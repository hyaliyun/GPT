Q: Q: Vertebrates evolved from primitive forms of which creature? A: A:","completion":"Vertebrates are thought to have evolved from a group of animals known as chordates. Chordates are characterized by having at some stage in their lives a notochord, a dorsal nerve cord, pharyngeal slits, endostyle, and a post-anal tail. Vertebrates are a subgroup that evolved within the chordates. To go further and pinpoint the exact type of early chordate from which vertebrates evolved from, it's widely believed that it's a type of creature known as \\"ancestral chordate,\\" which had all the five chordate features mentioned. Let's look closer at this evolution process. The very first vertebrates are believed to have evolved around 530 million years ago during a period known as the Cambrian explosion. This was a period of rapid evolutionary development when most of the major animal phyla first appeared. These early vertebrates were jawless, armless fish-like creatures, often collectively referred to as ostracoderms. They had a notochord (the precursor to the spinal cord), a basic vertebra-like structure for support, and rudimentary sensory organs. They were considered primitive, lacking many of the advanced features seen in later vertebrates. The evolution of a jaw, which first appeared in fish, was a significant evolutionary step for the vertebrates. The development of the jaw allowed for a wider variety of food sources and was likely a major factor in the successful diversity and survival of this group. Through millions of years, the descendants of these early jawed fish began to evolve a wide variety of characteristics and took on many forms. Some of these became the first amphibians, evolving lungs and legs and, for the first time, ventured onto land. From these amphibians, the reptiles evolved. They developed a new method of laying eggs, allowing them greater independence from water. It was from a lineage of reptiles that both mammals and birds evolved, with mammals appearing around 220 million years ago and birds a bit later, approximately 150 million years ago. Among mammal descendants are humans, evolved around 6 million years ago. In conclusion, vertebrates—encompassing a group whose members include fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals—evolved from primitive forms of chordates, specifically an ancestral chordate creature with primitive, fish-like characteristics. And it is through this lineage that we, as human beings, trace our own evolutionary history back hundreds of millions of years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They notice that the old rope swing is frayed in parts and very thin, while a new rope swing nearby is not frayed and much thicker. Which rope swing would be more likely to snap under the force of swinging? (A) old rope swing (B) new rope swing Choose the answer between \\"new rope swing\\" and \\"old rope swing\\". Answer:","completion":"The answer would be the \\"old rope swing\\". Allow me to explain why. As a material ages, it gets subjected to various conditions that can weaken its strength. For instance, a rope swing by a river would probably be exposed to harsh weather elements like sun, rain, snow, and humidity, all of which can cause the rope to degrade over time. This can significantly weaken the rope, thereby reducing its load-bearing capacity. This process of weakening is evident through the visual cue of fraying. When a rope frays, its threads unravel and separate from each other, reducing the overall mass of the rope that contributes to tensile strength. Remember, the tensile strength of a rope (its ability to withstand pulling forces) is greatly determined by the sum of the strength of its individual fibers. When a rope begins to fray, the total number of intact fibers is reduced, thereby reducing its tensile strength. However, a new rope, particularly one that is thicker, is less likely to snap under force. First, its relative newness implies it may not have gone through the same degree of weathering, reducing the probability of internal degradation. Secondly, thickness in rope usually equates to added strength. A thicker rope would have more fibers contributing to its overall strength and would therefore be more capable of withstanding force as compared to a thin rope. So in this case, given the visible signs of wear and tear (fraying and thinness) on the old rope swing, it would more likely be the one to snap under the force of swinging compared to the new, thicker rope swing. This is based on the logical understanding of how material strength degrades over time and under environmental stressors. So, once again, between the old rope and the new rope swing, the more likely to snap under force would be the \\"old rope swing\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available options: - yes; - it is not possible to tell; - no;","completion":"Based on the information given in the premise, we can analyze the details and determine the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. Premise: \\"Three women and one man is jumping into off a pile a sand with their over their heads.\\" This statement describes a scenario where there are a total of four individuals, out of which three are women, and one is a man. They are engaging in an activity where they are jumping off a pile of sand, and their hands are over their heads. Hypothesis: \\"There are both men and women in the photo.\\" The hypothesis focuses on establishing the presence of both men and women in a particular photo, presumably related to the premise. Now, let's look at the multi-select problem. Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true? To answer this, let's analyze the relationship between the premise and hypothesis. Since the premise states that there are three women and one man, we can assert that both men and women are present in the scenario. If we assume that the photo captures the scene described in the premise, it is reasonable to conclude that there would be both men and women present in the photo. Therefore, based on the information provided and assuming the photo captures the described event: Available options: - yes: This option affirms that if the premise is true and the photo represents that event, we can conclude that both men and women are in the photo, making the hypothesis true as well. - it is not possible to tell: This option is not accurate because the information given in the premise allows us to determine the presence of both men and women in the scenario, and if the photo captures the event, it would also contain both men and women. - no: This option is also not accurate because, as discussed earlier, the premise's information does support the hypothesis if we assume the photo represents the event. Based on this analysis, the best-suited option is \\"yes.\\" We can conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, assuming the photo captures the event described in the premise."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Mattie Ross (Hailee Steinfeld), the narrator and protagonist, explains that her father was murdered by Tom Chaney (Josh Brolin) when she was 14 years old. While collecting her father's body in Fort Smith, Arkansas, Mattie asks the local sheriff about the search for Chaney. He tells her that Chaney has fled with \\"Lucky\\" Ned Pepper and his gang into Indian Territory, where the sheriff has no authority, so she inquires about hiring a Deputy U.S. Marshal. The sheriff gives three recommendations, and Mattie chooses Rooster Cogburn. Cogburn initially rebuffs her offer, not believing she has the money to hire him. She raises the money by aggressively horse-trading with Colonel Stonehill. Texas Ranger LaBoeuf arrives in town after pursuing Chaney for the murder of a Texas State Senator. LaBoeuf proposes to team up with Cogburn, but Mattie refuses his offer. She wishes Chaney to be hanged in Arkansas for her father's murder, not in Texas for killing the senator. Mattie also insists on traveling with Cogburn but he leaves without her, having gone with LaBoeuf to apprehend Chaney and split the reward. After being refused passage on the ferry that conveyed Cogburn and LaBoeuf, Mattie crosses the river on horseback. LaBoeuf expresses his displeasure by birching Mattie with a stick, but Cogburn eventually allows Mattie to accompany them. After a dispute over their respective service with the Confederate States of America, Cogburn ends their arrangement and LaBoeuf leaves to pursue Chaney on his own. Cogburn and Mattie meet a trail doctor who directs them to an empty dugout for shelter. They find two outlaws, Quincy and Moon, and interrogate them.

(December 2009) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Andoheb, the aging High Priest of Arkam (Karnak in the previous films), has summoned Yousef Bey to the Temple of Arkam to pass on the duties of High Priest. Beforehand, Andoheb explains the legend of Kharis to Bey. Meanwhile, in Mapleton, Massachusetts, Professor Matthew Norman, who had examined one of Kharis' missing bandage pieces during the Mummy's last spree through Mapleton, also explains the legends of the Priests of Arkam and Kharis to his History class who are less than believing. After the lecture ends, one of the students, Tom Hervey, meets up with his girlfriend Amina Mansori, a beautiful woman of Egyptian descent. However, a strange, clouded feeling in her mind occurs when ever the subject of Egypt is mentioned. Back in Egypt, Andoheb informs Yousef Bey that Kharis still lives and that Yousefâs mission is to retrieve Kharis and the body of Ananka and return them to their rightful resting place in Egypt. Yousef Bey pledges his devotion before Andoheb explains that during each full moon, Yousef Bey is to brew the fluid from nine tana leaves. Kharis will sense this and find the leaves wherever they are. The moon is full in Mapleton as Professor Norman studies the hieroglyphics on a case of tana leaves. He has deciphered the message about brewing nine tana leaves during the full moon and decides to do just that. The battered, ragged form of Kharis the Mummy, however, senses the leaves brewing and heads toward them. On the way, he passes the home of Amina and she follows him in a trance-like state. Kharis soon arrives at the home of Professor Norman, strangles him, and drinks the fluid of the tana leaves. Amina sees Kharis, which snaps her out of her trance but also causes her to faint.

My review in one word - disappointing. How about two words? Very disappointing. We were so excited to try this place after strong yelp reviews and friends' recommendations so we saved our first visit for my birthday. 6:15 Saturday night reservations started off great. Seated right away, asked if we had theater plans so they could make sure they tended us in a timely manner. Seemed like a great beginning. That was when it went downhill. The two of us were seated along the wall where the \\" tables\\" for two are located. These tables are woefully small and completely inadequate for any dinner setting. And they are so close together!! They are essentially thigh width apart!! There should be a minimum state requirement of butt width for goodness sake! Even the skinny busboys couldn't wedge themselves in there. When your chair is wider than the table, you know it's bad. Makes for a very disruptive dining experience when your neighbor leaves. Plus, I think the fire marshall should have a look at this. Can't be safe. When I say close together, I mean the plates of the diners on either side of me were just as close to me as my wife's across the table! Everything was in arms reach. I wanted a table for two, not a party of six. I am not that interested in your life, trust me. Beer served in cans is not my style but I did one anyway. Arrived warm. Wanted to try the smoked wings we'd heard about so we started with those and the curry mussels. Both came out together and we literally had to stack them on top of each other on the table since it was so tiny. Ridiculous. The wings were the best thing all night - good, not great. I'm a huge mussels fan and was excited when they arrived looking fresh and delish. They were large but not delish. There was NO flavor. Bland with a capital B. No curry flavor at all - I think the steaming liquid would have tasted better. Did the spice cabinet turn out to be empty? Nice quantity though. Just not what I would have expected. Frankly I could have stopped eating here - and wish I had. We had placed our entire order at one time. I ordered the brisket sandwich and my wife the short rib flatbread. Between appetizers and entree was at least 50 minutes. At one point I was finally able to grab our server ( where DOES she does disappear to?) and told her, if it's not out now, just cancel the order. She had stopped by 25 minutes prior and said they'd be out in one minute. Wrong. Amazingly, mine came out but she dropped the flat bread in the kitchen. Service disaster. Let's just say 2 1/2 hours is way too long for what we had. One hour waits between courses? Absurd. Service was among the worst I've ever experienced. And the brisket? After 3 bites I put my utensils down. Not good at all. Another flavorless serving. Flatbread? Awful. Short rib my eye. If there was more than an ounce of short rib on there I'll buy your next meal. I feel bad giving it two stars but that was what my experience calls for. Oh, and the very limited draft beer menu? No Oktoberfest at all. Instead, a summer session ale? I mean, come on guys - this is October! There's no excuse for that. And at 7 and 10 each for our drafts, this is not a place I'd even want to drink.

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved.

The equation is simplified by combining the like terms. Both terms in the equation relate to 'o', so they can be combined. 9*o - 3*o equals 6*o. So now, the equation becomes 24 = 6*o . Step 2: Solve for the variable 'o'. In order to isolate 'o' and solve for it, divide both sides of the equation by 6 (that's the coefficient of 'o'). This gives you: 24/6 = 6*o/6.

Station in Kansas City to put song on heavy rotation on first night of series. Giants and Royals face off in Game 1 of World Series Tuesday night.","completion":"Title: San Francisco Radio Stations Ban No. 1 Hit \\"Royals\\" Prior to World Series, While Kansas City Embraces the Tune As the highly anticipated World Series kicks off, the rivalry between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals is not just limited to the field. In an amusing display of team spirit and competition, San Francisco radio stations have collectively decided to ban Lorde's chart-topping hit \\"Royals\\" from Bay Area airwaves for the duration of the series, while a station in Kansas City plans to put the song on heavy rotation during the first night of the showdown. The Giants and Royals are set to face off in Game 1 of the World Series this Tuesday night, and listeners in San Francisco will notice a significant absence in the radio playlist. Bay Area stations have come together in agreement to remove the Grammy-winning song by New Zealand artist Lorde from their schedules as a way to show unwavering support for their home team. The interesting fact behind the 2013 hit song is that Lorde was actually inspired by a photograph she saw of Kansas City Royals' then-retired baseball player George Brett in a magazine, signing autographs for fans. The image, which was accompanied by the word \\"Royals\\", became the central theme of the song that went on to become a No. 1 hit in multiple countries. Given the connection to the Kansas City team, it's not surprising that San Francisco stations have chosen to distance themselves from the track for the time being. On the other side of the competition, Kansas City is embracing the tune wholeheartedly. A local radio station in Missouri's largest city announced that they would be putting \\"Royals\\" on heavy rotation throughout the first night of the World Series. This move is seen as a clever counter-response to the Bay Area's elimination of the song, and as a way of celebrating one of Kansas City's many claims to fame. This humorous tit-for-tat between the radio stations adds an extra layer of rivalry to the already intense World Series atmosphere. Fans on both sides of the matchup are sure to appreciate the lengths their respective cities are going to demonstrate team loyalty and dedication. As the World Series progresses, all eyes will be on the Giants and Royals, with their respective cities – and radio stations – standing firmly behind them. While it's unclear whether the temporary ban of \\"Royals\\" will have any noticeable psychological impact on the participating teams, it's a lighthearted and entertaining manifestation of the competitive spirit that makes baseball, and sports in general, such a thrilling experience for fans and players alike. In summary, the World Series between the San Francisco Giants and Kansas City Royals brings not just fierce competition on the baseball field, but also an amusing battle between radio stations and fanbases. San Francisco's decision to ban Lorde's \\"Royals\\" from their airwaves shows a commitment to the home team, while Kansas City's equal and opposite reaction of putting the song on heavy rotation highlights the pride and joy of their city and baseball legacy. As the games unfold, this soundtrack switch-up leaves fans everywhere excited to see how their cities will continue to support their teams in creative and engaging ways."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions.

What is the answer: Which was the first Soviet Union republic to establish its independence when the Soviet Union was dissolving?","completion":"The first Soviet Union republic to establish its independence when the Soviet Union was dissolving was Lithuania. This historic event was a result of a long struggle for freedom and growing nationalistic sentiments within the Lithuanian population during the late 1980s and early 1990s. Lithuania's journey towards independence started with the inception of the reform movement called \\"Sąjūdis\\" (Lithuanian Reform Movement) in June 1988. This movement was initiated by a group of intellectuals, artists, and politicians who aimed to bring democratic reforms and autonomy to Lithuania. Sąjūdis gained significant support from the Lithuanian population and managed to elect many of its sympathetic representatives to the Congress of People's Deputies in the Soviet Union, which was a result of several popular demonstrations and actions in support of their cause. During the Soviet Union's weakening economic and political situation in the late 1980s, the Lithuanian independence movement gained momentum. Under the pressure of various regional movements and widespread protests, the Soviet Union adopted a policy of decentralization and allowed more autonomy for its republics. On March 11, 1990, Lithuania's Supreme Soviet, which was the highest state organ in the Lithuanian SSR, adopted the \\"Act of the Re-establishment of the State of Lithuania.\\" In this declaration, Lithuania claimed its independence from the Soviet Union and decided to restore the independent Lithuanian state that had existed between the First and Second World War, before being occupied by the Soviet Union in 1940. The immediate international reaction was cautious, and it took some time for other countries to recognize Lithuania's independence. The Soviet Union, led by President Mikhail Gorbachev, opposed the declaration and tried to prevent Lithuania's independence by applying political pressure and economic sanctions. This Soviet response resulted in several confrontations between Soviet military forces and the Lithuanian independence movement. The critical event that furthered Lithuania's recognition as an independent state occurred in January 1991. Soviet authorities ordered a military intervention in Lithuania to suppress the growing independence movement. However, this action generated strong resistance from the Lithuanian population and prompted widespread international condemnation. As a result, the Soviet Union's authority and reputation were further undermined. By the summer of 1991, the situation in the Soviet Union had significantly deteriorated. In August, an unsuccessful coup attempt in Moscow marked the beginning of the end for the Soviet Union. Following this event, the Soviet Union started recognizing the independence of its former republics. Lithuania's steadfastness paved the way for other Soviet republics to demand independence, and soon, many of them declared their sovereignty. Eventually, on December 26, 1991, the Soviet Union was officially dissolved, marking the end of an era and giving birth to several new independent states, including Lithuania, which had bravely led the way in the quest for freedom and self-determination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Four years later, a newly divorced woman, medical doctor Sarah Cassidy (Elisabeth Shue), and her 17-year-old daughter Elissa (Jennifer Lawrence) move to a small, upscale town. Their house is near the house where the massacred family lived. As told by the neighbors, four years prior, a girl named Carrie-Ann Jacobson killed her parents, then fled into the forest and was never seen again, leaving her brother Ryan (Max Thieriot) as the sole survivor. Ryan now lives alone and is hated by his neighbors; Bill Weaver (Gil Bellows), a local police officer, appears to be Ryan's only supporter. The mother-daughter relationship becomes rocky and Elissa starts dating Ryan against her mother's wishes, finding Ryan to be lonely but a sweet boy. Ryan confides in her that he accidentally injured Carrie-Ann by allowing her to fall from a swing when they were little; he was supposed to be watching her while their parents were getting high on drugs. The resulting brain damage from the accident made her extremely aggressive, leading to their parents' murder. Ryan is revealed to have been secretly taking care of a seemingly now-grown Carrie-Ann (Eva Link) in a hidden room. When she, Ann, escapes, Ryan accidentally kills her while trying to hide her. In grief, he goes to the diner, where he meets a kind waitress named Peggy (Jordan Hayes). Later, some unruly high school boys pick a fight with Ryan and he flees, and Elissa drives to his house and subdues a fire the boys started.

Information: - In biology, a species (abbreviated sp., with the plural form species abbreviated spp.) is the basic unit of biological classification and a taxonomic rank. A species is often defined as the largest group of organisms in which two individuals can produce fertile offspring, typically by sexual reproduction. While this definition is often adequate, looked at more closely it is often problematic. For example, in a species complex, the boundaries between closely related species become unclear or disappear altogether. Other ways of defining species include similarity of DNA, morphology, or ecological niche. The presence of locally adaptive traits may further subdivide species into infraspecific taxa such as subspecies. - Flaviviridae is a family of viruses. Humans and other mammals serve as natural hosts. They are primarily spread through arthropod vectors (mainly ticks and mosquitoes). The family gets its name from the Yellow Fever virus, the type virus of \\"Flaviviridae\\"; \\"flavus\\" means yellow in Latin, and Yellow fever in turn was named because of its propensity to cause jaundice in victims. There are currently over 100 species in this family, divided among four genera. Diseases associated with this family include: hepaciviruses, hepatitis, pestiviruses, hemorrhagic syndromes, fatal mucosal disease, flavivirus, hemorrhagic fever, encephalitis, and the birth defect microcephaly. - Pestivirus is a genus of viruses, in the family Flaviviridae. Viruses in the genus \\"Pestivirus\\" infect mammals, including members of the family Bovidae (which includes, but is not limited to, cattle, sheep, and goats) and the family Suidae (which includes various species of swine). There are currently four species in this genus including the type species Bovine viral diarrhea virus 1. Diseases associated with this genus include: hemorrhagic syndromes, abortion, fatal mucosal disease. - Suidae is a family of artiodactyl mammals commonly called pigs, hogs, or boars. In addition to numerous fossil species, up to sixteen extant species are currently recognized, classified into between four and eight genera. The family includes the domestic pig, \\"Sus scrofa domesticus\\" or \\"Sus domesticus\\", in addition to numerous species of wild pig, such as the babirusa \\"Babyrousa babyrussa\\" and the warthog \\"Phacochoerus aethiopicus\\". All suids, or swine, are native to the Old World, ranging from Asia to Europe and Africa. - Yellow fever is an acute viral disease. In most cases, symptoms include fever, chills, loss of appetite, nausea, muscle pains particularly in the back, and headaches. Symptoms typically improve within five days. In some people within a day of improving, the fever comes back, abdominal pain occurs, and liver damage begins causing yellow skin. If this occurs, the risk of bleeding and kidney problems is also increased. The disease is caused by the yellow fever virus and is spread by the bite of an infected female mosquito. It infects only humans, other primates, and several species of mosquitoes. In cities, it is spread primarily by mosquitoes of the \\"Aedes aegypti\\" type. The virus is an RNA virus of the genus \\"Flavivirus\\". The disease may be difficult to tell apart from other illnesses, especially in the early stages. To confirm a suspected case, blood sample testing with polymerase chain reaction is required. A safe and effective vaccine against yellow fever exists and some countries require vaccinations for travelers. Other efforts to prevent infection include reducing the population of the transmitting mosquito. In areas where yellow fever is common and vaccination is uncommon, early diagnosis of cases and immunization of large parts of the population is important to prevent outbreaks. Once infected, management is symptomatic with no specific measures effective against the virus. The second and more severe phase results in death in up to half of people without treatment. Yellow fever causes 200,000 infections and 30,000 deaths every year, with nearly 90% of these occurring in Africa. Nearly a billion people live in an area of the world where the disease is common. It is common in tropical areas of South America and Africa, but not in Asia. Since the 1980s, the number of cases of yellow fever has been increasing. This is believed to be due to fewer people being immune, more people living in cities, people moving frequently, and changing climate. The disease originated in Africa, from where it spread to South... - The Bovidae are the biological family of cloven-hoofed, ruminant mammals that includes bison, African buffalo, water buffalo, antelopes, gazelles, sheep, goats, muskoxen, and domestic cattle. A member of this family is called a bovid. Consisting of 143 extant species and 300 known extinct species, the family Bovidae consists of eight major subfamilies apart from the disputed Peleinae and Pantholopinae. The family evolved 20 million years ago, in the early Miocene. - Bovine Viral Diarrhea ( BVD ) or Bovine Viral Diarrhoea ( UK English ) , and previously referred to as Bovine Virus Diarrhoea ( BVD ) , is a significant economic disease of cattle which is endemic in the majority of countries throughout the world . The causative agent , bovine viral diarrhea virus ( BVDV ) is a member of the Pestivirus genus of the family Flaviviridae . BVD infection results in a wide variety of clinical signs , due to its immunosuppressive effects , as well as having a direct effect on respiratory disease and fertility . In addition , BVD infection of a susceptible dam during a certain period of gestation can result in the production of a persistently infected ( PI ) fetus .

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"FAA communication\\" correctly answer the question \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11\\"? *no. *yes.","completion":"Yes, based on the paragraph, the response \\"FAA communication\\" correctly answers the question, \\"What was overstated in regards to the perceived inadequacy in military response to 9/11?\\" The paragraph describes that inaccurate accounts made by government officials led to the assumption that the military was notified timely on two of the hijackings, which then resulted in questions about the adequacy of their response. These accounts, in reality, overstated the FAA's capacity to provide timely and accurate information to the military on that morning.

Randi was born on August 7, 1928 in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, the son of Marie Alice (nee Paradis) and George Randall Zwinge. He has a younger brother and sister. He took up magic after seeing Harry Blackstone Sr. and reading conjuring books while spending 13 months in a body cast following a bicycle accident. He confounded doctors who expected he would never walk again. Randi is the author of ten books, among them Conjuring (1992), a biographical history of noted magicians. The book is subtitled Being a Definitive History of the Venerable Arts of Sorcery, Prestidigitation, Wizardry, Deception, & Chicanery and of the Mountebanks & Scoundrels Who have Perpetrated these Subterfuges on a Bewildered Public, in short, MAGIC! The book's cover says that it is by \\"James Randi, Esq., A Contrite Rascal Once Dedicated to these Wicked Practices but Now Almost Totally Reformed\\". The book selects the most influential magicians and tells some of their history, often in the context of strange deaths and careers on the road. This work expanded on Randi's second book titled Houdini, His Life and Art. This illustrated work was published in 1976 and was co-authored with Bert Sugar. It focuses on the professional and private life of Houdini. Randi also wrote a children's book in 1989 titled The Magic World of the Amazing Randi, which introduced children to magic tricks. In addition to his magic books, he has written several educational works about paranormal and pseudoscientific claims. These include biographies of Uri Geller and Nostradamus as well as reference material on other major paranormal figures. He is currently working on A Magician in the Laboratory, which recounts his application of skepticism to science.

Yes A detailed explanation for the choice would be: Upon reviewing the provided statement, \\"A black and white bird standing on a hand,\\" several context clues help us arrive at the conclusion that yes, a bird is stationary. First, let's break down the initial statement: - \\"A black and white bird\\": This portion of the statement describes the bird's physical appearance but does not offer any information about its movement or lack thereof. - \\"standing on a hand\\": This part of the statement is crucial in determining the bird's status, specifically its movement. \\"Standing\\" is a verb that implies stillness and stability, indicating the bird is not currently in motion. Based on the statement alone, we can logically infer that the bird being \\"stationary\\" is true. However, it is essential to acknowledge that this conclusion is based solely on the given information, and circumstances surrounding the situation may change our analysis. While the bird is standing on a hand at that moment, it could potentially fly off or move in the near future.

Q:Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: A cocky American athlete named Lee Sheridan (Robert Taylor) receives a scholarship to attend Cardinal College, Oxford University in 1937. At first, Lee is reluctant to go to the college owing to his father Dan's (Lionel Barrymore) limited income, but he finally does attend. Once in England, Lee brags about his athletic triumphs to Paul Beaumont (Griffith Jones), Wavertree (Robert Coote), and Ramsey (Peter Croft) on the train to Oxford. Annoyed, they trick Lee into getting off the train at the wrong stop. Lee, however, does make his way to Oxford where the students attempt to trick him again, this time into thinking that he is getting a grand reception. Seeing through the deception, he follows the prankster impersonating the Dean and after chasing him is thrown off and ends up kicking the real Dean of Cardinal (Edmund Gwenn) before retreating. This begins a contentious relationship between them when Lee reports to apologize. Lee considers leaving Oxford but stays on after being convinced by Scatters (Edward Rigby), his personal servant. Lee meets Elsa Craddock (Vivien Leigh), a married woman who \\"helps\\" the new campus students, and starts a relationship with Paul Beaumont's sister Molly (Maureen O'Sullivan). Lee makes the track team by outpacing other runners while wearing a cap and gown. Just when he begins to fit in, he is hazed for refusing to rest during a crucial relay race at a track meet and pushing his replacement Paul out of the way in his zeal to win. In a fit of anger, Lee goes to a pub, which students are forbidden to frequent, to confront Paul, finding him in a private booth with Elsa. He starts a fight with Paul but Wavertree warns them of the Bullers coming. Lee and Paul run and when they are almost caught by one of the Bullers, Lee punches him. Paul is called before the Dean, fined and warned for hitting the Buller. He is scorned for saying it was Lee who punched him and Lee is soon the favorite of Paul's old friends. Molly begins to see him again, but Lee still feels poor for what has happened...

Second question: Why do some people currently believe the earth is flat? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: Why do some people think that the Earth is flat when it is clear that it is not? The belief in a flat Earth can be attributed to various factors, despite overwhelming scientific evidence pointing to the contrary. Here are some reasons why certain individuals continue to maintain this belief: 1. Misinterpretation of scientific data: Some flat-Earthers misinterpret or misunderstand scientific data and observations to fit their worldview. This could stem from a lack of scientific education or a deliberate attempt to discredit mainstream scientific consensus. 2. Distrust of authorities and institutions: Some people may doubt the Earth's true shape because of a deep mistrust of governmental and scientific institutions. This skepticism can lead them to disregard widely-accepted facts and instead cling to alternative theories like the flat Earth notion. 3. Confirmation bias: People tend to have a strong desire to confirm their existing beliefs, leading them to seek out and interpret new information in a way that aligns with their preconceptions. This psychological phenomenon can cloud people's judgment and allow them to readily accept questionable evidence that supports their views. 4. Sensation and attention-seeking: Individuals may adopt the flat Earth belief as a means of provoking reactions from others and attracting attention. This motivation can stem either from the desire to feel unique and special or the thrill of engaging in controversial debates. 5. Internet and social media echo chambers: The internet fosters a self-reinforcing environment in which people can easily find like-minded individuals and content that reaffirms their beliefs. Social media algorithms also contribute to this effect, as they often suggest content similar to what a user has previously viewed or engaged with, leading to further polarization of opinions. 6. Desire for simplicity: Believing in a simplified model of reality, like a flat Earth, can appeal to those who want to ignore the complexities and uncertainties of the scientific world. For some, this simplified worldview may be comforting. Second question: Why do some people currently believe the earth is flat? There is significant overlap in the factors that contribute to the current trend of flat Earth beliefs. Some of the main reasons include: 1. Influence of the internet: The internet has allowed once-fringe beliefs, like the flat Earth theory, to reach wider audiences. Online platforms provide a means for spreading this information, and the anonymity of the internet enables people to express and share controversial ideas without much accountability. 2. Conspiracy theories and distrust: The proliferation of conspiracy theories has led to an environment where distrust of authority is increasingly common. As a result, the flat Earth belief, which is often associated with broader conspiracy theories, has gained traction as well. 3. Social and community aspects: People who believe in a flat Earth often find comfort and validation in connecting with like-minded individuals through online forums and social media groups. The strong sense of community that develops may encourage individuals to further embrace this belief. 4. Psychological factors: Certain psychological tendencies, such as confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance, may play a role in driving the belief in a flat Earth. These mental processes can cause people to interpret evidence in a way that confirms their existing beliefs and reject information that conflicts with their views. In conclusion, while these two questions appear to ask the same thing, they differ in that the first question focuses on the reasons people have historically believed in the flat Earth theory, while the second question highlights the factors that contribute to its continued prevalence in modern times. Though there is significant overlap between the reasons, the primary distinction is that the second question emphasizes the role of the internet and current sociopolitical climate, which has contributed to the resurgence of flat Earth beliefs."},{"prompt":"The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food.

Managers shouldn’t learn to speak tech, but they should drop the biz-buzzwords. A manager can say “We need to proactively impact our time-to-market” or simply use plain English and stick to “We gotta be on time with this project”. The latter makes total sense to everyone involved. When managers don’t know much about a technical question, they should simply admit it. Geeks respect them for that, but not for pretending to know. And they will catch it––geeks are smart––that's why you employed them after all! Even if you do know, don't lord this knowledge over everyone. Most geeks will be thinking the answer as quickly as you, there's no need to discuss the minutiae. The best thing you can do is to make it known that you are always available to answer questions or to clarify whatever you've just said. They'll take it from there and respect you all the more for it.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of clear and honest communication between managers and their technical teams. It highlights how using management jargon or buzzwords can alienate experts in technology-related fields, who may view such language as superficial or insincere. Rather than trying to learn technical terms or pretending to know the ins and outs of a specific field, the article suggests that managers should focus on using plain English to convey their ideas and requirements. When managers are faced with technical questions that they may not have the expertise to answer, the article recommends admitting this lack of knowledge instead of attempting to bluff their way through. Tech experts value honesty and transparency, and will respect a manager who is open about their limitations. Pretending to know more than one does is likely to backfire, as technical professionals are often quick to detect any inconsistencies or inaccuracies in someone's claims. Instead of trying to prove themselves as knowledgeable in their team's field of expertise, managers should make it clear that they are always available for clarification or to provide support when needed. This approach fosters a positive working relationship built on trust and mutual respect, ultimately contributing to a more productive and harmonious work environment. In summary, managers should avoid management-speak and focus on honest and clear communication with their technical staff to build a strong and respectful working relationship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _ Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases.

After his return he was not taken particularly seriously, and was hard put to get audiences for his new works, hence his \\"prophet without honour\\" remark after the nearly empty hall and indifferent reception of Richard III and Wallenstein's Camp at Žofín Island in January 1862.Smetana's first noteworthy public success was his initial opera The Brandenburgers in Bohemia, in 1866 when he was already 42 years old. His second opera, The Bartered Bride, survived the unfortunate mistiming of its opening night and became an enduring popular triumph. The different style of his third opera, Dalibor, closer to that of Wagnerian music drama, was not readily understood by the public and was condemned by critics who believed that Czech opera should be based on folk-song. It disappeared from the repertory after only a handful of performances. Thereafter the machinations that accompanied Smetana's tenure as Provisional Theatre conductor restricted his creative output until 1874. In his final decade, the most fruitful of his compositional career despite his deafness and increasing ill-health, Smetana belatedly received national recognition. Of his later operas, The Two Widows and The Secret were warmly received, while The Kiss was greeted by an \\"overwhelming ovation\\". The ceremonial opera Libuše was received with thunderous applause for the composer; by this time (1881) the disputes around his music had declined, and the public was ready to honour him as the founder of Czech music. Nevertheless, the first few performances in October 1882 of an evidently under-rehearsed The Devil's Wall were chaotic, and the composer was left feeling \\"dishonoured and dispirited.\\" This disappointment was swiftly mitigated by the acclaim...

Math Problem Solve -4*w + 346 = -169*w - 47*w + 39*w for w.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step for you. We have the equation: -4*w + 346 = -169*w - 47*w + 39*w First, let's combine all the w terms on the right side of the equation. We have -169w, -47w, and 39w. When we add them together, we get: -169w - 47w + 39w = -177w Now our equation looks like this: -4w + 346 = -177w Next, let's move all the terms with w to one side of the equation and other terms to the other side. We can add 177w to both sides to move the w terms to the left side: -4w + 177w + 346 = -177w + 177w When we add up the w terms on the left, it looks like this: 173w + 346 = 0 Now, we will move the constant term (346) to the right side of the equation by subtracting 346 from both sides: 173w = -346 Finally, we have to find the value of w itself. To do that, we will divide both sides by 173: w = -346 / 173 When we do that division, we find out that w = -2. So, the answer is w = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The family across the street has a cat. He is a cute black kitty named Dillon. The cat is about two years old, and the family has had him for about a year. He is an indoor cat who is not allowed to go outside. The children like to play with Dillon because he still acts like a kitten. Dillon jumps around, and chases flies, beetles and spiders. When he plays with the children, he sometimes uses his paws to attack them, but he doesn't try to hurt them with his claws. Dillon is a great cat but he has one problem: he likes to eat bread. The family only feeds him cat food, never human food like steak or potatoes. But the cat likes the smell of bread so much that he tries to find it everywhere he can. Dillon jumps up on the kitchen table when a sandwich is there, and tries to carry it away. He finds loaves of bread from the store on the floor and claws through the wrappers. The cat climbs into the bread cupboard looking for hot dog and hamburger buns. The family tries to make Dillon stop getting into the bread by spraying him with water when he goes after bread. They yell at him when he walks on the table. But Dillon does not listen. The kitty keeps trying to find bread to eat. The family thinks that the man who took care of Dillon when he was a very young kitten must have been a baker or cook, and that's why Dillon likes the smell and taste of bread so much!

An Idaho man man used a shotgun to kill his longtime girlfriend and one of her five children before using the same weapon to kill himself, a preliminary investigation shows. Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs says autopsy reports have not been finalized from the Nov. 15 deaths but the early investigation has found only the single weapon. Police say 36-year-old George Salinas likely killed 38-year-old LeAnn Schuldies and her 17-year-old daughter, Brianna Cox, before ending his life. Their bodies were found in a Twin Falls County home. Four other children, ages 6, 7, 9 and 13 survived. They're believed to be Salinas' children with Schuldies. Victims: LeAnn Schuldies (left) died alongside her 17-year-old Brianna Cox in Idaho. Police believe they were shot by Schuldies' longtime boyfriend George Salinas, who then killed himself. Schuldies was a well-liked bartender in Twin Falls. She had an order of protection against Salinas and was trying to end her relationship with him when she and her daughter were killed. Schuldies' four surviving children are staying with family. Salinas was not Cox's father. County court records show that on Nov. 5, Schuldies obtained a two-week 'no-contact' order against Salinas for herself and her children. On Nov. 12, she got a second order against him that extended past a court hearing planned for Friday. 'She was trying to get out of that relationship and move on with her life with her kids,' said her co-worker and friend Hannah Zamora, a manager at restaurant and bar Elevation 486. Schuldies leaves behind four surviving children ages 6, 7, 9 and 13. Police say George Salinas shot Schuldies and one of her five children before killing himself. 'Obviously, it was just paper to him. It wasn't anything that stopped him. It didn't seem like she had the help that she needed.' Zamora said she knew Schuldies for six years and, six months ago, helped her land a job at Elevation 486, where she worked as a bartender and where at least one other company tried to hire her away. 'Everybody loved her,' Zamora said. 'She was very warmhearted. She never showed what was going on in her life. She was always happy and smiling, always thinking of others.' But Zamora said Schuldies did share some of her problems — including her plans to end her relationship with Salinas — with a select few. 'She was tired of everything,' Zamora said. 'So she stood up for herself and her kids.' Elevation 486 closed for the day Saturday after workers learned of Schuldies' death. Employees since have created a link on the restaurant's Facebook page for those wishing to make a donation for Schuldies' surviving children. The restaurant overlooks the Snake River Canyon, a view Schuldies enjoyed, even during a snowstorm. 'On Friday I remember her saying, \\"Hannah, turn around and look at the snowflakes,\\"' Zamora said. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine all the terms with p in them: (189 + 119 + 73 - 108)p = 0 This simplifies to: 273*p = 0 Step 2: Solve for p Now, we'll solve the equation 273*p = 0 for p. Since there's only one term on the left and 0 on the right, we can quickly see that in order for the equation to be true, p has to be equal to 0. If p were a nonzero value, then 273*p would be a nonzero value as well, which won't equal 0. The only way for the left side of the equation to equal 0 is if p itself is 0.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. By. Daily Mail Reporter. BT Sport has sent shockwaves through the football world by outbidding Sky and ITV to secure exclusive rights to broadcast top European matches. The telecommunications giant has agreed a stunning £299million a season, three-year deal to show all 350 Champions League and Europa League games from 2015/16. It represents a staggering coup for the fledgling channel - which only launched in August this year - to have beaten off Sky, which has dominated the live football landscape in Britain for more two decades, while ITV has broadcast the Champions League since 1992. Mega deal: BT Sport has blown its rivals out of the water with a staggering £900m deal to show Champions League football. End of an era: ITV - originally with Bob Wilson anchoring the show - have shown the Champions League live since its creation in 1992. It means that, for the first time, fans will have to pay to watch European matches, which have always been shown on terrestrial television. Although BT Sport says it will make a handful of matches available for free, including the finals of both competitions, supporters will have to buy BT broadband or pay a subscription to watch through their Sky box. Making some matches free will appeal to sponsors, which was ITV's main trumpcard in its relationship with Europe's football governing body, Uefa. Gavin Patterson, BT chief executive, said: 'I am thrilled that BT Sport will be the only place where fans can enjoy all the live action from the Uefa Champions League and Uefa Europa League. 'Both tournaments are world class and firm favourites with many. The live rights will give a major boost to BT Sport and give people yet another reason to take our terrific service.' Overpriced: TV rivals Sky said the company has overpaid for the rights. The BT channels are also showing live FA Cup games and live football from the top leagues in Germany, Italy, France and Scotland plus the FA Women's Super League. Away from football, there will also be rugby union and women's tennis, plus MotoGP coverage from next year. Mr Patterson added: 'BT Sport has got off to a strong start with customers enjoying what we have to offer. We have attracted millions of customers by giving sport back to the fans, and we can assure people who want to catch all the action, that European football will be far more accessible and affordable with BT.' Sky, which is thought to have nearly matched BT's bid, said its rival had paid 'far in excess' of its own valuation for the rights to the European matches. A statement from Sky read: 'We bid with a clear view of what the rights are worth to us. It seems BT chose to pay far in excess of our valuation. 'There are many ways in which we can invest in our service for customers. We take a disciplined approach and there is always a level at which we will choose to focus on something else. If we thought it was worth more, we'd have paid more. 'Nothing changes until 2015 and we look forward to 18 more months of live Champions League on Sky Sports. We will now re-deploy resources and continue to bring customers the best choice of TV across our offering.' What are highlight points for this article?","completion":"The article highlights BT Sport's acquisition of exclusive rights to broadcast top European football matches, outbidding rivals Sky and ITV.

The deal marks the end of Sky's dominance over live football broadcasts in Britain and ITV's long-standing tradition of broadcasting Champions League matches since 1992.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? Should I leave fallen fruits on the ground as these help add organic beneficial materials to the soil?","completion":"To determine whether you should leave fallen fruits on the ground to help add organic beneficial materials to the soil, consider the following steps: Step 1: Assess the fallen fruits First, look at the types of fruits that have fallen and their condition. Are they rotten or fresh? The decomposition of fallen fruits contributes to the organic matter in the soil, which can indeed be beneficial. Step 2: Consider the potential downsides Leaving fallen fruits on the ground can sometimes attract pests, rodents, and unwanted insects. If you're trying to maintain a clean and pest-free garden, leaving fallen fruits on the ground might not be the best choice. Step 3: Check for potential diseases If the fallen fruits are from a diseased tree or plant, you should remove them from the ground to prevent the spread of disease to other plants. In this case, leaving the fallen fruits would not be beneficial to the soil. Step 4: Evaluate the soil needs Consider the current condition of your soil. If your soil is lacking organic matter or nutrients, leaving the fallen fruits might be a good idea. Check the soil's texture, structure, and nutrient content to make an informed decision. Step 5: Consider composting If you're concerned about pests or diseases but still want the benefits of organic matter, consider composting the fallen fruits. This process can help break down the fruits, allowing you to use the nutrient-rich compost as an amendment to improve your soil. Step 6: Make a decision Taking all the steps above into account, determine whether it's best to leave the fallen fruits on the ground or to remove and compost them. The goal is to promote healthy soil while minimizing any risks associated with leaving fallen fruits on the ground. Step 7: Monitor the results After deciding on the best approach, observe the effects on your soil and plants. This will help you determine if leaving the fallen fruits on the ground is indeed beneficial or if adjustments need to be made in the future."},{"prompt":"Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What is the name of the debut single released by the music group that created the album Three?","completion":"To accurately answer this question, more specific information is needed about the music group in question, as there are multiple groups with an album titled \\"Three.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You have some choice when it comes to tomatoes, especially between determinate (bush) and indeterminate (vining) varieties. Both will have advantages for indoor gardens, so think about which kind is best for your purposes. Hypothesis: The type of tomato grown indoors should be based on your situation.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the hypothesis that the type of tomato grown indoors should be based on an individual's situation from the given context. The context suggests that there are various factors to consider when choosing a suitable tomato variety to grow indoors. Below is a detailed overview of the hypothesis and the considerations that support it: Growing tomatoes indoors can be an enjoyable and rewarding experience if the right choices are made during the planning process. Each person has unique circumstances and preferences that can impact their decision-making, including their space, time, requirements, and expectations from their indoor garden. 1. Space limitations: One significant factor to consider when choosing a type of tomato plant to grow indoors is the amount of space available. Determinate (bush) tomato plants are more compact and can be ideal for small spaces or container gardening. These plants are generally shorter and have a well-defined growth period, producing all their fruits around the same time. Indeterminate (vining) tomato plants, on the other hand, can grow quite large and require more space and support structures. They produce fruits over an extended period and can be a good option for those with ample room for a larger indoor garden. 2. Time investment: The time and effort that an individual can invest in their indoor garden should also be considered. Indeterminate tomato plants need more pruning, training, and support as they grow taller and produce fruits over a longer period. Determinate tomato plants, with their set growth period and smaller size, require less maintenance and time investment. 3. Purpose of growing tomatoes: Each person's purpose of growing tomatoes indoors can also dictate their choice of plant variety. If they primarily want tomatoes for cooking or require a large harvest at once, determinate tomato plants would be a better choice. However, if they want a steady supply of fresh tomatoes to snack on or add to salads over several months, indeterminate tomato plants might be more suitable. 4. Personal preferences: It's essential to consider personal preferences when selecting a tomato variety. Different tomato varieties have distinct flavors, sizes, and appearances that can be better suited to different culinary pursuits or aesthetic preferences. In conclusion, the hypothesis that the type of tomato grown indoors should be based on an individual's situation is supported by the context. Considering various factors such as space availability, time investment, purpose, and personal preferences can help individuals make an informed decision when choosing a suitable tomato variety for their indoor garden. This can lead to a more successful and enjoyable indoor gardening experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

A warm up gradually increases your heart rate, body temperature, and blood flow. Warming up your body before exercise can help to prevent injury and reduce soreness from a workout. A warm up should be a light version of your planned exercise. Warm ups should last for around ten minutes. You shouldn't feel exhausted or overly tired from your warm up. For example, before going for a fast walk, warm up by walking slowly for around ten minutes. It's important to gradually cool your body down after a workout. Cooling down can help your heart rate return to a normal resting rate and may help prevent injury or soreness after the workout. A cool down requires you to gradually reduce the intensity of your chosen exercise or activity. Try to cool down for around ten minutes. You may want to include stretching in your cool-down. For example, if you went for a walk, reduce your pace for around ten minutes. Include stretching in your warm-ups and cool-downs to help your muscles stay flexible and maintain their full range of motion. Stretches should be held for around thirty seconds each before repeating the stretch on the opposite side of the body. Try including some of the following stretches in your workouts: Keep your shoulders flexible by bringing your arm across your body and holding it in place with your opposite hand. Push slightly with your opposing hand and feel the stretch across your shoulder. Stretch your hamstrings by first laying down on your back. Put one of your legs up and rest your foot against the outer corner of a wall. Slowly straighten your leg and hold for thirty seconds. Repeat the same motion with your other leg. To stretch your quadriceps, grab your ankle while standing and pull it up and back. You will feel the stretch in the front of your leg.

Information: - Silverchair were an Australian rock band, which formed in 1992 as Innocent Criminals in Merewether, Newcastle with the line-up of Ben Gillies on drums, Daniel Johns on vocals and guitars, and Chris Joannou on bass guitar. The group got their big break in mid-1994 when they won a national demo competition conducted by SBS TV show \\"Nomad\\" and ABC radio station, Triple J. The band were signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Neon Ballroom is the third studio album by Australian alternative rock band Silverchair, released in 1999 by record labels Murmur and Epic. - Christopher John Joannou (born 10 November 1979) is an Australian musician, best known as the bassist for the Newcastle-based alternative rock band Silverchair.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

Considering the premise, it's evident that the Ibicencos chose to adapt the name given by the Romans to a version that likely suited their language preferences or cultural nuances. The adaptation of the name from Portus Magnus to Portmany demonstrates that the Ibicencos acknowledged the Roman influence but also wished to establish their own identity related to this location. The name change might also be attributed to linguistic changes over time as the old Latin transitioned to various Romance and Iberian languages. The hypothesis, on the other hand, assumes that the Ibicencos did not name the location, which is entirely based on an unfounded supposition. Given the premise, it's evident that the inhabitants of Ibiza (known as Ibicencos) found it relevant to give this location a name despite already having a Roman denomination. This action demonstrates the importance that the great port held for the Ibicencos and their connection to the site. In conclusion, if we trust the premise \\"The Romans called it Portus Magnus (great port), which the Ibicencos adapted to Portmany,\\" it directly contradicts the hypothesis \\"It was named \\"Portus Magnus\\" by the Romans, but the Ibicencos never bothered to give it a name.\\" The Ibicencos indeed gave it a name by adapting the Roman title into their version, Portmany, which sheds light on their acknowledgement of the Roman influence and their wish to create a localized identity for the great port."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alex Answer:","completion":"Title: Eyes of Alex Genre: Action/Thriller Plot Summary: A skilled team of thieves plan for their biggest heist yet - stealing a rare and extremely valuable artifact from a high-security museum. As they meticulously construct their master plan, the team starts to suspect that someone has been watching them. The mysterious figure, Alex, seems to know their every move and sends a chilling message, warning them of impending doom if they proceed with the robbery. Act I: The film opens with the group of thieves - led by fearless Ryan and his loyal crew of professionals, including tech genius Lila, acrobatics and burglary expert Mark, and the empathetic but muscle-strong Marlon - successfully pulling off a smaller heist to showcase their exceptional skills. It is then that we are taken into the planning process of their next big heist, which involves careful reconnaissance and brainstorming sessions. The target: a high-security museum holding a 15th-century artifact worth millions. The group splits up to familiarize themselves with the timetable of the guards, the inner workings of the security system, and possible escape routes. As they advance their preparation, Lila comes across mysterious CCTV footage of a shadowy figure following Mark on his recon mission. They quickly realize that they are being watched by someone named Alex, as they receive a cryptic message from him, warning them to stop their plans. Act II: Unwilling to back down from their most ambitious heist, the team decides to use Alex's surveillance as an opportunity to feed false information, hoping to throw Alex off their trail. Ryan, unable to shake the feeling that he knows Alex from somewhere, dives deep into his past, retracing old scores and the relationships he's built and shattered throughout his criminal career. As the big day draws near, the group finalizes their highly intricate plan and implements multiple contingencies. However, the stakes rise when the museum announces that a massive gala event will coincide with the planned night of their heist. The group is now faced with a heightened level of security, the ticking clock and the ever-looming presence of Alex, who seems to be getting closer to their inner circle. Act III: On the night of the heist, the team executes their plan with astounding precision, avoiding detection inside the museum while simultaneously dealing with the busy gala event. But as they approach the artifact, they discover that Alex has outsmarted them by leaving a life-size replica in the display - he's already stolen the original himself. A tense chase unfolds, and the group discovers that Alex is no ordinary observer. He is in fact a former member of Ryan's old crew, who was presumed dead years ago in a heist gone wrong. Alex, harboring feelings of betrayal and vengeance against Ryan and seeking redemption in the criminal world, aims to thwart the group's plans at every turn and claim the treasure for himself. As Alex's true motives are revealed, the group must face the darkness of their past to overcome the formidable foe they have made in Alex, all while evading the law enforcement that's quickly closing in on them. Conclusion: The climax of the film features a classic standoff between Ryan and Alex in the museum, mastermind versus mastermind. As the two face off, a moment of vulnerability allows Ryan to reach out to Alex, evoking sympathy for the experiences they once shared. In a twist of fate, Alex sacrifices himself to ensure the group's escape, redeeming himself in the process. In the end, Ryan and his crew manage to pull off the heist of a lifetime, while forever carrying with them the memory of Alex's contribution. The film concludes on an introspective, bittersweet note as the thieves ponder the price they've paid for the ultimate thrill of their criminal lives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

What is the solution?","completion":"Alright, let's solve it for z like we are explaining to a five-year-old. Imagine we have 24 blueberries and 3 blueberries, and we add them together, we get: 24 blueberries + 3 blueberries = 27 blueberries Now, think of z as magic balloons. We have 27 z, which means we have 27 times those magic balloons. So, our math problem becomes 0 = 27*z + 108. Now, let's play a game and pretend that we have already gotten those 108 candies. To make it fair, we need to remove these candies from both sides. So, if we remove (subtract) 108 candies from both sides, we will have: -108 = 27*z Now, we need to find out how many magic balloons we have (z). To know this, we will share the candies we have evenly among all the magic balloons. So, we will divide the number of candies we have (-108) by the number of magic balloons (27): -108 ÷ 27 = -4 This means we have 4 magic balloons, but since we used 'magic' in our game, it's -4 magic balloons.

[-] No. Answer:","completion":"No. While it is true that excessive sweating can cause dehydration in animals, it is important to distinguish between dehydration and infection. Dehydration is a result of an insufficient amount of water in the body, whereas infection typically occurs due to the invasion of microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, or fungi. Sweating is a natural cooling mechanism for many animals, and while it may lead to dehydration if the animal does not consume enough fluids, it does not inherently cause infection. However, an animal with a compromised immune system or open wounds may risk infection through other means (e.g., poor hygiene, contaminated environments, or contact with other infected animals), which may or may not be related to sweating. In summary, while dehydration can be a consequence of an animal sweating, it does not directly lead to infection.

Under the Abortion Act of 1967, abortions are legal and can be performed at or before 24 weeks of pregnancy in England, Wales, and Scotland. The laws in Northern Ireland are different than the rest of the U.K. Abortions after 24 weeks are only permitted when the pregnancy poses a substantial risk to the mother or if there is significant evidence of fatal fetal abnormalities. Two doctors must agree that it is in the patient’s best interest to terminate the pregnancy. This usually includes your general practitioner and the doctor performing the procedure. The U.K.’s National Health Service (NHS) provides free medical care to citizens of England, Scotland, and Wales. Abortions are free at NHS clinics and hospitals.

Summarize the following: Before you start to clean, you should take a look at the hamster's cage to see what state it is in. Look for anything that needs cleaning at least once everyday, even if it's not a scheduled cleaning day. Cleaning your hamster's cage too often or too little can cause them undue stress, so make sure you are cleaning the right amount when needed. Look for any droppings or wet areas in the bedding material. You can spot remove some areas. However, if there are a lot of them you should change the bedding. Pick out any leftover food that your hamster may have left laying around the cage. Change the water daily. If the bedding material has become soaked or damp near the water dispenser, you may want to change the bedding out. If the walls of the enclosure are looking dirty or smudged, it may be time for a full cleaning. If the cage smells you must clean it fully. Hamsters have a very sensitive sense of smell and can fall ill if the cage is unclean or the air quality is too poor. Before you get started cleaning, it is a good idea to assemble everything you will need. This can make the process much easier and less stressful for both you and your hamster. Collect the following items to get started: Wash cloth or baby wipes. This will be used for scrubbing and cleaning the cage and anything in it. Disinfectant. You can use mild, antibacterial hand or dish soap. Avoid harsh chemicals like bleach as these can harm your hamster. Pet stores will often carry safe and approved cleaning solutions as well. New bedding to place in the cage after you've cleaned it. Keep about a third of the bedding so they don't get stressed. You won't be able to clean the cage properly unless you have removed your hamster from it. Place your hamster in a secondary cage, exercise ball, or other safe enclosure while you work. Handle your hamster gently as you remove them from the cage. Cup your hamster in your hands, fully supporting their entire body. Don't leave your hamster in the exercise ball for more than half an hour as they will need fresh air and a break from the activity. Wash your hands before and after handling your hamster to protect both of you from spreading germs and getting sick. You can use regular unscented hand soap for this. After you have removed your hamster and have placed them in a secure environment, you will need to take out any objects in the cage. Leaving anything in the cage will make cleaning it more difficult and not as effective. Remove all food and water bowls or dispensers. Take out any toys or exercise equipment. The last thing you need to remove from the cage will be the bedding. The bedding is where your hamster leaves its waste, resulting in what can be a strong ammonia scent which can cause respiratory problems for your hamster. Make sure to keep a little to mix in with the new bedding and reduce the hamster's stress. You may want to seal the old bedding in a waste bag of its own to lock in any smells. Summary:","completion":"Regularly inspect the hamster's cage to determine if cleaning is necessary, as too much or too little cleaning can cause stress. Check for droppings, wet areas, dirty walls, and unpleasant odors. Before cleaning, gather a washcloth or baby wipes, disinfectant, and new bedding. Remove the hamster and place it in a safe enclosure during the cleaning process, remembering to wash your hands before and after handling it. Remove all objects and bedding from the cage. Keep a portion of the old bedding to mix with the new, reducing stress for the hamster. Dispose of the old bedding in a sealed waste bag to contain odors. Use mild disinfectants to clean the cage and its components. Always make sure the cleaning process is thorough to promote a healthy environment for your hamster."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Through the 1820s and the turn of the decade, American settlers kept up pressure on the US government to remove the Seminole from Florida to make way for their desired agricultural development. In 1832, a few Seminole chiefs signed the Treaty of Payne's Landing, by which they agreed to give up their Florida lands in exchange for lands west of the Mississippi River in Indian Territory. According to legend, Osceola stabbed the treaty with his knife, although there are no contemporary reports of this. Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminole, did not agree to removal. In retaliation, the US Indian agent, Wiley Thompson, declared that those chiefs were deposed from their positions. As US relations with the Seminole deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior rising to prominence, resented this ban. He felt it equated the Seminole with slaves, who were forbidden to carry arms. Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend and gave him a rifle. Osceola had a habit of barging into Thompson's office and shouting complaints at him. On one occasion Osceola quarreled with Thompson who had the warrior locked up at Fort King for a two nights until he agreed to be more respectful. In order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to sign the Treaty of Payne's Landing and to bring his followers into the fort. After his humiliating imprisonment, Osceola secretly prepared vengeance against Thompson. On December 28, 1835, Osceola, with the same rifle Thompson gave him, killed Wiley Thompson. Osceola and his followers shot six others outside Fort King, while another group of Seminole ambushed and killed a column of US Army, over 100 troops, marching from Fort Brooke to Fort King, in what Americans called the Dade Massacre. These nearly simultaneous attacks began the Second Seminole War. Answer this question \\"Did the warrior kill him?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, the warrior Osceola killed Wiley Thompson with the same rifle Thompson gave him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He confronts K, who is with his partner Agent J, telling him he is \\"already dead\\". J then discovers that K was responsible not only for capturing Boris, but for deploying the \\"ArcNet\\", a shield that prevented the Boglodites from conquering Earth and caused their extinction. Boris travels back in time to kill the young Agent K. With history altered so that K is long-dead, J finds that only his memory has been unaffected, and no one from the Agency understands his obsession with K until Agent O, the new Chief, deduces that there has been a fracture in the space-time continuum. With K out of the picture, the ArcNet was never deployed, and there is nothing to protect the present-day Earth from the Boglodite invasion, so J must travel back in time to stop Boris and save K. Back in 1969, he travels to Coney Island, knowing from the Agency's records that, in 1969, Boris will commit a murder there. He finds Boris, but is discovered and arrested by 1969 K, who prepares to wipe his memory, but decides at the last minute to investigate J's claims. K and J follow clues, leading them to a bowling alley, and then to The Factory, where they come across an alien named Griffin, who is in possession of the ArcNet. Griffin, who can see all possible future timelines and outcomes, senses Boris is coming and escapes, but he later captures him. J and K pursue and rescue Griffin, acquiring the ArcNet. 1969 Boris escapes and 2012 Boris arrives and they team up. Upon learning that they must go to Cape Canaveral, Florida and attach the ArcNet to the Apollo 11 rocket so it can be deployed in space, J reveals the real purpose of his mission to K, who initially takes the news badly.

A: Pick your answer from: - coronary; - pulmonary; - digestive; - respiratory; Answer:","completion":"The airway and the lungs are part of the respiratory system. This system is essential for the process of respiration, which involves the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between an organism and its environment. The respiratory system can be divided into two main parts: the upper respiratory tract and the lower respiratory tract. The upper respiratory tract consists of the nose, nasal cavity, paranasal sinuses, pharynx (throat), and larynx (voice box). The lower respiratory tract consists of the trachea (windpipe), bronchi, bronchioles, and the lungs. The primary function of the respiratory system is to deliver oxygen from the environment to the blood and remove carbon dioxide, a waste product, from the blood back to the environment. Here is an overview of the process: 1. Inhalation: When we inhale, air enters through the nose or mouth and passes through the nasal cavity or oral cavity. The air is warmed, moistened, and filtered as it travels through these cavities and the associated structures. 2. Transport through upper respiratory tract: The air continues to travel through the pharynx and larynx, and then enters the trachea. The trachea divides into two primary bronchi, which further divide into smaller secondary and tertiary bronchi. 3. Bronchi and bronchioles: The bronchi continue to branch into smaller and smaller structures known as bronchioles. These bronchioles are lined with tiny hair-like structures called cilia, which help trap mucus and foreign particles, assisting in the defensive function of the respiratory system. 4. Alveoli and gas exchange: Eventually, bronchioles end in small sac-like airspaces called alveoli. The alveoli are covered by an extensive network of capillaries, which allow for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the air and blood. Oxygen diffuses from the air in the alveoli into the blood, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood back into the alveoli. 5. Exhalation: After the exchange of gases in the alveoli, carbon dioxide-rich air is expelled from the lungs and up through the respiratory tract during exhalation. The respiratory system also plays a role in speech, smell, and maintaining the pH balance of the blood. In addition, it protects the body from harmful substances and pathogens that may be inhaled by producing mucus, initiating a cough reflex, and containing immune cells to combat infections. In summary, the airway and lungs are essential components of the respiratory system, which is responsible for vital life processes such as respiration, gas exchange, and defense against microbes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Like sentinels, they sprouted in a line from the barn, swerved north of the stream, veered at a right angle for the stump, and followed Justin to where he stood. The cross-beams remained, after which he'd finally be done. He took a white handkerchief from his shirt pocket and wiped his forehead. The task had been lengthened considerably, although Justin refused to admit it, by incessant thinking, an activity which often stopped him with his hammer in mid-air. But now, he would soon be able to think all he wanted from the comfort of his porch as the cattle wandered from shade to shade. After he bought some cattle, he reminded himself. Under the entirely blue vault of sky, Justin felt something pass between himself and the morning sun. His leathered face turned up to see nothing but ubiquitous light, curving toward him in all directions. He arched his aging back, feeling the popping and hating it more than usual, before wiping his neck and replacing the handkerchief. He had that feeling that he'd better drink something and sit down or he'd end up in that damn hospital again. Twice last year, whether he needed it or not, he went in for a check-up, and twice a year, some intern treated him like the village idiot. Truth be told, everyone who knew about him had treated him that way for nearly eleven years, except his niece. With a sigh escaping from the bellows of his withering chest, Justin shuffled back to the porch he had added onto his small two-room home. In the distance, a plume of dust was billowing off the road.

Which notorious real-life terrorist figures prominently in Robert Ludlum's Bourne Trilogy?","completion":"The notorious real-life terrorist figure that prominently features in Robert Ludlum's Bourne Trilogy, specifically in the third novel – “The Bourne Ultimatum” – is the infamous international terrorist, Carlos the Jackal. His real name is Ilich Ramírez Sánchez. Born on October 12, 1949, in Caracas, Venezuela, Carlos the Jackal rose to notoriety as one of the most ruthless and feared terrorists during the 1970s and 1980s. He was involved in various terrorist activities, assassinations, and bombings across Europe and the Middle East. He worked for multiple revolutionary organizations, including the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), which was responsible for the terror attacks he was involved in. Some of his most infamous acts include the 1975 attack on OPEC headquarters in Vienna and a series of bombings in France in the early 1980s. In the Bourne Trilogy, Carlos serves as the primary antagonist for the protagonist, Jason Bourne. In the novels, Bourne (whose real name is David Webb) is a highly skilled CIA operative with amnesia, struggling to uncover his own identity and past as he is caught in a deadly game of cat-and-mouse with Carlos. Ludlum weaves their rivalry through a compelling and suspenseful narrative, highlighting the various ways their lives and missions intersect and affect one another. The Bourne Trilogy comprises of three novels: \\"The Bourne Identity\\" (1980), \\"The Bourne Supremacy\\" (1986), and \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" (1990). While Carlos the Jackal does not feature as prevalently in the first two novels, he is a central figure in the last one. In \\"The Bourne Ultimatum,\\" Bourne becomes more determined to bring Carlos to justice and end his reign of terror. As the story progresses, Bourne unearths the secrets of his own past, confronts Carlos, and outwits him in an intense final showdown. It is important to note that the Bourne Trilogy was later adapted into a series of successful films starring Matt Damon as Jason Bourne. However, the storylines of both the movies and the novels diverge significantly in details and themes, and the Carlos the Jackal character is not present in the film adaptations. Carlos the Jackal's placement in the Bourne Trilogy fictional narrative almost mirrors his real-life infamous status. The character's ruthless nature, elusiveness, and ability to stay ahead of various governments' attempts to apprehend him add depth and intrigue to the novels. Ludlum's inclusion of such a notorious historical figure serves to heighten the stakes within the story, making for an especially captivating read where fiction meets reality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? ? Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location. Built in 1911 the town hall was on the junction of Water Street and Spring Lane. For many years after the town lost its urban district status, the building was unoccupied. It was converted to private accommodation in 1999.","completion":"The name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for is St Thomas' Church."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer is:","completion":"Cashmere comes from cashmere goats. These goats are the primary source of cashmere wool, a fiber renowned worldwide for its softness, warmth, and durability. Cashmere goats are found in various parts of the world, including Mongolia, China, Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkey, among others. The process of acquiring cashmere is tedious and is a contributing factor to its premium cost. The wool is diligently harvested by hand during the molting season, which typically falls in spring. The material is collected from the soft undercoat of the goat, rather than its rough outer hairs. It takes an average of two to three goats to produce enough wool to make a single cashmere sweater. Once collected, the cashmere fiber then undergoes a rigorous process of cleaning and separating, as the desirable undercoat needs to be separated from the rougher overcoat hairs. This process usually requires a lot of work, adding further to the luxury status of cashmere items. Thus, the intricate process of obtaining cashmere from goats and the limited regions in which these goats are found contribute significantly to the relatively high costs of cashmere products around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Seuraavassa on yksityiskohtainen ja pidempi vastaus: Barcelonan prosessin avulla tarkoitus on parantaa taloudellista ja poliittista yhteistyötä Euroopan unionin ja eteläisen Välimeren alueen maiden välillä. Prosessin puitteissa on tehty useita toimia, joiden tarkoituksena on tukea poliittista vakautta, taloudellista kehitystä ja sosiaalista yhteenkuuluvuutta alueella. Yhteistyön kannalta keskeiset osa-alueet ovat muun muassa energia, liikenne, ympäristö, koulutus ja kulttuuri. Välimeren yhteistyöstrategiassa pyritään luomaan synergioita Euroopan unionin ja eteläisen Välimeren alueen maiden välille, jotta edistettäisiin yhteisiä strategisia etuja sekä vastattaisiin alueellisiin ja maailmanlaajuisiin haasteisiin. Viime vuosikymmenen aikana olemme nähneet, että poliittiset ja taloudelliset kriisit alueella heijastuvat vahvasti Euroopan unioniin, ja siksi onkin olennaisen tärkeää omaksua ennakoiva lähestymistapa, joka edistää alueen vakautta ja vaurautta. Euroopan naapuruuspolitiikka (ENP) ei ole ainoastaan keskittynyt Euroopan lähialueisiin, vaan siinä korostetaan myös yhteistyön merkitystä niin alueella kuin kansainvälisellä tasolla. ENP korostaa yhteisiä arvoja, kuten demokratiaa, oikeusvaltioperiaatetta ja ihmisoikeuksien kunnioittamista. Tavoitteena on, että Euroopan unionin on syvennettävä kumppanuutta ja yhteistyötä eteläisen Välimeren naapuriensa kanssa, jotta voidaan edistää poliittista ja taloudellista vakautta koko alueella ja tukea Euroopan unioniin pyrkivien maiden pyrkimyksiä demokratiaan ja hyvään hallintoon. Koska ENP:n tärkeänä osana on ollut edistää eteläisen Välimeren alueen maiden talouskehitystä, turvallisuutta ja vakautta, unionin on jatkettava konkreettisten toimien toteuttamista energian, liikenteen, kaupan ja ympäristön aloilla. Lopuksi on ehdottomasti tärkeää, että Euroopan unioni huomioi eteläisen naapurustonsa kehityksen ja tarpeet, niin ettei Välimeren alueen kumppaneiden kanssa tehty yhteistyö jää pelkäksi julistuksen tasolle. Euroopan unionin on oltava valmis toimimaan tehokkaasti alueen etujen sekä omien etujensa mukaisesti ja tarjottava horisontaalista, kumppanuuteen perustuvaa lähestymistapaa poliittisiin ja taloudellisiin kysymyksiin."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The leading U.S. presidential hopefuls reacted strongly Monday to the massacre at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Sunday's incident that left 49 people dead and 53 others wounded was the worst mass shooting in U.S. history. The gunman, Omar Mateen, was a U.S. citizen and the son of Afghan parents. In her first speech since the shooting, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton told supporters in Cleveland, \\"The Orlando terrorist may be dead, but the virus that poisoned his mind remains very much alive.\\" Clinton laid out a multi-faceted approach to combating terrorism. The plan would disrupt terrorist groups by infiltrating their online networks, enhancing intelligence sharing among local and federal law enforcement agencies, and asking allied nations to help \\"prevent the radicalization and recruitment\\" of potential terrorists in the U.S. and Europe. In an apparent response to presumptive Republican Party opponent Donald Trump's charge that President Barack Obama and other Democrats refuse to use the word \\"radical\\" to describe terrorists who happen to be Muslim, Clinton said earlier on CNN that she is not afraid to use the term, but says she refuses \\"to demonize and demagogue and declare war on an entire religion.\\" Doing so, she said, \\"plays right into the ISIS' hands.\\" ISIS is an acronym for Islamic State, which is also known as IS, ISIL and Daesh. Clinton called for citizens to reach out to Muslims in the United States \\"to help us defeat this threat.\\" She cited the need for \\"common sense reform\\" of gun ownership laws, including a ban on assault weapons. After Obama did not use the term \\"radical\\" in his remarks Sunday from the White House, Trump criticized Obama's approach to extremism and said the president \\"should step down.\\" Trump, meanwhile, renewed a call for a ban on the entry of Muslim immigrants into the United States. \\"The only reason the killer was in America in the first place was we allowed his family to come here,\\" Trump said in a speech to supporters in Manchester, New...

Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions. That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases: \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger) The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions? Answer: Pick your answer from: 1. It brought a legal case against the government.; 2. It marks an important change for the Bush administration.; 3. It is a conclusion by a Bush administration.; 4.

This review only came about after a group of environmental organizations brought a legal case against the government, urging them to take action to protect polar bears. By invoking the Endangered Species Act, the US government might finally be compelled to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary cause of global warming and the subsequent melting of polar ice – the polar bear's natural habitat."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Sir William Jones proposed that Sanskrit, Persian, Greek, Latin, Gothic, and Celtic languages all shared a common base. After Jones, an effort to catalog all languages of the world was made throughout the 19th century and into the 20th century. Publication of Ferdinand de Saussure's Cours de linguistique générale created the development of descriptive linguistics. Descriptive linguistics, and the related structuralism movement caused linguistics to focus on how language changes over time, instead of just describing the differences between languages. Noam Chomsky further diversified linguistics with the development of generative linguistics in the 1950s. His effort is based upon a mathematical model of language that allows for the description and prediction of valid syntax. Additional specialties such as sociolinguistics, cognitive linguistics, and computational linguistics have emerged from collaboration between linguistics and other disciplines.

Get a group of friends or family members together and register for an escape room, where you work as a group to find your way out of a locked room. Before booking anything, be sure to check the reviews of the escape room business first. Ask for everyone to chip in a little bit of money to make the cost more manageable. If you’re traveling with younger kids, try choosing an escape room with a more family-friendly theme. Search online to see if there are any parks or trail systems near your home. When the weather is nice, drive or catch a ride to begin exploring the great outdoors! Take in the beautiful scenery by taking a hike, or by going on a bike ride. Ask your friends and family to join you on a hike. If you have a furry friend, bring them along too!

When studying the kinetic-molecular theory, two teams of students did and experiment. Team A heated a can of soup over the fire without venting it first, team B heated a can of soup, but vented it first. Which team lead a less safer experiment? Hint: It would be very unadvisable to place a can of soup over a campfire without venting the can. As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can. A:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, Team A led a less safer experiment. Here's the step-by-step justification for this conclusion: 1. According to the kinetic-molecular theory, heating the can of soup provides the air inside with more kinetic energy, causing air molecules to move faster and impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. 2. Team A heated the can of soup without venting it first, which means the can remained a closed, rigid container. 3. As the air molecules inside the can gained more energy from the heat, the pressure inside the can increased due to more frequent and forceful collisions with the container walls. 4. Additionally, the soup may have begun to boil, releasing more gas and further increasing the pressure inside the can. 5. The combination of increased molecular activity and additional gas from boiling soup causes the pressure to build up inside the closed can, which may eventually exceed the can's strength, leading to an explosion. 6. Team B vented the can of soup before heating it, allowing the trapped air and excessive pressure to escape, thus mitigating the risk of explosion. In conclusion, Team A's experiment was less safe due to the potential for a pressure buildup from the increased kinetic energy and boiling of the soup, which might have caused the can to explode. Team B's experiment was considerably safer due to the venting done to prevent pressure buildup."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

Group A ate lots of fats(lipids), while Group B had a more balanced diet with few fats. Group A gained a lot of weight over the course of the 6 month study. Which group had normal lipid levels in the blood? Hint: Although some lipids in the diet are essential, excess dietary lipids can be harmful. Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Group B, which had a more balanced diet with few fats, is more likely to have normal lipid levels in the blood. This is because they maintained a moderate fat intake, avoiding the negative effects associated with excessive dietary lipids, such as unhealthy weight gain and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. On the other hand, Group A, which consumed a high-fat diet, likely experienced increased lipid levels in their blood, leading to potential health problems. It is important to maintain a balanced diet with appropriate levels of fats, particularly focusing on consuming healthier unsaturated fats and limiting saturated fats, trans fats, and cholesterol intake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person whose \\"middle\\" compositional period was after 1901? The Symphony No. 8 in E-flat major by Gustav Mahler is one of the largest-scale choral works in the classical concert repertoire. Because it requires huge instrumental and vocal forces it is frequently called the \\"Symphony of a Thousand\\", although the work is normally presented with far fewer than a thousand performers and the composer did not sanction that name. The work was composed in a single inspired burst, at Maiernigg in southern Austria in the summer of 1906. The last of Mahler's works that was premiered in his lifetime, the symphony was a critical and popular success when he conducted the Munich Philharmonic in its first performance, in Munich, on 12 September 1910. The fusion of song and symphony had been a characteristic of Mahler's early works. In his \\"middle\\" compositional period after 1901, a change of direction led him to produce three purely instrumental symphonies. The Eighth, marking the end of the middle period, returns to a combination of orchestra and voice in a symphonic context. The structure of the work is unconventional; instead of the normal framework of several movements, the piece is in two parts. Part I is based on the Latin text of a 9th-century Christian hymn for Pentecost, Veni creator spiritus (\\"Come, Creator Spirit\\"), and Part II is a setting of the words from the closing scene of Goethe's Faust. The two parts are unified by a common idea, that of redemption through the power of love, a unity conveyed through shared musical themes. Mahler had been convinced from the start of the work's significance; in renouncing the pessimism that had marked much of his music, he offered the Eighth as an expression of confidence in the eternal human spirit. In the period following the composer's death, performances were comparatively rare. However, from the mid-20th century onwards the symphony has been heard regularly in concert halls all over the world, and has been recorded many times. While recognising its wide popularity, modern critics have divided opinions on the work; Theodor W....

This means that if an item is stored for any part of the day, the full daily rate will be charged. For example, if you store your bicycle for 2 hours or 23 hours, the daily rate of 5.00€ still applies. However, if the item is stored for multiple days, the daily rate is multiplied by the number of days the item is stored. So, for example, if the item is stored for 3 days and 2 hours, the total fee would be (3 full days x 5.00€) + (1 partial day x 5.00€) = 20.00€. 4. 5.00€: This is the cost or fee associated with storing oversized luggage items for each calendar day or part thereof. The fee is in Euro (€) and applies to each outsized item separately. In summary, the statement \\"Outsized luggage (bicycles, surfboards, etc.) per calendar day or part thereof: 5.00€\\" is explaining the pricing structure for storing large and irregularly shaped items, such as bicycles and surfboards, at a particular service or facility. The fee for storing these items is 5.00€ per calendar day or any part of a calendar day, regardless of the exact duration of storage within that day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This is a good book for a refresher, that's it. Answer: A:","completion":"There is a negative tone to this product review. The author of the review has expressed dissatisfaction and frustration with the book in question, specifically as a tool for learning algebra. This is made clear in both the title and the content of the review. The capitalization of \\"DO NOT\\" in the title indicates a strong warning against the book for anyone looking to learn algebra. The reviewer further emphasizes their disapproval by reiterating the title's sentiment - \\"Do Not get this book if you are trying to learn algebra\\" - in the opening line of the review. The reviewer does not provide a completely negative assessment, as they do admit that the first half of the book is \\"OK\\" for covering basic topics in algebra. However, the overall tone remains negative as the review discusses the major issues found in the later sections of the book. The mention of \\"tons of problems with no explanation AT ALL\\" conveys a sense of frustration and disappointment, especially for a book that is presumed to teach algebra. The reviewer clearly feels that the book essentially fails to fulfill its purpose. Their use of all-capital letters for \\"AT ALL\\" further emphasizes the reviewer's exasperation with the book. While the reviewer does try to offer a slightly positive point about the book being a potentially good tool as a refresher, the overall tone remains predominantly negative. The dissatisfaction with the book's usefulness in teaching algebra appears to be the driving factor behind this negative tone, indicating that, for the reviewer, the book is not a worthwhile investment for those seeking to learn the subject."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Gregory smiles and looks carefully. It could be a year before Gregory, 4 months old, can speak, but now his mother hopes to communicate with her baby through sign language. Like others around the world, Campbell is part of a growing movement of parents teaching hearing babies simple signs to communicate before they can talk. The baby sign language has been more popular in recent years. The movie,\\"Meet the Fockers\\",where the main character teaches his young grandson to sign, makes it well developed. Babies generally begin to talk between 12 and 15 months, but babies can use sign language to communicate before they learn how to speak. \\"We know they are learning language faster than they are able to show you with their speech production because that system takes a long time to develop.\\" says McRoberts, director of developmental research at the Haskins Laboratories. \\"They are understanding words before they are able to say them.

The World No.1 avoided a potentially long and drawn out court case in Dublin, Ireland, after attempting to sue Horizon Sports Management, who in turn were counter-suing the golfer by claiming the Northern Irishman owed them millions of dollars in commission on contracts up to 2017. McIlroy had labeled the contract he had signed with Horizon as \\"unconscionable.\\" \\"The legal dispute between Rory McIlroy and Horizon Sports Management has been settled to the satisfaction of both parties who wish each other well for the future,\\" said a joint statement from McIlroy and Horizon. \\"The parties will be making no further comment,\\" added the statement. McIlroy reportedly paid 22.8m million plus costs to settle the case. In an interview with CNN's Living Golf show month, McIlroy insisted the case had been about taking \\"control of things myself.\\" He added: \\"If there's one good thing that's came out of all of this, it's being able to set up my own management team and my own management company. \\"That's been huge.

McIlroy, who won the Dubai Desert Classic last weekend, was not in court when the settlement was announced, though he did make a brief appearance on Tuesday.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Sir Richard Starkey (born 7 July 1940), known professionally as Ringo Starr, is an English musician, singer, songwriter and actor who gained worldwide fame as the drummer for the Beatles. He occasionally sang lead vocals with the group, usually for one song on each album, including \\"With a Little Help from My Friends\\", \\"Yellow Submarine\\", \\"Good Night\\", and their cover of \\"Act Naturally\\". He also wrote and sang the Beatles' songs \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Octopus's Garden\\", and is credited as a co-writer of others, including \\"What Goes On\\" and \\"Flying\\". Starr was afflicted by life-threatening illnesses during childhood, and he fell behind in school as a result of prolonged hospitalisations. He briefly held a position with British Rail before securing an apprenticeship at a Liverpool equipment manufacturer. Soon afterwards, he became interested in the UK skiffle craze and developed a fervent admiration for the genre. In 1957, he co-founded his first band, the Eddie Clayton Skiffle Group, which earned several prestigious local bookings before the fad succumbed to American rock and roll by early 1958. When the Beatles formed in 1960, Starr was a member of another Liverpool group, Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. After achieving moderate success in the UK and Hamburg, he quit the Hurricanes and joined the Beatles in August 1962, replacing Pete Best. Starr played key roles in the Beatles' films and appeared in numerous others.

In one study, striking increases in IQ occurred in 25 children who were moved from an orphanage to more stimulating(,) environments.The children, who were all considered mentally retarded and unadoptable, were moved to an institution where they received personal attention from adults.Later, these supposedly retarded children were adopted by parents who gave them love, a family ,and a stimulating home environment.The children gained an average of 29 IQ points.For one child, the increase was an amazing 58 points.A second group of initially less \\"retarded\\" children, who stayed in the orphanage, lost an average of 26 IQ points. Other encouraging results can be found in early childhood education programs, which provide stimulating intellectual experiences for disadvantaged children.In one study, children from low-income families were given enriched environments from early infancy through preschool.By age 2 their IQ scores were already higher than those in a control group.More important, they were still 5 points higher seven years later.High-quality enrichment programs such as Head Start can prevent children from falling behind in school. A particularly striking environmental effect is the fact that 14 nations have shown average IQ gains of from 5 to 25 points during the last 30 years.These IQ boosts, averaging 15 points, occurred in far too short a time for genetics to explain them.It is more likely that the gains reflect environmental forces, such as improved education, nutrition, and living in a technologically complex society.

Elettra stuck the little slip of paper, on which the recipe was written, into her shabby pocket-book without looking at it. She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed.

Her husband, Gus Hillman, a wealthy businessman, would be willing to contribute half a million dollars as capital for the venture. Doris quickly seems interested in more than a purely professional relationship. Shaw starts an affair with her and accepts the business offer. However, an accidental discovery leaves him convinced that the Hillmans' interest lies less in the long-term profits of the venture than in the 175,000 key man insurance policy he took on himself as a precondition for the deal, and that an attempt on his life is imminent. Madge, the younger sister of Doris, develops a romantic interest in Shaw as well. Without knowing what Doris has planned, she reveals to Shaw that her sister was married previously to a man who died in Wyoming when his car crashed over a bridge. Shaw ends up drugged by Gus Hillman and barely keeps his car from going off a cliff. The police are skeptical about his story and the insurance company refuses to cancel the policy, Hillman having portrayed Shaw as a man who is trying to steal his wife.

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that \\"There is little penalty for failing to meet the goal.\\" Step 3: Assess the relationship between the premise and hypothesis To assess the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we need to consider the implications of the given information. - If 23 percent of active lawyers met the pro-bono goal, this means that 77 percent (18,171 lawyers) did not. - If there were significant penalties for not meeting the goal, we might expect a higher proportion of lawyers to meet the goal in order to avoid those penalties. - The premise does not provide any information on the penalties that may exist for not meeting the pro-bono goal, but it does show that a large majority of lawyers did not meet the goal. Step 4: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the premise The fact that 77 percent of the lawyers did not meet the pro-bono goal in 2002 suggests that either the penalties for not meeting the goal are not significant, or that they are not effectively enforced. While the premise does not conclusively prove the hypothesis, it does support the idea that there is little penalty for failing to meet the goal.

The medical college is located at 1300 York Avenue, on the Upper East Side of Manhattan in New York City, along with the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences. - Immunology is a branch of biology that covers the study of immune systems in all organisms. It was the Russian biologist Ilya Ilyich Mechnikov who boosted studies on immunology, and received the Nobel Prize in 1908 for his work. He jabbed the thorn of a rose on a starfish and noted that, 24 hours later, cells were surrounding the tip. It was an active response of the body, trying to maintain its integrity. It was Mechnikov who first observed the phenomenon of phagocytosis, in which the body defends itself against a foreign body, and coined the term. It charts, measures, and contextualizes the: physiological functioning of the immune system in states of both health and diseases; malfunctions of the immune system in immunological disorders (such as autoimmune diseases, hypersensitivities, immune deficiency, and transplant rejection); the physical, chemical and physiological characteristics of the components of the immune system \\"in vitro\\", \\"in situ,\\" and \\"in vivo\\". Immunology has applications in numerous disciplines of medicine, particularly in the fields of organ transplantation, oncology, virology, bacteriology, parasitology, psychiatry, and dermatology. - Medicine (British English ; American English ) is the science and practice of the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of disease. The word \\"medicine\\" is derived from Latin \\"medicus\\", meaning \\"a physician\\". Medicine encompasses a variety of health care practices evolved to maintain and restore health by the prevention and treatment of illness. Contemporary medicine applies biomedical sciences, biomedical research, genetics, and medical technology to diagnose, treat, and prevent injury and disease, typically through pharmaceuticals or surgery, but also through therapies as diverse as psychotherapy, external splints and traction, medical devices, biologics, and ionizing radiation, amongst others. - The National Cancer Institute (NCI) is part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH), which is one of eleven agencies that are part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The NCI coordinates the U.S. National Cancer Program and conducts and supports research, training, health information dissemination, and other activities related to the causes, prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer; the supportive care of cancer patients and their families; and cancer survivorship. On April 1, 2015, Douglas Lowy, M.D. was named the Acting Director of NCI. - Alfred Pritchard Sloan, Jr. (May 23, 1875 February 17, 1966) was an American business executive in the automotive industry. He was a long-time President, chairman and CEO of General Motors Corporation. Sloan, first as a senior executive and later as the head of the organization, helped GM grow from the 1920s through the 1950s, decades when concepts such as the annual model change, brand architecture, industrial design, automotive design (styling), and planned obsolescence transformed the industry, and when the industry changed lifestyles and the built environment in America and throughout the world. - The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), is a center of health sciences research, patient care, and education devoted solely to graduate education and located in San Francisco, California. The UCSF School of Medicine is one of the most selective medical schools in the United States based on average MCAT score, GPA, and acceptance rate. In 2015, 7,393 people applied and 437 were interviewed for 149 positions in the entering class. UCSF is ranked 3rd among research-oriented medical schools in the United States and ranked 3rd for primary care by \\"U.S. News and World Report,\\" making it the only medical school to achieve a top-5 ranking in both categories. UCSF is currently ranked 2nd among medical schools in the world by the Academic Ranking of World Universities (Clinical Medicine, 2015). - Physiology is the scientific study of the normal function in living systems. A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. - The term \\"microbiologist\\" comes from the Greek \\"mkros\\" meaning \\"small\\" , and \\"bios\\", meaning \\"life\\" , combined with \\"-logia\\" meaning one who studies. A microbiologist (from Greek ) is a biological scientist who studies microscopic life forms and processes or works in the field of microbiology. Microbiologists investigate the growth, interactions and characteristics of microscopic organisms such as bacteria, algae, fungi, and some types of parasites and their vectors. They contribute much to the field by trying to understand and learn about the interaction between these microbes and the environment and also among themselves and other organisms. Most microbiologists are qualified to work in offices and/or research facilities, such as a laboratory as well as in the academia. There, they conduct experiments that help them analyze microbes and their importance. A microbiologist's work is often repeated or improved in order to establish accurate research. Most microbiologists specialize in environmental, food, agricultural, industrial or medical aspects of microbiology including: virology (the study of viruses); immunology (the study of mechanisms that fight infections); bioinformatics (the methods for storing, retrieving, organizing and analyzing biological data) and Bioremediation (using microbes as environmental mitigation strategies). Many microbiologists use biotechnology to advance the understanding of cell reproduction and human disease. Some microbiologists have contributed to knowledge of pathogens and disease-causing microbes. While others, study their interaction with the environment and their use as potential environmental pollution cleaners. - The Nobel Prize (; Swedish definite form, singular: \\"Nobelpriset\\") is a set of annual international awards bestowed in a number of categories by Swedish and Norwegian institutions in recognition of academic, cultural, and/or scientific advances. - San Francisco (SF) (Spanish for Saint Francis) officially the City and County of San Francisco, is the cultural, commercial, and financial center of Northern California. It is the birthplace of the United Nations. Located at the north end of the San Francisco Peninsula, San Francisco is about in area, making it the smallest countyand the only consolidated city-countywithin the state of California. With a density of about 18,451 people per square mile (7,124 people per km), San Francisco is the most densely settled large city (population greater than 200,000) in California and the second-most densely populated major city in the United States after New York City. San Francisco is the fourth-most populous city in California, after Los Angeles, San Diego, and San Jose, and the 13th-most populous city in the United Stateswith a census-estimated 2015 population of 864,816. The city and its surrounding areas are known as the San Francisco Bay Area, and are a part of the larger OMB-designated San Jose-San Francisco-Oakland combined statistical area, the fifth most populous in the nation with an estimated population of 8.7 million. - Life is a characteristic distinguishing physical entities having biological processes, such as signaling and self-sustaining processes, from those that do not, either because such functions have ceased, or because they never had such functions and are classified as inanimate. Various forms of life exist, such as plants, animals, fungi, protists, archaea, and bacteria. The criteria can at times be ambiguous and may or may not define viruses, viroids, or potential artificial life as \\"living\\". Biology is the primary science concerned with the study of life, although many other sciences are involved. - Harold Eliot Varmus (born December 18, 1939) is an American Nobel Prize-winning scientist and was the 14th Director of the National Cancer Institute, a post to which he was appointed by President Barack Obama. He was a co-recipient (along with J. Michael Bishop) of the 1989 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for discovery of the cellular origin of retroviral oncogenes. He is currently the Lewis Thomas University Professor of Medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and a Senior Associate at the New York Genome Center. - Virology is the study of viruses submicroscopic, parasitic particles of genetic material contained in a protein coat and virus-like agents. It focuses on the following aspects of viruses: their structure, classification and evolution, their ways to infect and exploit host cells for reproduction, their interaction with host organism physiology and immunity, the diseases they cause, the techniques to isolate and culture them, and their use in research and therapy. Virology is considered to be a subfield of microbiology or of medicine. - A diploma (from Greek µ \\"díplma\\", meaning \\"folded paper\\") is a certificate or deed issued by an educational institution, such as a college or university, that testifies that the recipient has successfully completed a particular course of study, or (US) recording that an academic degree has been awarded. In some countries, e.g. the United Kingdom and Australia, the word diploma also refers to an academic award (e.g. diploma of higher education, graduate diploma, postgraduate diploma). Historically, it can also refer to a charter or official document, thus diplomatic, diplomat and diplomacy via the \\"Codex Juris Gentium Diplomaticus\\". - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - The Alfred P. Sloan Prize is an award given each year, starting in 2003, to a film at the Sundance Film Festival. The prize is given to a feature film that focuses on science or technology as a theme, or depicts a scientist, engineer, or mathematician as a major character. - Bacteria (common noun bacteria, singular bacterium) constitute a large domain of prokaryotic microorganisms. Typically a few micrometres in length, bacteria have a number of shapes, ranging from spheres to rods and spirals. Bacteria were among the first life forms to appear on Earth, and are present in most of its habitats. Bacteria inhabit soil, water, acidic hot springs, radioactive waste, and the deep portions of Earth's crust. Bacteria also live in symbiotic and parasitic relationships with plants and animals. - Bioremediation is a waste management technique that involves the use of organisms to remove or neutralize pollutants from a contaminated site. According to the United States EPA, bioremediation is a treatment that uses naturally occurring organisms to break down hazardous substances into less toxic or non toxic substances. Technologies can be generally classified as \\"in situ\\" or \\"ex situ\\". \\"In situ\\" bioremediation involves treating the contaminated material at the site, while \\"ex situ\\" involves the removal of the contaminated material to be treated elsewhere. Some examples of bioremediation related technologies are phytoremediation, bioventing, bioleaching, landfarming, bioreactor, composting, bioaugmentation, rhizofiltration, and biostimulation. - The University of California (UC) is a public university system in the U.S. state of California. Under the California Master Plan for Higher Education, the University of California is a part of the state's three-system public higher education plan, which also include the California State University system and the California Community Colleges System. - Primary care is the day-to-day healthcare given by a health care provider. Typically this provider acts as the first contact and principal point of continuing care for patients within a healthcare system, and coordinates other specialist care that the patient may need. Patients commonly receive primary care from professionals such as a primary care physician (general practitioner or family physician), a nurse practitioner (adult-gerontology nurse practitioner, family nurse practitioner, or pediatric nurse practitioner), or a physician assistant. In some localities such a professional may be a registered nurse, a pharmacist, a clinical officer (as in parts of Africa), or a Ayurvedic or other traditional medicine professional (as in parts of Asia). Depending on the nature of the health condition, patients may then be referred for secondary or tertiary care. - Academic Ranking of World Universities (ARWU), also known as Shanghai Ranking, is an annual publication of university rankings by Shanghai Ranking Consultancy. The league table was originally compiled and issued by Shanghai Jiaotong University in 2003, the first global ranking with multifarious indicators, after which a board of international advisories was established to provide suggestions. The publication currently includes world's overall and subject league tables, alongside independent regional \\"Greater China Ranking\\" and \\"Macedonian HEIs Ranking\\". ARWU is regarded as one of the three most influential and widely observed university measures, alongside \\"QS World University Rankings\\" and \\"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\\". It is praised for its objective methodology but draws some condemnation for narrowly focusing on raw research power, undermining humanities and quality of instruction. - The Sundance Film Festival, a program of the Sundance Institute, is an American film festival that takes place annually in Park City, Utah. With 46,660 attendees in 2016, it is the largest independent film festival in the United States. Held in January in Park City, Salt Lake City, and Ogden, as well as at the Sundance Resort, the festival is a showcase for new work from American and international independent filmmakers. The festival comprises competitive sections for American and international dramatic and documentary films, both feature films and short films, and a group of out-of-competition sections, including NEXT, New Frontier, Spotlight, Midnight, Premieres and Documentary Premieres.

Specifically, it is inquiring about the two cities that are central to the plot of Charles Dickens's novel, A Tale of Two Cities. A Tale of Two Cities is an 1859 historical novel written by Charles Dickens, one of the most famous English authors. The novel is set against the backdrop of the French Revolution and focuses on the experiences and struggles of those living during that tumultuous time. The tale involves themes like love, sacrifice, resurrection, and the importance of choices. The two cities referenced in the title and at the heart of the story are London, England, and Paris, France. The novel initially presents the socio-economic contrast between London, a relatively stable and growing city, and Paris, a city in turmoil due to the rebellious fervor leading up to the French Revolution. Dickens masterfully weaves the story of his characters' lives through their different experiences in both cities, ultimately showing how the lives and fates of people in both cities become intertwined. In summary, the question is asking about a location, specifically the two cities that are the main focus of Charles Dickens's novel, A Tale of Two Cities: London in England and Paris in France."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Given the following context: The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson worked as a teacher and principal for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend heard the story of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.The organs of farm animals came from slaughterhouses, while fishermen supplied those of pinnipeds and the smaller whales. The penises of larger whales came from commercial whaling stations, although this source dried up after the International Whaling Commission implemented a global ban on commercial whaling in 1986. Sigurður was able to continue to collect whale penises by harvesting them from the 12–16 whales that fall victim to stranding on the Icelandic coast each year. He also obtained the penis of a polar bear shot by fishermen who found the animal drifting on drift ice off the Westfjords.Sigurður was assisted by his family, though not without some occasional embarrassment. His daughter Þorgerður recalls that she was once sent to a slaughterhouse to collect a specimen but arrived just as the workers were taking a lunch break: \\"Someone asked, 'What's in the basket?' I had to say, 'I'm collecting a frozen goat penis.' After that I said, 'I will never collect for you again.'\\" According to Sigurður, \\"Collecting penises is like collecting anything. You can never stop, you can never catch up, you can always get a new one, a better one.\\" The collection was at first housed in Sigurður's office at the college until he retired from his teaching job. He decided, more as a hobby than a job, to put it on public display in Reykjavík and was awarded a grant from the city council of ISK 200,000 to... answer the following question: What is the last name of the person to whom acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing whale penises?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Breathing is the process of moving air into and out of the lungs. The process depends on a muscle called the diaphragm. This is a large, sheet-like muscle below the lungs. Inhaling, or breathing in, occurs when the diaphragm muscle tightens. This increases the size of the chest. This too decreases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows air and gases to enter the lungs. Exhaling, or breathing out, occurs when the diaphragm muscle relaxes. This decreases the size of the chest. This increases air pressure inside the lungs. This action allows for air to leave the lungs. When you inhale, air enters the respiratory system through your nose and ends up in your lungs, where gas exchange with the blood takes place. What happens to the air along the way? In the nose, mucus and hairs trap any dust or other particles in the air. The air is also warmed and moistened. Next, air passes through a passageway that is connected to the windpipe. The air then finds its way to the lungs. In the chest, the windpipe splits so that air enters both the right and left lung. Question: \\"What happens to the size of your chest when you relax your diaphragm muscle?\\" Answer: \\"Increases\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"No, the answer to the question is not correct. When you relax your diaphragm muscle, the size of your chest decreases. This is because the diaphragm muscle moves upwards and reduces the chest space when it relaxes, causing air to be pushed out of the lungs during exhalation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A study of a million UK women, published today in The Lancet, has shown that happiness itself has no direct effect on mortality, and that the widespread but mistaken belief that unhappiness and stress directly cause ill health came from studies that had simply confused cause and effect. Life-threatening poor health can cause unhappiness, and for this reason unhappiness is associated with increased mortality. In addition, smokers tend to be unhappier than non-smokers. However, after taking account of previous ill health, smoking, and other lifestyle and socio-economic factors, the investigators found that unhappiness itself was no longer associated with increased mortality. The lead author, Dr Bette Liu, now at the University of New South Wales, Australia said: \\"Illness makes you unhappy, but unhappiness itself doesn't make you ill. We found no direct effect of unhappiness or stress on mortality, even in a ten-year study of a million women.\\" As in other studies, unhappiness was associated with deprivation, smoking, lack of exercise, and not living with a partner. The strongest associations, however, were that the women who were already in poor health tended to say that they were unhappy, stressed, not in control, and not relaxed. The main analyses included 700 000 women, average age 59 years, and over the next 10 years these women were followed by electronic record linkage for mortality, during which time 30 000 of the women died. After allowing for any differences already present in health and lifestyle, the overall death rate among those who were unhappy was the same as the death rate among those who were generally happy. The study is so large that it rules out unhappiness being a direct cause of any material increase in overall mortality in women. This was true for overall mortality, for cancer mortality, and for heart disease mortality, and it was true for stress as well as for unhappiness.

He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers.

Jerusalem (CNN) -- Following an investigation, Israel apologized to Egypt this week over an August incident in which five Egyptian border guards were killed, the Israeli Ministry of Defense said. The apology, issued Tuesday, was overshadowed by news that a deal had been reached for the release of Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, who was captured by the Palestinian group Hamas more than five years ago. However, it was largely seen as an olive branch to the transitional Egyptian government, as relations between Israel and Egypt have become strained in recent months. On August 18, militants crossed into Israel from Egyptian territory to attack Israeli civilian targets. Eight Israeli citizens were killed in the attacks, which Israel has said were the work of a jihadist group based in Gaza. Responding to the attacks, Israeli troops killed five Egyptian border guards while in pursuit of the militants. But \\"based on the findings of the investigation, the defense minister decided to express his apology to OPTIONS: - CNN over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Egyptian over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Gaza over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Gilad Shalit over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Hamas over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Israel over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Israeli over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Jerusalem over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Ministry of Defense over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Netanyahu over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Palestinian over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" - Shalit over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\"","completion":"Egypt over the death of every Egyptian policeman who was killed while on duty as a result of Israeli fire.\\" The correct answer is \\"Egypt\\" because the apology was being issued to the nation of Egypt for the deaths of their border guards caused by Israeli forces.

Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"In order to generate a detailed description of the given data, I will first clarify the terminology and context of each data point, then make connections and describe the significance of each value. Step 1: Terminology clarification - 10 Hygiea: The fourth-largest asteroid in the solar system, located in the asteroid belt. - Escape velocity: The minimum speed needed for an object to break free from the gravitational attraction of a celestial body without further propulsion. - Apoapsis: The point in the orbit of a celestial body where it is furthest from its focus, usually the central body it is orbiting. Step 2: Describing and relating the data points 10 Hygiea has an escape velocity of 0.21 kilometres per second, which means that in order to break free from its gravitational attraction, an object must achieve a speed of 0.21 km/s. This escape velocity is relatively low compared to other bodies in the solar system, such as Earth (approx. 11.2 km/s), which can be attributed to 10 Hygiea's smaller mass and size. The apoapsis of 10 Hygiea is 523,951,582.33968 kilometres. This is the point in the asteroid's orbit around the Sun where it is the furthest away. By contrast, the distance from the Earth to the Sun, known as an astronomical unit (AU), is approximately 149.6 million kilometres, so 10 Hygiea's apoapsis is around 3.5 AU from the Sun. This distance, along with the asteroid's orbit, places 10 Hygiea within the asteroid belt, which is located between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter. In conclusion, the data provided describes some key characteristics of the asteroid 10 Hygiea. With an escape velocity of 0.21 km/s, an object requires lesser energy in comparison to Earth to break free from Hygiea's gravitational pull. Furthermore, the apoapsis of 10 Hygiea locates it within the asteroid belt by positioning it approximately 3.5 times farther away from the Sun than Earth's average distance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Title: The Dark Knight Movie plot: The movie begins with a gang of men with clown masks breaking into the bank where the mob has a large portion of their money stashed. It begins with five clowns, each getting a cut of the spoils. They suggest that a sixth member of the gang - nicknamed 'The Joker' - who did the planning, but sat out the robbery, doesn't deserve a cut. As the robbery goes on, the clowns begin to kill each other in order to get a larger cut, until a school bus crashes through the wall of the bank, killing another clown. A mob bank manager, who was himself shot with an automatic weapon after he tried to take out the clowns with a shotgun, tells the remaining clown that he doesn't know who he is dealing with. The clown kneels down and tells the banker, \\"Whatever doesn't kill you simply makes you...stranger...\\" then removes his mask to reveal that he himself is The Joker. Joker puts a grenade into the banker's mouth and boards the bus, leaving a string attached to the pin. The bus pulls out with all of the bank's cash and the pin pops out. It is just a gas grenade. The Joker joins a long line of school buses leaving the scene as the police arrive.Gotham is then seen at night with criminals afraid to commit crimes under the watchful sign of the batsignal projected onto the clouds.

The sale is interrupted when some of Gotham's citizens dressed as Batmen wanna-be's begin shooting at the men.

In our everyday lives whenever we meet people, we always try to judge them in terms of their statuses. For example, we must judge whether the person in the library is a reader or a librarian, whether the telephone caller is a friend or a salesman and so on. Our statuses often vary with the people we meet, and change through life. Most of us can, at very high speed, assume the different statuses that various situations require. Much of social communication consists of recognizing and selecting among proper statuses and allowing other people to assume their statuses in relation to us. This means that we fit our actions to those of other people, based on a constant mental process of assessment and understanding. Although some of us find the task more difficult than others, most of us perform _ rather easily. A status has been compared to ready-made clothes. Within certain limits the buyer can choose style and material. But an American is not free to choose the clothes of a Chinese peasant or that of a Hindu prince. We must choose from among the clothing presented by our society. Furthermore, our choice is limited to a size that will fit, as well as by our wallet.

A new line extension called \\"Cracker Jack 'd\\" will hit stores soon, including a caffeinated variety called Power Bites that is drawing criticism from a health-advocacy group that fears the snack might make little Johnny a bit too hyper. \\"Boxes of Cracker Jack are famous for having a toy surprise inside. But what parent suspects that Cracker Jack might come with a surprising dose of a mildly addictive stimulant drug?\\" the Center for Science in the Public Interest said Wednesday. CSPI, known for taking on big brands for a variety of reasons, charges that the planned snack violates federal food rules. \\"Caffeine is generally recognized as safe only in cola-type beverages and only at concentrations of 0.02% or less (about 72 mg per 12 oz.),\\" the organization said in a letter to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. A Frito-Lay spokesman told Ad Age that Power Bites will include \\"two flavors that will contain coffee, a natural source of caffeine, as an ingredient.\\" He added: \\"We stand by the safety of all products in the Cracker Jack 'd line, including those that contain coffee. It is worth pointing out the regulation referenced in CSPI's letter to FDA speaks to caffeine -- not coffee -- and is not an exhaustive list of the safe uses of caffeine in foods and beverages. Rather it represents one particular recognized safe use.\\" While Frito-Lay is still finalizing the product, Power Bites are expected to \\"contain approximately 70 mg of caffeine from coffee in each 2 oz. package,\\" he said. The line extension comes as Frito-Lay seeks to expand its lineup of premium and value brands -- which include Cracker Jacks -- to appeal to an increasingly bifurcated consumer group. The Jack 'd lineup will include \\"a variety of products, including snack mixes [and] popcorn clusters\\" in addition to the Power Bites, the Frito-Lay spokesman said. The website nationwidecandy.com shows what potentially might be on the way. In a letter to PepsiCo executives, CSPI said \\"caffeine is a mildly addictive stimulant drug that is totally inappropriate to be included in foods consumed by children,\\" noting that effects include \\"anxiety, restlessness, irritability, excitability and insomnia.\\" The Frito-Lay spokesman said: \\"Cracker Jack 'd is a product line specifically developed for adult consumers and will not be marketed to children. All marketing for the products will be exclusively aimed at adult consumers, and the package design and appearance are wholly different from Cracker Jack to ensure there is no confusion among consumers. The presence of coffee and the caffeine that comes with it is clearly called out on both the front and back of the package.\\" CSPI also took issue with Kraft Foods Group's new Mio \\"energy\\" drink flavoring product, which contains caffeine, as well as Jelly Belly's \\"Extreme Sport Beans.\\" Kraft markets Mio to young adults. Sport Beans target athletes. \\"Unless the FDA begins enforcing its regulations, I fear that we'll see caffeine being added to ever-more improbable drinks and snacks, putting children, unsuspecting pregnant women, and others at risk,\\" CSPI executive director Michael Jacobson said in a statement. \\"How soon before we have caffeinated burgers, burritos or breakfast cereals?\\" A Kraft spokesman said: \\"We have carefully reviewed FDA requirements and believe our product is in compliance with current regulations for food ingredients. FDA is currently evaluating caffeine and has explained that they do not object to caffeine use in other beverages beyond colas. The caffeine level in our product is comparable to what is naturally found in coffee and tea.\\" ||||| Who needs coffee in the morning when you can wake up with caffeinated Cracker Jacks? It's no joke: PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is rolling out a new line extension appropriately called \\"Cracker Jack'd\\" that will include a caffeinated variety called Power Bites. One serving, according to its packaging, packs the same amount of caffeine as a single cup of coffee. As one might imagine, the product is raising a few eyebrows. The Center for Science in the Public Interest, a food activist group, says on its website that it believes Power Bites violates FDA regulations and urges government regulators to take action: \\"Unless the FDA begins enforcing its regulations, I fear that we'll see caffeine being added to ever-more improbable drinks and snacks, putting children, unsuspecting pregnant women, and others at risk,\\" said CSPI executive director Michael F. Jacobson. \\"How soon before we have caffeinated burgers, burritos, or breakfast cereals?\\" Ad Age spoke with a Frito-Lay spokesman, who said that Power Bites will feature \\"two flavors that will contain coffee, a natural source of caffeine, as an ingredient.\\" The product is still in development, he said, but it's expected to contain about 70 mg of caffeine in each 2 oz. package. He also stressed that Power Bites are perfectly safe, and that it will be marketed at adult consumers, not children. Still, one has to question the clearness of that message. After all, the original Cracker Jacks, which contain small toys hidden within, are traditionally considered children's snacks. It's easy to see how a child -- or a parent, for that matter -- could be easily confused. The Power Bites packaging even features the brand's iconic mascots, Sailor Jack and his dog, Bingo. It's unclear when Cracker Jack'd products will be hitting shelves, but online candy distributor Nationwide Candy is already taking pre-orders online. According to the site, the first shipments will be made after December 22. Six bags of 2 oz. packages of \\"Cracker Jack'D Power Bites Cocoa Java\\" are being sold 11.22. Fears over excessive levels of caffeine in some products have hit full tilt in recent months. On Wednesday, the FDA confirmed that caffeine supplement 5-Hour Energy may have been a contributing factor in the deaths of 13 people over the last four years. Last December, a 14-year-old girl died of \\"cardiac arrythmia due to caffeine toxicity\\" after consuming two 24-ounce cans of Monster Energy Drink in one day. Her mother later discovered that the drink had been tied to five other deaths in past years. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"PepsiCo's Frito-Lay is creating a new version of Cracker Jacks called \\"Cracker Jack 'd.\\" This new version will have a caffeinated variety named Power Bites.

In March 1991, the band signed to Victory Music, a new label launched by JVC and distributed worldwide by London Records and Polygram, and recorded more new material. This was combined with tracks from the Sydney sessions to form the Tin Machine II album. The album was described as \\"just as impure and twisted [as their first album], but more R&B and less abrasive.\\" Gabrels explained the change between the first and second album was because by the second album, \\"we knew one another as musicians. ... It wasn't as dense. And we actually left more room, I think for David to come up with some interesting melodies. There was more room for vocals on this record.\\" In late 1991 Bowie reiterated that he was still happy being in the band during that time, stating \\"I'm content. ... I'm deriving a great deal of fulfillment from working with Tin Machine\\", and band-mate Gabrels agreed, saying \\"we're doing exactly what we wanted to do.\\" During press performances for songs on the album, Gabrels played his guitar with a vibrator and for a performance on BBC's \\"Top of the Pops\\", who banned the use of the vibrator, he mimed playing his guitar with a chocolate eclair.

Cooper claims that the character Aibeleen, a middle-aged black nanny with a gold tooth and a deceased son, is based on her life, and she finds the portrayal humiliating. The case gains more interest as Ablene Cooper is currently employed by Stockett's brother, who supports Cooper's claims. To understand the similarities between Cooper and Aibeleen, one must break down their shared characteristics. Both are middle-aged black nannies with gold teeth and have experienced the tragic loss of their sons before they began working for their respective employers. Cooper claims that these similarities are not a coincidence and that Stockett has used her identity in crafting the character Aibeleen. \\"Ain’t too many Ablenes,\\" said Cooper. In the lawsuit, Cooper is seeking 75,000 in damages from Stockett, for the alleged unauthorized use of her name and likeness. It is worth noting that the lawsuit does not request punitive damages or attorneys’ fees. Cooper’s lawyer stated that the author ignored Cooper's request to refrain from using her name or likeness, despite knowing that doing so would be \\"emotionally upsetting and highly offensive to Ablene.\\" The Help, which is set during the early 1960s in Jackson, Mississippi, has been adapted into a movie slated for release this summer.

A:","completion":"Phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are three types of endocytosis, a subcategory of cellular transportation. Endocytosis is a cellular process by which substances are brought into a cell. These substances can include nutrients the cell needs to survive or foreign bodies, such as viruses or bacteria, that are harmful and need to be neutralized. The substances are engulfed by the cell membrane, creating a vesicle and are transported into the cell. 1. Phagocytosis: It involves the ingestion of solid particles, such as bacteria, dead cells, or bits of matter. The term \\"phagocytosis\\" comes from the Greek words \\"phagein,\\" which means to eat and \\"kytos,\\" meaning cell. When phagocytosis occurs, the cell changes shape by extending pseudopodia (cellular 'arms') to surround the material and then packages it into a food vacuole. The vacuole fuses with a lysosome, an organelle containing digestive enzymes, which destroys the material. 2. Pinocytosis: This is also commonly referred to as \\"cell drinking.\\" In pinocytosis, the cell ingests extracellular fluid and its dissolved solutes. The cell membrane invaginates, forming a small pocket filled with extracellular fluid. The pocket pinches off, resulting in the formation of an intracellular vesicle. 3. Receptor-Mediated Endocytosis: This is a more specialised process and allows cells to take in bulk quantities of specific substances, even when these substances may not be very concentrated in the extracellular fluid. The substances first bind to specific receptors on the cell surface before being engulfed. This process is highly specific as it uses receptors to attract and bind to specific substances. Each mode offers a specific way to take in extracellular substances, depending on the given circumstances. They are crucial for the survival of a cell as it enables the cell to interact with its environment in a controlled manner. Importantly, these are not mutually exclusive categories but rather reflect different techniques cells have to manage their internal environments. Endocytosis is a complex process that involves carefully controlled reshaping of the cell membrane."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Here's a new warning from health experts: sitting is deadly. Scientists are increasingly warning that sitting for long periods, even if you exercise regularly, could be bad for your health. And it doesn't matter where the sitting takes place--in the office, at school, in the car or before a computer or TV. Just the overall number of hours it takes matters. Several studies suggest people who spend most of their days sitting are more likely to be fat, have a heart attack or even die. While health officials have issued guidelines advising on the least amounts of physical activities, they haven't suggested people try to limit how much time they spend in a seated position. \\"After four hours of sitting, the body starts to send harmful signals,\\" said Ekblom-Bak of the Swedish School of Sport and Health Sciences. She explained that genes controlling the amount of glucose and fat in the body start to shut down. Even for people who exercise, spending long periods of time sitting at a desk is still harmful. Tim Armstrong, a physical activity expert at the World Health Organization, said people who exercise every day but still spend a lot of time sitting might get more benefits if that exercise were spread across the day, rather than in a single hour. Still in a study that tracked more than 17,000 Canadians for about a dozen years, researchers found people who sat more had a higher death risk, whether they exercised or not. Experts said more research is needed to figure out just how much sitting is dangerous, and what might be possible to _ those effects. People should keep exercising because that has a lot of benefits,\\" Ekblom-Bak said. \\"And when they're in the office, they should try to interrupt sitting as often as possible.\\" Which of the following might be the best title for the passage? A) More and More People Sit Too Much B) Side Effects of Sitting Too Much C) Don't Sit Too Much While Working D) Sitting Too Much Could Be Dangerous The answer is:","completion":"D) Sitting Too Much Could Be Dangerous"},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

The original sentence says \\"Мануэль ведет собрание в молитве\\" which translates to \\"Manuel leads the meeting in prayer.\\" Step 2: Identify a suitable word or phrase to change. I decide to change the verb \\"ведет\\" (leads) to another verb that still reflects the idea of Manuel's involvement in the meeting. Step 3: Choose a new verb and consider the necessary syntax changes. I choose the verb \\"начинает\\" (begins) as it is semantically related and conveys the similar idea that Manuel is initiating the meeting. This change requires me to change the preposition \\"в\\" (in) to \\"с\\" (with) and use the noun \\"молитвы\\" (prayer) in Genitive case. Step 4: Construct the new sentence with the changes. I then construct the new sentence: \\"Мануэль начинает собрание с молитвы\\" which translates to \\"Manuel begins the meeting with a prayer.\\" The generated sentence has high commonsense plausibility, as it is reasonable to believe that a meeting can begin with a prayer.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground","completion":"In the sentence \\"Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground,\\" the most important words associated with conveying meaning and understanding are \\"giraffes,\\" \\"leaning,\\" \\"low,\\" \\"eat,\\" and \\"ground.\\" 1. \\"Giraffes\\" – This word is crucial because it identifies the subject of the sentence. It tells us which animal we are discussing, and as the sentence's primary focus, knowing that it is about giraffes establishes the context for understanding the rest of the sentence. 2. \\"Leaning\\" – This verb defines the action or movement the giraffes are performing. Without this word, we would not know what they are doing. \\"Leaning\\" implies that the giraffes are bending or tilting their bodies or heads in a certain direction, which helps paint a mental image of the scene. 3. \\"Low\\" – This adjective describes the extent or manner of the leaning action. Without \\"low,\\" we would not have a clear idea of how these giraffes are leaning. We might wonder if they were leaning just a little or much more. By specifying that they are leaning low, this word adds depth to the mental imagery of the scene, helping us picture the giraffes in this specific posture. 4. \\"Eat\\" – This word reveals the purpose or reason for the giraffes' leaning action. It is essential for understanding the context and intention behind their movement. By knowing they are eating, we get a complete picture of the scene—giraffes bending low to consume something. Without \\"eat,\\" the sentence would not have a clear purpose. 5. \\"Ground\\" – This word denotes the location or source from which the giraffes are eating. It is essential for understanding the scene because it clarifies what the giraffes are eating from and why they need to lean low. Without the mention of \\"ground,\\" we could be left wondering if the giraffes were eating from a tree or another source. Knowing they are eating from the ground helps create a precise mental image and understanding of the action taking place. In conclusion, the words \\"giraffes,\\" \\"leaning,\\" \\"low,\\" \\"eat,\\" and \\"ground\\" are the most important words in the sentence \\"Giraffes leaning low to eat from the ground.\\" Each of these words plays a significant role in developing the primary context, action, purpose, extent, and location of the sentence, providing a clear and detailed understanding of the situation being described."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Clinton Foundation include amounts of 10 million to 25 million from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation and real estate mogul Stephen Bing, a personal friend of Clinton's. The Clintons came under intense pressure during Hillary Clinton's campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination to release the names of donors to both the foundation and to the Clinton presidential library in Arkansas. Bill Clinton agreed to the release the list after President-elect Barack Obama nominated Hillary Clinton to become secretary of state. The governments of Kuwait and Qatar are also on the list, as is Saudi businessman Nasser Al-Rashid, who has close ties to the Saudi royal family. Saudi Sheikh Mohammed H. Al-Amoudi, reputed to be one of the richest men in the world, is among the donors as well. Both Saudis contributed in the 1 million to 5 million range. A group called Friends of Saudi Arabia and the Dubai Foundation appear in the same category. Indian businessman Lakshmi Mittal also donated between 1 million and 5 million, as did the Elton John AIDS Foundation, the Princess Diana Memorial Fund and the Open Society Institute, which George Soros founded. Israeli-born television mogul Haim Saban, owner of the Spanish-language TV station Univision, donated between 5 million and 10 million personally or through his foundation. The two biggest donors are UNITAID, a new international organization that purchases drugs for the world's poorest people, and the Children's Investment Fund Foundation, both of which donated more than 25 million. Clinton donated between 500,000 and 1 million personally or through his family foundation, which is separate from the William J. Clinton Foundation.

WIN further claimed that YouTube would block all music content from labels that did not agree to be included in the paid service. In response to these accusations, Robert Kyncl, YouTube's Chief Business Officer, confirmed in a June 2014 statement to the Financial Times that YouTube would indeed block the content of labels who did not negotiate deals to be included in the paid service. Kyncl justified this decision by stating that it was necessary to ensure all content on the platform adhered to YouTube's new contractual terms. He also revealed that 90% of labels had already secured deals with YouTube, and while a 100% success rate would be ideal, it was not an achievable goal.

As shoppers meander through the narrow pathways lined with stalls, they are drawn to the variety of products on offer. Artisans peddle their handcrafted wares, eager to showcase the care and skill that has been poured into creating them. Jewelry, clothing, pottery, and home décor are just a few of the items featured, satisfying the diverse tastes and interests of the visitors that peruse the market. The fresh produce section is a crowd favorite. Farmers from the surrounding areas bring their freshest fruits, vegetables, and flowers to sell, attracting health-conscious shoppers aiming to incorporate locally grown ingredients into their meals. Seasonal items are a major highlight and are in high demand; it's not uncommon for lines to form with eager guests waiting to fill their shopping baskets. Street food vendors set up shop throughout the market, serving up hot dishes and sweet treats from their rustic carts. A diverse array of cuisine is available, with mouthwatering aromas drifting through the air and beckoning hungry patrons to indulge in the local delicacies. The tantalizing smells of freshly baked goods, sizzling meats, and aromatic spices intermingle and tempt even those with the strongest of willpower. The ambiance of the market is amplified by the street performers adding an element of culture and entertainment. As visitors traverse the market, the sounds of musicians strumming guitars, singing, or playing other instruments fill the air. Additionally, artists create live paintings, magicians dazzle the crowds with their tricks, and dancers move to the rhythm of their surroundings. These performances captivate visitors, elevating the overall atmosphere of the market and making it more than just a shopping destination. Shoppers are not only drawn to the market to support local businesses but also to engage in a time-honored tradition. The culture and history of the market are deeply ingrained in the local community, and spending Wednesdays shopping amongst friends and family has become a valued custom. Many people look forward to the market each week for both the opportunity to engage in lively conversations with fellow patrons and acquaint themselves with the faces behind the products they purchase. As the day winds down and the sun begins to set, the energy of the market slowly dissipates. Vendors start packing up their stalls, and the sounds of laughter and friendly chatter begin to fade. The once crowded pathways become desolate as the last shoppers make their purchases and leave this enlivened place with their newfound treasures. Once again, the market will transform into a quiet, vacant area on the weekend, but the memories created and the sense of community fostered persist long after the guests have gone home. And as another Wednesday approaches, locals and tourists alike will anticipate the return of the market's vibrancy, eager to bask in its diverse offerings and invigorating atmosphere once more."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The weather started out tranquil. Suddenly the wind began to pick up severely. Anna was caught in a scary sandstorm! What happened next?","completion":"Step 1: Determine the context of the story The story primarily takes place at the beach where Emily and Anna are present. The initial peaceful weather quickly turns frightening as a sandstorm begins. Step 2: Analyze the characters and their situation Emily is mentioned first, so she is likely the main character. Anna, who is mentioned as being caught in the sandstorm, could be a friend or family member. Both Emily and Anna are at risk due to the sudden sandstorm. Step 3: Brainstorm possible outcomes Considering the situation, several outcomes are possible. They include: - Emily could try to rescue Anna - Both characters could find shelter - The sandstorm could pass quickly, allowing them to escape Step 4: Choose an outcome and elaborate on it I will choose the first outcome, where Emily tries to rescue Anna. Step 5: Continue the story As the sandstorm grew stronger, visibility became nearly impossible. Emily could barely see anything around her. However, she knew she had to do something to help Anna. With great determination, Emily started calling out to her friend. Amidst the howling wind, she heard a faint response. Emily followed the sound, shielding her face from the stinging sand with her arm. As she got closer, she noticed Anna's figure grappling with the situation. Risking her safety, Emily fought her way through the storm until she reached Anna. Finding one another gave them both a sense of relief. Together, they linked arms and crouched low to the ground, making their way toward a nearby lifeguard station that could serve as a temporary shelter. Taking one step at a time, Emily and Anna pushed through the relentless wind and sand, getting closer to their goal. Finally, they stumbled into the lifeguard station and took cover, grateful to have made it out of the sandstorm together. The girls stayed huddled together inside the station, waiting for the sandstorm to pass. They shared stories and laughter as their friendship grew stronger, despite the frightening experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Movie title: Onionhead Movie plot: In the spring of 1941, Al Woods quits an Oklahoma college to join the armed forces after a quarrel with his co-ed sweetheart, Jo. He joins the Coast Guard, partly by chance due to the flip of a coin. After boot training, Al is assigned to a buoy tender in Boston, the Periwinkle, as a ship's cook although he has no cooking experience. He encounters immediate hostility from the chief of the galley, Red Wildoe, from new crew mates and cooks' helpers Gutsell and Poznicki, and from his arrogant department head, Lieutenant (junior grade) Higgins. In a Boston bar, Al picks up Stella, who appears to do this kind of thing with some regularity. They develop a strong attraction, but she seems to be holding out for something more.[3] He befriends Gutsell by fixing him up with a girlfriend of Stella's and learns from Wildoe how to be a ship's cook, making a number of embarrassing mistakes. Al, frustrated after Stella won't spend a night in a hotel room with him, stops seeing her, whereupon he and the alcoholic Wildoe get drunk together and bond. Wildoe begins seeing Stella with Al's blessing. Pearl Harbor is attacked and war declared. Wildoe abruptly proposes to Stella and they marry. A free-for-all breaks out at their wedding celebration, with a jealous Al instigating a fight with soldiers who are clearly familiar with Stella already. Wildoe is assigned to another vessel performing convoy duty at sea. During this time, Stella begins seeing other men. Al tries to prevent this on Wildoe's behalf, but can't resist Stella himself. Aboard the Periwinkle, Al becomes the new chief cook. Higgins, promoted to executive officer, is discovered entering lesser amounts than they pay for the cost of officers' meals into the ledger of the ship's mess and pocketing the difference. He purchases substandard food for the crew in order to keep the mess budget from showing a deficit. Higgins also objects to finding Al's hair in his food, so Al shaves his scalp bald, earning the nickname \\"Onionhead.\\" Assuming erroneously that all the officers...","completion":"Based on the provided information about the movie plot and characters, Al Woods' new job title is \\"Chief Cook\\" on the buoy tender named Periwinkle. Throughout the story, we see several interactions and events that lead to Al's growth and development in this role. Initially, not having any cooking experience, he faces opposition from the crew and other cooks on board. But as the story unfolds, Al learns the skills needed for this position and even earns the nickname \\"Onionhead\\" from the officers after shaving his scalp bald. The movie title \\"Onionhead\\" comes directly from Al's nickname in the story, possibly referencing both his bald appearance and his newly acquired cooking skills. The plot revolves around Al Woods' life, his experiences on the ship, and his relationships with both his service colleagues and the women he encounters. Throughout the movie, Al's personal and professional life goes through a series of ups and downs, which eventually lead to his new job title. We see that through his close relationships with other characters, such as Wildoe and Stella, Al gains life experiences and learns valuable lessons. He experiences heartbreak, friendship, professional growth, and even becomes involved in exposing a malpractice by Lieutenant Higgins, thus playing a crucial role in keeping the integrity of the ship's crew. In deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, not only evaluate the plot and content, but also consider the movie's potential target audience, genre, and possible actors for the roles. Primarily, the film appears to cater to an audience interested in drama, period pieces (from the 1940s), and romance, exploring themes such as personal growth, friendship, overcoming adversity, and the reality of life during wartime. Additionally, the movie appears to present a mix of light-hearted and serious moments, which could appeal to audiences looking for a balanced cinematic experience. Another crucial aspect of investing in a film proposal is analyzing the team behind the project - the director, screenwriter, and producers - as well as any attached actors or funding in place. Make sure to research box-office performance and critical reception of similar movies to gauge potential success. Finally, consider your personal affinity for the story and its themes, as this investment could potentially be a matter of personal satisfaction in addition to financial returns. In summary, Al Woods' new job title is \\"Chief Cook\\" in the movie \\"Onionhead.\\" His story, set amid the backdrop of war and interspersed with elements of romance, friendship, and personal growth, seems to cater to audiences interested in drama and period pieces. When evaluating the film proposal, assess target audience, themes, attached talent, potential competitors, among other factors, to make an informed investment decision."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The steak house was unfamiliar to western palettes, from where did the cooking style originate? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - mexico - ocean - japan - texas - new york The answer to this question is:","completion":"Japan. The steakhouse, unfamiliar to Western palettes, most likely follows the cooking style originating from Japan. This Asian country has a unique steak preparation technique that is different from the traditional steakhouses commonly found in Western countries. Japanese-style steakhouses, most notably teppanyaki-style restaurants, are well-known for their distinctive method of preparing steaks. The concept of teppanyaki was introduced after World War II as Western-style dishes became more popular in Japan. The term “teppanyaki” refers to the method of cooking using an iron griddle, called a 'teppan.' Foods such as steak, shrimp, chicken and various vegetables are cooked on the griddle, and the experience often includes the theatrical flair of the chef's knife and spatula skills, becoming part of the dining entertainment. The preparation of steak in these types of Japanese restaurants is distinct. Typically, the steaks are seasoned with salt and pepper, seared on the hot griddle, then sliced into bite-sized pieces and served with a variety of sauces. Often, the highlight of this cooking style is Kobe beef or Wagyu steak, which is globally renowned for its extreme tenderness and fatty, well-marbled texture. In addition, the Japanese also place a substantial emphasis on the quality of ingredients used, the presentation of the dish, and the overall eating experience. Incorporating elements of the traditional Japanese 'omotenashi' hospitality, these steakhouses often offer an intimate, high-quality dining experience. So, while Mexican, Texan, and New York styles have had their influences on steakhouse culture, if the steakhouse is of an uncommon, distinctive style to Western palettes, it is likely to be of Japanese origin."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: How many inches tall is Monument 10?

Problem:Question: How many troops died in the battle that ended the Byzantine-Bulgarian wars with a great Bulgarian victory? Passage:With the ascendance of Simeon I to the throne in 893, the long-lasting peace with the Byzantine Empire established by his father was about to end. A conflict arose when Byzantine Emperor Leo VI the Wise, acting under pressure from his wife Zoe Zaoutzaina and her father, Stylianos Zaoutzes, moved the marketplace for Bulgarian goods from Constantinople to Thessaloniki, where Bulgarian merchants were heavily taxed. Forced to take action, in the autumn of 894 Simeon invaded the Byzantine Empire from the north, meeting little opposition due to the concentration of most Byzantine forces in eastern Anatolia to counter Arab invasions. Informed of the Bulgarian offensive, the surprised Leo sent an army consisting of guardsmen and other military units from the capital to halt Simeon, but his troops were routed somewhere in the theme of Macedonia.The Magyars managed to defeat Simeon's army twice, but in 896 they were routed in the Battle of Southern Buh. The war ended in 896 with a great Bulgarian victory near Bulgarophygon in Eastern Thrace. The market was returned to Constantinople, and the Byzantine Emperor had to pay annual tribute to Bulgaria.

In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

Created by British composer and lyricist Richard Thomas, along with comedian and writer Stewart Lee, Jerry Springer: The Opera is known for its profanity, irreverent treatment of Judeo-Christian themes, and surreal images, such as tap-dancing Ku Klux Klan members. The musical premiered at the National Theatre in London in April 2003 and soon transferred to the Cambridge Theatre in the West End in October 2003. It ran for a total of 609 performances through February 2005 and was met with both critical acclaim and controversy. The show's provocative content drew protests from religious groups, while critics praised its innovative approach and biting satire. Jerry Springer: The Opera received numerous awards and nominations, ultimately winning four Laurence Olivier Awards in 2004, including Best New Musical, Best Actor in a Musical (David Soul), Best Performance in a Supporting Role in a Musical (Leigh Zimmerman), and Best Sound Design.

While I agree that Pressfield's Gates of Fire depicted the battle scenes with better detail and gripping vision, Nicastro impressed me with his depictions of the Rearing, the period of brutal training for boys beginning at the age of seven, and with the other scenes of Spartan life.At the end of the novel, when the Spartans had surrendered and been led away in captivity, this book broke my heart at the depiction of how some of the soldiers' family members were treated back home. While there is much to be admired in the Spartan's culture, there is much to be loathed as well.

Question: A miniature gumball machine contains 4 blue, 4 green, and 2 red gumballs, which are identical except for their colors. If the machine dispenses three gumballs at random, what is the probability that it dispenses one gumball of each color? Option A: 2/15 Option B: 4/15 Option C: 5/30 Option D: 7/30 Option E: 11/60","completion":"To solve this problem, we will use the concepts of probability and combinatorics. We need to find the probability of the event that the machine dispenses one gumball of each color (blue, green, and red). Step 1: Total Gumballs There are a total of 4 blue + 4 green + 2 red = 10 gumballs in the machine. Step 2: Combinations Let's now compute the number of ways we can pick the 3 gumballs, which is a combination since the order doesn't matter. The total number of ways to pick 3 gumballs from 10 is given by the combination formula: C(n, r) = n! / (r!(n-r)!) = C(10, 3). Step 3: Calculate C(10, 3) Using the formula above, we find that C(10, 3) = 10! / (3! * (10-3)!) = 10! / (3! * 7!) = (10 * 9 * 8) / (3 * 2 * 1) = 120. Step 4: Desired Combinations We want to find the probability of getting one gumball of each color (blue, green, and red). To find this, we compute the number of ways to pick one blue, one green, and one red gumball: C(4, 1) * C(4, 1) * C(2, 1) = (4 * 4 * 2) = 32 possible combinations to get one gumball of each color. Step 5: Probability Now, we can find the probability of the event \\"dispenses one gumball of each color\\" by dividing the desired combinations (32) by the total number of ways to pick 3 gumballs from 10 (120). Probability = Desired Combinations / Total Combinations = 32 / 120 = 8 / 30 = 4 / 15. Therefore, the probability of the machine dispensing one gumball of each color is 4/15, which is Option B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our group all agreed that we should take advantage of the nice weather and head to the old city walls and St. Lawrence Fort (Lovrijenac). We spent several hours walking the walls and climbing up and down stairs. The sun sparkled off the Adriatic Sea and cast a warm glow on the orange and red tiled roofs in old city. It was such a change from the gray and foggy gloom of the last couple of days and it created a completely different mood, at least for me. From foreboding and dark to welcoming and bright.

The bulk of the larger states, and some groups of small states, were integrated through a different, four-step process. The first step in this process was to convince groups of large states to combine to form a \\"princely union\\" through the execution by their rulers of Covenants of Merger. Under the Covenants of Merger, all rulers lost their ruling powers, save one who became the Rajpramukh of the new union. The other rulers were associated with two bodies—the council of rulers, whose members were the rulers of salute states, and a presidium, one or more of whose members were elected by the rulers of non-salute states, with the rest elected by the council. The Rajpramukh and his deputy Uprajpramukh were chosen by the council from among the members of the presidium. The Covenants made provision for the creation of a constituent assembly for the new union which would be charged with framing its constitution. In return for agreeing to the extinction of their states as discrete entities, the rulers were given a privy purse and guarantees similar to those provided under the Merger Agreements.Through this process, Patel obtained the unification of 222 states in the Kathiawar peninsula of his native Gujarat into the princely union of Saurashtra in January 1948, with six more states joining the union the following year. Madhya Bharat emerged on 28 May 1948 from a union of Gwalior, Indore and eighteen smaller states. In Punjab, the Patiala and East Punjab States Union was formed on 15 July 1948 from Patiala, Kapurthala, Jind, Nabha, Faridkot, Malerkotla, Nalargarh, and Kalsia. The United State of Rajasthan was formed as the result of a series of mergers, the last of which was completed on 15 May 1949.

He published his first song when he was eighteen years old. During the next twenty years he wrote more than five hundred songs. Many of Gershwin's songs were first written for musical plays performed in theatres in New York City. These plays were a popular form of entertainment in the 1920s and 1930s. Many of his songs have remained popular as ever. Over the years they have been sung and played in every possible way -- from jazz to country. In the 1920s there was a debate in the United States about jazz music. Could jazz, some people asked, be considered serious music? In 1924 jazz musician and orchestra leader Paul Whiteman decided to organize a special concert to show that jazz was serious music. Gershwin agreed to compose something for the concert before he realized he had just a few weeks to do it. And in that short time, he composed a piece for piano and orchestra which he called Rhapsody in Blue. Gershwin himself played the piano at the concert. The audience were thrilled when they heard his music. It made him world-famous and showed that jazz music could be both serious and popular. In 1928, Gershwin went to Paris. He applied to study composition with the well-known musician Nadia Boulanger, but she rejected him. She was afraid that classical study would ruin his jazz-influenced style. While there, Gershwin wrote An American in Paris. When it was first performed, critics were divided over the music. Some called it happy and full of life, to others it was silly and boring. But it quickly became popular in Europe and the United States. It still remains one of his most famous works. George Gershwin died in 1937, just days after doctors learned he had brain cancer. He was only thirty-nine years old. Newspapers all over the world reported his death on their front pages. People mourned the loss of the man and all the music he might have still written.

If the immune system is a defense against harmful particles from entering the body, then the what is a defense against harmful particles from entering the body? Answer choices: - lungs - It remains dormant - A virus - immune system - exoskeleton - pancreas - chickenpox - liver The answer to this question is:","completion":"Immune System. The immune system is the body's primary defense mechanism against harmful particles, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites, and toxins, which can cause infections, diseases, and other health problems. The immune system is a complex network of cells, tissues, organs, and molecules that work together to identify and eliminate foreign invaders while preserving the body's own healthy cells and tissues. There are two main divisions of the immune system: the innate immune system and the adaptive immune system. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense, providing immediate and nonspecific protection against harmful particles. It includes physical barriers, such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as cellular components, such as macrophages and neutrophils, which engulf and destroy pathogens. The innate immune system also produces various antimicrobial substances, like lysozyme and defensins, which help neutralize pathogens. The adaptive immune system, on the other hand, is a more specialized and targeted defense that arises in response to specific infections. It consists of two major components: B cells and T cells. B cells produce and secrete antibodies, which bind to specific antigens (foreign molecules) on the surface of pathogens, marking them for destruction or neutralization. T cells, particularly cytotoxic T cells, directly eliminate infected cells and help coordinate the overall immune response. The adaptive immune system also has the ability to form immunological memory, which allows it to mount a faster and more effective response against repeated infections from the same pathogen. Some of the other answer choices listed may contribute to the overall protection and health of the body, but they are not the primary defense against harmful particles entering the body. For example: - Lungs: The lungs function in respiration and help to filter out some harmful particles from the air we breathe, but their primary function is not immune defense. - Exoskeleton: An exoskeleton is a protective outer covering found in some organisms, like insects and crustaceans, but it is not involved in immune defense in humans. - Pancreas: The pancreas is involved in digestion and regulation of blood sugar levels but does not serve as a defense against harmful particles entering the body. - Liver: The liver plays a role in detoxification and the production of important proteins, but its primary role is not immune defense. Therefore, the immune system is the correct answer as it is the most pivotal and specialized defense mechanism against harmful particles entering the human body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: The government's annual budget outlined a 1% increase in personal income tax and spending cuts of 25bn rand (Â£1.4bn; 2.2bn) over the next two years Projected economic growth for 2015 is 2%, down from 2.5% forecast last year. Finance Minister Nhlanhla Nene warned the economy would suffer from another three years of power disruptions. Economic growth could even halve again down to just 1% this year if power constraints worsened. He said state-owned power group Eskom faced a 200bn rand funding gap up to 2017. Eskom will receive a capital injection of 23bn rand this year, to be raised through the sale of non-strategic government shareholdings in some state-owned companies. Electricity prices will rise to finance Eskom's rebuilding of the country's power infrastructure. Mr Nene said he would also introduce a temporary increase in the electricity levy, to 5.5 cents per kilowatt hour (kWh) from 3.5 cents/kWh. \\"The most important challenges facing the economy are unemployment and the security and reliability of the energy supply,\\" he said. \\"Today's budget is constrained by the need to consolidate our public finances, in the context of slower growth and rising debt.\\" Economic growth in 2014 was 1.5%, dragged down by prolonged labour strikes in the key mining sector as well as energy shortages. Mr Nene called for moderation in wage increases to spur faster growth and create more jobs. The unemployment rate stands close to 25%. Public sector union Nehawu is in talks relating to demands for pay increases way above inflation. The Treasury forecasts inflation will be 4.3% in 2015, and rise to 5.6% in 2016. The budget also included spending cuts of 25bn rand over the next two years, while maintaining core social and economic programmes. Some analysts have called his plans a \\"Robin Hood\\" budget, because of the tax increases for the rich, in a country were welfare recipients outnumber tax payers. But Mr Nene admitted himself he had little scope for what he described as a \\"challenging\\" budget to prepare. South Africa's economy has been having a hard time. Last year, industrial action, including a prolonged strike on the country's platinum mines, severely reduced growth. This year, rolling blackouts (better known as load-shedding here) are pushing some small businesses to the brink of bankruptcy. But there was nothing in the budget speech that was new - Mr Nene is not a big one for surprises. What everyone will be watching now is the next few months. Wage negotiations on the country's gold mines are due by the middle of the year, with the accompanying threat of strikes. Meanwhile, unemployment, particularly among young people, remains stubbornly high, despite efforts to reduce it. However, the real test will be how fast the power situation can be solved. Some analysts say while the lights stay on, there's hope. Once they go out, it spells dark times ahead. South Africa's deficit has risen to 3.9% of the economy this year rather than the 3.6% forecast. The ratings agency Moody's has downgraded South Africa's sovereign debt rating in November, following similar downgrades from rival agencies Fitch and Standard & Poor's. Moody's said its decision was based on \\"poor medium-term growth prospects due to structural weaknesses, including ongoing energy shortages as well as rising interest rates\\". Net debt has doubled since the start of the financial crisis as the country increased borrowing to try to repair the economy. Mr Nene said debt was expected to stabilise at less than 45% of GDP in three years' time.","completion":"The South African government's annual budget includes a 1% increase in personal income tax and spending cuts of 25 billion rand over the next two years.

Distraught at being unable to provide for his daughter Emily and policewoman wife Penelope (Natascha McElhone), he is approached by former colleague Gus (Simon Pegg), an aspiring scam artist who presents Charlie with a seemingly snag-free plan to make some cash: blackmail Reverend Smalls, who is listed in the company database of visitors to illegal porn websites. Gus plans on extorting money from Reverend Smalls, with the intention of publicly exposing his secret shame should he refuse to pay. The normally cautious Charlie reluctantly agrees to play a part in the scam, confident that with the money he will garner from the deal he would be able to support his family. A teenage pageant queen Josie McBroom (Alice Eve), Gus's scheming one-night stand, forces herself into the scheme.

Plot title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

Q: Article: A rainforest is an area covered by tall trees with the total high rainfall spreading quite equally through the year and the temperature rarely dipping below l6degC. Rainforests have a great effect on the world environment because they can take in heat from the sun and adjust the climate. Without the forest cover,these areas would reflect more heat into the atmosphere, warming the rest of the world. Losing the rainforests may also influence wind and rainfall patterns,potentially causing certain natural disasters all over the world. In the past hundred years,humans have begun destroying rainforests in search of three major resources : land for crops,wood for paper and other products,land for raising farm animals. This action affects the environment as a whole. For example,a lot of carbon dioxide in the air comes from burning the rainforests. People obviously have a need for the resources we gain from cutting trees but we will suffer much more than we will benefit. There are two main reasons for _ . Firstly,when people cut down trees,generally they can only use the land for a year or two. Secondly,cutting large sections of rainforests may provide a good supply of wood right now,but in the long run it actually reduces the world's wood supply. Rainforests are often called the world's drug store. More than 25% of the medicines we use today come from plants in rainforests. However,fewer than l%of rainforest plants have been examined for their medical value. It is extremely likely that our best chance to cure diseases lies somewhere in the world's shrinking rainforests.

Write an article based on this summary: A new political party leader in New Zealand has reacted angrily to repeated questions about whether she plans to have children. Article:","completion":"Title: New Zealand's Newest Political Party Leader Confronts The Issue of Female Politicians And Motherhood Introduction: The appointment of a new political party leader in New Zealand has been met with significant media attention, particularly in relation to questions around whether she plans to have children. This unexpected and somewhat controversial focus has stirred discussions on the persistent double standards applied to female political figures in relation to motherhood and professional success. The leader's response: The new party leader, whose name and party affiliation are kept confidential at the moment, has expressed her dissatisfaction with the line of questioning raised during her interviews. The questions about her plans to have children have been deemed by many as an unfair inquiry into her personal life and privacy. This invasive line of questioning has struck a chord with female politicians around the globe who have been scrutinized in a similar manner. The new party leader has shared her concerns that the focus on her potential motherhood could divert attention from the important policies she plans to enforce and reform within New Zealand. She argues that her abilities should be judged upon her professional experience and political agenda, rather than whether she has or plans to have children. The double standard issue: This recent line of questioning aimed at the female party leader raises concern about the double standards that persist within the political sphere when it comes to personal matters. Male politicians are often not subjected to such invasive questioning related to their personal lives, which begs the question: why should a woman’s reproductive choices be deemed significant enough to influence her professional capacity? Moreover, it is essential to draw attention to the fact that male politicians who are fathers are rarely questioned about how their duties as a parent will affect their ability to perform in their professional roles. This insinuation that a woman's professional performance might be hindered by her ability to become a mother propagates the deeply ingrained sexism that exists within society. Implication on society and workplace: The example set by the media and public in focusing heavily on female politicians' reproductive choices highlights the struggles that women face not only in politics but also in workplaces and families around the world. It is important to address and challenge such attitudes towards professional women in order to foster a more equitable society. One solution that could help alleviate some of the discrimination might be the normalization of men taking equal responsibility for childcare and household chores. By breaking the traditional mold of gender expectations and roles, a more level playing field can be created for women where such questions are no longer deemed relevant. Conclusion: In conclusion, the angry response of New Zealand’s newest political party leader to questions about her plans to have children is a stark reminder of the double standards that persist within the political sphere. Female politicians continue to be subjected to invasive questions on their personal lives that their male counterparts rarely face. It is crucial to recognize and challenge these biases and to work collectively towards creating more equitable environments for women in politics and the workplace. The responsibility lies not only with the media but also with the wider public in choosing to place focus on policy and experience rather than personal matters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If bacteria enter the skin through a scrape, the area may become red, warm, and painful. These are signs of inflammation. Inflammation is one way the body reacts to infections or injuries. Inflammation is caused by chemicals that are released when skin or other tissues are damaged. The chemicals cause nearby blood vessels to dilate, or expand. This increases blood flow to the damaged area, which makes the area red and slightly warm. The chemicals also attract white blood cells called neutrophils to the wound and cause them to leak out of blood vessels into the damaged tissue.

The translator's role as a bridge for \\"carrying across\\" values between cultures has been discussed at least since Terence, the 2nd-century-BCE Roman adapter of Greek comedies. The translator's role is, however, by no means a passive, mechanical one, and so has also been compared to that of an artist. The main ground seems to be the concept of parallel creation found in critics such as Cicero. Dryden observed that \\"Translation is a type of drawing after life...\\" Comparison of the translator with a musician or actor goes back at least to Samuel Johnson’s remark about Alexander Pope playing Homer on a flageolet, while Homer himself used a bassoon. If it is possible to answer this question, answer it for me (else, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Where was the concept of parallel creation lost?","completion":"The concept of parallel creation in translation has not been truly \\"lost\\" but has rather evolved over time, adapting to cultural, social, and technological changes. This evolution has diversified the translator's role and highlighted the artistic and interpretative aspects instead of merely considering them as passive and mechanical. In many ways, the concept of parallel creation remains integral to the art of translation, as it acknowledges the creative input and decisions that translators must make to convey meaning across different languages and cultures. It is important to consider that translation is not a mere word-for-word transposition from one language to another but rather an act of interpretation, adaptation, and sometimes even recreation. The evolution of the translator's role, from the time of Terence and continuing through the works of Cicero, Dryden, and Johnson, has put more emphasis on the importance of equivalence, transfer of cultural nuances, idiomatic expressions, and various aspects of language that need to be considered when translating a text. With the rise of translation studies as an academic discipline in the 20th century, the intricacies of translation have come under more scrutiny. Additionally, contemporary translation theories have expanded upon the idea of parallel creation, recognizing that translation can involve varying degrees of recreation, adaptation, and cultural transplantation. The branches of translation theory such as dynamic equivalence, Skopos theory, and cultural translation have reinforced the importance of a translator's role as more than just a mechanical conveyer of meaning. Each approach emphasizes different aspects of the translation process, acknowledging that translators must sometimes be creative and adaptive in order to faithfully reproduce the intended message and impact of source material. In recent years, the growing interest in postcolonial studies and cultural studies has expanded discussions on translation in new directions. Translation is now seen as a tool through which values, ideologies, and power dynamics are reshaped and negotiated, further highlighting the active role of translators and revisiting the concept of parallel creation from a more critical and dynamic perspective. In conclusion, the concept of parallel creation in translation has not been entirely lost but has evolved and intertwined with various translation theories and approaches that emphasize the artistic, interpretative, and culturally-sensitive aspects of the translator’s role. As society and culture continue to change and as academic inquiries continue to diversify and expand, parallel creation remains as a valuable concept to understand the multifaceted art of translation."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Chesler was 18 when she fell in love with a handsome older Afghan man who she met when the pair were studying together at Bard college. After dating for two years, Chesler told Adul-Kareem she wanted to travel but her boyfriend insisted they must be married before they could embark on their adventures. And when I finally land on","completion":"Afghan soil, my life takes a drastic turn that I had never anticipated. As soon as we arrive, my then-husband Adul-Kareem's true colors begin to show. He reveals to me that our time in Afghanistan would be far different from what he had initially promised. No longer the progressive Western student, Adul-Kareem embraces his conservative Afghan roots and the patriarchal society, insisting that our wedding celebrations must follow traditional Afghan customs. During the wedding preparations, I am told that I will be required to wear a burqa, a head-to-toe covering garment that I had never worn in my life. Despite my hesitations and protests, I am told it is expected of me as his newlywed wife. As the celebrations unfold, I find myself questioning my decision to marry Adul-Kareem, as the life I had envisioned for myself seems to be fading away. In my new life as an Afghan bride, I am taken to Adul-Kareem's family compound where I meet my mother-in-law for the first time. It soon becomes apparent that I will have very little freedom, as my mother-in-law maintains an oppressive control over the household. She expects me to abide by the strict rules and regulations of Afghan society, insisting that I must learn the local language, wear the traditional heavy attire, and adjust to the role of an obedient, subservient wife. My smooth-talking, liberal husband suddenly morphs into an oppressive dictator, expecting me to adhere to these stringent customs. Over the next five months, I experience immense feelings of isolation, as my world becomes increasingly confined within the walls of my new home. My conversations become limited, as Adul-Kareem discourages me from asking questions or discussing topics that do not align with the conservative beliefs of his family. I spend most of my days with the other women in the harem, who share their own tales of oppression and resilience. We are all prisoners in our own ways, caged by the rigid expectations of Afghan society. As my health begins to deteriorate from the lack of basic necessities, such as clean water, medicine, and proper nutrition, I become desperate to escape. Life in the harem is unbearable, with no end in sight. I decide that I need to find a way to return to America before it's too late. In a stroke of luck, a sympathetic member of Adul-Kareem's family aids my escape and ensures that I am ushered onto a plane back to the United States. Upon my return to America, I am met with relief and disbelief from friends and family. After recounting the traumatic details of my time in Afghanistan, I decide to seek an annulment of my marriage to Adul-Kareem. It is a long and painful process, but ultimately successful. Years later, I write \\"An American Bride in Kabul\\" as a testament to my harrowing experience in Afghanistan and as a warning for others who may be navigating cross-cultural relationships.

Act 1: The movie starts with the protagonist, 16-year-old Alex Thompson, transferring to Jefferson High School and immediately getting a crash course on the social hierarchy from her newfound friends, which includes an introduction to Stacy Lockwood, the school's reigning queen bee. As Alex assimilates into high school life, she witnesses Stacy's manipulative tactics firsthand when Stacy befriends a new student, Holly, only to publicly humiliate her for petty reasons. Despite the common belief that Stacy's life is perfect, Alex learns from Holly that there's more to Stacy Lockwood than meets the eye. Act 2: Determined to uncover Stacy's secret and help Holly, Alex teams up with the school outcasts, known as \\"The Misfits,\\" and devises a plan. They begin watching Stacy closely and notice that she disappears every Wednesday evening after practice with the school's dance team. Their curiosity piqued, they follow Stacy and discover that she has a secret life: She volunteers at a local children's hospital, performing uplifting dance routines for the patients. Stacy has a younger brother who battled leukemia and passed away, inspiring her philanthropy but also contributing to her guarded, tough-girl exterior. Act 3: Empathizing with Stacy's pain, The Misfits become torn: Should they expose her secret to humanize her and teach her a lesson in humility, or should they keep her secret safe lest they compromise her fragile world? During the climactic homecoming weekend, Holly reveals that she's chosen to accept a scholarship at another school. Before leaving, she implores the group not to reveal Stacy's secret. The Misfits heed her wishes and decide to help Stacy grow through a supportive rather than antagonistic approach. Final Scene: Understanding that life is too short for cliques and hatred, Jefferson High School increasingly unites as a community. Stacy gradually lets her true colors show and becomes more open and compassionate toward others, retaining her title as queen bee but now with an emphasis on kindness. Alex, The Misfits, and Holly all reconcile with Stacy, and they all share a heartfelt dance at the homecoming gala.

Hate Speech will contain threatening language towards the community targeted. Offensive language will contain abusive or discriminatory language towards the community targeted. if we ’ re being real tegan became one of the baddest bitches as soon as she popped up in her first scene on the show","completion":"The task is asking you to classify a given tweet into one of three categories: Hate Speech, Offensive, or Normal. Here are the steps to do this: 1. Read and understand the tweet: \\"if we ’ re being real tegan became one of the baddest bitches as soon as she popped up in her first scene on the show\\" 2. Analyze the content of the tweet: - Hate Speech: threatening language towards the community targeted - Offensive: abusive or discriminatory language towards the community targeted - Normal: none of the above 3. Determine which category the tweet belongs to: - In this case, there's no threatening language, so it's not Hate Speech. - The language has some potentially offensive words, but it's not explicitly abusive or targeting a community. Therefore it might be on the border of being Offensive and Normal. - Since the task requires you to clearly choose a category, consider the context of the tweet and decide which category is most appropriate. 4. Once you have decided on the category, provide that as the output. In this example, the tweet could be considered Offensive due to the potentially offensive language used.

Nassau County is a suburban county on the western side of Long Island in the U.S. state of New York. At the 2010 census, the county's population was 1,339,532, estimated to have increased to 1,361,500 in 2016. The county seat is in the Village of Garden City, within the boundaries of the Mineola 11501 zip code. Can we draw the following conclusion? Minneola is within the boundaries of Garden City.","completion":"The information provided does not necessarily lead to the conclusion that \\"Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City.\\" The original text states that \\"the county seat is in the Village of Garden City, within the boundaries of the Mineola 11501 zip code.\\" This statement suggests that the Village of Garden City is located within the geographic region defined by the Mineola 11501 zip code. However, it does not explicitly state or imply that Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City. Mineola and Garden City are both villages in Nassau County, each with their own geographic boundaries. The fact that Garden City is within the Mineola 11501 zip code does not imply that Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City. The 11501 zip code is most likely a larger geographic region that contains both Garden City and parts of Mineola, among other areas. ZIP codes are postal codes used in the United States by the United States Postal Service (USPS). They are often based on administrative boundaries (such as city or county boundaries) but may also cross such boundaries, depending on how the USPS organizes its delivery routes. In this case, the USPS has chosen to designate the 11501 ZIP code as covering an area that includes the Village of Garden City, which is the county seat of Nassau County. This means that mail sent to addresses in the Village of Garden City would be sorted and delivered as part of the route for the Mineola 11501 ZIP code. In conclusion, the statement that \\"Garden City is within the boundaries of the Mineola 11501 zip code\\" simply means that these two villages share the same postal zone for mail delivery. It does not provide information on whether Mineola is within the boundaries of Garden City. This would require additional information about the geographic boundaries of the two villages."},{"prompt":"Q: In this task you will be given a process, and a question.

Here is a news article: \\"If you’re going to play [tackle] football, put it off until the body matures completely, until the body size has caught up with head size, until the muscles are coordinated,\\" McKee said. Cassandra Keck took some comfort in hearing the diagnosis. The man she met and married had been smart, kind and industrious. But then he started to change; his memory deteriorated and he became violent and abusive. Keck had maintained a 3.8 GPA at Harrisonville High in Missouri and was able to keep his grades high in his freshman year at the University of Missouri. That all changed after he transferred to Missouri State University and sustained his second college concussion playing linebacker. Michael took a year off football to recover. When he tried to start working out with the team again, his headaches would flare and his vision would fade to black. Though his vision would return eventually, it was frightening and Keck told his coaches he couldn’t come back. “He couldn’t read his books,\\" Cassandra said. \\"The words would get all scrambled. He’d get angry and punch the book and throw it across the room. He couldn’t read, so he couldn’t study. He felt like he was failing. He just wanted to graduate from college.” About a year before he died, he had to stop working. “Having to be somewhere on time was very stressful,” Cassandra said. “I’d have to put his shoes and socks and hat by the door so he knew where everything was. I’d have to get his shirt and pants ready.” Head hits and later symptoms There still isn’t enough evidence to suggest that youngsters need to give up tackle football, experts told NBC News. It's unknown how many people end up with permanent debilitating symptoms as a result of hits on the field, said David Hovda, a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, who is unaffiliated with the new study. Even if it’s a small percentage, “we still need to do something about it,” Hovda said. “Every person is important. But we have to be cautious about changes that affect everybody.” If the percentage is much larger, say one-third of players, then “we have a real problem that needs to be fixed,\\" Hovda said. Another question is whether head hits among some youngsters can be linked to CTE symptoms later in life. “Certainly we have known that CTE changes in the brain can be found in younger players,\\" said Dr. Julian Bailes, medical director of Pop Warner football, who is unaffiliated with the new study. “But I don’t think that any research, and not the [new] case report, necessarily correlates with football participation at a young age. In my opinion, it is more likely that the exposure that he got in high school or college, or even doing other activities, led to the accrual of CTE changes.” Related: Will Soccer's New Header Rules Make Kids Safer Bailes, clinical professor of neurosurgery at the University of Chicago Pritzker School of Medicine and the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at the NorthShore University HealthSystem reported on the 2009 death of Chris Henry, the only active NFL player to die and have CTE at age 26, with forensic pathologist Dr. Bennet Omalu. Watch: Bengals mourn the death of receiver Chris Henry The hits little kids sustain playing tackle football rarely lead to concussions, Bailes said. “For instance, in Pop Warner football, we think that currently the concussion rate is only 1 percent annually for players, while they are receiving about 100 cranial impacts per season, almost all of low velocity,” he added. “However, high school players hit at high velocity (high g-forces) and at about 600-800/year, and college approximately 1000/year. “ Taught to play through pain For her part, Cassandra hopes that in telling Michael’s story, people will better understand the dangers of concussions. ||||| Also Meets CME requirements for: Accreditation Information The American Medical Association is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education to provide continuing medical education for physicians.

The article highlights experts' concerns that youngsters might develop neurological issues from playing tackle football due to the increased risk of head hits. Some experts argue that tackle football should be postponed until a person's body has fully matured. However, others argue there isn't enough evidence to suggest that young players need to give up tackle football. Michael Keck, the central focus of the article, was diagnosed with CTE after he had started to display cognitive and emotional issues after sustaining concussions playing football. The article mentions Dr. Ann McKee's comments that if a person wants to play tackle football, it should be put off until the body matures completely. David Hovda, a professor of neurosurgery and the director of the Brain Injury Research Center at the University of California, Los Angeles, believes there's still not enough evidence to justify asking young players to give up tackle football.

Question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What singer was going to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman? During a Fitzroy Football Club benefit concert with other Neighbours cast members, Minogue performed \\"I Got You Babe\\" as a duet with actor John Waters, and \\"The Loco-Motion\\" as an encore. She was subsequently signed to a recording contract with Mushroom Records in 1987. Her first single, \\"The Locomotion\\", spent seven weeks at number one on the Australian singles charts and became the country's highest-selling single in the 1980s. She received the ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single. Its success resulted in Minogue travelling to England with Mushroom Records executive Gary Ashley to work with producers Stock, Aitken & Waterman. They knew little of Minogue and had forgotten that she was arriving; as a result, they wrote \\"I Should Be So Lucky\\" while she waited outside the studio. The song reached number one in the United Kingdom, Australia, Germany, Finland, Switzerland, Israel and Hong Kong. Minogue won her second consecutive ARIA Award for the year's highest-selling single, and received a \\"Special Achievement Award\\". Minogue's debut album, Kylie was released in July 1988. The album was a collection of dance-oriented pop tunes and spent more than a year on the UK Albums Chart, including several weeks at number one. The album went gold in the United States, and the single, \\"The Locomotion\\", reached number three on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, and number one on the Canadian Singles Chart. The single \\"Got to Be Certain\\" became her third consecutive number one single on the Australian music charts. Later in the year, she left Neighbours to focus on her music career. Minogue also collaborated with Jason Donovan for the song \\"Especially for You\\", which peaked at number-one in the United Kingdom and in December 2014 sold its one millionth copy in the UK. Minogue was sometimes referred to as \\"the Singing Budgie\\" by her detractors over the coming years.

Given the following context: There are two Campfire Circles which are used extensively during the peak camping season. The Large Campfire Circle has a Maori Gatewat which was presented by the Scouts New Zealand in 1951. The Lime Walk, constructed by previous estate owner Margaret Chinnery, surrounds the Training Ground which was the original main lawn area of the White House. Few of the Lime trees survive to this day. On this path sits the Jim Green Gate, a 1930 tribute to Jim Green, an editor of The Scouter magazine. The Buffalo Lawn is so called because of the replica of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA) Silver Buffalo Award that was presented by the Boy Scouts of America in 1926. This was to honour the Unknown Scout that helped William D. Boyce bring Scouting to the United States. Located there is a signpost with the directions and distances to all the World Scout Jamborees from Gilwell Park. Surrounding the Buffalo Lawn is part of the original balustrade of London Bridge which was re-built in 1820. The sections were moved to Gilwell Park after being purchased at auction in 1826. Considered by many to be the most important Scouting site, The Training Ground is where Wood Badge training was historically held and where the Gilwell oak tree is located. Contrary to popular belief, the Wood Badge beads have never been made of Gilwell Oak. On the Training Ground sits the Gidney Cabin, a memorial to the first Camp Chief, Francis Gidney, in 1929. Across from the Gidney Cabin is the Thurman Memorial, in memory of Camp Chief John Thurman. The caravan trailer, presented to Chief Scout Sir Robert Baden-Powell, along with a new Rolls-Royce car, during the 3rd World Scout Jamboree in 1929 is on display during the summer months. The caravan was nicknamed Eccles. The car, nicknamed Jam Roll, was sold after his death by Olave Baden-Powell in 1945.

Fontaine died \\"very peacefully\\" in her sleep of natural causes, Beutel said. She was in her Carmel, California, home. She is survived by her older sister, actress Olivia de Havilland -- with whom she had not spoken for decades. Fontaine was born Joan de Beauvoir de Havilland in 1916 in Tokyo, Japan, where her British father was a patent lawyer and teacher. She and her sister moved to Saratoga, California, with their mother in 1919 when her parents separated. Fontaine was a teenager when she began her acting career as Joan Burfield in the 1935 film \\"No More Ladies.\\" She later adopted the stage name Fontaine -- the name of her mother's second husband. She wrote in her 1978 autobiography, \\"No Bed of Roses,\\" that her mother, who was an actress, began encouraging the rivalry with her older sister at an early age. The feud extended to their careers when both sisters were nominated for best actress Oscars in 1942. Fontaine, who was nominated for Alfred Hitchcock's \\"Suspicion,\\" beat her sister Olivia de Havilland, who was nominated for \\"Hold Back the Dawn.\\" De Havilland won the first of her two Oscars in 1947 when she was given the best actress award for \\"To Each His Own.\\" De Havilland and Fontaine remain the only sisters who have best-actress Academy Awards. The long-standing feud with de Havilland was at such a peak during one Oscar winners' reunion in 1979 that they had to be seated on opposite ends of the stage. \\"I was shocked and saddened to learn of the passing of my sister, Joan Fontaine ... and I appreciate the many kind expressions of sympathy that we have received,\\" a statement released by Olivia de Havilland to CNN said.

Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about United States presidential election, 1968. Yes or no? Answer: It was a wrenching national experience, conducted during a year of violence that included the assassination of civil rights leader Martin Luther King, Jr. , and subsequent race riots across the nation, the assasination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy , widespread opposition to the Vietnam War across university campuses, and violent confrontations between police and anti-war protesters at the 1968 Democratic National Convention as the Democratic party split again and again. Question: what where the most important factors that led to the defeat of the democrates in 1968? A:","completion":"Yes, the factors you mentioned played significant roles in the defeat of the Democrats in the 1968 United States presidential election. The key factors included: 1. Assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. and subsequent race riots: These events exacerbated racial tensions and further divided the nation. The Democratic Party's support for civil rights legislation and racial equality led some white voters to align themselves with the Republican candidate, Richard Nixon. 2. Assassination of Democratic presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy: This tragic event left the Democratic Party in disarray and without a clear frontrunner, ultimately leading to the nomination of Hubert Humphrey, who was perceived by some as a weaker candidate. 3. Opposition to the Vietnam War: The Johnson administration's handling of the Vietnam War was deeply unpopular, particularly among younger voters. Many Democrats were unhappy with their party's stance on the war and sought change through alternative candidates like Eugene McCarthy or the eventual independent candidate George Wallace. 4. The 1968 Democratic National Convention: The convention was marked by chaos and violence, as anti-war protesters clashed with police outside the event, while factions within the Democratic Party argued over the party's platform. This created a negative image of the party in the public eye. 5. The resurgence of the Republican Party under Richard Nixon: Nixon ran a strong campaign that capitalized on the dissatisfaction with the state of the nation under Democratic leadership. He highlighted law and order and promised to bring an end to the turmoil associated with the Vietnam War and civil unrest. These factors combined led to a fractured Democratic Party, and the ultimate victory of Republican nominee Richard Nixon in the 1968 United States presidential election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Please briefly summarize this news article: In Etan Patz Trial, Closing Arguments Are Expected to Focus on Confession Lawyers will sum up 10 weeks of testimony on Monday in the trial of the former store clerk accused of killing 6-year-old Etan Patz, with each side expected to marshal arguments designed to sway the jury on a simple question: Did the defendant, Pedro Hernandez, tell the truth when he confessed to strangling the boy? Both sides face hurdles. Mr. Hernandez’s lead lawyer, Harvey Fishbein, must persuade jurors that his client has such a weak and troubled mind that he convinced himself under pressure from the police that he committed a murder he did not commit, then calmly repeated a fictional confession to the crime several times. The prosecutor, Joan Illuzzi-Orbon, must not only convince the jury that Mr. Hernandez’s mind is sound and his confessions are reliable, but must also overcome evidence pointing to another possible culprit: Jose A. Ramos, a convicted child molester who for years was the prime suspect in Etan’s disappearance. Etan vanished in 1979 while walking from his parents’ loft on Prince Street in SoHo to a school bus stop two blocks away. His mother, Julie Patz, testified in the murder trial, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan, that her son was last seen heading to a bodega near the bus stop and that he had a dollar in his hand to buy a soda. The disappearance of Etan Patz, a 6-year-old boy, gripped New York City in 1979 and the years that followed. Mr. Hernandez, a high school dropout from New Jersey, worked at the bodega as a stock clerk at the time. In his videotaped statements, he recounts luring Etan into the store’s basement, strangling him, placing his body in a plastic bag and a box, then carrying the box to a subterranean passageway a block away and leaving it there. From the start, prosecutors have acknowledged they have no physical evidence to corroborate Mr. Hernandez’s account. Etan’s body was never found, nor did police find the boy’s clothes or his small blue tote bag, crammed with toy cars and pencils, which Mr. Hernandez said he threw behind a freezer in the basement of the bodega. But a series of prosecution witnesses testified that Mr. Hernandez, 54, of Maple Shade, N.J., made similar admissions to them. Three members of a prayer group, for example, said that during a religious retreat in the summer of 1979, Mr. Hernandez confessed to having killed a child at a bodega in New York. Mr. Hernandez’s ex-wife, Daisy Rivera, said he told her during their courtship in 1982 that he had killed a boy who made a sexual pass at him. A childhood friend, Mark Pike, recalled that Mr. Hernandez once boasted of having murdered a boy who threw a ball at him. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon can be expected to argue that Mr. Hernandez made those statements voluntarily long before the police interviewed him in 2012, countering the defense’s argument that he invented his confessions to investigators under duress. For his part, Mr. Fishbein will most likely stress that the details of each of the stories Mr. Hernandez told more than 30 years ago were slightly different. (He told Mr. Pike, for instance, that he had killed a black child; Etan was white.) Mr. Fishbein could also question the memory and credibility of the prosecution witnesses after so long, and ask why they never told the police what they had heard. He is likely to point to aspects of Mr. Hernandez’s account that do not add up, including: the police’s failure to find Etan’s book bag despite records showing that detectives visited the bodega and presumably searched the basement; how Mr. Hernandez, who weighed 110 pounds, could have carried the body of a 6-year-old boy for a block and a half in a box; and why no witnesses interviewed at the time had seen the boy at either the bodega or bus stop. But the biggest challenge for the defense will most likely be convincing the jury that Mr. Hernandez gave a false confession because he is mentally disabled. A defense psychiatrist, Dr. Michael B. First, testified that Mr. Hernandez has schizotypal personality disorder, and sometimes had difficulty distinguishing reality from fantasy. Dr. First’s testimony was buttressed by Mr. Hernandez’s daughter, Becky Hernandez, who said her father had frequently talked about seeing a lady in white, menacing shadow figures and ancient elders that no one else could see. A psychologist who testified for the defense, Dr. Bruce Frumkin, said Mr. Hernandez’s low intelligence, coupled with his personality disorder, made him extremely vulnerable to confessing to a crime to please the detectives. The prosecution’s psychiatrist, Dr. Michael Welner, disagreed, saying Mr. Hernandez did not have a serious mental illness. Dr. Welner also testified that the defendant had a solid grasp of reality and, despite his low I.Q., was not intellectually disabled. He noted that Mr. Hernandez had little trouble living on his own, working on his car and house or holding menial jobs. He also suggested Mr. Hernandez had exaggerated his symptoms of mental illness to qualify for disability benefits. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon can be relied on to portray Mr. Hernandez as a competent and canny man who, limited intelligence notwithstanding, hid his crime for years and has exaggerated his mental illness since being arrested. She is likely to highlight testimony from friends and employers who said they saw no obvious signs that Mr. Hernandez was delusional or mentally disabled. She can also be expected to cite Mr. Hernandez’s cocaine use in the 1990s and early 2000s as a possible cause of his reported hallucinations. Though Mr. Hernandez has never formally retracted his confession, and did not testify, Mr. Fishbein can point the jury to moments in his interviews with forensic psychiatrists in which he seemed unsure about whether his memories were real. “He’s a terrible historian,” Mr. Fishbein has said more than once during the trial. Beyond raising doubts about Mr. Hernandez’s mental competence, the defense was allowed to present evidence potentially implicating Mr. Ramos in Etan’s death, and Mr. Fishbein will almost certainly argue to jurors that he is the more likely killer. A parade of law enforcement officials testified for the defense, including the former Bronx prosecutor who first linked Mr. Ramos to the Patz family; a senior Federal Bureau of Investigation agent who investigated Mr. Ramos; and a former assistant U.S. attorney, Stuart GraBois, who pursued Mr. Ramos for two decades. Mr. Ramos, a drifter who was convicted of raping two young boys in Pennsylvania, told Mr. GraBois in 1988 that he had picked up a boy he believed was Etan in Washington Square Park the day Etan disappeared. He said he had molested the child in his apartment on East Fourth Street before letting him go. Mr. Fishbein can also be expected to highlight the testimony of Jeffrey Rothschild, a federal informer who testified that Mr. Ramos told him in prison that he had raped Etan. Asked if the boy was dead, Mr. Ramos told Mr. Rothschild, “Of course he’s dead, but there’s no proof and the kidnapping statutes are over,” referring to the statute of limitations. “The jury is going to have to exclude Ramos,” Mr. Fishbein said last week. In terms of Mr. Ramos, the prosecution’s challenge will be to persuade jurors that the evidence against him was never strong enough to warrant a prosecution, much less a conviction. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon will most likely try to hammer away at Mr. Rothschild’s credibility by highlighting that he is a convicted con artist seeking better treatment in prison. Ms. Illuzzi-Orbon will also most likely point out, as she did in her heated cross-examination of Mr. GraBois, that, unlike the man now on trial, Mr. Ramos never confessed to killing Etan in 1988, and later retracted his claim that he had met him.

Two of these (1 and 3) might explain why there are volcanoes at convergent plate boundaries the temperature of the subducting plate increases as it sinks into the hot mantle (1). Sediments lying on top of the subducting plate contain water. As the sediments subduct, the water rises into the overlying mantle material. This lowers the melting temperature of the mantle (3). When the mantle above the subducting plate melts, volcanoes form above it. This leads to volcanoes in an island arc or continental arc. Two brothers Syd and Dan went to college.

She had few glasses wine - then decided throw caution wind make first move . Why did John not reach out to Jennifer first ?","completion":"There could be several reasons why John Mayer did not reach out to Jennifer Aniston first to rekindle their relationship. While we cannot know for certain as we are not privy to their personal lives, we can infer some potential explanations based on common factors that may arise in relationships. Here are a few possibilities: 1. Fear of Rejection: John Mayer might have feared being rejected by Jennifer Aniston if he reached out to her first. In any relationship, the possibility of rejection can be a significant barrier to initiating contact, as it can result in emotional pain and embarrassment. John might not have wanted to put himself in such a vulnerable position. 2. Emotional Healing: Following a breakup, it's natural for both partners to need time to heal emotionally. John may have believed that attempting to rekindle their relationship too soon would have been detrimental to their healing process. By not reaching out to Jennifer first, he might have been trying to prioritize and respect the need for emotional healing for both of them. 3. Uncertainty about Jennifer's Feelings: John might not have been sure about Jennifer's feelings towards him. In such cases, it can be challenging to take the first step towards reconciliation. He may have wanted to wait and gauge Jennifer's emotions and actions before deciding whether or not to reconnect. 4. Believing the Breakup was Final: It's possible that John viewed their breakup as a final decision and could not envision a future together. When individuals believe a relationship has permanently ended, they may be less inclined to reach out and attempt to rekindle a romance, as they believe it would be futile. 5. Pride: In some cases, pride can prevent people from reaching out to an ex-partner, as they may feel the need to \\"save face\\" and avoid appearing desperate. John might have struggled with the idea of being the one to pursue Jennifer in this scenario, as it could potentially make him feel vulnerable or appear weak. 6. Reflecting on Personal Issues: Breakups can often lead to self-reflection and personal growth. John might have taken time to evaluate his life and relationships, perhaps realizing that he needs to work on his own personal issues before trying to rekindle a romance with Jennifer. 7. Changes in Priorities: People's priorities change over time, and John's focus might have shifted from romantic relationships to other aspects of his life, such as his career, family, or friendships. This change could have affected his decision not to initiate contact with Jennifer, as he might have felt that a relationship with her was no longer his primary concern. Ultimately, all of these factors are speculative since we cannot know the exact reasons behind John Mayer's decision not to reach out to Jennifer Aniston first. Personal circumstances, emotions, and individual perspectives greatly influence the complex dynamics of relationships, making it difficult to definitively pinpoint why specific actions are or are not taken."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I really wanted to see a few of the polydactyl cats 3 who live there and sure enough, there are plenty roaming around the place – and by “roaming”, I mean laying around sleeping as cats do. Cats normally have 4 toes on their back feet and 5 on the front but these polydactyl cats mostly have 5 on the back and 6 on the front, thanks to a genetic mutation. Their front paws are noticeably larger and look like they have mittens on. In addition to extra toes, they also have cat condos, complete with shutters on the windows for decorative purposes to match the main house and there are tiny cat houses scattered around the property for shelter and privacy. And if that’s not enough, they have free reign over the main house too and clearly don’t read the signs that say not to sit or lay on the furniture. These cats have a good deal. Hemingway bought this enormous home sitting on prime real estate for a whopping 8,000 back in the early 1930s in the middle of the Great Depression. At 16 feet above sea level, it sits on the second-highest point on the island and was the first house to have indoor plumbing and a swimming pool. Today, it serves as a historical site, tourist attraction, and most ironically, a wedding venue.

Return \\"True\\" if title is proper according to paragraph else \\"False\\". Paragraph: Although promotion of safe hygiene is the single most cost-eff ective means of preventing infectious disease, investment in hygiene is low both in the health and in the water and sanitation sectors. Evidence shows the benefi t of improved hygiene, especially for improved handwashing and safe stool disposal. A growing understanding of what drives hygiene behaviour and creative partnerships are providing fresh approaches to change behaviour. However, some important gaps in our knowledge exist. For example, almost no trials of the eff ectiveness of interventions to improve food hygiene in developing countries are available. We also need to fi gure out how best to make safe hygiene practices matters of daily routine that are sustained by social norms on a mass scale. Full and active involvement of the health sector in getting safe hygiene to all homes, schools, and institutions will bring major gains to public health. Blum D, Feachem RG.

Speak slowly to keep people engaged. Use a softer voice to avoid sounding aggressive. Avoid mumbling to keep your listener from getting confused. Record yourself to practice your changes.","completion":"Title: The Art of Voice Control: Techniques for Enhancing Your Vocal Skills Introduction It's no secret that the voice is a powerful tool in communication. A well-controlled voice can effectively convey your message and keep your audience engaged. Many people, however, are unaware of the techniques they can use to improve their voice control. In this article, we will discuss some simple yet effective tips to help you develop better vocal skills, ensuring that your message is both engaging and effectively communicated. 1. Breathe from the diaphragm Breathing from your diaphragm is the foundation of good voice control. This technique allows you to efficiently use your breath, which in turn provides you with more sustained vocal power. To breathe from your diaphragm, focus on engaging your abdominal muscles and filling your lung capacity without raising your shoulders. Practicing this deep-breathing technique will not only improve your voice quality, but also assist in reducing any feelings of nervousness or anxiety that may be affecting your speech. 2. Vary your vocal pitch Speaking in a monotone voice can be dull and will quickly disengage your audience. To keep their attention, it's essential to vary your vocal pitch. This does not mean you should dramatically fluctuate for no reason, but rather include a natural rise and fall to create vocal variety and make your speech captivating. Changes in pitch can add emphasis, convey emotion and demonstrate authority when used effectively. 3. Speak slowly Speaking too quickly is a common mistake that can alienate listeners and leave them struggling to keep up with your message. To maintain their interest, practice speaking more slowly, clearly, and deliberately. When speaking more slowly, it's crucial to maintain the natural rhythm and cadence of your speech. This allows your listeners to follow your thoughts comfortably and helps you maintain a strong connection with them. 4. Use a softer voice to avoid sounding aggressive While it's important to be confident and assertive, projecting your voice with excessive force can be perceived as aggressive or domineering, which could detract from your message. Instead, practice speaking with a softer voice, which not only sounds more pleasant, but also invites openness and collaboration. Balancing your tone with appropriate volume will help you sound composed and approachable. 5. Avoid mumbling Mumbling makes it difficult for your listeners to understand and follow your thoughts, leading to confusion and disengagement. To avoid this common pitfall, practice enunciating your words clearly and concisely. Focusing on proper diction and pacing will dramatically improve your speech quality and make it easier for your audience to engage with your message. 6. Record yourself to practice your changes One of the most effective ways to identify areas of improvement and monitor your progress is by recording yourself. Listening to recordings of your speech can provide valuable insights into your vocal strengths and weaknesses. Use these recordings to make targeted improvements and adjustments to your vocal techniques. Over time, this self-evaluation will result in a notable enhancement of your voice control. Conclusion Voice control is an invaluable skill in communication, and mastering these techniques can dramatically improve your effectiveness as a speaker. Implementing these tips and practicing regularly will help you develop a compelling, engaging voice that successfully conveys your message and captivates your audience. Don't underestimate the power of a well-controlled voice – it might just be the key to unlocking your full communication potential."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Apple and Samsung have settled their seven-year patent dispute over Apple’s allegations that Samsung copied the iPhone’s design and software, reports CNN. Terms were not available, but according to the Wall Street Journal, the companies filed a notice in California federal court that they had agreed to settle the case. Apple was awarded 539 million in May by a US jury; prior to the award, Samsung had already paid Apple 399 million, so Samsung had an outstanding payment of 140 million, according to Reuters. It was unclear how this week’s ruling would affect that settlement. The battle between the world’s two largest smartphone makers has already cost both companies hundreds of millions in legal fees. In 2012, Samsung was ordered to pay Apple more than 1 billion for iPhone and iPad patent infringement, but that penalty was later reduced to 450 million by a federal judge. Apple declined to comment on the agreement, but an Apple rep referred CNN to a company statement released last month that said, \\"Apple ignited the smartphone revolution with iPhone and it is a fact that Samsung blatantly copied our design.

The exact terms of the settlement remain undisclosed. However, it is known that Apple was awarded 539 million by a US jury in May – prior to this award, Samsung had already paid Apple 399 million, which meant Samsung had an outstanding payment of 140 million, according to Reuters. It is still unclear how the recent ruling will affect that settlement. The lawsuit, which has already cost both companies hundreds of millions in legal fees, began in 2011 when Apple accused Samsung of copying its iPhone design. In spite of the ongoing legal dispute, both companies managed to maintain strong financial results and increased market share throughout the years. In 2012, Samsung was initially ordered to pay Apple over 1 billion for iPhone and iPad patent infringement. However, a federal judge later reduced the penalty to 450 million. Apple has not commented directly on the recent agreement, but referred CNN to a company statement from last month, which emphasized how the iPhone ignited the smartphone revolution and that Samsung \\"blatantly copied\\" Apple's design. Apple views the protection of its innovation and design as a priority. This settlement marks the end of a prolonged legal conflict between two titans of the smartphone industry, both of whom invested a significant amount of resources into the battle.

One evening, after getting drunk at a bar, Mitch and Dave urinate in a park's fountain, and simultaneously wish that they had each other's lives. The next morning, Mitch and Dave realize they have switched bodies. Mitch remembers the wish they made the night before and they drive back to the park, planning to urinate again in the fountain and wish for their original lives back, but find the fountain has been removed for restorations. Forced to wait a few days until the parks department can locate the fountain, Mitch and Dave agree to pretend to be each other for the day. When Mitch arrives at Dave's law firm office, he befriends Dave's attractive assistant, Sabrina McKay. However, Mitch's lack of professionalism and legal knowledge cause a big merger to fall through. Meanwhile, Dave arrives at Mitch's film shoot to discover that it is a lorno (light porno). Tired of pretending to be Mitch, Dave has them go back to his house to tell his wife Jamie the truth, but Jamie does not believe him. Dave gives Mitch advice on how to behave professionally and Mitch sets Dave up on a date with Sabrina, who Mitch has had a crush on. After speaking with his father, Mitch rededicates himself to doing everything Dave's life demands, from taking care of the kids and buying groceries to making decisions at the firm.

Maurice Robert \\"Mike\\" Gravel (; born May 13, 1930) is an American politician who was a Democratic United States Senator from Alaska from 1969 to 1981 and a candidate in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. Born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, by French-Canadian immigrant parents, Gravel served in the U.S. Army in West Germany, and he later graduated from the Columbia University School of General Studies. He moved to Alaska in the late 1950s, becoming a real estate developer and entering politics. He served in the Alaska House of Representatives from 1963 to 1966 and also became Speaker of the Alaska House. Gravel \\"decided to become a pioneer in a faraway place,\\" and moved to pre-statehood Alaska in August 1956, without funds or a job, looking for a place where someone without social or political connections could be a viable candidate for public office. Alaska's voting age of 19, less than most other states' 21, played a role in his decision, as did its newness and cooler climate. Broke when he arrived, he immediately found work in real estate sales until winter arrived. Gravel then was employed as a brakeman for the Alaska Railroad, working the snow-clearing train on the Anchorage-Fairbanks run. Subsequently, he opened a small real estate brokerage in Anchorage (the Territory of Alaska not requiring a license) and saved enough so as not to have to work the railroad again. Gravel joined the Anchorage Unitarian Universalist Fellowship, and continued a sporadic relationship with the movement throughout his life. Gravel married Rita Jeannette Martin, who had been Anchorage's \\"Miss Fur Rendezvous\\" of 1958, on April 29, 1959. They had two children, Martin Anthony Gravel and Lynne Denise Gravel, born c. 1960 and 1962 respectively. Meanwhile, he went to Washington, D.C. in 1957 to campaign for Alaskan statehood via the \\"Tennessee Plan\\": dressed as Paul Revere, he rode with a petition to the steps of the U.S. Capitol. Seeing Alaska as a wide-open place with no political establishment or entrenched interests, and using the slogan \\"Gravel, the Roadbed to Prosperity\\", he ran for the territorial legislature in 1958 but lost. He went on a national speaking tour concerning tax reform in 1959, sponsored by the Jaycees. He ran without avail for the City Council in Anchorage in 1960. During this time, he had become a successful real estate agent; after the 1960 election, he became a property developer in a mobile home park on the outskirts of Anchorage. A partner ran into financial difficulty, however, and the project went into Chapter 11 bankruptcy and Gravel was forced out in 1962.

Q:Question: how many canals in mandibular first molar I found the following answer on Google: The Palmer notation uses a number in conjunction with a symbol designating in which quadrant the tooth is found. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"No, the answer provided does not directly address the question of how many canals are in the mandibular first molar. Instead, it focuses on the Palmer notation system, which is used for identifying the position of a tooth in the mouth. Palmer notation combines a number and a symbol to indicate the location of a tooth in a specific quadrant. For example, the number '1' refers to a central incisor, '2' refers to a lateral incisor, '3' to a canine, '4' to a first premolar, '5' to a second premolar, '6' to a first molar, '7' to a second molar, and '8' to a third molar. Concerning the original question, the mandibular first molar typically has two roots: a mesial root and a distal root. The mesial root usually contains two separate canals, known as the mesiobuccal and mesiolingual canals. The distal root most often contains one canal, referred to as the distal canal. Therefore, the mandibular first molar typically has three root canals in total. However, it is essential to note that variations can occur in the number of canals present within a tooth. In some cases, the first mandibular molar might have an additional canal, known as a middle mesial canal, resulting in four total canals. Consequently, while the standard number of canals in a mandibular first molar is three, the complexity of the root canal system may vary depending on individual anatomical differences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your doctor might suggest taking DHEA, which is considered safe in low doses. Ask your doctor about a dose that is suitable for you. It may differ from person to person. Your doctor will usually prescribe this supplement in the form of a pill. Acne is a common side effect of DHEA. Another option is to take the supplement L-arginine. When taken in high doses it may stimulate your blood vessels, which can cause them to open wider and increase blood flow. Ask your doctor about the appropriate dose. Common side effects include cramps, nausea, and diarrhea. If you take blood pressure medication, ask your doctor about potential negative interactions. Your doctor might recommend trying Panax Ginseng, which has been shown to help treat premature ejaculation. It is only deemed safe for short-term use, so you’ll need to find another option if the issue persists. Ask your doctor about the proper length of time to use this.

Article: It's really important to meet with your potential property appraiser before you enter into any sort of working relationship.This is a way to make sure they have the qualifications you are looking for, but also that you are on the right page as far as expectations go. It is also important to have a level of comfort that will make your working relationship go more smoothly. Things like personality and the vibe of your interactions with them can really help build trust. Make sure they are personable and are willing to answer your questions and explain their process. Their ability to deal with people and communicate smoothly can affect their ability to find out information about the property and thus how accurate their appraisal is. A good appraiser should be able to answer important questions that give insight into their strategies, philosophies and experiences. However, this also means that you will need to know the right questions to ask. Some good questions to ask include: Will you receive a preliminary report? You should require every appraiser to give you a preliminary report so you can ensure the appraiser has access to all the information you consider important. Additionally, it will give you the opportunity to end the appraisal process before a final report is issued if you are not happy with the process. What qualifies you to appraise my specific property? Do you belong to an appraiser society that tests? There are a number of certificates and training programs for appraisers, but only some have standardized teaching and testing methods. If they are part of an organization that requires testing to be accredited, you can be sure that they meet the required expectations. How will you handle issues outside your specialty? There are over 220 areas of specialty knowledge in appraising and no one person can master them all. It is likely that they will come up against issues that they are not fully qualified to understand. Their ability to consult other colleagues and experts can assure that they have the problem solving skills needed to successfully do the job. What will your report look like? You should receive formal and organized documentation of how they came to their conclusions. Ask for examples of their previous work so that you can see how they organize and present their information so you can make sure you understand their work. Once you decide that the appraiser you've met is one that you want to move forward with, you'll want to make sure you know all the details of the working relationship you are about to enter. The fee you'll pay depends on the complexity of the property, type, size, and market. For residential appraisals you can expect to pay anywhere from 250-1000 USD, with averages in the 300-500 USD range. Rental appraisals can cost anywhere from 400-2400 USD and should include documentation of rental history. Commercial properties are more expensive and can range from 1,000-5,000 USD.

Question: What was Napoleon's actual height, in feet and inches? Is \\"Confusion about his height also results from the difference between the French pouce and British inch—2.71 cm and 2.54 cm, respectively.\\" the correct answer? Choices: [1]. yes; [2]. no;","completion":"To find Napoleon's actual height in feet and inches, I will follow these steps: 1. Research credible sources for Napoleon's height. 2. Address the confusion caused by the difference between the French pouce and the British inch. 3. Convert Napoleon's height to feet and inches. Step 1: Research credible sources for Napoleon's height According to the International Napoleonic Society and other sources, Napoleon's height was 5 feet 2 inches in French units, which was equal to 1.69 meters. Step 2: Address the confusion caused by the difference between the French pouce and the British inch The French unit, pouce, is equal to 2.71 cm, while the British unit, inch, is equal to 2.54 cm. Since Napoleon's height was measured in French units (pouces), it is essential to correct for the difference when converting his height to feet and inches. Step 3: Convert Napoleon's height to feet and inches As previously mentioned, Napoleon's height was 5 feet 2 inches in French units. Converting this to centimeters: 5 (French) feet * 12 inches = 62 (French) inches. 62 * 2.71 cm = 167.82 centimeters (approx). Now, to convert this to British feet and inches: 167.82 cm / 2.54 cm = 66.08 inches. 66.08 inches / 12 inches = 5.51 feet. Thus, Napoleon's actual height was approximately 5 feet 6 inches in British units. Considering the steps taken to find Napoleon's actual height, the answer to the question is: [2]. no."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero). - Rome is a city and special \\"comune\\" (named \\"Roma Capitale\\") in Italy. Rome is the capital of Italy and of the Lazio region. With 2,870,336 residents in , it is also the country's largest and most populated \\"comune\\" and fourth-most populous city in the European Union by population within city limits. The Metropolitan City of Rome has a population of 4.3 million residents. The city is located in the central-western portion of the Italian Peninsula, within Lazio (Latium), along the shores of Tiber river. The Vatican City is an independent country geographically located within the city boundaries of Rome, the only existing example of a country within a city: for this reason Rome has been often defined as capital of two states. - Italy, officially the Italian Republic, is a unitary parliamentary republic in Europe. Located in the heart of the Mediterranean Sea, Italy shares open land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia, San Marino and Vatican City. Italy covers an area of and has a largely temperate seasonal climate and Mediterranean climate; due to its shape, it is often referred to in Italy as \\"lo Stivale\\" (the Boot). With 61 million inhabitants, it is the fourth most populous EU member state. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In theoretical physics, quantum field theory (QFT) is the theoretical framework for constructing quantum mechanical models of subatomic particles in particle physics and quasiparticles in condensed matter physics. QFT treats particles as excited states of the underlying physical field, so these are called field quanta. - Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a spontaneous process of symmetry breaking, by which a physical system in a symmetrical state ends up in an asymmetrical state. In particular, it can describe systems where the equations of motion or the Lagrangian obey symmetries, but the lowest-energy vacuum solutions do not exhibit that same symmetry. - The Sapienza University of Rome, (Italian: Sapienza Università di Roma), also called simply Sapienza or the \\"University of Rome\\", is a collegiate research university located in Rome, Italy. Formally known as Università degli Studi di Roma \\"La Sapienza\\", it is the largest European university by enrollments (the third if considering also the distance learning schools) and one of the oldest in history, founded in 1303. The University is also the most prestigious Italian university and also the best ranked in Southern Europe. - In physics, symmetry breaking is a phenomenon in which (infinitesimally) small fluctuations acting on a system crossing a critical point decide the system's fate, by determining which branch of a bifurcation is taken. To an outside observer unaware of the fluctuations (or \\"noise\\"), the choice will appear arbitrary. This process is called symmetry \\"breaking\\", because such transitions usually bring the system from a symmetric but disorderly state into one or more definite states. Symmetry breaking is supposed to play a major role in pattern formation. - In quantum mechanics, an excited state of a system (such as an atom, molecule or nucleus) is any quantum state of the system that has a higher energy than the ground state (that is, more energy than the absolute minimum). Excitation is an elevation in energy level above an arbitrary baseline energy state. In physics there is a specific technical definition for energy level which is often associated with an atom being raised to an excited state. The temperature of a group of particles is indicative of the level of excitation (with the notable exception of systems that exhibit negative temperature). - Southern Europe is the southern region of the European continent. Most definitions of Southern Europe, also known as Mediterranean Europe, include the countries of the Iberian peninsula (Spain and Portugal), the Italian peninsula, Southern France, Greece and Malta. Other definitions sometimes include the Balkan countries of Southeast Europe, which are geographically technically in the southern part of Europe, but which have different historical, political, economic, and cultural backgrounds that commonly places them in the category of Eastern Europe. - Condensed matter physics is a branch of physics that deals with the physical properties of condensed phases of matter, where particles adhere to each other. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by using physical laws. In particular, they include the laws of quantum mechanics, electromagnetism and statistical mechanics. - The Accademia dei Lincei (literally the \\"Academy of the Lynx-Eyed\\", but anglicised as the Lincean Academy) is an Italian science academy, located at the Palazzo Corsini on the Via della Lungara in Rome, Italy. - In physics, quasiparticles and collective excitations (which are closely related) are emergent phenomena that occur when a microscopically complicated system such as a solid behaves \\"as if\\" it contained different weakly interacting particles in free space. For example, as an electron travels through a semiconductor, its motion is disturbed in a complex way by its interactions with all of the other electrons and nuclei; however it \\"approximately\\" behaves like an electron with a \\"different mass\\" (effective mass) traveling unperturbed through free space. This \\"electron\\" with a different mass is called an \\"electron quasiparticle\\". In another example, the aggregate motion of electrons in the valence band of a semiconductor is the same as if the semiconductor instead contained positively charged quasiparticles called holes. Other quasiparticles or collective excitations include phonons (particles derived from the vibrations of atoms in a solid), plasmons (particles derived from plasma oscillations), and many others. - Giovanni Jona - Lasinio ( born 1932 ) , sometimes called Gianni Jona , is an Italian theoretical physicist , best known for his works on quantum field theory and statistical mechanics .

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Bob was exposed to a higher risk of cancer due to his unhealthy lifestyle choices, including a diet with meat and cheese, lack of care for his health, and not protecting himself from potential carcinogens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: Keith is a zoologist. He studies large predators. Last year, he was studying different species of lions. First, he visited the Gir forest in India. There he found the Asiatic Lions. Unfortunately, only few Asiatic Lions are left in the wild, and they have to mate with their close relatives. He then visited the Serengeti reserve in Tanzania. There he found that the African Lions were not forced to mate with close relatives due to their large number. But I can use this background: During sexual reproduction, mating with a close relative (inbreeding) often leads to inbreeding depression. Inbreeding depression is considered to be largely due to expression of deleterious recessive mutations. The effects of inbreeding have been studied in many vertebrate species. What is an answer for this question: Which lion species would be less prone to inbreeding, Asiatic or African? Answer:","completion":"The African lion species would be less prone to inbreeding compared to the Asiatic lion species. This is mainly due to the differences in population sizes and habitat distribution of the two species. Let's explore these factors in more detail to understand how they contribute to the susceptibility of these lion species to inbreeding. 1. Population size: The population size of a species plays a critical role in determining its vulnerability to inbreeding. A larger population size increases the chances of finding genetically diverse mates, thus reducing the risk of inbreeding depression. The African lion (Panthera leo) is more abundant, with an estimated population of 23,000 to 39,000 individuals across Africa. On the other hand, the Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica) has a much smaller population of around 674 individuals (as of the 2020 census) confined to the Gir Forest in India. Consequently, African lions are less susceptible to inbreeding due to their larger population size. 2. Habitat distribution: The distribution of a species across different habitats is another factor influencing its likelihood of inbreeding. African lions have a relatively wider habitat range, spanning across various parts of Africa, including the savannas, grasslands, and forests. This geographic distribution allows for greater genetic diversity within the species as they can potentially mate with individuals from different populations. Contrastingly, the Asiatic lions' habitat is limited to the Gir Forest National Park in India, which restricts their opportunity to interbreed with other populations. This limited habitat range forces them to mate with close relatives, leading to higher chances of inbreeding depression. 3. Conservation efforts: While both African and Asiatic lions face the threat of habitat loss, poaching, and human-wildlife conflict, conservation efforts have been more successful in maintaining stable populations of African lions. In Tanzania's Serengeti National Park, for example, various protection measures, including anti-poaching patrols, have been implemented to ensure the survival of the African lion species. However, the Asiatic lion's highly restricted habitat and urgent need for conservation initiatives make them more prone to inbreeding. To summarize, the African lion species is less prone to inbreeding compared to the Asiatic lion species due to their larger population size, wide habitat distribution, and more successful conservation measures. In order to mitigate the risks of inbreeding depression in the Asiatic lion population, increased conservation efforts, habitat expansion, and even the possibility of translocation to establish new populations should be considered."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And I was wondering What does Aubrey need to do before this? Answer:","completion":"Before sending text messages to remind the group about the meeting this afternoon, Aubrey likely needed to complete the following tasks: 1. Schedule the meeting: Aubrey had to either set up the meeting himself/herself or receive information about the meeting from someone else. This could involve choosing the date, time, location, and purpose of the meeting. 2. Determine the participants: Aubrey needed to decide or receive a list of the people who are expected to attend the meeting. This may include team members, colleagues, managers, or clients. 3. Create a contact list: In order to send text messages, Aubrey needed to have access to the contact information (e.g., phone numbers) of the participants. This could be done by collecting the contact details from previous communications or company records. 4. Draft the message content: Aubrey had to decide on the content of the reminder text messages. This would typically include the meeting's purpose, date, time, location, and any other relevant details or instructions. 5. Set up a texting platform: If Aubrey planned on sending the reminder messages to a large group simultaneously, he/she might have needed to set up a texting platform or use a mass texting service. There are various tools available for this purpose that can send SMS messages to multiple recipients at once. It's important to check the platform's compatibility with local carriers or any restrictions on recipients' locations to ensure proper delivery. 6. Plan when to send the reminders: Aubrey had to decide when the text reminders would be sent out based on the meeting schedule and participants' availability. Ideally, sending reminders should be timed so that they are delivered at a convenient moment for the recipients, while also giving them enough time to prepare for the meeting. Once these steps were completed, Aubrey could send out the text messages reminding the group about the afternoon meeting."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But they become extremely good at something else. They become experts at spotting liars. The condition in which people lose their power to understand or use words due to brain damage are called aphasia . A study conducted in Massachusetts, U.S., has clearly proved that aphasics make good lie detectors . In the last 100 years, many doctors studying the brain have mentioned examples of this amazing power of patients suffering from aphasia. Recently, scientists conducted tests to see if all that was said about aphasics was true. They studied the powers of a mixed group of people. Some were normal; others were aphasic. And it was proved clearly that the normal volunteers still got fooled by words. The aphasics were far ahead of them in recognizing false speech. The results of the study were reported in the magazine Nature. \`Fourteen years ago, famous American doctor, Dr. Oliver Sacks, wrote about his experiences with aphasic patients in a book. He remembered a particular incident in a hospital. Patients from the aphasia room were watching TV. Their president, Ronald Reagan, was giving a speech.

On the contrary, the whole room shook with their laughter. The aphasics knew that he did not mean a word of what he was saying. Dr. Sacks saw aphasics as more gifted than normal people. Normal people \\"get carried away\\" by words. An aphasic cannot understand words. But he or she can still understand what is being said. He said most of the aphasics had this superior understanding.

Possible answers: worn out, bored, outgoing Answer:","completion":"Quinn would likely feel worn out after playing badminton at the park with his friends. The primary reason for this conclusion is that badminton is a physically demanding sport that involves a great deal of running, jumping, and rapid changes of direction. The intensity of the game, coupled with the fact that he was playing alongside his friends, makes it even more likely that Quinn exerted a significant amount of physical effort during the activity. Playing sports with friends can add an element of friendly competition and excitement, which could lead Quinn to push himself a bit harder than he might during a solo workout. As a result, it seems reasonable to assume that the combination of physical exertion and social interaction would leave him feeling worn out and in need of a rest. Moreover, engaging in physical activity results in the release of endorphins, which can cause feelings of pleasure and satisfaction. Even though he might be physically tired, there is also a good chance that Quinn would feel happy and fulfilled after the match. It is less likely that Quinn would feel bored after playing badminton with his friends, as the sport itself requires focus, concentration, and quick-thinking to predict the opponent's next move. Additionally, the social aspect of playing with friends tends to make the experience more enjoyable and less monotonous. If Quinn found the activity boring, it is doubtful he would choose to participate in it with his friends in the first place. Regarding the possibility of Quinn feeling outgoing, we can assume that engaging in a social activity such as badminton with friends might contribute to a more outgoing demeanor. However, this would be more of a contextual characteristic, as an introverted individual may still participate in and enjoy group activities. It could potentially provide Quinn with a sense of camaraderie and shared purpose with his friends. Nevertheless, considering the specific context and circumstances provided, feeling worn out seems to be the more accurate and fitting description of how Quinn would feel after playing badminton at the park with his friends."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Information: - Emperor Hui of Han (210188 BC) was the second emperor of the Han Dynasty in China. He was the second son of the first Han emperor, Han Gaozu and Empress Dowager Lü. He is generally remembered as a weak character dominated by his mother, Empress Dowager Lü, personally kind and generous but unable to escape the impact of her viciousness. He tried to protect Ruyi, Prince Yin of Zhao, his younger half-brother, from being murdered by Empress Dowager Lü, but failed. After that he indulged himself in drinking and women and died at a relatively young age. Empress Dowager Lü installed two of his sons, Liu Gong and Liu Hong (known collectively as Emperors Shao of Han), the sons of the Emperor's concubine(s) after he died without a designated heir. Emperor Hui's wife was Empress Zhang Yan, a niece of his by his sister Princess Yuan of Lu; their marriage was the result of insistence by Empress Dowager Lü and was a childless one. - Lü Zhi (241180 BC), courtesy name Exu, commonly known as Empress Lü and Empress Dowager Lü, or formally Empress Gao of Han, was the empress consort of Emperor Gaozu, the founder and first ruler of the Han Dynasty. They had two known children, Liu Ying (later Emperor Hui of Han) and Princess Yuan of Lu. Lü Zhi was the first woman to assume the title Empress of China. After Emperor Gaozu's death, she was honoured as Empress Dowager and later as Grand Empress Dowager () during the short reigns of Emperor Hui and his successors Liu Gong (Emperor Qianshao) and Liu Hong (Emperor Houshao). - Liu Ruyi ( simplified Chinese : ; traditional Chinese : ; pinyin : Li Rúyì , 208 BC -- 194 BC ) , also known as Prince Yin of Zhao ( , created 198 BC ) was the third son of Emperor Gao of Han and only son of Concubine Qi . In 200 BC , he was made Prince of Dai after Liu Xi was demoted for fleeing his Dai province from Xiongnu forces . In 198 BC , Ruyi replaced Zhang Ao as Prince of Zhao after Ao was falsely accused of conspiring rebellion . After Emperor Gao of Han fallen ill early in 195 BC , he discovered Empress Lü Zhi 's plot to kill Ruyi , and appointed Zhou Chang as prime minister for Zhao province to protect him from Lü . Emperor Gao died later the year and Emperor Hui of Han continued Prince of Zhao 's protection by halting multiple attempts from Empress Dowager Lü on Ruyi 's life . When Emperor Hui left for a winter hunting trip in 194 BC , Empress Dowager Lü had Ruyi killed . - Zhang Yan (died 163 BC), known formally as Empress Xiaohui () was an empress during the Han Dynasty. She was the daughter of Princess Yuan of Lu (the only daughter of Emperor Gao (Liu Bang) and his wife Empress Lü) and her husband Zhang Ao (, son of Zhang Er), the Prince of Zhao and later Marquess of Xuanping.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You will create a three column table in Excel, with the same three headings as above. In cell A1, type in the heading “Value.” In cell B1, enter the heading “Deviation.\\" In cell C1, enter the heading “Deviation squared.” In the first column, you need to type in the values of your measurements. If the set is small, you can simply type them in by hand. If you have a large data set, you may need to copy and paste the data into the column. Excel has a function that will calculate the mean for you. In some vacant cell underneath your data table (it really doesn’t matter what cell you choose), enter the following: =Average(A2:___) Do not actually type a blank space. Fill in that blank with the cell name of your last data point. For example, if you have 100 points of data, you will use the function: =Average(A2:A101) This function includes data from A2 through A101 because the top row contains the headings of the columns. When you press Enter or when you click away to any other cell on the table, the mean of your data values will automatically fill the cell that you just programmed. In the first empty cell in the “Deviation” column, you need to enter a function to calculate the difference between each data point and the mean. To do this, you need to use the cell name where the mean resides. Let’s assume for now that you used cell A104. The function for the error calculation, which you enter into cell B2, will be: =A2-A104. The dollar signs are necessary to make sure that you lock in cell A104 for each calculation. In the third column, you can direct Excel to calculate the square that you need. In cell C2, enter the function =B2^2 After you have entered the functions in the top cell of each column, B2 and C2 respectively, you need to fill in the full table. You could retype the function in every line of the table, but this would take far too long. Use your mouse, highlight cells B2 and C2 together, and without letting go of the mouse button, drag down to the bottom cell of each column. If we are assuming that you have 100 data points in your table, you will drag your mouse down to cells B101 and C101. When you then release the mouse button, the formulas will be copied into all the cells of the table. The table should be automatically populated with the calculated values. Column C of your table contains all the square-error values. The final step is to have Excel calculate the sum of these values. In a cell below the table, probably C102 for this example, enter the function: =Sum(C2:C101) When you click Enter or click away into any other cell of the table, you should have the SSE value for your data.

Shade the monitor area with your hand when typing in your PIN and block others’ view of the screen. Do this even when no one is around. Some thieves use binoculars or install cameras so they can watch you from far away. There typically is a lot of identifying information in your wallet or purse. If stolen, the person can use that information to steal your identity. For your protection and to help prevent identity theft, leave anything at home that you aren't planning on using. Don't keep all your credit cards in your wallet. Keep them in a safe or other secure location in your home, and only take with you the card you're going to use. Write \\"SEE ID\\" in your signature block on the back of the card rather than signing it. You also can secure credit cards by changing them to a PIN-only option, if possible. Avoid carrying blank checks, or any identification other than what you need. For example, you should carry your driver's license if you're driving, but you won't need your passport if you're in your home country. Thieves can access your social security number if you have your social security card in your purse or bag. Consider leaving it stored in a locked storage location and only bring it on trips where it will be needed. Even in relatively safe areas, pickpockets or purse snatchers look for easy opportunities. You can keep what information you are carrying secure by always keeping your wallet or purse close to your person and within your line of sight. Go for a cross-body bag, rather than one you merely dangle from one shoulder. Avoid allowing the bag to hang behind you, as someone could reach in without you even knowing. If you carry a wallet, consider attaching it to your body with a chain or bungee cord. Don't just stick it into your back pocket as someone could easily pull it out. Never leave your wallet or purse unattended, such as at a restaurant or grocery store. If you're out and about, it can be convenient to take advantage of the free public Wi-Fi available at many cafés, libraries, and public parks. However, if these networks are open to all, they come with risks. Even if the network requires a password, you should still consider that network open if the password is available to anyone. Avoid doing any banking or transmitting any sensitive personal information when using these networks. Doing so provides an opportunity for hackers to access whatever information you have stored on your hard drive. Ideally, if you want to get cash with your debit card, you should use an ATM located inside a bank branch – even if you have to go a little out of your way. Private ATM machines, particularly those outdoors, present a tremendous risk. Look for security cameras, and inspect the machine carefully for signs of tampering before you use it. Avoid ATMs located in out-of-the-way places.Stay away from poorly-lit ATMs at night. These not only put you at risk of identity theft, but also put you at risk of being assaulted or mugged. ATM skimming occurs when thieves put a device over top of an ATM card reader that steals the information from the card when you swipe. These skimming devices also can be found on unattended point-of-service card readers, such as those on gas pumps. Look carefully for signs of tampering. Many gas pumps, for example, have a tampering seal. Do not use the card reader if the seal has been broken, and alert store staff immediately. Summary:","completion":"Be cautious of your surroundings when using ATMs or in public spaces, as thieves may be watching you or using technology to obtain your information. Protect your PIN and account balance by blocking the view of screens, and avoid carrying unnecessary personal items that could be used for identity theft. Store credit cards and sensitive documents securely at home and only carry essential identification. Use cross-body bags for better security and avoid leaving belongings unattended. Be cautious when using public Wi-Fi networks, as they pose risks to your personal information. Choose secure, well-lit ATMs, preferably within bank branches, and be vigilant for signs of tampering on card readers to minimize the risk of identity theft and physical harm."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is an article: New homes being built in California. Spending on building houses has helped boost the US economy. Photograph: Ruaridh Stewart/ZUMA Press/Corbis A surge in activity across the US services sector in July fuelled by spending on new homes put the economy on track for a strong second half of 2014, according to a business survey. Businesses recorded growth rates only slightly below the previous month's record as the US continued to rebound from freezing weather in the spring that sent the economy's recovery into reverse. But the Markit purchasing managers' index (PMI) contained warning signs that the 4% annualised GDP growth in the second quarter was unlikely to be maintained after service sector businesses reported a fall in confidence and a slowdown in job creation. Meanwhile analysts also said a fall in service sector activity growth in China last month to a record low would dent confidence in the global economy's growth prospects and its ability to maintain recent rises in output during the second half of this year. Chris Williamson, Markit's chief economist said the summer months could represent a peak in the rate of growth. \\"The surveys indicate that the rate of job creation has waned, as have inflows of new business. Business confidence has also fallen to the lowest since late 2012 as companies have noted greater economic uncertainty and mounting risk aversion.\\" The US economy suffered in the spring after the country was blanketed in freezing snow, closing factories and cutting transport links. The bounce was rapid and revealed all major sectors recovered most of the lost output. Policymakers at the Federal Reserve have hinted at an early rate rise should the momentum continue into the latter half of the year, but appear to be vindicated in their warnings that it is unlikely while the recovery remains bumpy. China, the world's second largest economy, saw its services sector slow sharply in July to its lowest level in nearly nine years. The HSBC/Markit China services PMI fell to 50 in July, the lowest reading since data collection began in November 2005, indicating a recovery in the broader economy is still fragile and may need further government support. A reading above 50 indicates growth while a fall to 50 shows the sector stagnated in July. Services, which account for about 46% of GDP and roughly half of all jobs in the country, have been one of the few bright spots in China's economy this year. Analysts said the sudden signs of weakness raised the question of whether Beijing will need to do more to shore up growth as well as consumer and business confidence. Qu Hongbin, HSBC's chief economist in China, said: \\"The weakness in the headline number likely reflects the impact of the ongoing property slowdown in many cities as property related activity such as agencies and residential services see less business.\\" He added: \\"Today's data points to the need of continued policy support to offset the drag from the property correction and consolidate the economic recovery.\\" China's main stock markets fell on the news. The Shanghai Composite Index ended down 0.2% at 2,220. The CSI300 of the leading Shanghai and Shenzhen A-share listings lost 0.3%. Some economists blamed a slowdown in the housing market for the weak reading, as property-related activities saw less business. China Vanke, the country's biggest residential property developer, lost 2.1% of its value after posting July sales which showed a big drop from June. Poly Real Estate also slid 1.7%. China's manufacturing sector has continued to expand after contracting last year, but with government support that has yet to reach the services sector.

Ed Miliband tried to end Labour’s disastrous ‘elitism’ row yesterday by insisting he admires the working classes. Ukip’s second poll victory over the Tories had been eclipsed by a Labour frontbencher apparently sneering at a white van driver whose modest home is decked with England flags. Mr Miliband bizarrely declared he felt ‘respect’ on seeing a white van and insisted it was right for Emily Thornberry to resign over her tweet. Scroll down for video Laughing in the face of disaster: Ed Miliband grins as he leaves his house in Gospel Oak, North London, yesterday despite claims he was 'furious' after hearing about Miss Thornberry's tweet Effectively what this means is that","completion":"Mr. Miliband was keen to rectify the impression that Labour, as a party, looked down on the working class or was dismissive of their values and lifestyle. The reference to feeling 'respect' on seeing a white van is a nod to the many laborers and tradespeople who use such vehicles for their work. As such, the van is an emblem of the working class – people who work hard, but may not fit into the more polished image often associated with the middle and upper classes. In the context of Emily Thornberry's resignation, it can be inferred that Mr. Miliband was attempting to signal that her tweet was not an accurate reflection of Labour's stance or attitude. By supporting her resignation, he was demonstrating that the party does not condone or support such insensitivity towards the values of the working-class. Ukip's poll victory over the Tories laid bare the growing disaffection among a slice of the population that felt ignored or undervalued by the major political parties. Labour, traditionally the party of the working class, appeared to be losing ground to Ukip among these voters. Being 'furious' over Miss Thornberry's tweet can be viewed as a manifestation of his concern over the potential damage such incidents can do to Labour's relationship with the working class. The scandal reinforced the 'elitism' stereotype the party was battling against - the perception that Labour no longer understood or represented working-class values. In this light, Mr. Miliband's public assertion of admiration for the working class was an essential part of his strategy to reconnect Labour with its traditional voter base. This incidence underscored the need for the party to demonstrate its commitment to the principles of fair representation and equal respect for all layers of society, regardless of class, race, or profession. Leaving his house on Gospel Oak, North London with a grin, perhaps demonstrated his determination to weather this storm, not be bogged down by such setbacks and present an image of resilience that is so needed in political leadership. Meanwhile, it may also have been aimed at diminishing the gravity of the incident in public perception – an attempt to show business as usual despite the controversy clouding his party. In summary, Mr. Miliband’s actions and statements following the debacle aimed to re-establish Labour's reputation as a party that understands, respects, and seeks to represent the interests of the working class, thereby damage controlling the 'elitism' row that threatened to alienate a significant sector of their electorate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: The concept of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) was first reported in 1985. Since then, MALDI MS technologies have been evolving, and successfully used in genome, proteome, metabolome, and clinical diagnostic research. These technologies are highthroughput and sensitive. Emerging evidence has shown that they are not only useful in qualitative and quantitative analyses of proteins, but also of other types of biomolecules, such as DNA, glycans, and metabolites. Recently, parallel fragmentation monitoring (PFM), which is a method comparable to selected reaction monitoring, has been reported. This highlights the potentials of MALDI-TOF/ TOF tandem MS in quantification of metabolites. Here we critically review the applications of the major MALDI MS technologies, including MALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-TOF/TOF MS, SALDI-TOF MS, MALDI-QqQ MS, and SELDI-TOF MS, to the discovery and quantification of disease biomarkers in biological specimens, especially those in plasma/serum specimens. Using SELDI-TOF MS as an example, the presence of systemic bias in biomarker discovery studies employing MALDI-TOF MS and its possible solutions are also discussed in this chapter. The concepts of MALDI, SALDI, SELDI, and PFM are complementary to each other. Theoretically, all these technologies can be combined, leading to the next generation of the MALDI MS technologies. Real applications of MALDI MS technologies in clinical diagnostics should be forthcoming.

Eye strain occurs when the ocular muscles work harder than usual to adjust and focus on an object, like small text, that is difficult for the eyes to process.

Climatologist Michael Mann has sued two organizations that have accused him of improperly manipulating data Michael Mann, an influential climatologist who has spent years in the center of the debate over climate science, has sued two organizations that have accused him of academic fraud and of improperly manipulating data. Mann, director of Pennsylvania State University's Earth System Science Center, on Monday sued the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, along with two of their authors, Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn. The lawsuit, Mann's lawyer said in a statement, was based upon their \\"false and defamatory statements\\" accusing him of academic fraud and comparing him to a convicted child molester, former Penn State assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky. Neither Mann nor his lawyer, John B. Williams of the Washington, D.C.-based law firm Cozen O'Connor, were available for comment Tuesday afternoon. But on Facebook, where news of the lawsuit was initially posted Tuesday, Mann said the lawsuit was part of \\"a battle\\" to assist climate scientists in the fight against those who attack their work. \\"There is a larger context for this latest development,\\" he wrote, \\"namely the onslaught of dishonest and libelous attacks that climate scientists have endured for years by dishonest front groups seeking to discredit the case for concern over climate change.\\" But he faces a high bar: Mann has played a key role in climate science for decades, and the law generally requires a much higher burden of proof from public figures, said CEI general counsel Sam Kazman. \\"I don't think he's got a shot at reaching it,\\" Kazman said in an interview. \\"Our stuff may have been debatable, but it was solidly based and we had a perfect right to say what we did.\\" \\"We plan to defend the suit vigorously but we think it is a totally unfounded lawsuit.\\" In 1999 Mann published a timeline of global temperatures stretching back almost 1,000 years. The graph showed a fairly stable trend until 1900, when temperatures spiked sharply upward. That so-called \\"hockey stick\\" diagram became a lightning rod in the debate on whether humans were influencing the climate. In 2007 he shared the Nobel Peace Prize with former Vice President Al Gore and authors of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report for work connecting human activities to global warming. 500,000 and two years Two years later a cache of emails illegally obtained from University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom purported to show climate scientists manipulating data. Many of the emails were to or from Michael Mann. Upwards of seven organizations, from the National Science Foundation to Penn State, conducted investigations into Mann's work. All declared baseless allegations of academic fraud. Yet the attacks persisted: Virginia Attorney General spent 500,000 and two years unsuccessfully suing to obtain email correspondence from the University of Virginia, where Mann worked from 1999 to 2005. ||||| Michael Mann, a scientist at the centre of the \\"climate wars\\", has sued a rightwing thinktank and a magazine for comparing him to the convicted sex offender and disgraced football coach Jerry Sandusky and accusing him of academic fraud. Mann, a climate scientist at Pennsylvania State University, announced the defamation lawsuit against the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) and the National Review in a posting on his Facebook page on Tuesday. The 37-page complaint arises from blog posts published last July, and accuses National Review and CEI of recycling \\"false and defamatory statements\\" about Mann's research. Mann, the author of the iconic hockey stick graph showing a sharp uptick in global temperatures after 1900, has come under repeated attack from climate contrarians. He has been cleared of academic wrongdoing by seven separate investigations, but the attacks have persisted – culminating in last July's blogs which likened Mann to Sandusky. A post on the CEI blog referred to Mann as \\"the other scandal\\" at Penn State and accused the scientist of \\"molesting data\\" about climate change. The sentences likening Mann to Sandusky were later removed. National Review later picked up the post, although the writer added a minor caveat. \\"Despite their knowledge of the results of these many investigations, the defendants have nevertheless accused Dr Mann of academic fraud and have maliciously attacked his personal reputation with the knowingly false comparison to a child molester. The conduct of the defendants is outrageous, and Dr Mann will be seeking judgement for both compensatory and punitive damages,\\" Mann's Facebook page said. Mann said the lawsuit was part of a larger effort by scientists to push back against the attacks on climate science. Another new front was opened up in that broader fight, with the release of a report by climate contrarians intended to undermine an authoritative US government study on the effects of climate change. The Daily Climate reported that another rightwing thinktank in Washington, the Cato Institute, planned to put out its own version of a landmark US government climate science report – aimed at discrediting mainstream climate science. The Cato report appears almost identical to a 2009 study detailing the effects of climate change on the US. The Cato version, however, was assembled by climate contrarians and concludes that the impacts of climate change would have \\"little national significance\\" in the US. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Michael Mann, a climate scientist, has sued two organizations, the National Review and the Competitive Enterprise Institute, and their authors, Rand Simberg and Mark Steyn, for making false and defamatory statements about him.

San Francisco photographer Helena Price has become an overnight viral sensation among Brazilian Twitter users - and all thanks to her name. Since Monday, Price, 26, has been inundated with thousands of tweets from fans of the new Brazilian soap opera Em Familia, which features a character named Helena. In the series premiere Monday, the troubled Helena nearly drowned, undressed in front of her uncle and fell in love with her cousin. It girl: San Francisco photographer Helena Price, 26, landed on the cover of a Brazilian magazine after she was mistakenly associated with a character from a new soap opera also named Helena. Early adopters of the new show immediately took to Twitter to share their thoughts of Em Familia, and that is how many of them stumbled upon Price’s handle, @Helena, San Francisco Chronicle reported. Price, who is blonde and has Nordic feautres, is not an actress and looks nothing like her fiery brunette namesake on the show, but that did not stop thousands of strangers from tweeting at her. The photographer, a North Carolina native, was initially blindsided by all this unsolicited attention, but quickly embraced it and decided to enjoy her 15 minutes of cyber-fame. To set things straight, the 26-year-old Bay Area resident clarified on her Twitter page exactly who she was, writing: 'Tall, pale, and half-Norwegian. Full-time photographer who occasionally dabbles in tech. Not the actress, DJ, Brazilian soap opera star, or state capital.' But the tweets kept pouring in and Price, who does not speak Portuguese, began responding to the best of her ability. No resemblance: The blonde, part-Norwegian Price looks nothing like either Bruna Marquezine (left), who plays the young Helena, or Julia Lemmertz (right), who portrays the character later in life. Fifteen minutes of fame: Brazilian news media breathlessly wrote about the American woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans. When one soap opera fan wrote to her that in the first episode Helena made a blood pact with her boyfriend (who is also her cousin), and then nearly drowned while swimming, Miss Price wrote a dead-pan response: 'I do not remember this.' Before long, the full-time photographer, who only last year ditched her previous career in Silicon Valley, turned into an Internet phenomenon. 'Omg i think I've become a meme,' a stunned Price shared with her skyrocketing number of followers. In one picture, Price’s head was digitally inserted into the opening credits of Em Familia. In another, the blonde beauty was Photoshopped into an image of a scantily clad Samba dancer. In an email to MailOnline Thursday, Miss Price said she does not expect the hullabaloo over Helena to die down in the near future. 'A few thousand Brazilians have let me know that the show is continuing for the next 8 months or so, so I don't think this will be over anytime soon,' Price wrote. Carrer change: Price worked in Silicon Valley's technology industry until last year, when she quit and reinvented herself as a professional photographer. New opportunity: Price hopes she would be able to travel to Brazil for a photo-shoot. Brazilian news media quickly caught on, breathlessly reporting about the American mystery woman who has won over the hearts of local soap opera fans, many of whom took to Twitter to profess their love for the real-life Helena. ‘I'm officially in Brazilian news for becoming a meme,’ Price wrote two days ago. ‘Life is funny.’ One. user inquired whom Helena would choose as a love interest in the show,. Virgilio or Laerte, while another begged her to pose naked for Brazilian. Playboy. Thereza Chammas gushed: 'Please come to Brazil for Carnival! You are our queen.' The photographer told MailOnline that her friends and family are baffled as to why she is getting all this attention online. 'It is still pretty hard to explain, but we all think it's pretty funny,' she wrote. Born to dance: The blonde beauty had her face digitally inserted into this picture of a Brazilian Samba dancer. Protagonist: With the help of Photoshop, Price made it into the opening credits of Em Familia. Adored: Soap opera fans on Twitter professed their love to Price, and some urged her to visit Brazil, where she has never been. ‘Still getting thousands and thousands and thousands of tweets. Brazil you are funny,’ Price tweeted. The San Francisco woman now boasts more than 21,000 followers on Twitter, many of them Brazilian. She said that she hopes one day to visit the country that has shown her so much love. 'Maybe all of this will translate into some photo work there someday,' Price said.

His family has their name on a building there, Wilder Hall. However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the fun loving school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon (Kurt Fuller). Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall).

The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The trade-off theory of capital structure is the idea that a company chooses how much debt finance and how much equity finance to use by balancing the costs and benefits. The classical version of the hypothesis goes back to Kraus and Litzenberger[1] who considered a balance between the dead-weight costs of bankruptcy and the tax saving benefits of debt. Often agency costs are also included in the balance. This theory is often set up as a competitor theory to the pecking order theory of capital structure. A review of the literature is provided by Frank and Goyal.[2] An important purpose of the theory is to explain the fact that corporations usually are financed partly with debt and partly with equity. It states that there is an advantage to financing with debt, the tax benefits of debt and there is a cost of financing with debt, the costs of financial distress including bankruptcy costs of debt and non-bankruptcy costs (e.g. staff leaving, suppliers demanding disadvantageous payment terms, bondholder/stockholder infighting, etc.). The marginal benefit of further increases in debt declines as debt increases, while the marginal cost increases, so that a firm that is optimizing its overall value will focus on this trade-off when choosing how much debt and equity to use for financing. Company X stopped taking on more debt, and decided to file for bankruptcy, while company Y, kept benefiting from the tax benefits of debt, having a lower debt level. Which company fired more people, company X or company Y? The answer to this question is:","completion":"It is not possible to definitively answer this question without more specific information about the financial situations and decisions of Company X and Company Y. However, based on the information provided, we can make some general observations. Company X has stopped taking on more debt and has decided to file for bankruptcy. This suggests that Company X has reached a point of financial distress, where the costs of taking on more debt outweigh the tax benefits. As a result of filing for bankruptcy, the company may undergo restructuring, cost-cutting measures, or even be liquidated. In these scenarios, it is highly likely that Company X will have to lay off some employees to reduce costs or because the company is no longer able to operate at its previous scale. On the other hand, Company Y continues to benefit from the tax advantages of debt without facing significant financial distress. This indicates that Company Y likely has a lower debt level and a more manageable debt-to-equity ratio. As a result, Company Y may not need to lay off as many employees as Company X, or it may not need to lay off any employees at all, depending on its overall financial health and performance. Although we cannot provide a specific number or percentage in terms of employee layoffs, it is reasonable to assume that Company X, which filed for bankruptcy, would likely have to let go of more employees than Company Y, which continues to experience the benefits of debt financing without extreme financial distress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Techno is a form of electronic dance music that emerged in Detroit, Michigan, in the United States during the mid-to-late 1980s. The first recorded use of the word \\"techno\\" in reference to a specific genre of music was in 1988. Many styles of techno now exist, but Detroit techno is seen as the foundation upon which a number of subgenres have been built. - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Tech house is a subgenre of house music that mixes elements of techno with house. The term \\"tech house\\" developed as a shorthand record store name for a category of electronic dance music that combined musical aspects of techno, such as \\"rugged basslines\\" and \\"steely beats,\\" with the harmonies and grooves of progressive house. The music originally had a clean and minimal production style that was associated with techno from Detroit and the UK. In the mid to late 1990s a scene developed in England around club nights such as The Drop run by Mr.C & Plink Plonk, Heart & Soul, and Wiggle run by Terry Francis and Nathan Coles. Other DJs and artists associated with the sound at that time included Charles Webster, Bushwacka!, Cuartero, Dave Angel, Herbert, Funk D'Void, Ian O'Brien, Derrick Carter, and Stacey Pullen. By the late 90's London nightclub The End, owned by the former Shamen rapper Richard West (Mr C) and Layo Paskin, was considered the home of tech house in the UK. Tech house tracks are typically between 610 minutes in length. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

From 1949 to 1990, it administered the region of Germany that was occupied by Soviet forces at the end of World War IIthe Soviet Occupation Zone of the Potsdam Agreement, bounded on the east by the OderNeisse line. The Soviet zone surrounded West Berlin, but did not include it; as a result, West Berlin remained outside the jurisdiction of the GDR. The German Democratic Republic was established in the Soviet Zone, while the Federal Republic was established in the three western zones. East Germany was a satellite state of the Soviet Union. Soviet occupation authorities began transferring administrative responsibility to German communist leaders in 1948, and the GDR began to function as a state on 7 October 1949. Soviet forces, however, remained in the country throughout the Cold War. Until 1989, the GDR was governed by the Socialist Unity Party (SED), though other parties nominally participated in its alliance organisation, the National Front of Democratic Germany. - Eisenhüttenstadt (literally \\"ironworks city\\" in German) is a town in the Oder-Spree district of the state of Brandenburg, Germany, on the border with Poland.

Today, we're going to have a super fun time learning how to decorate a box all by ourselves. Decorating a box can be a great way to store our treasures or even to give a special gift to someone we care about. So, let's get started and get creative! First, we need to find or make a box that we want to decorate. A box can be a simple cardboard box, like the one our toys came in, or we can use a wooden box from a craft store. We can even reuse an old shoebox! Remember to ask a grown-up for help if we need to make a box or find one that's just perfect for decorating. Next, if our box has a lid, we need to take it off. This will make it easier for us to decorate our box and make it look really pretty. Just put the lid to the side so we don't lose it, because we'll need it later when we're all done decorating! Now, it's time to think about what color we want our box to be. If we want to paint the box as the background, we can use primer or paint. Primer is something that helps the paint stick to the box better, so our beautiful decorations will last a long time. But if we don't want to use paint, that's okay too! It's all about what we like and what makes us happy. To paint our box, we can use any color we want. Maybe we love pink and want a pink box, or maybe we want to use all the colors of the rainbow! Let's pick our favorite color and gently paint our box, making sure to cover all the sides. We should also ask a grown-up for help with this part if we need it. Don't forget to let the paint dry before moving on to the next step. With our box all painted and dry, we can finally start the best part - decorating! There are so many things we can do to make our box unique. We can draw, glue, or stick pictures and stickers on our box to give it a personal touch. We can also use glitter, ribbons, buttons, or any other fun things we find to make our box truly special. When we're finished decorating, all we need to do is put the lid back on our box and show off our amazing creation to our friends and family. They'll surely be impressed by the beautiful box we made all by ourselves! So now that we know how to decorate a box, we can create as many as we want and have lots of fun with our imagination! Remember, the most important part of this whole process is to enjoy ourselves and be proud of the masterpiece we created!

Article: NEW DELHI -- Two Muslim mothers in a northern Indian town have been arrested on accusations they killed their daughters for dishonoring the family by eloping with Hindu men, police said Sunday. Newlyweds Zahida, 19, and Husna, 26, were strangled when they returned home after getting married to men of their choice, said Anil Kumar Kusan, a police officer. Marriages between Hindus and Muslims are not common in India and are frowned upon by both communities, although there are more instances of inter-religious marriages among the educated urban population. Across India, many marriages are still arranged by families. But with the booming economy and more women entering the work force, such traditions are slowly giving way to love marriages. However, centuries-old caste and community barriers still come into play, and there has been a spurt in \\"honor killings\\" in recent years across northern India. Zahida and Husna were neighbors in Baghpat, a town in India's Uttar Pradesh state, when they fell in love with two construction workers. They eloped and got married last week before returning home to make peace with their families, Kusan said. The women belonged to Muslim families and their mothers, both widows, were furious, Kusan said. Initial investigations showed that the mothers helped each other to strangle their daughters. \\"We killed them because they brought shame to our community. How could they elope with Hindus? They deserved to die. We have no remorse,\\" Khatun, one of the mothers, was quoted as saying by the Indian Express newspaper after her arrest Friday. Khatun uses only one name. Earlier this week, India's Supreme Court recommended the death penalty for honor killings, calling the practice barbaric and feudal. Most victims of such killings are young adults who fall in love or marry against their families' wishes. In some cases, village councils order couples killed who marry outside their caste or religion. While there are no official figures, an independent study found around 900 people are killed each year in India for defying their elders. ||||| Zahida and Husna sought police protection but SDM sent them home Two Muslim women in an Uttar Pradesh town, 40 km east of Delhi, allegedly killed their daughters because they had eloped and married migrant Bihari Hindu labourers, police said. The victims had sought police protection after they returned to their homes in Baghpat earlier this week, but the subdivisional magistrate sent them home to reconcile with their mothers. On Wednesday night, Khatun and Subrato, both of whom are widows, allegedly tied their daughters, 19-year-old Zahida and 26-year-old Husna, to cots and threw a rope around their necks. They then held the girls down and tightened the noose until the victims suffocated to death, police said. Khatun and Subrato have been arrested. A third woman called Momina, their neighbour in Baghpat’s Muslim-dominated Mughalpura area, who allegedly helped them commit the murders, is on the run. |||||Summary:","completion":"In a northern Indian town, two Muslim mothers were arrested for allegedly killing their daughters after they eloped with Hindu men and returned home after getting married.

Write some highlights for the following article: Leisure time: Shaun Clemens-Cooney, who was behind a £300,000 cannabis factory in Blackburn. A builder converted a newly-built house into a £300,000 cannabis factory - after council planners told him he could only use it as a 'leisure facility.' Shaun Clemens-Cooney, 43, wanted to build the three-bedroomed detached home at the back of his own £200,000 semi-detached house in Blackburn - but had been refused planning permission three times. Finally, inspectors agreed he could build the property - but only after he promised he would only use the upper floors for 'leisure purposes', including a playroom for a billiard table and another for a model railway. Yet after construction boss Clemens-Cooney finished his project, police received a tip-off about the nature of the property's 'leisure facilities.' During a raid in May last year officers opened the roller shutters of the double garage - and were faced with a plaster board wall behind which they could hear fans whirring away. They then discovered 600 marijuana plant, being grown in 3,000 pots across all the three floors of the property. They also found a sophisticated hydroponic irrigation system complete with extraction ducts and discovered Clemens-Cooney had also rigged the electricity supply at his own home to steal £20,000 worth of power to supply light, water and air filtration. Today Clemens-Cooney, from Blackburn, Lancashire, is starting three years in jail after he was convicted of producing cannabis following a 12-day trial. Boarded up: Clemens-Cooney blacked out the windows and boarded up the doors to keep his facilities secret. One of his tenants Morgan Redmayne, 44, of Darwen was jailed for two and a half years for cannabis production. After the case a neighbour, who asked not be named, said: 'Council planners may have told Shaun he could only use the property for leisure purposes but obviously his idea of leisure purposes was far from their minds when they let him build it. Also jailed: Tenant Morgan Redmayne must serve two and a half years. 'The reality was Shaun was pretty cross with the council when it refused him permission and we wouldn't be surprised if he finished the building off with a view to using it as a custom-built cannabis farm. 'He had already started building the house when he was found out, and ordered to submit planning permission but the dispute went on for years and must have cost him a considerable a fortune. 'Maybe he thought growing cannabis was a way of getting back some of his money.' Clemens-Cooney who is company secretary of Millbrooke Construction in Darwen and owns up to seven properties hit trouble in February 2007, when he was caught trying to build an eighth house on half an acre of land behind his family home without the right permissions. Over a two year period officials at Blackburn with Darwen Council repeatedly refused planning permission for the property saying it would have a 'dominant, overbearing impact to neighbouring dwellings, to the detriment of residential amenity.' A report said the proposal would be 'out of character with adjacent properties and the surrounding area in general.' But in January 2010 Clemens-Cooney. applied again this time saying the detached property would now be a. double garage and games room and offered drawings showing a 'playroom' and 'model railway room' as well as office space and a utility room. The. following the March officials said they would only grant permission for. the property to be completed on condition it would not be used as. 'habitable accommodation.' He later completed the house and even showed. it off on his company website. Another neighbour said: 'The property was built about three years ago, and it is quite an eyesore and nobody likes it. 'But. we had no indication that it was a cannabis farm, we never smelt. anything and you couldn't tell it was lit up because the windows were. whitewashed.' Out of character: The 'cannabis house' was hidden behind Clemens-Cooney's own house. What officers might have expected to find: Clemens-Cooney told planning officers the upstairs would be used for projects such as a model railway. The neighbour added: 'There was nothing suspicious about it either, no suspicion coming and goings and I kept a pretty good eye on it. I wouldn't say I was shocked when I found out what was going on - more surprised I'd say - but not surprised when I found out it was him. 'There were two fake garage doors at the front and behind that was a breeze block. The windows on the front were all white washed so you could never see in. It took about two days for the police to bring out all the plants. 'We were told there were 600 cannabis plants but there must have been about 3,000 plant pots which in the end were given to the local garden centre. 'The plants were between 6ft and 9ft high and had been being cropped. He must have had a lot of heaters in there too. 'He must have put ducts in there that took out the smell so we could never smell anything because it went out the other way. Even when we were sat out in summer we couldn't smell anything. 'Mr Clemens-Cooney is a well known man around here because of his building background and he owns a lot of houses. 'I always saw him in his overalls and driving a van. He's a real Del Boy.' Clemens-Cooney's Millbrooke Construction company showcased the house as a residential new build. Last September Clemens-Cooney was caught in a row after claims electricity powering seven houses he built were illegally connected. He and Redmayne both denied drugs charges at Preston Crown Court. A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: 'In his back garden, Clemens-Cooney had built a three-bedroom property, albeit the planning permission was limited to a storage structure. 'When the police conducted a raid at the property, they found that it was being used as a cannabis factory, with lights and fans and extraction ducting. 'The electricity for the property was being abstracted from Clemens-Cooney's own house, with a cable running from his house and underground to the property in the rear garden.' Det Insp Mark Winstanley from Lancashire Police said: 'This was a very large and significant cannabis set-up and I hope this result will reduce the supply of drugs in the local area. 'Cannabis brings upset and misery to our communities and we are determined to work with local residents to tackle the issue. I urge local residents to contact us with any information or concerns about cannabis in their community.' Highlights:","completion":"1.

The largest kingfishing tournament in the U.S. is held on a St. Johns tributary, where sport fishers concentrate on king mackerel (Scomberomorus cavalla), cobia (Rachycentron canadum), dolphin (Coryphaena hippurus) and Wahoo (Acanthocybium solandri). The home stadium for the Jacksonville Jaguars faces the river, as does most of the commercial center of downtown. Seven bridges span the St. Johns at Jacksonville; all of them allow tall ships to pass, although some restrict passing times when train or automobile traffic is heavy.Tides cause seawater to enter the mouth of the St. Johns River and can affect the river's level into the middle basin. As a result, much of the river in Jacksonville is part seawater, making it an estuarine ecosystem. The animals and plants in these systems can tolerate both fresh and salt water, and the fluctuations in saline content and temperatures associated with tidal surges and heavy rainfall discharge. Marine animals such as dolphins and sharks can be spotted at times in the St. Johns at Jacksonville as can manatees. Fish such as mullet (Mullidae), flounder (Paralichthys lethostigma), shad (Alosa sapidissima), and blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus) migrate from the ocean to freshwater springs upriver to spawn.Although freshwater invertebrates inhabiting and comprising algae and periphyton make the foundation of food webs in the middle and lower basin, zooplankton and phytoplankton take that role in the estuarine habitat. Mollusks gather at the St. Johns estuary in large numbers, feeding on the bottom of the river and ocean floors. The abundance and importance of oysters (Crassostrea virginica) is apparent in the many middens left by the Timucua in mounds many feet high. Oysters and other mollusks serve as the primary food source of shorebirds. The large trees... contains an answer for the question: What are the type of mollusk that is left in mounds many feet high?, what is it ?

They were the first pictures of the former South African president since he left hospital on 6 April after more than a week of treatment for pneumonia. Looking dazed, he is seen surrounded by ANC leaders and well-wishers. An ANC spokesman said the party was happy to share the 94 year old with \\"the world, even in his frail state\\". The rare video footage of Mr Mandela, popularly known by his clan name \\"Madiba\\", was broadcast by South African public broadcaster, SABC. The vast majority of Twitter reaction to the footage of Nelson Mandela has been hostile. \\"After everything the man has done for us this is how we treat him. Like an animal at the zoo. Shame on us. #mandela,\\" wrote Marius van der Walt. Nosipho Dhladhla tweeted: \\"Part of #ANC campaign for next elections. Using an old man as a puppet. Let #Mandela live his last days in peace!\\" Tina Yvonne-Michelle appealed for Mr Mandela to be left in peace: \\"People should just leave poor #Mandela alone. Let him be and let him rest. He is 94 for goodness sake.\\" The response from Simmi Areff was more tongue-in-cheek: \\"Everybody needs to calm down about the #Mandela photo shoot. The ANC needed a new Facebook Cover Photo.\\" A minority of Twitter users defended the footage. \\"Dear whites plz chill..#Mandela is supposed to look like that..He is 94 ,U are the ones that wasted his time by jailing him for 27 years,\\" said Shibe Serakalala. Lwazi Mlaba also disagreed with much of Twitter outrage: \\"The #Zuma #Mandela visit is the least distasteful recording I've seen in 10 years... The media is angry they didn't get the scoop!\\" Compiled by BBC Monitoring The BBC's Milton Nkosi in Johannesburg says there has been an outcry on social media - especially Twitter, where the topic is trending - about the broadcast of the video. Many see it as exploitative and an invasion of the former president's privacy, our correspondent adds. In the images, Mr Mandela is seen unsmiling, seated upright on a sofa with his legs covered in a blanket as people take photographs of him using flashes. Patrick Conroy, the head of news at South Africa's privately owned television channel eNCA, accused the ANC of applying double standards. \\"The media has been repeatedly lectured by the #ANC and SA govt about respecting #Madiba's privacy and dignity. Now we know how they treat him,\\" he wrote on Twitter. President Jacob Zuma and ANC Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa were among the senior ANC officials who called in on Mr Mandela at his home in Johannesburg on Monday and were given an update by his medical team. The president said Mr Mandela \\"shook hands and even smiled\\". \\"Those who are complaining that Madiba's latest images was a publicity stunt by the [ANC] are eating sour grapes,\\" the South African news agency, Sapa, quoted ANC spokesman Jackson Mthembu as saying. \\"Our people have not seen Madiba in many years. Now they have seen him open and close his eyes... We are happy with his health. He is no longer a young man,\\" he added. By Milton NkosiBBC News, Johannesburg Nelson Mandela appeared frail but better than many feared. From what I could see from SABC's exclusive video, I noticed that Mr Mandela flinched as one of his grandsons took a photograph and a bright flash went off. It has been many years now since photographers were requested not to use flashes when taking pictures of the 94 year old. Mr Mandela's eyes were damaged when he worked in a lime quarry while a political prisoner on Robben Island. There are probably two reasons why President Zuma paid his old comrade and mentor a home visit. He wanted to prove the sceptics wrong. He was dispelling the myth that the former president was in bed on a life support machine, as many had speculated on social media. Some cynics say it was pure electioneering. They say that President Zuma posed for pictures next to Mr Mandela and that he went to seek blessings from the governing ANC's most famous member with an eye on next year's crucial elections. Mr Mandela's health has been a continuing cause for concern recently. The veteran leader's lung problems date from his 27 years as a political prisoner. Eighteen years were spent on the windswept Robben Island, where he contracted tuberculosis. In December, he spent more than two weeks in hospital undergoing treatment for his lung ailment and gallstones. In February, doctors dealt with a stomach condition. Mr Mandela, who stepped down as president in 1999, is revered in South Africa for his role in ending the system of apartheid, or white minority rule. He retired from public life in 2004 after acting as a high-profile ambassador for the country. Mr Mandela became South Africa's first black president in the 1990s and is seen by many as father of the nation. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 jointly with former President FW de Klerk for ending apartheid and bringing democracy to South Africa.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would you stay in a chic and well design hostel if it is a little far away from popular area? Should I stay away from her? Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two questions are not paraphrases of each other. They address different topics and have distinct implications. Let's analyze each question separately. The first question asks: \\"Would you stay in a chic and well-designed hostel if it is a little far away from the popular area?\\" This inquiry is about making a decision in the context of travel and accommodation. It raises consideration for the trade-off between the quality of the lodging (a chic and well-designed hostel) and its location (being somewhat distant from popular areas). In providing a detailed answer, numerous factors would need to be considered when deciding whether to stay in such a hostel. For instance, the traveler's personal preferences, budget, and priorities would play a significant role. Some individuals may prioritize a comfortable and stylish environment, making the chic, well-designed hostel an excellent choice despite its distance from popular areas. Others may be more concerned with convenience in terms of accessing popular attractions, restaurants, or public transportation, and would therefore potentially forgo the attractive hostel in search of a more centrally located option. Additionally, the frequency of public transportation, taxi or ride-sharing availability, and the general safety of the neighborhood would also be factors to consider. If the hostel is easily accessible and the area is considered safe, it may be worth staying in the chic, well-designed hostel. Prioritizing personal desires, such as accommodation quality, convenience, and cost would, in the end, dictate whether or not to stay at the hostel. The second question asks: \\"Should I stay away from her?\\" In contrast, this question isn't related to travel or accommodation. It pertains to interpersonal relationships and emotional matters. A variety of potential reasons could exist for staying away from someone – personal conflicts, differences in values or opinions, emotional distress, or other factors threatening the well-being of the individuals involved. To provide a detailed answer, it would be essential to understand the context and underlying reasons for such a question. If the relationship is causing stress, unhappiness, or other negative emotions, evaluating whether that person is beneficial to one's mental and emotional well-being would be critical. It is important to communicate concerns and feelings in any relationship to make informed decisions and promote personal growth. An open dialogue can sometimes help resolve misunderstandings or lead to a mutual understanding about the need for space or even the end of the relationship. However, if engaging in communication and healthy conflict resolution doesn't yield positive results, it may be in the best interest for one's well-being to stay away from the person in question. In summary, these questions are not paraphrases of each other, as they consider completely different scenarios and factors. The first question examines the pros and cons of staying in a chic, well-designed hostel that is not conveniently located, while the second question touches on interpersonal relationships and emotional decision-making."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let's just follow the steps, okay? We need to find the value of j in this equation: -3631 = -192*j - 1121 + 2290 First, we'll add 1121 to both sides of the equation: -3631 + 1121 = -192 * j - 1121 + 1121 + 2290 After summing up those numbers we get: -2510 = -192 * j + 2290 Now, let's subtract 2290 from both sides of the equation: -2510 - 2290 = -192 * j + 2290 - 2290 -4800 = -192 * j To find the value of j, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -192: -4800 / -192 = -192 * j / -192 So, the value of j is: 25 = j Yay, we found the answer! j equals 25.

Logan had never fired a gun before, so Michael took him to a firing range;","completion":"Logan had never fired a gun before, so Michael took him to a firing range, where he hoped to introduce his friend to the basics of firearm safety and proper shooting techniques in a controlled and secure environment. Michael, an experienced shooter and gun enthusiast, believed that it was important for everyone, even those who might not have a personal interest in guns, to gain a basic understanding of them. This stemmed from his belief that a lack of education and understanding could foster unnecessary fear or biased opinions. Furthermore, knowing how to handle a firearm safely could come in handy in unexpected situations. Upon arriving at the state-of-the-art indoor range, the pair was greeted by a friendly on-site staff member who helped them check in and navigate the facility's rules and regulations. As part of their introduction to the world of shooting sports, they were required to attend a first-time shooter safety briefing where they were provided with essential protective gear like headsets to muffle the sound of gunshot blasts and eye protection to shield their eyes from any stray debris. Once the briefing was completed and the proper gear was donned, Michael led Logan to the rental counter where they would select a firearm suited to a beginner. While Logan felt a mixture of excitement and uneasiness at the prospect of holding a gun, Michael reassured him by carefully selecting a smaller caliber pistol, recognized for its accuracy and minimal recoil. He explained that starting with a smaller caliber weapon would allow Logan to focus on accuracy and technique, whilst growing accustomed to the noise and sensation of firing a gun. With their protective gear and rental firearm in hand, the pair proceeded to their assigned lane in the spacious firing range. Michael took the time to explain different parts of the gun, the correct way to load the magazine, and the proper stance for shooting before they begin. Emphasizing the importance of safety, Michael reminded Logan to always treat firearms as if they were loaded and never to point the muzzle at anything he didn't intend to shoot. Stepping up to the firing line, Logan listened attentively as Michael guided him through the process of lining up the sights, slowly exhaling, and smoothly pulling the trigger. Though Logan's arms wobbled slightly with the weight of the pistol and his heart pounded in his chest, he felt a rush of adrenaline as he fired his first shot and watched the bullet pierce the paper target downrange. Throughout their time at the range, Logan gained confidence under Michael's patient tutelage. They practiced various shooting drills, focusing on improving grip, stance, and trigger control. By the end of their session, Logan's initial nervousness had subsided, and he felt a newfound appreciation for the skill and responsibility required to handle a firearm safely and proficiently. As they left the firing range, Logan thanked Michael for introducing him to this eye-opening experience which had changed his perspective on firearms and their role in modern society. While he might not become a gun enthusiast like Michael, he recognized the importance of firearm education and respected the dedication and skill it took to become a proficient shooter. The day at the firing range had not only been a bonding experience for the friends but also an educational moment that would stay with Logan for a lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

În concluzie consider că, prin adoptarea acestui regulament, vom contribui la sensibilizarea cu privire la bunăstarea animalelor şi la menţinerea unor standarde înalte în acest domeniu în Uniunea Europeană. Translate to English","completion":"In conclusion, I believe that by adopting this regulation, we will contribute to raising awareness about animal welfare and maintaining high standards in this field in the European Union. Animal welfare refers to the well-being of animals, which can encompass both their physical and psychological state. Awareness in this regard is crucial. By adopting the proposed regulation, we will encourage greater understanding of the needs of animals, their care and treatment. This heightened public consciousness should stimulate ethical behaviors and actions towards animals, thus contributing to their welfare. High standards are key in any field and animal welfare is no exception. Setting stringent rules and regulations can have a profound impact on ensuring the well-being of animals. It can ensure that all animals receive the care and protection they require. These include specific regulations regarding housing, feeding, handling, health care and transportation. For instance, they dictate the space an animal should have, what they should be fed, how they should be handled and what medical treatment they should receive. These standards would be designed not merely for the prevention of cruelty, but also to ensure the provision of positive well-being for the animals. The European Union, given its legislative power and economic size, has a tremendous responsibility and capability in setting animal welfare standards that could highly influence the rest of the world. The EU has been at the forefront of establishing legislation aimed at protecting animals and has made significant strides in the promotion of animal welfare. Adopting this regulation in such influential entity as the EU ensures that the high standards set are far-reaching. It sends a message to all member countries and their citizens about the importance the EU places on animal welfare. It will not only force businesses and individuals within the EU to comply, but also nudge non-EU countries trading with the bloc to raise their standards. In this way, the EU can truly act as a global standard bearer for animal welfare. Therefore, it stands to reason that the adoption of this regulation in the EU will indeed have a significant and positive impact on raising awareness about animal welfare and maintaining high standards in this field. It will play an integral role in highlighting the importance of animal welfare and ensuring that it is given the attention and priority it deserves. This, in turn, will promote healthier, happier lives for animals across the EU and potentially set a global example for effective animal welfare regulations and practices."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It is nice to see people so rich and 'successful' wasting their time on one of the most forgettable, trite, and pathetic pieces of film-making of all time. This movie represents the worst of Hollywood. What is this? Is it based on a true story. Well, they do start with some basic news bites and facts that they read off USA today. But then the movie departs to some fantasy world and a 'cuban' refugee going to make it in the American drug subculture; kind of like Rocky on cocaine. Is it a movie about Cuba or Cubans? For the life of me I don't believe there is a single Cuban in this movie. The accents are totally fake, and scene with Antonio's mother looks like a poster for midwest American values. The whole scene looks like something out of the Dick Van Dyke show. Is this movie about Miami? It looks more like L.A. transposed in Florida. Afterall, a palm tree is a palm tree. Is this a romance novel. The relationship between Pacino and Pfeiffer is so obvious from the getgo, and there is not one shred of possibility that these two characters could ever care for each other. Is this a drug movie? Well, no issues of obsession or addiction are even mentioned. The behavior of the actors after a line of coke is nothing different than had they had a drink of water. Admittedly, the acting is terrible. Let's get to the rest. The music is disgusting and sounds like latin elevator music or something out of a Lawrence Welk show. I think I heard a polka? The camera work is shoddy with too much movement and far more cranes than could ever be effective. Clearly, the photography budget was excessive. The sound is bleached in a number of spots, and the dialogue seems to be carried out in a warehouse. The writing is appalling. This is one of those movies were the script writes itself. You are dragged from one trite piece of dialogue to the next, each pushing the plot like a sack of bricks. So I am going to ask, Is this even a movie? It could be a drama series patched together for two and a half hours. But at least a drama series has some kind of focus. Maybe it is just a bunch of poorly acted scenes taped together.

Article: FRIDAY, Aug. 3 (Health Day News) -- Middle school students who are physically fit are likely to score higher on standardized tests measuring reading and math abilities, a new study has found. And, the average scores went up in connection with levels of fitness, the findings showed. \\"The more physically fit kids were, the higher their scores,\\" said the study's lead author, Trent Petrie, director of the Center for Sport Psychology at the University of North Texas in Denton. \\"Parents should encourage their kids to be physically active. There are some real cognitive and academic benefits that come from physical fitness\\", Petrie said. Results of the study are scheduled to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Psychological Association in Orlando, Fla. The study included more than 1,200 middle school students from five schools in a suburban area of Texas, with 561 boys and 650 girls. About 57 percent of the children were white, and nearly one-quarter were Mexican American. Nine percent were black and about 2 percent were of Asian descent. The school district provided the researchers with information on the children's race, age, grade level and whether they qualified for the free school lunch program, which was an indicator of the family's socioeconomic status. The schools also provided scores to the tests, which were given between one and four months after the researchers had assessed the children's levels of fitness. Fitness tests were administered during physical education classes to determine the youngsters' heart and lung health (cardiorespiratory fitness), as well as their body mass index (BMI), an indicator of how much body fat a person has. The children also filled out questionnaires that helped the researchers determine factors such as self-esteem and social support. After accounting for factors such as age, sex, family income and self-esteem, the researchers found that for both boys and girls, higher levels of heart and lung health predicted better scores on both the math and reading...

Question: Rob was in his chemistry lab, experimenting with different states of matter. He had a liquid substance that he labeled as state A. He then transformed half of the liquid substance to gaseous state. He labeled it as state B. Finally, he froze the remaining half of the liquid to solid state. He labeled it as state C. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which state has less possible arrangements, state A or state B? Hint: There are many examples in the chemical world of changes in entropy. Phase transitions are one obvious example. When a substance makes a transition from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements, because they are no longer confined to a specified volume in which they are close to each other; gas particles can move freely throughout their container. Vaporization represents an increase in entropy. In the opposite direction, a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid. Because solids have very ordered structures, there are fewer possible arrangements of particles that would result in the properties associated with a solid. Answer:","completion":"State A has less possible arrangements. Explanation: According to the provided information, when a substance transitions from the liquid state to the gaseous state, the particles have many more possible arrangements due to their increased freedom of movement. This means that state B (gaseous) has more possible arrangements than state A (liquid). Additionally, it's mentioned that a liquid loses entropy when it freezes to a solid, so state C (solid) has even fewer possible arrangements than state A (liquid).

Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

Write an article based on this \\"The American Prairie Reserve is buying land from cattle farmers, which, combined with public land, creates a vast open area of prairie.\\"","completion":"Title: The American Prairie Reserve's Vision: A Bold Conservation Initiative to Restore an Ecosystem Introduction The American Prairie Reserve (APR), a non-profit organization established in 2001, has embarked on an ambitious project to create a vast open area of prairie in Northeastern Montana. This has been made possible through the acquisition of land from cattle farmers, combined with the careful use of public land. The idea behind this project is to restore and conserve the diminishing prairie ecosystem and support the native species that have called this habitat home for centuries. Here, we delve deeper into the workings of the APR, their conservation efforts, and the implications of their work for the prairie ecosystem and the various stakeholders involved. Step 1: Acquiring Land from Cattle Farmers The first and foremost step in achieving APR's vision is acquiring land from cattle farmers. This has been made possible through negotiations, where the organization has been able to secure properties for sale or long-term lease agreements. By focusing on purchasing land that offers the best potential for conservation, APR is not only ensuring the protection of native species but also creating a buffer between development and the pristine prairie landscape. Step 2: Combining Private Acquisitions with Public Land APR has managed to effectively combine the privately acquired lands with public land, creating a vast, contiguous habitat for flora and fauna. By consolidating these parcels of land, APR's conservation efforts become more impactful, creating interconnected corridors for wildlife migration and movement. This approach offers a better opportunity to preserve the genetic diversity of species and enhance the ecological resilience of the landscape in the face of climate change. Step 3: Collaboration with Key Stakeholders For the success of any project of this magnitude, collaboration with local communities, government agencies, and environmental organizations is crucial. The APR, recognizing this fact, has focused on creating mutually beneficial partnerships with various stakeholders. These partnerships involve working with local ranchers and cooperating on grazing management plans to promote better land stewardship and the conservation of the native prairie. By working closely with the local community, APR is fostering a collaborative environment and ensuring a widespread commitment to the preservation of this unique ecosystem. Step 4: Restoration & Ecological Management Once the land has been secured, restoration and ecological management are the next critical steps in the process. This involves the removal of invasive species and noxious weeds, along with the restoration of native prairie grasses and other flora. APR also employs various wildlife reintroduction programs, such as the establishment of bison herds, which play a crucial role in shaping the prairie ecosystem. Moreover, the organization conducts ongoing monitoring and research to continually improve land management practices and develop evidence-based strategies to ensure the long-term viability and health of the prairie. Conclusion The American Prairie Reserve has set an unprecedented benchmark for land conservation through their remarkable initiative in Montana. By acquiring land from cattle farmers and combining these efforts with the use of public lands, the organization has created a vast open area that benefits both the prairie ecosystem and the various stakeholders involved. As the reserve continues to expand and flourish, it serves as a shining example of the power of collective action toward a meaningful goal: the long-term preservation of an invaluable natural resource and its many inhabitants."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The information provided in the sentence is related to the economic impact and development of the downtown area, the number of jobs it provides, its tax base, the presence of upscale restaurants, shops, and residential units. However, it does not mention the specific number of people living in downtown New Haven. To answer the question about the number of people living in downtown New Haven, more information about the population demographics would be required. Demographics may be found on government websites, statistical databases, or websites of organizations conducting population surveys. These resources may contain quantitative information on population figures or changes over certain periods to provide a better understanding of the number of residents in the downtown area. For example, if you were to look up the population data for downtown New Haven from a reliable source like the United States Census Bureau or a regional planning agency, you might find statistics on the total population size, the number of households, and the population density per square mile. By obtaining these figures, it would be possible to determine an estimate of how many people live in downtown New Haven. Once the relevant data has been collected, it is important to cross-reference the information and ensure consistency among the sources. Additionally, monitoring changes in population over time can help provide a more accurate context when examining how residential developments, employment opportunities, and other factors affect the number of people living in the downtown area of a city like New Haven."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In a mental facility The answer to this question is:","completion":"Title: Fractured Spirits Genre: Psychological Thriller/Drama Plot: Act 1: Meet Jerilee Evans, a 28-year-old aspiring writer struggling with the recent loss of her mother. Brilliant and introspective, Jerilee suffers in silence, refusing to accept help from her friends or family. Encouraged by her psychiatrist, Dr. Sarah Fields, Jerilee reluctantly makes the decision to check into the Serenity Hills Mental Health Facility. She believes it is a temporary stay for a few days, intended to help her overcome her crippling grief and anxiety. Act 2: Once at Serenity Hills, Jerilee encounters an array of unique patients: the enigmatic and spiritually inclined Luna, the deeply mistrusting and volatile Michael, and the warm-hearted but withdrawn Abigail. The therapist overseeing group therapy at the facility, Dr. Rebecca Shaw, helps Jerilee explore her grief and develop coping strategies. As Jerilee navigates her way through therapy sessions, she begins to unravel buried emotions and painful memories. Jerilee's introverted nature leads her to observe the other patients intently and keep a journal of their interactions. It isn't long before she starts noticing strange occurrences at the facility - patients going missing, inexplicable mood shifts, and whispered conversations between the staff. Driven by curiosity and an eerie sense of deja vu, Jerilee begins investigating the dark secrets that lie within Serenity Hills's seemingly peaceful walls. As she delves deeper into the facility's history and her fellow patients' lives, she discovers evidence of dangerous and unethical practices by the staff. Act 3: Jerilee becomes the target of the sinister facility administrator, Mr. Alexander Cross, who grows suspicious of her meddling. He uses his position of power to secretly manipulate the patients and staff, twisting their realities, causing confusion and mistrust between them. Jerilee's only allies are her fellow patients, but as suspicion grows and tensions rise, their loyalties are put to the test. Running out of time and desperately aware that Mr. Cross is closing in on her, Jerilee must prove her credibility to her fellow patients and unite them against the corruption within Serenity Hills. She uncovers a horrifying connection between Mr. Cross, Dr. Shaw, and their experimental treatments––a shocking revelation that throws Jerilee's own perceptions and memories into question, making her doubt her sanity. Climax: As Jerilee and her new friends confront the corrupt staff members, a thrilling and tense standoff ensues. Lives are on the line as patients turn against staff and chaos erupts in the facility. Resolution: In the aftermath, the police arrive to apprehend the corrupt staff members, and the uncovered truth sets in motion the facility's closure. The patients are sent to other treatment centers, and Jerilee and her friends are finally able to start their journeys toward healing with a newfound understanding of themselves and others. Jerilee learns to accept her mother's death, finding solace in the friendships she forged and using her writing as a means of expression and connection. Haunted yet inspired by her experiences at Serenity Hills, Jerilee pens a novel based on the events she endured. The novel touches the hearts of people across the nation, raising awareness about mental health practices and advocating for positive change. Strengthened by her courage and resilience, Jerilee eventually emerges as a powerful voice and advocate for mental health and patient rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Experts say Yemen is going to be the first country in the world to run out of water.The capital, Sanaa, will run out of drinking water as early as 2025,says a report by the World Bank.

In Taiz, in the south,tap water is available only once every 45 days.In the mountainous Malhan district in the north,women and children climb a 1,500m mountain to collect water from a spring, often in the small hours to avoid long queues. Yemen is located in Southwest Asia,bordering the Arabian and Red Sea.Yemeni people have lived on scarce water supplies for thousands of years but that problem has been made serious by conflict in the area,the fastgrowing population and the use of water to grow a drug called qat.With one of the world's highest rates of population growth--3.46 percent, Yemen is the poorest Arab country.

The Moon has more or less effect on the tides than Mars? A:","completion":"The Moon has a greater effect on Earth's tides than Mars due to several factors, including distance, size, and gravitational forces. The tides on Earth are primarily influenced by the gravitational forces exerted by the Moon and the Sun. To fully understand this, it is crucial to dive deep into the dynamics of the tides and the gravitational interactions between celestial bodies. Tidal forces are caused by the gravitational attraction between two objects, such as the Earth and the Moon. Gravity pulls objects towards each other, and this pull is stronger for objects that are closer together and more massive. Since the force of gravity is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects, the closer an object is, the stronger its gravitational force will be. The Moon is approximately 384,400 kilometers (238,855 miles) away from Earth, while Mars is on average about 225 million kilometers (140 million miles) away. The close proximity of the Moon to Earth makes its gravitational pull on our planet significantly stronger than that of Mars. Furthermore, the Moon has a mass of 7.34 x 10^22 kilograms, compared to Mars’ mass of 6.39 x 10^23 kilograms. Although Mars is more massive than the Moon, its greater distance from Earth means that its gravitational influence on our planet is much weaker. The Sun is an even more massive object, with a 1.989 × 10^30 kilogram mass. However, it is about 149.6 million kilometers (93 million miles) away from Earth. As a result, the Sun's gravitational pull on Earth is weaker than that of the Moon. This is why the Moon primarily controls the tides, even though the Sun plays a secondary role in moderating the tides' strength. Mars' effect on Earth's tides is minimal, if not negligible. The Moon's proximity to Earth means that its influence on our tides is significantly stronger than Mars despite being smaller. The much larger distance from Mars to the Earth results in a vastly reduced gravitational force by comparison. Additionally, tides are also influenced by factors such as Earth's rotation, shape, and weather patterns, further diluting any impact Mars might have on our planet's tides. In conclusion, the Moon has a much more significant effect on Earth's tides than Mars due to its closeness, gravitational force, and mass. The effects of Mars on the tides are nearly insignificant compared to the dominant roles played by the Moon and the Sun.Understanding these gravitational influences allows us to predict tidal patterns, supporting endeavors such as maritime navigation, coastal planning, and environmental conservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this view, phonological representations are sequences of segments made up of distinctive features. These features were an expansion of earlier work by Roman Jakobson, Gunnar Fant, and Morris Halle. The features describe aspects of articulation and perception, are from a universally fixed set, and have the binary values + or −. There are at least two levels of representation: underlying representation and surface phonetic representation. Ordered phonological rules govern how underlying representation is transformed into the actual pronunciation (the so-called surface form). An important consequence of the influence SPE had on phonological theory was the downplaying of the syllable and the emphasis on segments. Furthermore, the generativists folded morphophonology into phonology, which both solved and created problems.\\"?

Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him.

Answer the above question based on the context below: As Opeth's primary songwriter and lyricist, vocalist/guitarist Mikael Åkerfeldt heads the direction of Opeth's sound. He was influenced at a young age by the 1970s progressive rock bands King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Camel, P.F.M., Hawkwind, and Gracious, and by heavy metal bands such as Iron Maiden, Slayer, Death, Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Celtic Frost, King Diamond, Morbid Angel, Voivod, and, most importantly, Judas Priest. Åkerfeldt considers Judas Priest's Sad Wings of Destiny (1976) the best metal album of all time, and notes that there was a time when he listened only to Judas Priest. While warming up before Opeth concerts, Åkerfeldt frequently sings \\"Here Come the Tears\\" from Judas Priest's third album Sin After Sin (1977). Åkerfeldt later discovered progressive rock and folk music, both of which had a profound impact on the sound of the band.Opeth's distinct sound mixes death metal with progressive rock. Steve Huey of AllMusic refers to Opeth's \\"epic, progressive death metal style\\". Ryan Ogle of Blabbermouth described Opeth's sound as incorporating \\"the likes of folk, funk, blues, '70s rock, goth and a laundry list of other sonic oddities into their trademark progressive death style.\\" In his review of Opeth's 2001 album Blackwater Park, AllMusic's Eduardo Rivadavia wrote, \\"Tracks start and finish in seemingly arbitrary fashion, usually traversing ample musical terrain, including acoustic guitar and solo piano passages, ambient soundscapes, stoner rock grooves, and Eastern-tinged melodies—any of which are subject to savage punctuations of death metal fury at any given moment.\\" Åkerfeldt commented on the diversity of Opeth's music: I don't see the point of playing in a band and going just one way when you can do everything. It would be impossible for us to play just death metal; that is our roots, but we are now a mishmash of everything, and not purists to any form of music. It's impossible for us to do that, and quite frankly I would think of it as boring to be in a band that plays just metal music....

After the publication of the L'Orfeo score in 1609, the same publisher (Ricciardo Amadino of Venice) brought it out again in 1615. Facsimiles of these editions were printed in 1927 and 1972 respectively. Since Eitner's first \\"modern\\" edition of L'Orfeo in 1884, and d'Indy's performing edition 20 years later—both of which were abridged and adapted versions of the 1609 score—there have been many attempts to edit and present the work, not all of them published. Most of the editions that followed d'Indy up to the time of the Second World War were arrangements, usually heavily truncated, that provided a basis for performances in the modern opera idiom. Many of these were the work of composers, including Carl Orff (1923 and 1939) and Ottorino Respighi in 1935. Orff's 1923 score, using a German text, included some period instrumentation, an experiment he abandoned when producing his later version.In the post-war period, editions have moved increasingly to reflect the performance conventions of Monteverdi's day. This tendency was initiated by two earlier editions, that of Jack Westrup used in the 1925 Oxford performances, and Gian Francesco Malipiero's 1930 complete edition which sticks closely to Monteverdi's 1609 original. After the war, Hindemith's attempted period reconstruction of the work was followed in 1955 by an edition from August Wenzinger that remained in use for many years. The next 30 years saw numerous editions, mostly prepared by scholar-performers rather than by composers, generally aiming towards authenticity if not always the complete re-creation of the original instrumentation. These included versions by Raymond Leppard (1965), Denis Stevens (1967), Nikolaus Harnoncourt (1969), Jane Glover (1975), Roger Norrington (1976) and John Eliot Gardiner. Only the composers Valentino Bucchi (1967), Bruno Maderna (1967) and Luciano Berio (1984) produced editions based on the convention of a large modern orchestra.

What you have here is basically a decent plastic chess set with a cardboard playing board. The pieces are large (2-5 inches; good for smaller hands) and have a nice weight to them. I'm giving this set a high score for durability because the pieces seem pretty indestructible and will probably get lost long before they break or wear out. But the cardboard playing board may need to be replaced or repaired (read: duct taped) after heavy use or rough handling. Kids will love that the pieces look just like the life-sized set Ron played in the first movie. And hey, in my opinion there just isn't a more educational toy than a chess set. Harry Potter books helped many kids discover they like to read, now Harry Potter can help kids develop an interest in chess! Cool.

Q:Title: The Shetland Bus Product review: Well written chronicle of the war effort against occupying Germany between Norway's underground and Great Britain's military. A handful of Norwegian fishing vessels armed and sailing the winter night arctic seas between a British Naval base in the Shetland Isles off Scotland and the German patrolled coast of Norway. Materials, refugees and trained underground fighters wer transported back and forth at great risk during the early 1940's. This was a little-known effort between these two countries that greatly stressed the people involved. These dangerous and difficult adventures did not mean a great deal in the big scheme of the war until the Norwegian underground played a key part in delaying Germanys efforts to produce atomic weapons. This German set-back helped end the war in Europe and allowed America to be the first nuclear power and to turn their attention to the war in the Pacific. Would you say this review depicts the product in a flattering or unflattering light? A:","completion":"This review portrays the product, \\"The Shetland Bus,\\" in a largely flattering light. The reviewer describes the book as a \\"well-written chronicle\\" that provides an insight into the lesser-known and important war efforts between Norway's underground and Great Britain's military during the early 1940s. The reviewer clearly admires the bravery and determination of the people involved in these dangerous and difficult adventures and recognizes the impact their actions had on ending the war in Europe. In the review, the reader is given a brief but detailed account of the key events and operations that took place, highlighting the perilous conditions the Norwegians faced while transporting materials, refugees, and trained underground fighters across the arctic seas. The reviewer also emphasizes that these efforts, though seemingly insignificant in the broader context of the war, played a crucial role in delaying Germany's progress in developing atomic weapons, ultimately contributing to the conclusion of the war in the European theatre. The description of the book as a chronicle implies that the author has meticulously researched and documented the events, adding credibility to the narrative and making it more engaging for the readers. It also suggests that the book might provide a fresh perspective on a lesser-known aspect of World War II, likely appealing to history enthusiasts and general readers alike. In conclusion, the review highlights the book's strengths, emphasizes the significance of the events it covers, and acknowledges the author's writing skills. Consequently, the review casts the product in a flattering light, advocating for the thoroughness, accuracy, and compelling nature of its storytelling.

Q:Information: - The Elenium is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes: - David Eddings (July 7, 1931 June 2, 2009) was an American fantasy writer. With his wife Leigh, he authored several best-selling epic fantasy novel series, including \\"The Belgariad\\" (198284), \\"The Malloreon\\" (198791), \\"The Elenium\\" (198991), \\"The Tamuli\\" (199294) and \\"The Dreamers\\" (200306). - Genre (or ; from French \\"genre\\" , \\"kind\\" or \\"sort\\", from Latin \\"genus\\" (stem \\"gener-\\"), Greek , \\"gés\\") - Fiction is the classification for any story or universe derived from imaginationin other words, not based strictly on history or fact. Fiction can be expressed in a variety of formats, including writings, live performances, films, television programs, animations, video games, and role-playing games, though the term originally and most commonly refers to the narrative forms of literature (see \\"literary\\" fiction), including the novel, novella, short story, and play. Fiction constitutes an act of creative invention, so that faithfulness to reality is not typically assumed; in other words, fiction is not expected to present only characters who are actual people or descriptions that are factually true. The context of fiction is generally open to interpretation, due to fiction's freedom from any necessary embedding in reality; however, some fictional works are claimed to be, or marketed as, historically or factually accurate, complicating the traditional distinction between fiction and non-fiction. Fiction is a classification or category, rather than a specific mode or genre, unless used in a narrower sense as a synonym for a particular literary fiction form. - The Tamuli is a series of fantasy novels by David Eddings. The series consists of three volumes: - The supernatural (Medieval Latin: \\"superntrlis\\": \\"supra\\" \\"above\\" + \\"naturalis\\" \\"natural\\", first used: 15201530 AD) includes all that cannot be explained by science or the laws of nature, including things characteristic of or relating to ghosts, gods, or other supernatural beings, or to things beyond nature. - Speculative fiction is a broad umbrella genre denoting any narrative fiction with supernatural or futuristic elements; this encompasses the genres of science fiction, fantasy, horror, alternative history, magic realism, and superhero fiction, as well as combinations of the previous genres. It typically strays strongly from reality and so may feature fictional types of beings like mythical creatures and supernatural entities, technologies that do not exist in real life like time machines and interstellar spaceships, or magical or otherwise scientifically inexplicable elements. The term's popularity is sometimes attributed to Robert Heinlein, who referenced it in 1947 in an editorial essay, although there are prior mentions of speculative fiction, or its variant \\"speculative literature\\". - The Malloreon is a five-part fantasy book series written by David Eddings, which follows \\"The Belgariad\\". The Malloreon is set in the same world as The Belgariad, but expands on several aspects of the setting, especially the eastern continent of Mallorea. - The Belgariad is a five - book fantasy epic written by David Eddings , following the picaresque journey of protagonist ' Garion ' and his companions , first to recover a sacred stone , and later to use it against antagonist ' Kal Torak ' . - Fantasy is a fiction genre set in an imaginary universe, often but not always without any locations, events, or people from the real world. Most fantasy uses magic or other supernatural elements as a main plot element, theme, or setting. Magic and magical creatures are common in many of these imaginary worlds. Fantasy is generally distinguished from the genres of science fiction and horror by the expectation that it steers clear of scientific and macabre themes, respectively, though there is a great deal of overlap between the three, all of which are subgenres of speculative fiction. - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. 'the belgariad' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Question: what is the source of geothermal energy I found the following answer on Google: Geothermal wells release greenhouse gases trapped deep within the earth, but these emissions are much lower per energy unit than those of fossil fuels. Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. A:","completion":"Yes, the provided answer is partially correct as it addresses the lower greenhouse gas emissions of geothermal energy compared to fossil fuels. However, it doesn't fully explain the source of geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is derived from the natural heat generated within the Earth's core. The source of this heat comes primarily from two processes: 1. Radioactive decay: The natural radioactive decay of isotopes, such as potassium-40, uranium-238, and thorium-232, generates heat deep within the Earth's core. These isotopes release energy in the form of heat as they decay into more stable elements. 2. Primordial heat: This heat is a remnant from when the Earth initially formed around 4.6 billion years ago by accretion of dust and gas and subsequent differentiation of the planet into layers based on density. Gravitational forces and pressure created intense heat during this process, and the Earth has been gradually losing this heat over time. Geothermal energy is harnessed by tapping into the Earth's internal heat, usually by drilling wells to access hot water and steam stored in the Earth's crust. This resource is utilized through three primary methods: direct use, geothermal heat pumps, and geothermal power plants. Direct use applications exploit lower-temperature geothermal resources (20-150°C) to heat buildings, support industrial processes, and even provide therapeutic benefits in certain spas. Geothermal heat pumps efficiently heat and cool buildings by capitalizing on stable underground temperatures unaffected by weather changes to provide space heating or cooling. These systems work well in wide-ranging climates and function at far lower temperatures than required for geothermal power generation. Geothermal power plants convert the heat from hot water or steam reservoirs (150-370°C) into electricity. Different types of geothermal power plants include: 1. Dry steam plants: The oldest type of geothermal power plant, which directly use the steam produced from geothermal reservoirs to power turbines and generate electricity. 2. Flash steam plants: The most commonly used worldwide, they exploit high-pressure hot water from the ground, converting it into steam by decreasing the pressure, hence the term \\"flash.\\" This steam powers the turbines and generates electricity. 3. Binary cycle plants: These plants employ a secondary fluid with a lower boiling point than water. Heat from geothermal resources is used to convert the secondary fluid into vapor, which then drives the turbines and produces electricity. Although geothermal energy exploitation does release certain greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and hydrogen sulfide, from the subsurface, the emission levels are significantly lower than those produced by fossil fuel combustion. As a result, geothermal energy is considered a more environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Stephanie, the office manager, had been receiving complaints from employees about the poor lighting in the building, which made it difficult to focus on their work. She knew that something had to be done, so she began researching the most effective and cost-efficient lighting solutions for the workplace. Step 1: Research lighting solutions Stephanie wanted to make an informed decision, so she spent time researching various lighting options online. She read about different types of light bulbs, such as LEDs and fluorescents, as well as different ways to install and control lighting, like smart switches and motion detection. Step 2: Compare costs and effectiveness After gathering information on the available options, Stephanie compared costs and effectiveness of each solution. She considered factors such as energy consumption, lifespan, and light quality. Step 3: Consult with employees Before making a final decision, Stephanie wanted to get input from the employees who would be directly affected by the change. She scheduled a meeting to discuss the options, answer questions, and gauge preferences among the staff. Step 4: Make a decision and place an order After considering all the information and employee feedback, Stephanie decided to go with energy-efficient LED lamps and a smart lighting system that allowed for customization of brightness and color temperature. She placed an order through a reputable vendor and scheduled the installation. Step 5: Dispose of old lights responsibly As the new lamps were being installed, it was crucial to dispose of the old lights properly. Stephanie contacted a local recycling center and arranged for the old lights to be picked up and recycled, ensuring that harmful chemicals would not end up in a landfill. Step 6: Train employees on new lighting system With the new lamps and smart lighting system in place, Stephanie organized training sessions for all employees to learn how to use and adjust the settings to their personal preferences. This empowered everyone to create a comfortable and productive work environment. Step 7: Monitor and adjust as needed Over the next several weeks, Stephanie monitored the effectiveness of the new lighting system by observing employee satisfaction and gauging productivity. She remained open to feedback and made adjustments to the system as needed. The new lighting system was a great success, as both employees and management noted the improved atmosphere in the office space. Productivity increased, and complaints about headaches and eyestrain caused by poor lighting were significantly reduced. The investment in the new lamps and smart system turned out to be a wise decision – a brighter space led to brighter minds and happier employees."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Process: - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose an increase in the filter strength happens, how will it affect less coffee makes it through the filter. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyzing the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in the filter strength will affect the amount of coffee that makes it through the filter. To evaluate this hypothesis, we can examine the process step by step and determine if the perturbation has a direct or indirect effect on it. Step 2: Examining the process with the perturbation - The carafe is filled with water - The water is poured into the machine at the back - Coffee beans are put into a grinder - The grinder is activated - A filter is put into the coffee maker (the filter strength is increased) - The ground coffee is put into the filter - Sometimes a bit of salt is added to the grounds to bring out the flavor - The top of the machine is closed - The power is turned on - The water passes through the grounds and becomes coffee (less coffee makes it through the filter due to the increased filter strength) Step 3: Evaluating the effect of the perturbation Direct effect: The increase in filter strength directly affects the amount of coffee that makes it through the filter, resulting in less coffee being brewed. This means that the final output - the brewed coffee - will be of a lower volume than with a regular filter. Indirect effect: As less coffee makes it through the filter, this may result in a stronger or more concentrated coffee, depending on the amount of water used and the ratio of coffee grounds to water. This change in coffee strength could be considered an indirect effect of the perturbation. Conclusion: The supposed perturbation (an increase in filter strength) does have an effect on the process. The direct effect is that less coffee makes it through the filter, resulting in a lower volume of brewed coffee. The indirect effect is the potential change in the strength or concentration of the coffee, which may influence the overall flavor and experience of drinking the coffee."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Which one of these answers best answers the question according to the context? A: had to go to the principal's office B: had to go to the nurse's C: calm down A:","completion":"Based on the context provided, Addison got into a big fistfight at school. The question being asked is: What does Addison need to do before this? We have three choices here: A) had to go to the principal's office, B) had to go to the nurse's, or C) calm down. Now let's evaluate each of these options: A) \\"Had to go to the principal's office\\": This option may make sense, as the principal's office is often a place where students are sent after committing a significant disciplinary offense, such as getting into a fight. It is possible that after the fistfight, Addison could face punishment, such as suspension, detention, or even expulsion depending on the severity of the incident. Therefore, this option could be an appropriate next step for Addison to face the consequences of the fight. B) \\"Had to go to the nurse's\\": In the context of the fistfight, if Addison was injured during the altercation, they may have needed to go to the nurse's office for medical attention, such as a dressing for a wound, ice for bruises, or an assessment of potential concussion symptoms. Additionally, the nurse's office could also serve as a \\"cool-down\\" area for Addison to reflect on the incident and its implications. This is a reasonable option considering the physical aspect of a fistfight. C) \\"Calm down\\": Since the question asks what Addison needs to \\"do before this,\\" it implies actions that should be taken before the fistfight occurred. In that sense, option C: \\"calm down,\\" could be the most appropriate answer. If Addison had been able to calm down and manage their emotions more effectively, they may have been able to avoid getting into the fistfight altogether. Strategies for calming down may include taking deep breaths, talking with a friend, teacher, or counselor, or engaging in a healthy coping mechanism like exercise or journaling. In summary, after evaluating the context and the possible choices, the best answer according to the context is: C) Calm down This answer takes into account the fact that the question asks about what Addison should have done before the fistfight happened. Calming down and addressing emotional issues would have most likely prevented the situation from escalating to a physical altercation. While options A and B are more relevant in the aftermath of a fight, C is the best answer for the given context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In front of a crowd that set the new record for highest decibel level at an NFL Game, the Chiefs dismanteled the Patriots 41-14 on Monday Night Football. The Patriots struggling offensive line combined with Brady's accuracy issues doomed them against Tamba Hali and Justin Houston while the Patriots had no answer for the Chiefs balanced offensive attack. The Chiefs had a strong opening possession, reaching the Patriots 46, but were forced to punt. After a Patriots three-and-out, the Chiefs struck with 11-play, 73-yard drive, with Jamaal Charles scoring on a 2-yard touchdown run. The Patriots managed to reach the Chiefs 42-yard line on their next drive but were once again forced to punt. On the Chiefs' next possession, Knile Davis powered his way for a 48-yard carry to the Patriots 38-yard line. Next, Alex Smith hit star tight-end Travis Kelce on a 33-yard catch-and-run to the Patriots 5-yard line. Finally, Smith hit Charles for a five-yard touchdown pass, extending the Chiefs lead to 14-0. The Patriots once again drove into Chiefs' territory on their next drive, but again punted away. Later, the Chiefs drove all the way to the Patriots 4-yard line, and Smith hit Dwayne Bowe at the Patriots 1-yard line, which should have ended the half, but Logan Ryan was called for a hands-to-the face on Donnie Avery, allowing one more play, and Cairo Santos booted a 22-yard chip-shot field goal for a 17-0 Chiefs lead at halftime. The Chiefs had gained 303 yards of offense in the first half, the most allowed in one half by the Patriots under Belichick. Both teams punted on their initial second-half possession, but on 2nd and 7 on the Patriots' next possession, Tamba Hali, almost completely untouched by left tackle Nate Solder, strip-sacked Brady and recovered for Kansas City at the Patriots 9. Two plays later, Smith threw a quick pass to Charles out of the backfield for a touchdown, Charles' third, increasing Kansas City's lead to 24-0. On the Patriots' second play of their next drive, a miscommunication between Brady and Edelman led to an interception by Sean Smith who returned the ball 34 yards to the New England 13 yard line. The Patriots defense managed to keep Kansas City out of the end zone, but Santos booted a 31-yard field goal, giving Kansas City a 27-0 lead. On the Patriots next drive, Vereen ran for 9 yards on 1st down. After being stuffed for no gain on the next play, Brady hit Vereen for a 28-yard gain to the Chiefs 44. On the very next play, Brady hit Brandon LaFell who broke through three defenders and raced off for a 44-yard touchdown, making the score 27-7. However, the Chiefs couldn't be stopped. Kansas City answered right back, marching 80 yards in 12 plays, converting two third-and-longs in the process, and scoring on Smith's two-yard touchdown strike to Kelce extending the lead to 34-7, and killing any hope of a Patriots comeback. On the ensuing Patriots drive, facing a 3rd-and-4 from their own 26, Husain Abdullah intercepted a Brady pass and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving the Chiefs a 41-7 lead. Abdullah fell to his knees in a Muslim prayer, and was flagged for unnecessary roughness. This caused controversy as many thought it was for his praying. With the deficit an insurmountable 41-7, Brady was benched and rookie Jimmy Garoppolo stepped in. Garoppolo completed 3 passes on the drive: a 5-yard pass to Edelman, a 37-yard screen to LaFell, then a 13-yard touchdown pass to Rob Gronkowski, for a 41-14 score. After both teams punted, the Chiefs ran out the rest of the clock to end the game. Jamaal Charles was the main weapon of the Chiefs' offense, totaling 108 yards from scrimmage (92 rushing, 16 receiving) and three touchdowns. Knile Davis ran the ball 16 times for 107 yards. Alex Smith was 20/26 for 236 yards, 3 touchdowns, and no interceptions. The Chiefs forced three turnovers and converted them into 17 points while committing no turnovers themselves. Brady completed 14 of 23 passes for a pedestrian 159 yards, 1 touchdown and 2 interceptions while being sacked 3 times. Brandon LaFell was the sole offensive star for the Patriots, catching 6 passes for 119 yards and a touchdown. The 27 point margin of defeat represented the second largest loss for the Patriots in the Bill Belichick era (the Patriots' worst loss was a 31-point loss (31-0) to the Bills in Week 1 of the 2003 season). With the loss, the Patriots' record dropped to 2-2. In his regular press conference the ensuing Wednesday, when asked about the loss (primarily by Albert Breer) he replied with his now famous line, \\"We're on to Cincinnati\\". The Patriots would proceed to win ten of their final twelve regular season games, clinch the #1 seed, win the AFC Championship, and win the Super Bowl, making that quote a piece of Patriots lore.

In recent years, several nations across the globe have witnessed a surge in terrorist activities. As a result, they have taken a more proactive approach in dealing with instances of international terrorism. Law enforcement agencies and intelligence organizations from these countries have been working together to identify, apprehend, and prosecute individuals suspected of having ties with terrorist groups. This collaborative effort has involved sharing information, conducting investigations, and expanding surveillance efforts to monitor activities of both known and potential terrorists. The authorities have also employed advanced technologies and adopted new preventive measures to counteract the threats posed by international terrorism. These efforts together have yielded success in unearthing numerous terrorist plots, as well as in bringing those responsible to justice. The arrest and trial of individuals connected to international terrorism often present legal and procedural challenges, as competent authorities must navigate complex international laws and regulations. The countries in question must also deal with the political and diplomatic implications that could arise from such actions. As a result, the governments involved must carefully balance their national security concerns with their obligations under international law. In terms of legal proceedings, the authorities must ensure that the judiciary processes adhere to international standards on human rights and due process. Subsequently, the arrest and trials must be transparent, impartial and, in certain cases, could involve the cooperation of international legal institutions. This collaboration ensures that the rights of the accused are protected, while still allowing for the effective prosecution of the suspects. The international community has increasingly recognized the need for a cohesive response to the growing threat of terrorism. As a result, various international agreements, conventions, and resolutions have been adopted to enable better cooperation among nations. This framework allows for a more streamlined process when it comes to the arrest, extradition, and prosecution of individuals connected to international terrorism. In conclusion, the authorities in these countries have made significant strides in the ongoing battle against international terrorism. The arrest and trial of individuals associated with such acts are critical to ensuring both national and global security.

The expedition crossed the border on the night of April 21, 1919. The goals were to capture Lodeynoye Pole, Petrozavodsk and the Murmansk railroad. The troops were divided into three groups and were made up of 1000 volunteers. The southern group advanced to Lodeynoye Pole in just three days, but was pressed back behind River Tuulos by Bolshevik troops. The northern group captured Prääsä. At this time it became obvious that there weren't enough troops to complete the goals of the expedition. A new round of recruiting 2000 new volunteers was started and Mannerheim made Aarne Sihvo the new commander of the expedition.

The original statement explicitly mentions that Matter opened in September 2008, after three years of planning. Additionally, the infrastructure and concept of nightclubs and music venues in their modern context did not exist during 20 BC. The mention of its 2,600 capacity and that it was the second project for founders Cameron Leslie and Keith Reilly, further establishes the modern nature of this music venue and nightclub. Matter being the third venue to open at The O2 in south-east London also does not support the claim of its existence in 20 BC. The O2 itself is a modern entertainment district situated on the Greenwich Peninsula in London which opened in 2007, offering a range of options like music venues, night clubs, restaurants, bars, and cinemas. Precisely, the O2 being in existence merely a year prior to the opening of Matter reaffirms the timeline of Matter's establishment in 2008, rather than 20 BC. Furthermore, in 20 BC, the region we now know as London was populated by Celtic tribes, far before the Roman conquest and eventual transformation of the area into the city of Londinium, which marked the genesis of the modern city. In conclusion, based on the information provided, Matter was a London music venue and nightclub that opened in September 2008 and not in September 20 BC.

They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. I am facing a new situation today: Tim and Dan both studied reproduction in college.

Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which person studied more about the ways fish eggs develop? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Tim studied more about the ways fish eggs develop. This is because Tim specifically focused on fish reproduction during his time in college, which would include learning about the various stages of egg development and the processes involved in their fertilization and growth. On the other hand, Dan studied plant reproduction, which would involve learning about the reproductive processes unique to plants, such as pollination, fertilization, seed formation, and dispersal. While both individuals possess knowledge about reproduction in general, Tim would have a more in-depth understanding of fish egg development due to his specialized study on fish reproduction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question: When frozen it showed solidity, but as it thawed and melted it showed what? Here are possible answers to this question: - fluidity - hollowness - openness - weakness - instability I believe the correct choice is \\"fluidity\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fluidity\\". When a substance, such as water, is frozen, it becomes solid, forming a structure with rigid bonds. However, as it thaws and melts, the bonds weaken and the substance transitions from a solid to a liquid state. In its liquid form, the substance exhibits fluidity, which means it can flow and take the shape of its container. Fluidity is a property of liquids and gases where the particles are in constant motion and can easily slide past one another, allowing for flow and changes in shape. This is in contrast to solids, where particles are closely packed and have limited movement, maintaining a definite shape and structure. So, when a solid substance like ice thaws and melts, it transitions from a state of rigidity and structural stability to a state of flow and fluidity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thameslink and Great Northern are the brand names used by the Govia Thameslink Railway train operating company on the Thameslink and Great Northern routes of the Thameslink, Southern and Great Northern franchise, previously operated by First Capital Connect. Can we infer the following? Both names are used","completion":"Yes, we can infer that both Thameslink and Great Northern are brand names used by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) train operating company. The reason for using these two distinct brand names is because they each represent different routes within a larger rail network under the Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise, which is overseen by GTR. A bit of background on the companies and the franchise will help clarify this further. Govia Thameslink Railway is a train operating company in the United Kingdom, which is a joint venture between the British transport company Go-Ahead Group and the French transport company Keolis. GTR was awarded the Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern (TSGN) franchise in 2014 and started operating services under this franchise in September of the same year. Before GTR was awarded the franchise, First Capital Connect was responsible for operating the train services along these routes. The TSGN franchise is extensive and includes several services covering a vast area in the southeast of England served by a complex network of rail lines. The franchise encompasses around 20% of all passenger rail services in the United Kingdom. To make it clear to passengers which services are being operated in each area, different brand names have been maintained or introduced: 1. Thameslink: This brand name is used for services operating along the Thameslink route, a central rail artery that connects cities and towns north and south of London. Thameslink services run between Bedford in the north, Brighton in the south, and several other locations such as Luton, Sutton, and Orpington. The Thameslink route passes directly through the heart of London, with trains calling at key stations like St. Pancras International, Farringdon, and Blackfriars. 2. Great Northern: This brand name refers to the services operating along the Great Northern route, which serves destinations north of London and is mainly focused on commuter services into the capital. The route primarily consists of two lines—the East Coast Main Line (ECML) from London King's Cross to Peterborough and the Hertford Loop Line, which branches off the ECML towards Stevenage. The Great Northern route serves locations such as Cambridge, Ely, King's Lynn, and Hertford North. In conclusion, both Thameslink and Great Northern are distinct brand names used by Govia Thameslink Railway (GTR) to represent train services and routes within the larger Thameslink, Southern, and Great Northern franchise. The use of these two brand names on their respective routes allows passengers to easily identify the services they are using and differentiates the services in the southeast region of England's rail network."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Four fixtures are to be staged in 2016, with more next year. Hereford was shut in 2012 after 241 years of racing - the first recorded meeting there was in August 1771. ARC director of external affairs Susannah Gill told BBC Sport the decision \\"shows our commitment to all racing\\". When it closed Hereford, the company said the venue was no longer viable, citing the recession and the rise of internet betting on other sports. It also said investing in the course was difficult because it only had a 17-year lease from Herefordshire Council. Despite closing the course, ARC kept hold of the lease but has so far not been able to reach an agreement with the authority over it. Gill said: \\"There's no deal over the lease with the local council yet, but we said to prove that we wanted to do business we are going to re-open the track. \\"There will be four fixtures moved to Hereford from within the ARC group from October, and then we plan 12 more in 2017. \\"Relations with the council were, as you can imagine, frosty for a while after Hereford closed, but we went to them last summer and said there's a new face at the top and we want to do business.\\" BBC racing correspondent Cornelius Lysaght When ARC closed down Hereford and Folkestone, for which there are no re-opening plans, it was the first time any long-established track had been shut in over 30 years. The Hereford decision was especially controversial as it followed a confusing dispute with the local authority over the lease, which ARC then refused to release.

Generate a question that has the following answer: Meinhof for the following movie plot: The film begins on a nude beach in Germany in the late 1960s, where we are introduced to Ulrike Meinhoff, a respected journalist, and her family. Meinhoff and her husband are then guests at a party, where Meinhoff reads off a periodical that she wrote about the injustice of the Iranian Government. With the Shah of Persia arriving into Berlin, there is a rally in the streets, where half the people are protesting the injustice and the other half are praising. As the protesting goes on, the Iranian people end up going into the crowd and fighting the innocent German protesters with the help of the German Police; leaving many injured and a man killed. The next scene is of Meinhoff at a television studio arguing why she favors the protesters side instead of the Governments side, and watching the live recording on her television is Gudrun Ensslin, another activist. She explains to her parents how American Imperialism is completely corrupt while Meinhoff walks in on her husband having sex with another woman. Next, we are introduced to Andreas Baader, the ringleader of these revolutionaries who decide to name themselves The Red Army Faction (RAF). Their first major rebellious occurrence takes place in a department store, where they decide to set home made bombs and light it on fire. On a television broadcast we are informed of the many student protests at universities across America and of protests in West Germany, being led by Rudi Dutschke. The film then cuts to a famous rally where Dutschke announced his views on the protest and wars occurring around the world, trying to spark everyone to join their resistance. Rudi Dutschke is then almost assassinated by a man who is accused to be from the Springer Group, which is tied to the German Government. In effect, many activists go to the Springer Group headquarters and riot. As we see there are many demonstrating protesters rioting around the world, Baader and Ensslin are in court confessing about the department store fires. As her parents discuss how they are surprised...

It implies that the speaker has an appreciative view of the film in a way that various aspects of the movie are being applauded. Here's a breakdown of the different elements of the sentence that contribute to its overall positive sentiment: 1. \\"so meditative and lyrical\\": This phrase demonstrates a strong emotional appreciation for the film's qualities, suggesting that it encourages contemplation and has a poetic touch in its storytelling. These terms hold positive connotations, indicating that the speaker values the artful approach taken by Babak Payami. 2. \\"boldly quirky\\": This descriptor, again, praises Babak Payami's work by appreciating the originality and unconventional nature of his Iranian drama. The use of \\"boldly\\" implies that the quirkiness is embraced, emphasizing the brave creative choices made in this drama. 3. \\"charming and evoking\\": Referring to the described \\"little ditty,\\" the speaker seems to appreciate the appealing and emotionally engaging attributes of the film. \\"Charming\\" denotes a pleasant and attractive quality, while \\"evoking\\" implies that the film successfully elicits emotions or memories from its audience. 4. \\"manages to show\\": This phrase suggests that the film effectively brings attention to aspects that might not be commonly associated with Middle Eastern world politics.

Quantities for each ingredient will vary, dependent on the size and amount of candles you plan to make. However, half a pound of wax equals to 10-12 small candles, and candles only require one wick each. You should check your mould tray for a point of reference if you're unsure about quantity. Paraffin wax. Half a pound of wax should serve you well for a home set of candles. If you're feeling thrifty however, you can melt down old candles into fresh wax. Drops of essential oil. These are essential, and can be used if you want to give your candles a scent. Only a couple of drops per candle will be needed to get the scent. Baking tray mould. The size of your mould will determine how large the candles will be. Small muffin candles will burn for approximately one hour. Large muffin tray candles will go on for about three. Tart moulds and cookie cutters can be used as well for this, so long as there's a moulded slot for a candle to settle in. Pretabbed candle wicks. Making sure to get pretabbed wicks can take some of the hassle out of adding them into the wax. Dye chips. Dye chips are specifically made for use in homemade candles. They're small, but effective, so you'll probably only need around one per candle. You can eyeball the effects of the dye chips as you add them. Dye chips will give your candles a pleasant colour. One dye chip per pound of wax should be enough to ensure a bold colour. It's important to add your dye while the candles are heated. That way, they'll be able to disperse throughout the wax with stirring. Dye chips are designed specifically for use in DIY candle-making, so they tend to mix with wax very well. Mix it in with a wooden spoon to ensure the dye is consistent in the candles. Essential oils are added for the sake of scent, and should be added to the pot as soon as you've turned off the heat. Paraffin wax needs to be 150 degrees Fahrenheit in order to be ready for pouring. If you have a thermometer at hand, place it in the wax and gauge the temperature. Check the consistency periodically. You can do this by placing a wooden spoon in the boiler pitcher and gently stirring the wax around. If you don't have a thermometer, wait until a thin film forms around the edges of your pitcher. If you don't coat your mould with cooking spray or petroleum jelly before hand, your candles will put up a hassle when you try to take them out. Because you'll ultimately be taking them up held by their fragile wick, you'll want to minimize that resistance early on. Excessive spray isn't necessary. Just make sure the bottom of each mould slot is evenly sprayed. Being thorough at this stage prevents hassle later down the road. Once the wicks have set, candles take up to two hours to harden completely. Set them aside, and occupy your time with something else while they settle.","completion":"To make candles, you need to buy some ingredients like wax, wicks, essential oil, dye chips, and a baking tray mould from a craft store. You'll make candles by melting the wax, adding a little bit of color and scent, then pouring it into a mould with a wick in it. Make sure to spray the mould with cooking spray so the candles come out easily. When the wax has cooled for two hours, your candles are ready to use!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Jacqueline Woodson's big win at the National Book Awards on Wednesday was briefly eclipsed by a racially charged joke. After Woodson accepted an award for her memoir \\"Brown Girl Dreaming,\\" host Daniel Handler shared an anecdote he learned over the summer: that Woodson, who is black, is allergic to watermelon. \\"Just let that sink in your mind,\\" said Handler, who writes popular children's books under the pen name Lemony Snicket. The non sequitur elicited a few laughs and uncomfortable titters from the audience. Handler went on to say that he advised Woodson to write a book that featured a black girl with a watermelon allergy. Watermelon is historically evoked as a favorite food among black people in racist jokes, and it's considered by many to be an offensive reference. Handler said that Woodson, who won the National Book Award for Young People's Literature, told him he should write the book instead. \\"I'm only writing a book about a black girl who is allergic to watermelon if I get a blurb from you, Cornell West, Toni Morrison, and Barack Obama saying this guy's OK,\\" Handler said, with a laugh. After a clip from the awards ceremony was posed on C-SPAN, viewers and some prominent writers quickly took to Twitter to denounce Handler's comments as racist and a distraction from Woodson's accomplishment. Handler responded with several apologetic tweets, including: \\"My remarks on Wednesday night at #NBAwards were monstrously inappropriate and yes, racist.\\" Handler also pledged to donate 10,000 to the We Need Diverse Books campaign and match others' donations for 24 hours up to 100,000. Woodson's post-ceremony social media posts have expressed her happiness about the award and have not mentioned Handler's joke. The author did not respond to a request for comment on the incident.

But he gave up that dream and settled for building it inside the city limits. Where might he have built it? Possible A: suburbs, in the pond, residential area, newspaper, surface of earth Why is \\"residential area\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"To determine why \\"residential area\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense, let's analyze each potential answer step by step: 1. Suburbs: While the suburbs can be considered as an area close to the city, it is usually positioned outside of the city limits, which contradicts Johnny's final decision of building the house inside the city limits. 2. In the pond: Building a house \\"in the pond\\" is not a suitable choice, as it does not align with human common sense to construct a house in a body of water. 3. Residential area: A residential area is a section within a city that is primarily intended for housing. This answer aligns with human common sense because Johnny decided to build his house inside the city limits, and a residential area within the city would be an appropriate place to do so. 4. Newspaper: A newspaper is not a physical location where someone could build a house; it is an information medium. Choosing the newspaper as the answer does not align with human common sense. 5. Surface of the earth: While this answer is technically correct since all houses are built on the surface of the earth, it is too broad and vague to address the specific details provided in the question (i.e., building inside the city limits). Considering these points, \\"residential area\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because it satisfies the specific requirements of Johnny's decision to build a house inside the city limits while also being a suitable and functional location for housing."},{"prompt":"A funeral for Zbigniew Brzezinski, the national security adviser to President Jimmy Carter and a noted foreign policy expert and thinker, will be held Friday at St. Matthew's Roman Catholic Cathedral in Washington, D.C. Brzezinski died May 26 in Virginia. He was 86. In a statement, Carter called Brzezinski “a superb public servant” as well as “brilliant, dedicated and loyal.” Along with Henry Kissinger, Brzezinski helped shape U.S. foreign policy with a lasting impact, while also serving as an adviser to Presidents Lyndon Johnson and John F. Kennedy. One of his most well-known accomplishments came in 1978, when Brzezinski helped President Carter reach an agreement between Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and Egyptian President Anwar Sadat to secure the Camp David peace accords between the two countries. He also was involved in making other major U.S. foreign policy decisions during the Carter administration, including negotiating the Panama Canal Treaty, arming mujahedin in Afghanistan to fight the Soviet invaders and planning a failed mission to rescue 52 American hostages held in Iran.

But the story of this singular artist, who was so unlucky and unwise in life, fell into the right hands after she died. What’s familiar in Mr. Kapadia’s film is only the framework for an enthralling study of why Amy Winehouse didn’t, and/or couldn’t, reconcile her blazing talent with her deepest yearnings. The nature of that talent soon comes clear in the home videos and assorted clips that the filmmaker has assembled like mosaic fragments in his own intricately detailed work of art. Amy, a smart, troubled girl from an unstable Jewish family in North London, was one of those blessed kids with a big, rich voice that soared forth seemingly on its own; all she had to do was open her mouth. She adored jazz, along with pop, listening to and learning from Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Thelonious Monk, and then, later, James Taylor and Carole King. As you watch her connect professionally, though—with record companies, would-be managers, other young musicians—it’s clear that her love of jazz won’t be able to compete with the seductions, and extravagant rewards, of pop celebrity. Onward and upward she goes, encouraged by success and fueled by booze and drugs. Cocaine makes an early appearance in those shaky home videos. Danger enters her life in the person of her boyfriend and later her husband, Blake Fielder, a soul mate in narcotic and other self-destructive urges. (“I cut my wrists when I was 9 years old,” he says by way of self-ingratiation.) The cast of unsupporting characters is chillingly large: Mr. Fielder was far from the only one who facilitated, catalyzed or accelerated Amy’s terrifying fall. (Her father, Mitch Winehouse, earns a special place in this group with his purblind eagerness to keep her working—and earning—in the face of ever more alarming evidence of her fragility.) But Amy was her own woman, in her own creative world, and one of Mr. Kapadia’s most inspired strokes in this valuable documentary is to put her lyrics on screen as she sings them, so we can see for ourselves the essential elements of her songs as they reflected, and intertwined with, her tumultuous life. That her lyrics are poetic goes without singing; that they resonated with her public is affirmed by her honors and revenue. Reading them on screen, though, one is also struck by how inward her gaze was, how repetitive her references—to love and lost love, to pain, to bleak fate. Those are familiar themes in pop culture, of course, but they became imprisoning themes as Amy grew more and more bewildered by the tumult of her life, and the menacing possibilities of her career. One of her friends, the hip-hop artist and performer Mos Def, recounts in the film that she once asked him, “What am I supposed to do in this space?” That’s a haunting thing for her to have said, and the film offers a haunting answer in a clip of Amy doing a duet with Tony Bennett. Of all people, Tony Bennett! He’s a paragon of modesty, clarity and longevity, and she knows it. She knows it so well she can barely pull herself together to sing with this man she reveres. More to the point of her question, he’s a pure spirit, and when their voices join, she is, however briefly, the pure spirit she once was, and the moment they share is about nothing but pure, sweet music. “Life teaches you how to live it if you live long enough,” Mr. Bennett says. She didn’t live long enough. This thrilling documentary, directed by Asif Kapadia, recounts the career of Ayrton Senna (1960-1994), a Formula 1 driver of legendary skill and courage and a national hero in his native Brazil. The film opens almost quaintly with a home-movie sequence of a very young Senna, in his first race abroad, steering a squat little go-kart around a European track. “It was pure driving, pure racing,” we hear him recall elegiacally. That sets the tone for what’s to come, a celebration of a singular spirit in an impure sport. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text focus on the review of \\"Amy,\\" a documentary film by Asif Kapadia about the life and untimely death of English singer-songwriter Amy Winehouse. The review highlights her extraordinary talent, unstable Jewish family in North London, and influences such as Dinah Washington, Sarah Vaughan, Thelonious Monk, James Taylor, and Carole King. It sheds light on her substance abuse, questionable relationships like the one with her husband Blake Fielder, and the enabling behavior of people around her, including her father Mitch Winehouse. The insightful method of showing her lyrics on screen to reveal her internal struggles in her art is mentioned as one of the strong points of the documentary. Additionally, the review discusses her poignant duet with Tony Bennett as an example of her pure musical spirit.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment.

It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow.

Information: - Virginia (, officially the Commonwealth of Virginia) is a state located in the Mid-Atlantic region of the United States, as well as in the historic Southeast. Virginia is nicknamed the \\"Old Dominion\\" due to its status as the first colonial possession established in mainland British America, and \\"Mother of Presidents\\" because eight U.S. presidents were born there, more than any other state. The geography and climate of the Commonwealth are shaped by the Blue Ridge Mountains and the Chesapeake Bay, which provide habitat for much of its flora and fauna. The capital of the Commonwealth is Richmond; Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision. The Commonwealth's estimated population is over 8.3 million, which is slightly less than New York City. - The Kentucky Supreme Court was created by a 1975 constitutional amendment and is the state supreme court of the U.S. state of Kentucky. Prior to that the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. The Kentucky Court of Appeals is now Kentucky's intermediate appellate court. - The Kentucky House of Representatives is the lower house of the Kentucky General Assembly. It is composed of 100 Representatives elected from single-member districts throughout the Commonwealth. Not more than two counties can be joined to form a House district, except when necessary to preserve the principle of equal representation. Representatives are elected to two-year terms with no term limits. The Kentucky House of Representatives convenes at the State Capitol in Frankfort. - Pennsylvania (Pennsylvania German: \\"Pennsylvaani\\"), officially the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, is a state located in the northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. The Appalachian Mountains run through its middle. The commonwealth borders Delaware to the southeast, Maryland to the south, West Virginia to the southwest, Ohio to the west, Lake Erie and the Canadian province of Ontario to the northwest, New York to the north, and New Jersey to the east. - The Kentucky General Assembly, also called the Kentucky Legislature, is the state legislature of the U.S. state of Kentucky. - An appellate court, commonly called an appeals court, court of appeals (American English), appeal court (British English), court of second instance or second instance court, is any court of law that is empowered to hear an appeal of a trial court or other lower tribunal. In most jurisdictions, the court system is divided into at least three levels: the trial court, which initially hears cases and reviews evidence and testimony to determine the facts of the case; at least one intermediate appellate court; and a supreme court (or court of last resort) which primarily reviews the decisions of the intermediate courts. A jurisdiction's supreme court is that jurisdiction's highest appellate court. Appellate courts nationwide can operate by varying rules. - Kentucky, officially the Commonwealth of Kentucky, is a state located in the east south-central region of the United States. Kentucky is one of four U.S. states constituted as a commonwealth (the others being Virginia, Pennsylvania, and Massachusetts). Originally a part of Virginia, in 1792 Kentucky became the 15th state to join the Union. Kentucky is the 37th most extensive and the 26th most populous of the 50 United States. - James Clark ( January 16 , 1779 -- August 27 , 1839 ) was a 19th - century American politician who served in all three branches of Kentucky 's government and in the U.S. House of Representatives . His political career began in the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1807 . In 1810 , he was appointed to the Kentucky Court of Appeals , where he served for two years before resigning to pursue a seat in the U.S. House of Representatives . He served two terms in that body , resigning in 1816 . Clark accepted an appointment to the circuit court of Bourbon and Clark counties in 1817 . It was in this capacity that the most defining event of his career occurred . In 1822 , he struck down a debt relief law in the case of Williams v. Blair on the basis that it impeded the obligation of contracts . His decision was unpopular with the legislature , who condemned the ruling and summoned Clark to appear before them and defend it . An attempt by the legislature to remove him from office fell short of the needed two - thirds majority . The following year , the Kentucky Court of Appeals upheld Clark 's ruling . In retaliation , the legislature attempted to abolish the court and create a new one more sympathetic to their views . This event and its aftermath became known as the Old Court - New Court controversy . In 1825 , Clark was chosen to fill the congressional seat vacated by Henry Clay 's elevation to Secretary of State . He served until 1831 , but did not seek re-election that year . He became active in organizing the Whig Party in Kentucky and was rewarded for his efforts by being chosen as the party 's nominee for governor in 1836 . He won the election and laid out an ambitious platform to the legislature , which acted on only part of it . Clark 's most significant accomplishment as governor was securing the creation of a state board of education and the establishment of public schools in every county in the state .

Prior to a 1975 amendment to the Kentucky Constitution the Kentucky Court of Appeals was the only appellate court in Kentucky. - Massachusetts ; officially the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, is the most populous state in the New England region of the northeastern United States. It is bordered by the Atlantic Ocean to the east, the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island to the south, New Hampshire and Vermont to the north, and New York to the west. The state is named for the Massachusett tribe, which once inhabited the area. The capital of Massachusetts and the most populous city in New England is Boston. Over 80% of Massachusetts' population lives in the Greater Boston metropolitan area, a region influential upon American history, academia, and industry. Originally dependent on agriculture, fishing and trade, Massachusetts was transformed into a manufacturing center during the Industrial Revolution. During the 20th century, Massachusetts' economy shifted from manufacturing to services. Modern Massachusetts is a global leader in biotechnology, engineering, higher education, finance, and maritime trade. - A U.S. state is a constituent political entity of the United States of America. There are 50 states, which are bound together in a union with each other. Each state holds administrative jurisdiction over a defined geographic territory, and shares its sovereignty with the United States federal government.

Here is an article: WADI RUM, Jordan — Hitched up in the sandy lot by the police station, next to the four-by-four trucks and the dune buggy, is some other important equipment for enforcing the law in this parched and forbidding desert valley: eight surly and perpetually masticating camels. Six of the towering beasts are saddled up regularly for patrol by the local police to reach rugged areas or to show off for tourists. The other two are thoroughbred racing camels, males, kept around to provide another kind of service. “Any resident who wants to bring his lady camel by can come,” said Kayed Nasser, a handler in the station’s camel unit. “It’s a free service that we provide to citizens.” This is the local station of Jordan’s Royal Desert Forces, a 4,000-man-strong branch of the national police force that is responsible for monitoring and patrolling the sparsely populated desert areas that cover four-fifths of this Middle Eastern monarchy. The force is descended from a camel corps founded in the 1920s, when Britain, which had a mandate to rule the area, separated the region of Transjordan from Palestine. The force evolved after Jordan’s independence in 1946, relying more heavily on trucks and surveillance technology. Today, the camel patrols are a small, but still important, part of the Royal Desert Forces’ efforts to catch smugglers, track down stolen cars and keep family feuds from turning murderous. The force’s officers hail from Jordan’s Bedouin tribes, meaning that they know how to operate in the desert and how to navigate the intricate social codes of the hundreds of thousands of Bedouin who live in those areas. “The child of the city does not know how to interact with the Bedouin who live in the desert,” said Capt. Enad al-Jazi, a Bedouin and the deputy chief of the Wadi Rum station. “We do,” he said, although he now spends more time in a four-by-four truck than on camelback. The makeup of the force also sheds light on one factor that has helped maintain relative stability in Jordan, a key Arab ally of the United States, despite the turmoil roiling its neighbors. Throughout its history, the monarchy of Jordan has not only maintained good relationships with the country’s tribes, it has also built them into the structure of the state by heavily recruiting their members into the army and security services, analysts say. This has to do with Jordan’s past, which has left its eight million citizens split between “East Bankers,” or native Jordanians, and “West Bankers,” or the descendants of Palestinians displaced by the creation of Israel and its subsequent wars with its Arab neighbors. Jordan’s rulers have long seen those descendants of Palestinians, who tend to care less about the monarchy, as a demographic threat to their rule, according to Ora Szekely, an associate professor of political science at Clark University in Massachusetts, who studies Jordan. This sentiment increased after Black September, the violent battle that began in 1970 between the Jordanian Army and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Thousands were killed, but the monarchy won and expelled the P.L.O. from the kingdom. “This cemented the decision and convinced the monarchy that the only people they could trust were the East Bankers,” Dr. Szekely said, “and especially the Bedouin.” Since then, the ruling family has heavily stocked the security services with East Bankers who get perks like pensions and education benefits for their children, ensuring that entire families remain invested in the monarchy’s survival, Dr. Szekely said. The importance of those ties between the tribes and the state has become more clear with the rise of the jihadists of the Islamic State in neighboring Iraq. Since the American invasion in 2003 ushered in a Shiite-led government in Baghdad, the relationship between the state and the Sunni tribes has been battered, and many blame the discriminatory policies of former Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki for enraging the country’s Sunnis. Some have outright joined the Islamic State, also known as ISIS or ISIL; others oppose its ideology but are happy to see it fight the government. Still others have taken up arms to fight it and accuse the state of giving them little help. The difference of the Jordanian approach is clear to many here. “In Iraq, Maliki oppressed the Sunnis, so they said, ‘Let ISIS come in and wreck their homes,' ” said Mr. Jazi, the deputy police chief. “Here in Jordan, the tribes are the nerves of the state.” Though some signs of support for ISIS have cropped up in Jordan, the group is not known to have an operational presence here. Analysts note that many other factors, too, have shaped the two countries’ fates. For one, Jordan, which is almost all Sunni, lacks the sectarian divisions that have proved explosive in Syria and Iraq. Jordan’s monarchs have also mostly opted for more moderate means of dealing with internal dissent, making small political concessions instead of resorting to the mass killings of President Saddam Hussein in Iraq or President Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The biggest proof that Jordan’s approach has succeeded — at least so far — is this: “Jordan is still there,” Dr. Szekely said. Elements of that durability were clear in the Wadi Rum station and in the career of Mr. Jazi, its deputy chief. Welcoming a guest to a desert campfire where his men served rounds of tea and baked flatbread on hot coals, Mr. Jazi, 44, said he had joined the Desert Forces at age 16 and served on all of Jordan’s borders. Most of his work had involved tracking men smuggling cigarettes, drugs, electronics and weapons between Jordan and its neighbors, an often hazardous job. His brother Atallah, who had also served in the force, was killed in 1991 in a shootout near the Iraqi border, Mr. Jazi said. On occasion, Mr. Jazi’s unit had joined the riot police to break up demonstrations in Jordan’s cities, work he considers part of serving King Abdullah II, the official head of the Desert Forces. Photos of the king, dressed in a traditional Bedouin police uniform with red bandoleers crossing his chest and a silver dagger protruding from his belt, hang prominently in the force’s stations. Much had changed, Mr. Jazi said, since the days when the deserts lacked roads and phone coverage and when officers did multiday camel patrols carrying only lentils, flour, ghee and powdered milk — sleeping with their camels around wood fires. Now, Jordan’s army staffs most of the borders, and Mr. Jazi and his men work in trucks, or by cellphone. One afternoon, a colleague called to tell him that four officers had been speeding in the desert when they got a flat fire and flipped their vehicle. All were unharmed, so Mr. Jazi dispatched a crew in another truck to retrieve them. Later, his officers caught some Bedouins hunting without a license. They confiscated the poachers’ rifle, wrote them a court summons and released a falcon they had trapped and a pigeon they were using for bait, Mr. Jazi said. He and his men spend little time in their boxy white police station, preferring to drink tea and gossip with the Bedouin who come by to visit in the red and black tent pitched on the lawn. The camels rest nearby. All have names as well as official government numbers branded into their necks, like license plates. One was captured laden with drugs near the border with Israel and turned over to the force after its owner was jailed. The station’s officers acknowledge that technology has largely made the camels unnecessary but say that the force of tradition keeps them there. “They are the heritage passed down from our grandparents,” said Mr. Nasser, one of the camel handlers. “And we love them.” An earlier version of this article misidentified one of the items that officers of Jordan’s Royal Desert Forces used to carry during multiday camel patrols. They carried ghee, not lard. Ranya Kadri contributed reporting from Amman, Jordan.

After the nuclear fusion occurs, tremendous amounts of energy in the form of photons (light particles) are produced. These photons carry the energy generated by the nuclear reactions from the core of the Sun. 2. These photons then travel through the Sun's radiative zone, a thick layer adjacent to the core. The energy transfer in this zone is predominantly by radiation, and the photons bounce around, gradually making their way outwards. 3. Once the photons reach the convective zone, they continue their journey through convection currents, which transport heat from the inner layers of the Sun to the surface layer (photosphere). This process involves the rising of hot plasma towards the surface and the sinking of cooler plasma back to the inner layers. 4. Upon reaching the photosphere, the photons are finally emitted as visible light and other forms of electromagnetic radiation, such as ultraviolet and infrared rays.

Here is a news article: Apple lost its title as the most valuable company in the world on Friday. Apple's market cap plummeted below 420 billion on Friday after a disappointing earnings report earlier in the week, allowing Exxon Mobil to regain its title as the most valuable company by market cap. Apple ended the day with a market cap of 413 billion, about 5 billion less than Exxon's market cap. The Cupertino company first overtook Exxon in August, 2011, just a few weeks before Steve Jobs resigned as CEO and has held onto it firmly starting in January. Under the leadership of his successor Tim Cook, Apple's market cap continued to grow on the strength of the company's product lineup. At its peak after the iPhone 5 was released in September, Apple's market cap was 656 billion — about 240 billion more than Exxon at the time. Since then, however, Apple's stock has been plagued by iPhone 5 sales concerns, a shakeup in the company's executive leadership and increasing competition in the smartphone and tablet markets, most notably from Samsung. On Wednesday, Apple reported generating record revenue in the December quarter, but it fell short of analysts' sales estimates for iPhone and iPad. Perhaps more importantly, the company's profits were effectively unchanged from the same quarter a year ago, adding to investors' concerns that the days of Apple's incredible profit growth are coming to an end. Part of the reason Apple's stock and market cap soared as much as it did was the expectation that the company had more innovative products in the pipeline that would help it break into new markets. Now, according to Forrester analyst Charles Golvin, Wall Street appears to be settling into lower expectations for the company, with the stock's price dropping accordingly. \\"It's a reality check on inflated expectations,\\" Golvin says, referring to the significance of Apple losing its top spot for market value. \\"I don't think it's a portent or a harbinger of diminished impact of Apple on the market.\\" Beyond that, Golvin says that the milestone may be indicative that Apple is no longer miles ahead of its competition. \\"While they are still an 800 pound gorilla and bringing tremendous innovation and new experiences to consumers, others are starting to catch up to them a little bit and having some influence where they didn't before.\\" Apple may be fighting for its position as the most valuable company in the world, but it is still far and away the most valuable tech company. Google and Microsoft, the second and third most valuable tech companies, each have market values around 250 billion. Even so, it's a sharp reversal for a company that some thought was on pace to become the world's first trillion-dollar business.

Exxon has once again surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company after the iPhone and iPad maker saw its... (Associated Press) Exxon has once again surpassed Apple as the world's most valuable company after the iPhone and iPad maker saw its stock price falter. Apple Inc.'s stock has been on the decline since the company's quarterly earnings report Wednesday suggested that its fast growth phase, rare for a company of its size, may be coming to an end. Apple's stock dropped 2.4 percent to 439.51 in midday trading Friday for a market capitalization of 412.7 billion. That followed a 12 percent drop on Thursday, the biggest one-day percentage drop for the company since 2008. Exxon Mobil Corp. gained 22 cents Friday to 91.57 for a market capitalization of 417.5 billion. Apple first surpassed Exxon in the summer of 2011. The two companies traded places through that fall, until Apple surpassed Exxon for good in early 2012 _ at least until Friday. Apple's stock price peaked in September at 705.07 on the day the iPhone 5 was released. Exxon, in the meantime, has been trading steady. Its business _ oil _ seems less prone to stock market ups and downs than the Cupertino, Calif.-based tech darling. This year, investors seem unforgiving with Apple, looking for perfection and punishing the stock for anything less. The company's stock price slipped below 500 for the first time last week, as investors saw signs that the iPhone 5 was falling behind competition from phones running Google's Android software, especially those from Samsung Electronics Co. The latest quarterly report added to the concerns. Apple warned that its revenue growth, which had been running at a speed more reminiscent of promising startups than multi-national corporations, is slowing down considerably. A big reason: It has been nearly three years since a new product has come from a company still seen as the embodiment of innovation. That last product, the iPad, came in 2010, when its CEO Steve Jobs was still alive. Some analysts question whether Apple can keep growing by just releasing new versions of its old products. The long-rumored Apple TV, is still just that, a rumor. ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"Apple lost its title as the most valuable company in the world on Friday, as its market cap fell below 420 billion following a disappointing earnings report.

Ionescu's attitude was based on several key principles: 1. National unity: Ionescu emphasized the importance of bringing together all Romanians under a unified nation. He supported the concept of \\"Greater Romania\\" which aimed to unite all Romanian-speaking territories. This idea materialized with the creation of Greater Romania following World War I, when Romania gained substantial territories, doubling its size. 2. Social order: Ionescu advocated for a hierarchical society to maintain stability and order. He believed that each person played a designated role, and respecting these social hierarchies was essential for the smooth functioning of the nation. Like many conservatives of his time, Ionescu viewed political stability as a crucial aspect of a prosperous society. 3. Preservation of cultural heritage: Ionescu championed the preservation of Romanian culture and tradition. He was deeply concerned with the impact of rapid modernization and industrialization on traditional values and sought to protect and promote Romanian customs, history, and the national identity. 4. Religion: As a conservative, Ionescu held strong Christian Orthodox beliefs, which formed the foundation of his traditional values. He believed in the central role of the Orthodox Church in shaping and preserving Romania's national identity and spiritual well-being. 5. Constitutional monarchy: Ionescu was a firm supporter of the constitutional monarchy, believing that it provided the right balance between the authorities of the monarchy and the power of the elected parliament. This belief was rooted in his conviction that a strong, central authority was necessary to maintain national stability and protect Romanian interests. In conclusion, Take Ionescu was a proponent of an attitude grounded in traditionalism and conservatism, with national unity, social order, and preservation of cultural heritage at its core. This was complemented by his beliefs in the importance of religion and the constitutional monarchy as a means of achieving a stable, prosperous Romania. As a result, Ionescu's attitudes continue to be influential in discussions of Romanian politics and national identity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In another field, that of literary and art criticism, the correlative topos is classicism: here, a canon of time-tested norms and corresponding names form the base on which the critic can stand. Translate to German","completion":"In einem anderen Bereich, nämlich dem der literarischen und kunstkritischen Betrachtung, ist das korrelative Thema der Klassizismus: Hier bildet ein Kanon aus bewährten Normen und entsprechenden Namen die Grundlage, auf der sich der Kritiker positionieren kann. In der Literatur- und Kunstkritik wird der Klassizismus als korrelatives Motiv betrachtet. Ein Kanon aus etablierten Regeln und dazugehörigen berühmten Namen bildet hier die Basis, auf der sich der Kritiker stützen kann. In diesem Zusammenhang ist es entscheidend, dass der Kritiker das historisch bewährte Regelwerk und die damit verbundenen repräsentativen Namen kennt und anerkennt, um eine fundierte und qualifizierte Bewertung und Analyse abgeben zu können. Die Auseinandersetzung mit dem Klassizismus ermöglicht es dem Kritiker, zeitlose ästhetische Standards und grundlegende Prinzipien der Literatur und Kunst zu erfassen und in seinen Urteilen zu berücksichtigen. Dabei stehen insbesondere die Werke der Antike und der Renaissance als künstlerische und literarische Referenzpunkte im Mittelpunkt des klassizistischen Denkens. In der Auseinandersetzung mit der literarischen und philosophischen Tradition des Klassizismus sind verschiedene Aspekte zu berücksichtigen. Dazu zählen unter anderem die Nachahmung der Natur, die Wahrung der Einheit von Zeit, Ort und Handlung, die Betonung von Ordnung, Harmonie und Klarheit sowie die Orientierung an idealen Vorbildern und humanistischen Idealen. Der Kritiker, der sich auf den Klassizismus bezieht, sieht sich somit in der Verantwortung, den künstlerischen und literarischen Ausdruck sowie die ästhetischen Grundsätze, die in den Werken der klassischen Autoren und Künstler zum Ausdruck kommen, in der Bewertung des aktuellen Schaffens zu berücksichtigen und zu würdigen. Dabei geht es nicht nur darum, die konkreten Regeln und Vorgaben des klassizistischen Kanons anzuwenden und abzuwägen, sondern auch eine Verbindung zur übergeordneten künstlerischen Tradition und dem geistigen Erbe der klassischen Kultur zu ziehen. Insgesamt spielt der Klassizismus in der Literatur- und Kunstkritik eine wichtige Rolle, um die Qualität und Bedeutung von künstlerischen und literarischen Werken im Hinblick auf zeitlose ästhetische Prinzipien und sowohl materielle als auch immaterielle Werte zu bewerten und einzuordnen. Der Bezug auf den klassizistischen Kanon ermöglicht dem Kritiker, sich in einer lange etablierten künstlerischen und literarischen Tradition zu verorten und sich gleichzeitig auf ein breites Spektrum an wissenschaftlichen und philosophischen Diskursen zu stützen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking.\\" true if \\"A group of people are walking.\\"?","completion":"To determine if the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking\\" is true when given \\"A group of people are walking,\\" I will follow these steps: Step 1: Identify the key components within each statement. In the first statement, the key components are: a) group b) random pedestrians c) walking In the second statement, the key components are: a) group b) people c) walking Step 2: Compare the key components to find any differences or similarities. Both statements mention a \\"group\\" and \\"walking.\\" This shows that there is some correlation between these two statements. However, the first statement specifies \\"random pedestrians,\\" while the second statement simply states \\"people.\\" Step 3: Analyze the differences to determine if the premise holds. The difference lies in the description of who is walking. The first statement implies that these pedestrians are random, which might suggest they don't necessarily know each other or have any other particular connection. The second statement only specifies that it is a group of people walking, but it doesn't provide any context about their relationship or the nature of their walking. Conclusion: Given the information provided, we cannot definitively determine if the premise \\"A group of random pedestrians walking\\" is true when given \\"A group of people are walking.\\" The second statement has a broader scope and doesn't provide enough specific information about the relationship between the people or the context in which they are walking."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

While walking by Minnie Mouse's house one day, Mickey Mouse is enticed by the aroma of a cake Minnie is baking. Promised a slice if he cleans the yard, Mickey immediately jumps into raking up the fall leaves littering Minnie's lawn. While working in the yard, a small tornado as tall as Mickey comes along and makes his work more complicated: first the youngster hops into the basket and leaps over Mickey countless times before he pounds the basket in place, shaking it to check if it's snared. After he throws the leaves in, the child pounces on him, spins him around, grabs his hat, and taunts him. Angered, Mickey pounces on the youngster, who spins him around and scoots away, leaving Mickey's hat on his head. Both Mickey and the youngster have a tug'o'war on the basket until it shatters on Mickey, who is entangled. Then, the child makes an army of leaves and marches around the house. Mickey manages to trap the child with a sack, which he ties and punts away. The tornadoling retaliates with just 2 punches, then attempts to get away, with Mickey hot on his heels. As Mickey chases him with a rake the terrified child calls out for help. The mother tornado, unamused with Mickey tormenting her offspring (and unaware of what her child has been doing to Mickey), furiously pursues him with a look of relentlessness on her face.

Sir Gus O’Donnell wrote in the Political Quarterly. He questioned free bus passes and prescriptions for the elderly. Lord O’Donnell served three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Lord Gus O'Donnell Calls into Question Free Bus Passes and Prescriptions for the Elderly Introduction: In a recent article written in the Political Quarterly, Lord Gus O'Donnell, who served as Cabinet Secretary under three prime ministers from 2005 to 2011, raised questions about the sustainability and efficacy of providing free bus passes and prescriptions to the elderly. As a key advisor and government official, Lord O'Donnell's concerns carry significant weight and have the potential to incite debate on this policy matter. Step 1: Provide background on Lord Gus O'Donnell Before delving into O'Donnell's concerns, it is important to highlight his experience and credibility. Gus O'Donnell is a former British civil servant with an extensive political career, having served as Cabinet Secretary to Tony Blair, Gordon Brown, and David Cameron. As such, his position within the government grants him the ability to provide informed insight on policy matters. Step 2: Detail the existing policy of offering free bus passes and prescriptions to the elderly In the UK, certain senior citizens are currently entitled to free bus passes and prescriptions. This policy aims to support the well-being and mobility of elderly citizens while also alleviating some of the financial burdens common among older populations. Additionally, it encourages seniors to use public transportation, potentially reducing traffic and pollution. Step 3: Present Lord O'Donnell's criticisms of the policy In the Political Quarterly article, Lord O'Donnell questions the overall effectiveness of the current policy, citing concerns about the viability and financial sustainability of providing free services in the long term. He particularly mentions that the policy might need to undergo a reevaluation, especially given the rapidly aging population and the increasing pressure it places on public funds. Step 4: Explore possible policy changes and solutions Keeping Lord O'Donnell's observations in mind, one could explore potential adjustments to the policy. Suggestions include means testing for eligibility, raising the qualifying age for the benefits, or implementing a more targeted support system focusing on seniors in significant need. Step 5: Highlight the importance of continued dialogue and evaluation of public policies In concluding the article, emphasize the significance of having open discussions and reviews of public policies, even those that may seem well-intentioned or beneficial. As society progresses and demographic trends shift, regularly reevaluating government policies is essential to maintain the welfare of citizens and the long-term stability of public finances. Conclusion: Lord Gus O'Donnell's recent remarks on the policy of free bus passes and prescriptions for the elderly in the UK have the potential to open up meaningful discussions on the subject. By drawing on his experience in government, Lord O'Donnell is able to provide valuable insight into the challenges of an aging population and the need for policy adjustment. In addressing such concerns, the government and citizens must work together to ensure the well-being of all generations while also maintaining fiscal responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Quantum Hoops is a 2007 documentary film directed by Rick Greenwald, that follows the California Institute of Technology's basketball team—the Caltech Beavers—in their attempts to end a 21-year losing streak during the final week of the 2006 basketball season. Can we infer the following? The Caltech Beavers had a 22-year losing streak in the 2007 basketball season.","completion":"Let's analyze the information provided: 1. The documentary is from 2007. 2. It covers the Caltech Beavers' attempts to end a 21-year losing streak during the final week of the 2006 basketball season. Step 1: Determine the start of the losing streak Since the documentary is about a 21-year losing streak prior to the end of the 2006 season, we must first figure out when this losing streak began. To do this, we subtract 21 years from 2006: 2006 - 21 = 1985 So, the losing streak began in the 1985 basketball season. Step 2: Determine if there was a 22-year losing streak in 2007 To infer if the losing streak continued through the 2007 basketball season, we must consider how the Caltech Beavers performed during that season. If they lost again, this would result in a 22-year losing streak. However, based on the information given, we don't know the outcome of the 2007 basketball season. Since we don't have enough information about the Caltech Beavers' performance in the 2007 season, we cannot conclusively infer that they had a 22-year losing streak in the 2007 basketball season."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Suggested answer: While talk radio has historically been associated with AM/FM, starting around 2005 the technology for Internet-based talk-radio shows became cost effective in the form of podcasts . Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"The suggested answer provided seems to focus more on the emergence of internet-based talk-radio shows in the form of podcasts, which began around 2005. However, it does not address the actual beginning of talk radio in the U.S., which dates back much earlier than the advent of podcasts. Therefore, you should not validate the answer in its current form. To provide a more accurate answer to the question, the history of talk radio in the United States dates back to the early days of radio broadcasting. It is difficult to pinpoint an exact year when talk radio began since it has evolved over time, but it is generally agreed that talk radio started becoming prominent in the U.S. during the 1940s and 1950s. This was a time when radio broadcasters and hosts would engage in conversation with their listeners, discuss current events, and take calls from listeners. One of the early pioneers in talk radio was Joe Pyne, who began his career in the late 1950s. His confrontational style of debate and focus on controversial issues helped shape the format that many talk radio shows adopt today. Through the years, talk radio has diversified and expanded in terms of its content, political viewpoints, and audience reach. While AM/FM radio has traditionally been the primary platform for talk radio, the emergence of digital technology, such as podcasts, in the early 2000s has allowed for a new form of talk radio consumption. Podcasts offer more flexibility and accessibility, allowing listeners to access the content on-demand through the internet. This has further propelled the popularity of talk radio and facilitated the creation of various niche programs. In conclusion, while the suggested answer does provide some valuable information about the role of podcasts in talk-radio, it fails to address the actual beginning of talk radio in the U.S. A more accurate answer would date the origins of talk radio back to the 1940s and 1950s, highlighting the development and evolution of the format over time. Thus, the answer should be revised before validating it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Being able to reach treats immediately is important for training, so the dog learns which behavior is being rewarded. Traditionally, dogs are taught to walk on the left side, so keep the treats in a left pocket or waist pouch. Put a few small treats in your closed fist and walk along with your hand in front of the dog's nose. Every few seconds, pop a treat into your dog's mouth as you continue walking. If the dog runs forward or hangs back, stop and call the dog to you. Continue to call the dog back patiently, until it returns. When it does, tell it to sit, feed it a treat, and praise it. Continue your walk as before, feeding it treats as you do. If the dog starts walking ahead but hasn't lunged to the end of the leash yet, say \\"Easy.\\" Say \\"Yes\\" and give a treat if it responds by turning around and coming back to you. If the dog pulls at the leash to eliminate or to sniff an object, stop and call it back. When it comes, praise it, say \\"Yes,\\" and let it go where it wants to go. Follow it so the leash stays slack. When you start out, you might just walk up and down the block, so the dog doesn't stop paying attention. Each day, walk a little further. After at least a week of this, straighten up and keep your hand near your pocket of treats, around waist level. Every other step or so, take a treat from your pocket and lower it to the dog. If the dog can walk for several minutes without pulling on the leash, you can slowly increase the number of steps between treats. Try to reach one treat per minute within a couple weeks. Dogs have trouble understanding the purpose of punishment, which makes it an ineffective motivation technique. You should only use these techniques sparingly to discourage unusually bad behavior, not on every walk: Never use these techniques with a choke, pinch, or prong collar, or a head halter. If the dog ignores your commands to slow down and return to you, stop talking and turn back the way you came, tugging at the leash gently. Praise the dog when it catches up to you, then turn around and resume the walk.","completion":"The article provides a step-by-step guide to train your dog to walk on a leash without pulling, focusing on positive reinforcement and gradually increasing the distance walked, while discouraging the use of punishment techniques."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

So, just how long can fires burn? The blaze at the abandoned Good2Grow recycling centre started on 30 November last year and was put out on 21 June. But that is no match for the world record for the longest-burning fire which is believed to have started around 5,000 years ago at a coal seam beneath Mount Wingen in New South Wales, Australia, and is still smouldering. \\"Lightning struck the coal seam where it reached the Earth's surface,\\" said a spokesman for Guinness World Records. \\"Today, the fire is now burning around 30m (100ft) underground, as it has slowly eaten away at the seam.\\" In Hertfordshire, fire crews were on site for 15 days in Hemel Hempstead when a \\"deep-seated fire\\" burned in a large pile of recycled timber in November last year. \\"How long can fires burn? How long is a piece of string? \\"As long as there is a fuel supply and oxygen to supply it, a fire can burn indefinitely,\\" said Steve Tant, policy support officer for the Chief Fire Officers' Association operations directorate. He said the fire service would \\"never walk away\\" from a burning fire which is likely to endanger life, property or affect the economy. Underground fires tend to burn longest, he said. \\"They have the right conditions, particularly if they are on a coal seam where there is a constant fuel source. \\"The dangers involved in trying to extinguish these types of fires - the risk to life, the environment, not to mention the sheer cost due to the millions of tonnes of water you would need - it's the Devil's own job to get them to go out.\\" In the US, a fire set in 1884 by striking miners in New Straitsville, Ohio is still burning underground. \\"It's now a tourist feature,\\" said Laura Thrapp, president of New Straitsville History Group. \\"Visitors ask how they can find it - we tell them to look for the smoke billowing up from the fire holes.\\" In the 1930s, the government intervened as the fire was beginning to spread to parts of the town. Residents were evacuated and homes demolished. \\"A barricade was built around the town to try and stop it spreading - the old mine works were dug out and back-filled with clay,\\" said Ms Thrapp. \\"It should have worked but it did not, and in the 1970s one of the highways had to be moved because it kept sinking.\\" She said residents had been known to brew coffee straight from their wells because the soil was so warm, or even fry eggs over the fire holes. It is estimated the fire, which is currently smouldering under nearby Wayne National Forest and does not pose a threat to infrastructure, could burn for at least another 100 years. UK Coal said one of the biggest underground coal fires in the UK happened last year at Daw Mill Colliery near Coleshill in Warwickshire. Gordon Grant, of UK Coal, said: \\"It lasted for several weeks and is regarded as one of the biggest fires the industry has seen for at least 30 years. \\"It was described by the miners who tackled it as a 'raging inferno'.\\" He described the 50-year-old mining roadways underground as a \\"huge network\\". \\"The oxygen supply was turned off the night the fire broke out, which gives you some indication of just how long it took that oxygen to disperse,\\" he said. Mr Grant added: \\"The main thing is no-one was injured.\\" This article was about:","completion":"This article talks about fires and how long they can burn.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Neighborhood Legal Services, which provides free legal services to the poor, has expanded into the San Gabriel and Pomona valleys, areas with large Asian populations, many of whom speak limited or no English. Language is their biggest obstacle, but the Asian communities' cultural isolation and service providers' lack of cultural expertise also play a part, said NLS executive director Neal Dubovitz. And with 13 percent to 15 percent of the Asian population in the U.S. living below the poverty line, NLS services are badly needed, Dubovitz said. \\"Although it is a significant part of the poverty population, Asians historically have not been able to participate in the services and programs available to the poor,\\" he said. From simple telephone advice to complete legal representation in court, the agency provides free consumer, health, family, immigration, housing, public benefits and labor legal services to people who earn under 1,380 per month. Legal service providers have long served large Latino populations, who have cultural diversity but share a common language. \\"I remember the days when there were only a handful of people in the legal offices who spoke Spanish,\\" Dudovitz said. \\"Now Spanish and English are interchangeable. Our goal is to have that for the major Asian languages as well.\\" Before the expansion, only a few NLS lawyers spoke Asian languages, said attorney Rebecca Yee, who was hired by NLS in April 2002 to design and head the project. \\"Now we have people speaking Cantonese, Mandarin, Thai, Khmer (from Cambodia), Korean, Vietnamese, Japanese and Tagalog,\\" Yee said. One of the 13 attorneys hired to work with the program is Irene Mak, a family law attorney who speaks Cantonese, Mandarin and Thai. Mak was a partner at a private law firm before she went to work for NLS two years ago, earning up to 20,000 less a year working on domestic violence cases. \\"The job is more satisfying than the money,\\" said Mak, who grew up in Hong Kong and Thailand before coming to the United States. \\"I could use my language skills and wanted to give back to the Asian community.\\" NLS expanded when Legal Services Corp., the federal agency that funds providers of free legal services nationwide, reduced the number of grantees in the Los Angeles area from five to three, Dudovitz said. NLS won the competitive grant over the Legal Services Program for Pasadena, San Gabriel-Pomona valleys. That boosted its client base from 16,000 to around 25,000, and NLS opened an office in El Monte.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:I read this background article the other day: When wind waves approach to coast area from deep water, the waves change their heights and lengths. The wave height becomes higher and the wavelength becomes shorter as the wave velocity is slowed when ocean waves approach to the shore. If the water depth is sufficiently shallow, the wave crest become steeper and the trough gets broader and shallower; finally, the ocean waves break at the shore. The motions of wave breaking are different with along to the steepness of shores and waves, and can be categorized by below three types.[11][12] I am facing a new situation today: The tourist village had two beaches: Coral beach with nice sand and deeper water was preferred by families, and Surfer beach which had shallow water was a surfer's heaven. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which beach had waves with a broad and shallow trough? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the description of the two beaches, it is likely that Surfer beach had waves with a broad and shallow trough. Since Surfer beach has shallow water, this would cause the ocean waves to slow down as they approach the shore. As the wave velocity decreases, the wave height increases, the wavelength shortens, and the wave crest becomes steeper. Meanwhile, the trough gets broader and shallower. Eventually, the waves break at the shore. This shallow water condition combined with wave breaking is ideal for surfing, which is why this beach is considered a surfer's heaven. On the other hand, Coral beach has nice sand and deeper water, which is preferred by families. Deeper water prevents the waves from slowing down and steepening as much as they would at Surfer beach, so the troughs would be less broad and shallow compared to Surfer beach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who was taught photography? Answer the above question based on the context below: Fuller's time at Adyar was eventful. Leadbeater arrived around the same time as Fuller, and soon afterward he \\"discovered\\" the person he believed would become a global teacher and orator, Jiddu Krishnamurti (then in his teens). Leadbetter and others tutored Krishnamurti. Fuller may have taught him photography. She also had a small studio built in the grounds, and painted. Her works from the period include a portrait of Leadbeater and Portrait of the Lord Buddha. McFarlane emphasises the significance of the latter work, pointing out that it is \\"strikingly modern\\" in comparison to all of Fuller's other work, and more radical than compositions created by Grace Cossington Smith and Roland Wakelin, half a decade later. The painting owes much to theosophy's emphasis on seeing the subject \\"through a psychic, visionary experience\\". Sources describing Fuller's movements after her time in India sometimes are ambiguous. She arrived in England in June 1911, where she marched with Besant in the suffragette protests associated with the coronation of George V. She continued to paint portraits, but found it difficult to realise the transformation in her art that she had conceptualised in India:I have painted a great many portraits since I have been in England, and have been, I suppose, fairly successful—though I have done nothing in any way remarkable. The hidden inner life has not yet succeeded in expressing itself on canvas, and I can only write myself as one who aspires to a greater art, but who has not yet achieved.
