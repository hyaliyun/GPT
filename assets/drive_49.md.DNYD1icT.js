Given the question: The answer to the question: What non-native plant species are considered noxious? is inside the article: Shoshone National Forest is an integral part of the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, which has 1,700 documented species of plants. Since the elevation of the land in the forest ranges from 4,600 to 13,804 ft (1,402 to 4,207 m), which is more than 9,000 ft (2,700 m), the forest has a wide variety of ecosystems. Lower elevations often have sagebrush and grass-dominated vegetation types, while forested areas are dominated by various combinations of tree and shrub species. These include lodgepole pine, which along with Rocky Mountain juniper, and quaking aspen are found at elevations up to 9,000 ft (2,700 m). At higher elevations subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, whitebark pine and limber pine, are common, each occurring up to timberline. The region above timberline makes up 25 percent of the total acreage of the forest and of that 13 percent is listed as just either barren, rock or ice. The types of plant species is highly dependent on the amount of water available, and trees are more commonly found on higher slopes due to the longer lasting snowfall which keeps the soil moister for a longer time into the summer months. Along lower elevation riparian corridors, cottonwoods and willows are typically dominant. Numerous plant species are endemic to the region including some that are rare. Among them, the whitlow grass, fremont bladderpod, shoshonea, and the north fork Easter daisy provide vivid white and yellow flowers during the spring and summer.Exotic species of flora that are not native to the region include Canada thistle, Musk thistle, Spotted knapweed, Leafy spurge and Yellow toadflax. These non-native plant species are considered noxious, impacting native plant communities and the species that thrive on them. Native species such as the mountain pine beetle are having an enormous negative impact on some tree species. A survey of the forest performed in 2010 indicated that over 1,000,000 acres (400,000 ha) of timberland had been impacted by insects such as the mountain pine beetle, spruce bark beetle and Douglas..., can you guess it ?

Step 1: Combine like terms: The given equation is: > 119*o + 1801 + 432 = 91 Combine the constant terms 1801 and 432 in the equation: > 119*o + (1801 + 432) = 91 > 119*o + 2233 = 91 Step 2: Subtract the constant term from both sides: Now, we will isolate the term with the variable (119*o) by subtracting 2233 from both sides of the equation: > 119*o + 2233 - 2233 = 91 - 2233 > 119*o = -2142 Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of the variable: Finally, divide both sides of the equation by 119 to solve for o: > (119*o) / 119 = -2142 / 119 > o = -2142 / 119 > o ≈ -18 So, the solution for the equation 119*o + 1801 + 432 = 91 is o ≈ -18.

Step 1: Identify notable phrases and sentences. - \\"act like everyone is just coming in to steal\\" - \\"students on the floor just to watch you at every moment\\" - \\"get your bag (handbag/backpack) searched before you walk in\\" - \\"It is sooo weird\\" Step 2: Analyze the words used to describe experiences and feelings. - \\"act like\\": negative connotation, suggesting a pretense or hostile behavior. - \\"students on the floor just to watch you\\": negative connotation, possibly intrusive. - \\"get your bag searched\\": negative connotation, related to lack of trust or privacy. - \\"sooo weird\\": a negative or neutral expression, suggesting that the situation is strange and potentially unsettling. Step 3: Consider the overall sentiment based on the previous analysis. Given the prevalence of negative connotations and lack of positive expressions in the review, it is evident that the sentiment of this review is negative. The reviewer is expressing dissatisfaction with the way the establishment's security measures are implemented and how it makes them feel uncomfortable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

But according to a lawsuit last month, that's exactly what happened, so he's suing the cop for the wrongful arrest that caused him physical pain and set in motion years of legal headaches to clear his name. Detective Frank Maio allegedly attempted to park his vehicle in a spot in front of the 888 Shoes where he did off-duty security work. But not before Pierre parked his SUV in it first. And when Pierre got out to do some shopping, Maio ordered him to move. But Pierre refused, saying there was no reason to move -- the spot wasn't reserved, so why should he? See also: Boynton Cop Stephen Maiorino Arrested for Raping Woman at Gunpoint That's when Maio began to make an arrest for no reason, says Pierre's attorney, Christopher Brown. \\"There was no underlying charge for the arrest,\\" Brown tells New Times. \\"The spot was open to the public. It's a typical thing: Two people see a spot; two people go for it. But in this case, one of those people was a police officer with the power to arrest.\\" Pierre couldn't believe he was being arrested simply for getting a parking spot, so when Maio tried to apprehend him, he called 911. Below is a recording of the call, which Maio was clearly unhappy about. Pierre says Maio caused him severe pain during the arrest, including some broken bones. The lawsuit contends that Maio repeatedly hit Pierre, put his life in danger, and caused him severe injuries. Maio also charged him with battery on a law enforcement officer and resisting arrest with violence.

He adds that during a deposition, Maio claimed he was already in the process of backing his vehicle into the spot and Pierre stealthily swooped in to confiscate the parking space. But Brown says that was proved to be impossible based on the size of the two vehicles. Despite the charges getting dropped and the reason for the initial arrest possibly illegal, BSO didn't acknowledge any wrongdoing on behalf of one of its deputies. In a letter to Brown sent in July, a claims investigator said they found BSO had no legal liability for what happened.

Article: From bankers to factory staff, employees in the West face a cold _ of losing their jobs as a global recession starts to bite. For colleagues in the East, the pain is more likely to come through a pay cut. Human resource experts say cultural differences explain why Asian companies try harder to preserve jobs in difficult times, which will prevent unemployment and may help Asian economies survive at a time of slowing exports. The East Asian attitude may also make it easier for companies to recover quickly from the economic downturn since they will not need to rehire or train new staff, but build up a more loyal and devoted group. \\"In the Confucian mindset, the right thing to do is to share the burden, which is the sense of collective responsibility. While in the West, it's more about individual survival,\\" said Michael Benoliel, associate professor of organizational behavior at Singapore Management University (SMU). In contrast, local Western companies from General Motors to Goldman Sachs plan to lay off workers by the thousand, but at the Asian units of Western multinationals or western units of Asian groups, job cuts will probably be less severe. Japan's jobless rate was 4 percent in September, up from 3.8 percent in January, while Hong Kong's was flat at 3.4 percent. But US unemployment is expected to have jumped to 6.3 percent last month from below 5 percent in January. Experts say that while there are noticeable differences in labor practices in East and West, the gap will narrow as more firms become more multinational and competition forces firms to adopt the best practices of rivals from abroad.

Hint: Many mutations have no effect on the proteins they encode. These mutations are considered neutral. Occasionally, a mutation may make a protein even better than it was before. Or the protein might help the organism adapt to a new environment. These mutations are considered beneficial. An example is a mutation that helps bacteria resist antibiotics.

What is the final step of the following process: - Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud - Sediment builds up over the remains - The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts - The remaining parts over the years are replaced with mineral A:","completion":"The final step of the process is the formation of fossils. After the remaining parts of the dead animals and plants have been replaced with minerals over the years, the resulting mineralized or petrified remains become fossils, which provide an invaluable record of the Earth's history and evolution. To better understand the entire process, let's break it down into its individual steps: 1. Animals and plants die in soft soil or mud: When an animal or plant dies and falls onto soft soil or mud, the conditions may be conducive for fossil formation. Soft soil or mud can help preserve the remains while also providing a moist and low-oxygen environment that slows down decomposition. 2. Sediment builds up over the remains: Over time, layers of sediment, such as silt, sand, or clay, accumulate and cover the remains. This burial helps to protect the remains from scavengers and further decomposition, increasing the chances of fossilization. 3. The remains decompose, leaving only trace amounts: As the remains decompose, the soft tissues gradually break down and disappear, leaving behind the more resistant parts such as bones, shells, or woody tissues. Microorganisms and other natural processes help to break down the organic matter. 4. The remaining parts over the years are replaced with minerals: Over thousands to millions of years, groundwater rich in minerals seeps through the buried remains, and the minerals gradually replace the remaining organic structures through a process called permineralization. This process can turn bones into stone-like structures and preserve fine details of the original organism, leading to a more accurate depiction of the past. 5. Formation of fossils: As the process of mineralization is completed, the remains become solid, mineralized fossils embedded within the rock layers. The preservation of these fossils is influenced by various factors such as pressure, temperature, and mineral composition. Over time, geological processes such as erosion, plate tectonics, and other natural events can expose these fossils, allowing paleontologists and researchers to study and learn more about the Earth's past, evolution, and the history of life on our planet. In conclusion, the final step in this process is the formation of fossils, which serves as a crucial link between the past and present, shedding light on the Earth's history, climate, and the evolution of various species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The fist-pumping, floor-slapping dance track titled, of course, \\"The Situation,\\" is a collaboration with Fatman Scoop, DJ Class and the Disco Fries, according to TMZ, which posted a brief clip of the tune on Monday (June 14). Slated to hit iTunes this week, the tune has a basic techno backbeat and finds \\"the Sitch\\" Auto-Tune singing his way through lyrics about a debauched night out at the club over the kind of banging track he's probably used to hearing from his pal, Pauly D. \\"We got a Situation here,\\" fitness center assistant manager-turned-reality star says at the outset over air-raid blasts that sound like one of those annoying vuvuzela horns fans are constantly honking on at the World Cup. \\"The motherf'in Situation/ What the hell are you lookin' at?/ Can a DJ get in like that/ Grab some ass, drink some 'yac/ All I do is (bleep) until I get my cash/ Where the ladies at?/ I ain't at a bar to get drunk alone/ I'm gonna take a hottie home.\\" Sorrentino's vocals are tweaked until almost unrecognizable, but the sentiment in the lyrics seems to be in line with his full-throttle party lifestyle. A spokesperson for Sorrentino could not be reached for comment at press time. The GTL evangelist also didn't appear to make any reference to the song on Sunday, when he made an appearance at L.A. Sunset tanning salon in Hoboken, New Jersey, where fans lined up hours early to meet him and get his autograph, according to the Jersey Journal.

Barnum's creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and the lives of its star attractions. was the greatest showman based on barnum and bailey?","completion":"Yes, The Greatest Showman is loosely based on the real-life story of Phineas Taylor \\"P.T.\\" Barnum and his creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus. The film takes considerable artistic liberties with the real-life events, but it is inspired by the amazing and extraordinary world of circus entertainment and the lives of its star attractions that P.T. Barnum made possible. P.T. Barnum was an American showman, politician, and businessman, and is best known for founding the world-famous Barnum & Bailey Circus, which was billed as \\"The Greatest Show on Earth.\\" Born in 1810 in Connecticut, Barnum began his career as a showman in the 1830s, running a variety of entertainment ventures, including museums, theaters, and circuses. His remarkable ability to attract, promote, and manage talents made him one of the most successful and admired showmen of his time. In 1871, Barnum created the P.T. Barnum's Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan & Hippodrome, which later became known as the Barnum & Bailey Circus. In 1881, Barnum partnered with James Anthony Bailey, and together they transformed the circus into a global sensation that remained a popular form of entertainment until its closure in 2017. The film, The Greatest Showman, pays tribute to P.T. Barnum's legacy by showcasing his journey from a struggling businessman to the creator of one of the world's most memorable spectacles. The movie delves into not only Barnum's relentless ambition but also his keen sense for what people wanted to see in the world of entertainment, which ultimately led to his groundbreaking circus. The film's narrative takes its audience through the formation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus and introduces viewers to its star attractions, such as the trapeze artists (portrayed by Zendaya and Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), bearded lady (played by Keala Settle), and Tom Thumb (played by Sam Humphrey). Additionally, it explores Barnum's business partnership with Phillip Carlyle (Zac Efron in the movie), which is loosely based on Bailey, though the character is mostly fictional. While The Greatest Showman serves as a tribute to P.T. Barnum's incredible achievements in the realm of entertainment and spectacle, it is essential to note that the film is not a historically accurate representation of Barnum's life and career. The film takes dramatic liberties and embellishes aspects of the story to create an engaging and captivating musical experience for its audience. In conclusion, The Greatest Showman is indeed based on P.T. Barnum and the creation of the Barnum & Bailey Circus, albeit with significant artistic liberties. Its purpose is not necessarily to provide historical accuracy but rather to captivate the audience with the sense of awe and wonder that circuses inspired during their heyday and honor the remarkable impact P.T. Barnum had on the world of entertainment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Since my original review, I've been to a few other shows here. The place just get's worse and worse. If there is a band that I CAN'T miss, I'll drive to Flagstaff or Tucson to go see them.

They called it the “fidget spinner.” What they never imagined is that these spinners would become hot items in American classrooms, and that all the fidgeting with them would someday create an epidemic of mass distraction. Bill... ||||| Florida-based creator Catherine Hettinger couldn’t afford the patent on the ubiquitous playground toy but insists she’s ‘pleased’ about its sudden popularity As the inventor of the original fidget spinner – the ubiquitous new toy that has quickly become a craze in playgrounds around the world – Catherine Hettinger should be enjoying the high life. Secret Teacher: Fidget cubes need kicking out of class Read more But the Florida-based creator is not making a penny off her genius invention, even as global sales of the gadget she envisioned two decades ago as a way to entertain her seven-year-old daughter soar into the tens of millions and suppliers struggle to meet massive demand. Hettinger held the patent on finger spinners for eight years, but surrendered it in 2005 because she could not afford the 400 (£310) renewal fee. “I just didn’t have the money. It’s very simple,” she said. The palm-sized spinners consist of a ball bearing which sits in a three-pronged plastic device which can then be flicked and spun round. Some schools in the UK and the US have banned the devices, but some teachers believe that they can help children concentrate – especially those with ADHD. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Catherine Hettinger, creator of the fidget spinner, with her granddaughter Chloe. Photograph: Richard Luscombe Now, while the manufacturers and retailers who are selling the modern-day versions of the toy rack up huge profits, Hettinger, 62, is downsizing from her tiny house to a cheaper condo, wondering whether to get her disconnected telephone line reinstated, and figuring out how to afford “a car that truly works”. “It’s challenging, being an inventor,” she told the Guardian during a coffee-shop interview near her home in Winter Park, a historic suburban city just east of Orlando. “Only about 3% of inventions make any money. I’ve watched other inventors mortgage their houses and lose a lot. You take roommates, you get help from friends and family. It is hard.” Hettinger accepts that had she been able to afford to keep the patent, she would now likely be sitting on a sizeable fortune. “I wouldn’t have any problem. That would have been good,” she said. But while she joins a notable list of others – including Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the world wide web, and hoverboard inventor Shane Chen, who by accident or design failed to cash in personally on their world-changing creations – Hettinger insists that she is not bitter over the lost opportunity, and is instead “encouraged” by the spinners’ sudden popularity. “Several people have asked me: ‘Aren’t you really mad?’ But for me I’m just pleased that something I designed is something that people understand and really works for them,” she said. “There’s just a lot of circumstances in modern life when you’re boxed in, you’re cramped in, and we need this kind of thing to de-stress. It’s also fun. That’s the thing about culture, once everybody starts doing it, it’s kind of OK.” The inventor of the hoverboard says he's made no money from it Read more Her views are not shared by increasing numbers of schools, who are banning children from bringing or using the spinners because they are seen as a distraction. But Hettinger said she was pleased that in other circumstances, schools were finding the devices helpful. “I know a special needs teacher who used it with autistic kids, and it really helped to calm them down,” she said. Hettinger says the origins of the spinner lie in “one horrible summer” back in the early 1990s when she was suffering from myasthenia gravis, an autoimmune disorder that causes muscle weakness, and was also caring for her daughter Sara, now 30. “I couldn’t pick up her toys or play with her much at all, so I started throwing things together with newspaper and tape then other stuff,” she said. “It wasn’t really even prototyping, it was some semblance of something, she’d start playing with it in a different way, I’d repurpose it.” After several redesigns, a basic, non-mechanical version of the spinner was born. “We kind of co-invented it – she could spin it and I could spin it, and that’s how it was designed,” she added. Hettinger, who spent her childhood in Tulsa, Oklahoma, spent the next few years exhibiting and selling upgraded versions of her design at arts and craft fairs around Florida. “The project was great, I essentially broke even, I sold units and tested it with a couple of thousand people,” she said. She also flew with her daughter to Washington DC for an appointment with the US patent and trademark office and secured a patent on her design in 1997. But just when it looked like her original spinner was on track for wider commercial success, Hettinger was hit by a disappointment. The toy manufacturing giant Hasbro, who had been testing the design, decided not to proceed to production – effectively leaving the project to wither and eventually die with the lapse of the patent in 2005. “I’m a techie, I’m not a person who closes multimillion-dollar deals,” Hettinger said. “If there had been money or I’d had a venture capitalist back then, it would have been different.” Undeterred, Hettinger is currently working contract engineering jobs to earn income while helping advise others at meetings of the inventors council of central Florida, and also has plans to manufacture and sell her original spinner design if a Kickstarter appeal can raise enough funds. It is not quite how things could have turned out had she retained the fidget spinner patent and secured her financial future, but Hettinger insists she has only one regret: “I would probably be doing more inventing,” she said. ||||| Catherine Hettinger has an inventor’s mind: When she notices a problem, she tries to imagine a toy or device that can remedy it. So when she heard about young boys throwing rocks at police officers and people walking past them while visiting her sister in Israel, her wheels started turning. She started brainstorming devices that could distract young children and provide them with a soothing toy to play with. First, she thought of a soft rock that kids could throw. But then she tossed that idea aside, still thinking about other options when she returned to her home in Orlando, Fla. It was there that she eventually developed the idea that would become the original fidget spinner — more than two decades before the wildly popular device became the must-have toy for both kids and adults this year. Buy now: Fidget Spinner, 26, Amazon “It started as a way of promoting peace, and then I went on to find something that was very calming,” Hettinger, now in her 60s, told MONEY of the fidget spinners, which she first began imagining back in the 1980s. The toys now come in different designs and have hit the mass market after the patent expired on Hettinger’s original product in 2005, meaning companies can sell the product independently from her. But Hettinger isn’t upset about the sudden popularity and capitalization of her invention. In fact, she’s excited about it. “Maybe if it was some kind of exploitative product — like a new style of cigarettes — and my only motivation was to make money, I’d have a different attitude,” Hettinger said. “But I am just thrilled.” Catherine Hettinger courtesy of Sara Hettinger READ MORE: Meet the Fidget Spinner, a New Toy Craze Entrancing Kids and Grownups Alike The modern iterations of the devices made out of metal or plastic and have a bearing in the middle that allows it to be spun. Some of the products have prongs on them, while others are circular. The spinners, which range in price from just a few dollars to hundreds, are intended to calm nerves and help with stress and anxiety. The handheld gadgets are now so popular that different versions of fidget spinners make up all of Amazon’s top 20 best sellers for toys and games as of May 2. “When you start seeing these things flying off the shelf at your local 7-11, you know things are heating up,” Hettinger joked. Hettinger grew up in Oklahoma and attended Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in Troy, New York — a college known for its engineering and technology programs — before moving to Florida. The first fidget spinner debuted in 1993, and her patent approved four years later. But they didn’t take off — instead, she made rounds at fairs selling a couple thousand devices and frequently tried selling them to toy companies. Once she had her patent, she booked a meeting with Hasbro, the third-largest toy maker in the world, and even found herself using the fidget spinner to ease her nerves before the meeting with the company’s vice president. “That was one good thing about this product: If I walked into their headquarters spinning it, it totally calmed me down,” she recalled. “It’s not an easy thing for most people to walk in and close big deals.” Hasbro didn’t pick up the spinners, sending her a rejection letter after testing it on consumers. But now, Hasbro sells the fidget spinners — almost 20 years after it denied the original product. Chloe, Hettinger's granddaughter, plays with the original fidget spinner. Sara Hettinger– So why the sudden boom in popularity? Hettinger isn’t sure, but she speculates as a result of the recession in 2008, people may be looking for ways to calm their nerves and have fun. “That was always the concept — to help people,” she said. “I experienced it for myself.” “There’s a real need for this, ” she added. And given the device’s sudden popularity, Hettinger is working on a way to sell her original spinners, which have not been on the market throughout the current craze. She’s going to launch a a Kickstarter — called the Classic Spinner —soon and sell her version online. While she’s excited about the spinner’s newfound popularity, she’s still got an inventor’s mind and continues to observe her surroundings and think up products that can make life easier for people. Her latest project is a diet and fitness application for iPhones that she’s working on with the help of the Inventors Council of Central Florida, a Florida-based group that she is a member of that works on new ideas together. “The culture we live in now — the times now — everyone has a need for fun. People are realizing it — and it’s true,” she said. Correction: A previous version of this story misstated the year Hettinger’s patent expired. It expired in 2005, not 2017. Additionally, this story misstated what inspired her to create the fidget spinner. Hettinger was inspired after hearing about boys throwing rocks at people and police — she did not see it herself. ||||| A prototype is a preliminary model of something.

Presley's earliest musical influence came from gospel. His mother recalled that from the age of two, at the Assembly of God church in Tupelo attended by the family, \\"he would slide down off my lap, run into the aisle and scramble up to the platform. There he would stand looking at the choir and trying to sing with them.\\" In Memphis, Presley frequently attended all-night gospel singings at the Ellis Auditorium, where groups such as the Statesmen Quartet led the music in a style that, Guralnick suggests, sowed the seeds of Presley's future stage act: The Statesmen were an electric combination ... featuring some of the most thrillingly emotive singing and daringly unconventional showmanship in the entertainment world ... dressed in suits that might have come out of the window of Lansky's. ...

It is crucial to remember that trolls feed off the attention and reactions they receive from their targets. To effectively deal with them, the best course of action is to ignore and avoid engaging in conversations or battles. In the event that these malicious individuals continue to harass you despite your silence, move on to the next steps. 3. Record Evidence Evidence is vital when it comes to reporting or proving cases of cyberbullying. To thoroughly document such incidents, take screenshots, save messages, and note down relevant dates and times. If the situation escalates, this collection of evidence not only provides a clear picture of what has occurred but also serves as proof to support your claims. 4. Report Cyberbullying Cyberbullying must be reported both to the platform where it occurred and, if applicable, to local authorities or school officials. Most social media networks and websites have reporting options, guidelines, and teams dedicated to handling such situations. In some cases, especially those involving threats of violence, it is crucial to involve law enforcement. Remember to keep your evidence on hand to help expedite the process and communicate the severity of the situation. 5. Stay Safe Your personal safety, both online and offline, is of utmost importance. To protect yourself and others from cyberbullying, make sure to take the necessary steps to stay safe. This can include setting strong and unique passwords for each online account, using two-factor authentication, and always being cautious about sharing personal information. Educate others by teaching them how to protect themselves against cyberbullying. Conclusion As technology continues to advance, so does the risk of encountering cyberbullying. It is crucial for individuals to take charge of their safety and be proactive in preventing and addressing such issues. By embracing available tools, not engaging with trolls, collecting evidence, reporting incidents, and prioritizing personal security, you can play a vital role in minimizing the damage caused by cyberbullies and contributing to a safer digital world for all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was coming up on Mother's Day, and he usually tried to go back home, but this time he was too tired. He was in a small town outside of Little Rock when he drove by a flower shop. He decided to send his mother some roses. He went into the shop and saw a young man talking to the florist. \\"How many roses can I get for six dollars, ma'am?\\" the boy asked. The florist tried to explain that roses were expensive. Maybe he should be happy with carnations . \\"No, I have to have roses,\\" he said, \\"My mom was sick so much last year and I had little time with her. It has to be red roses, 'cause that's her favourite.\\" The florist shook her head. John was touched by the boy, who wanted to get those roses so badly. John looked at the florist and silently mouthed that he would pay for the boy's roses. Then the florist said, \\"Ok, I will give you a dozen red roses for your six dollars.\\" The young man almost jumped into the air. He took the flowers and ran from the store. It was worth the extra thirty-five dollars just to see that kind of excitement. John ordered his own flowers and had the florist be sure that delivery would include a note telling his mother how much he loved her. Then he drove away from the shop. As he waited at the light, he saw the young man crossing the street and enter a park through two huge gates. Suddenly, he realized it wasn't a park. It was a cemetery . The light changed, and John slowly crossed the road, parked his car and got out to follow the boy down the fence. The boy stopped by a small monument and went on his knee. He carefully laid the roses on the ground and cried, \\"Mommy, why didn't I tell you how much I love you?, Jesus, please. Tell my mommy I love her.\\" John turned, tears in his eyes, and walked back to his car. He drove quickly to the flower shop and told the florist he would take the flowers personally.

John paid an extra 35 for the boy's dozen red roses, and the boy paid 6. So, the total cost of the dozen red roses was 35 + 6 = 41. Since there were 12 roses in the dozen, we can now calculate the cost per rose: 41 (total cost) ÷ 12 (number of roses) = 3.42 (rounded to two decimal places) per rose.

Article: SHARE THIS ARTICLE Share Tweet Post Email The U.S. Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether top officials at Equifax Inc. violated insider trading laws when they sold stock before the company disclosed that it had been hacked, according to people familiar with the investigation. U.S. prosecutors in Atlanta, who the people said are looking into the share sales, said in a statement they are examining the breach and theft of people’s personal information in conjunction with the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The Securities and Exchange Commission is working with prosecutors on the investigation into stock sales, according to another person familiar with the matter. John Gamble Source: Equifax The federal probes add a serious challenge to Equifax as lawmakers, state attorneys general and regulators scrutinize the breach that may have compromised the privacy of 143 million U.S. consumers. Equifax shares were little changed. The shares have fallen 35 percent since the breach was disclosed after market close in New York on Sept. 7. Investigators are looking at the stock sales by Equifax’s chief financial officer, John Gamble; its president of U.S. information solutions, Joseph Loughran; and its president of workforce solutions, Rodolfo Ploder, said two of the people, who asked not to be named because the probe is confidential. The company and the executives didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. Equifax disclosed earlier this month that it discovered a security breach on July 29. The three executives sold shares worth almost 1.8 million in early August. The company has said the managers didn’t know of the breach at the time they sold the shares. Regulatory filings don’t show that the transactions were part of pre-scheduled trading plans. To run afoul of laws that prohibit insider trading, a seller has to be aware of nonpublic information, said Stephen Crimmins, a former enforcement lawyer for the Securities and Exchange Commission. The probe will be handled by the U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta, where the credit firm’s headquarters is located, said one of the people. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in Atlanta declined to comment on the investigation into share sales, but confirmed an inquiry into events surrounding the hack. “The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Northern District of Georgia is working with the FBI to conduct a criminal investigation into the Equifax breach and resulting theft of personal information,” said U.S. Attorney John Horn in a statement. The SEC, in its preliminary probe, is looking into what executives knew and when about the data breach, according to the person familiar with that matter. More than one third of U.S. senators have called on the Securities and Exchange Commission, in addition to the Justice Department, to get to the bottom of whether Equifax managers violated insider trading laws when they sold stock days after the company found out it was hacked. Separately, state and federal regulators and law enforcers are scrutinizing the company’s data security practices and its response to the breach. The U.S. Federal Trade Commission and a Congressional committee with subpoena power last week joined the growing number of bodies scrutinizing the cyber attack. — With assistance by Elizabeth Dexheimer ||||| CLOSE If you're concerned your personal information might have been exposed by the Equifax breach, you can take steps to freeze your credit. USA TODAY File photo taken in Sept. 2017 shows a sign for credit-reporting company Equifax on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Photo: JUSTIN LANE, JUSTIN LANE, EPA-EFE) The Department of Justice has reportedly opened a criminal investigation into whether three top Equifax officials violated insider trading laws when they sold company stock before a massive cyberbreach was made public. Federal prosecutors are examining the nearly 1.8 million in sales of Equifax stock by Chief Financial Officer John Gamble, Joseph Loughran, president of the credit-reporting giant's U.S. Information Solutions division, and Rodolfo Ploder, president of the firm's Workforce Solutions Unit, Bloomberg News reported, citing unidentified people familiar with the investigation. Wyn Hornbuckle, a spokesman for the Department of Justice, referred questions to the office of U.S. Attorney General John Horn in Atlanta, where Equifax is based. Bob Page, a spokesman for Horn, would say only that federal prosecutors there are working with the FBI to conduct a criminal investigation of the cyberbreach and resulting theft of personal information. Equifax previously said the executives \\"had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred\\" at the time they sold their shares. The company first publicly disclosed the cyberbreach after financial markets closed on Sept. 7, announcing that personal identifying information for an estimated 143 million U.S. consumers could be compromised by a cybersecurity attack attributed to suspected criminal hackers. Related: Equifax discloses cyberbreach that could impact 143M consumers The attack was carried out from mid-May through much of July 2017, and primarily involved names, Social Security numbers, birth dates, addresses and, in some cases, driver's license numbers, the company said. Regulatory filings show the executives' stock sales were conducted in the days after Equifax discovered the cyberbreach, and long before the company notified investors and the public. On Aug. 1, John Gamble sold Equifax shares with a market value of nearly 946,400, while Loughran exercised options to sell nearly 584,100, the regulatory filings show. Ploder sold company shares valued at nearly 250,500 on Aug. 2, the filings show. Related: Equifax breach: Do a 15-minute cybersecurity update The three executives collectively continued to hold tens of thousands of Equifax shares after the transactions. CLOSE Equifax’s massive security breach impacted as many as 143 million people. Time Shares of Equifax (EFX) lost nearly 34.5% of their value from Sept. 7 through Friday's trading close, falling from 142.72 to 92.98. The stock was fractionally lower in early-afternoon trading Monday. In order to prove insider-trading violations by those who sell their shares of company stock, prosecutors generally must have evidence showing that the sellers conducted the transactions based on material, non-public information. That means the information was likely to affect the company's stock price and had not been disclosed to investors.

The investigation is said to include U.S. prosecutors in Atlanta, the FBI and the Securities and Exchange Commission, according to a report this morning from Bloomberg. Three executives, Chief Financial Officer and Corporate VP John Gamble, President of U.S. Information Solutions Joseph Loughran and President of Workforce Solutions Rodolfo Ploder all sold substantive amounts of Equifax stock between the time the company learned of the hack and the date the hack was publicly announced. These trades, amounting to 1.8 million, saved the three executives from feeling the financial sting of the announcements. Equifax stock has plummeted in the days since 143 million people learned that their Social Security numbers and driver license information was put in jeopardy by the company that failed to patch a known bug. Equifax told us on September 7 that, “The three executives who sold a small percentage of their Equifax shares on Tuesday, August 1, and Wednesday, August 2, had no knowledge that an intrusion had occurred at the time they sold their shares.” While it is possible that the executives were not made aware of the breach before they sold their shares, it would be an almost unbelievable coincidence. A breach of the size faced by Equifax would have almost certainly been top of mind of every individual at the company, particularly key executives. To make matters worse, these trades were not pre-scheduled before the hack. If the executives were aware of the hack in advance of the public and traded on that information, they would have violated insider trading laws. And beyond even the law, profiting on the back of potential negligence is pretty disgusting. Members of the U.S. Senate and House have been putting pressure on Equifax to explain the trades in question. The pressure from both inside and outside the government seems to have culminated in a formal investigation. We are reaching out to Equifax and the U.S. Justice Department for comment and will update this post if we hear back. |||||Summary:","completion":"The US Justice Department has opened a criminal investigation into whether senior officials at credit rating company Equifax broke insider trading laws when they sold shares before a data breach affecting 143 million US customers was made public.

You’re like, “Enough about that random guy already!” We know, we know! Michelle Obama—there’s just no other way to put this—got bangs. So, like, O.K., first things first: they obviously look great. Michelle Obama is a tremendously pretty person whose hair is one of her top-10 best physical attributes. It’s shiny and healthy and thick, so upping its prominence on her face is an excellent idea. The bangs are also short enough that they don’t obscure her face—the way mothers are always saying their daughters’ bangs do—which is a relief, since her lovely face also ranks amongst her top-10 best physical attributes. As for the bangs themselves: they’re less blunt and more feathery, which helps combat any appearance of hair heaviness. They’re also longer at the sides than in the direct center of the forehead—a flattering cut for most face shapes. In the taxonomy of bangs, their genealogical ancestry is like this: ||||| Unveiled, the First Fringe: Michelle Obama debuts 1970s-style haircut as she turns 49 What did Michelle Obama, who turned 49 on Thursday, get for her birthday?

Mrs Obama has always had shoulder length hair, but since her entry into the White House in 2008, she has so far preferred to keep her look loose and flowing - or tied back. Her new cut, sharper, more sophisticated, comes in the wake of supermodel Karlie Kloss' new bob, after she cut off seven inches of hair late last year. The New York Times coined this return to shorter hair, 'The Karlie,' last night. So far the response to Mrs Obama's new do' has been positive, with thousands of Twitter users agreeing in unison that they 'love' her new bangs.

In the past four years she has adeptly walked - usually in kitten heels or ballet flats - the line between directional fashionista and everywoman.

It must be fun to be a girl with a big White House closet,' said Kevan Hall, a Los Angeles-based designer that Mrs Obama has worn before.

The latter proposes an operation to rescue Julius Limbani (Winston Ntshona), imprisoned former leader of the fictious central African country of Zembalia, who is due to be killed by the military dictator who overthrew him. Limbani, whose people believe he is already dead, is being held in a remote prison, guarded by ferocious African troops known as the \\"Simbas\\", under General Ndofa.Faulkner provisionally accepts the assignment and sets about recruiting his officers, all of whom have worked with him on previous African operations. They comprise:Shaun Fynn (Roger Moore) is a former RAF pilot. He is working as a currency smuggler, but when he realises that he's actually running drugs, he kills the mafia drug dealer and consequently has a death contract placed in his head. Matherson forces the crime boss to lift the contract at the last moment.Pieter Coetzee (Hardy Krüger), is a South African mercenary who only wants to return to his homeland and buy a farm, but can barely afford to pay his rent in London.Rafer Janders (Richard Harris) is hired as an experienced mission planner. He initially refuses the job, as he's making some money as an art dealer and is planning a Christmas vacation with his son, Emile. But Faulkner persuades Janders to join the mission as the tactician.Retired R.S.M (Regimental Sergeant Major) Sandy Young (Jack Watson), is asked by Faulkner to serve as drill sergeant to train the troops and assist in recruitment. He is very willing, but his wife strongly disapproves.With the tacit approval and support of the British government, the 50 soldiers are transported to an unspecified African location, equipped and mercilessly trained by Young. The day before the mission is to begin, Janders exacts a promise from Faulkner to watch over his son Emile, and take care of him should...

Article: The British coloney of Bermude is a top summertime escape. Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air. Of course, you can always shop in the city of Hamilton's upscale small goods arts and crafts shops.

Diese Entschließung gibt Aufschluss über und verurteilt die zahlreichen Vergewaltigungen, die als Kriegswaffe gegen kongolesische Frauen eingesetzt wurden. Translate to English English:","completion":"This resolution sheds light on and condemns the numerous rapes that have been used as a weapon of war against Congolese women. The resolution in question is highlighting and denouncing the widespread use of sexual violence, specifically rape, as a method of warfare against women in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Throughout the years, armed conflicts in the region have subjected countless women and girls to various forms of sexual violence, often perpetrated by armed groups and state military forces, as well as some non-state actors. The use of rape as a weapon of war carries several purposes. Firstly, it is used as a psychological tactic to demoralize and disempower the enemy by causing fear and suffering among its population. Secondly, it serves to destabilize communities, tearing apart the social fabric and making it easier for the offending party to maintain control or conquer the territory. Lastly, rape has also been used to force pregnancies, altering the ethnic composition of a population, and displacing people from their lands. The international community has been increasingly aware of the situation in Congo and has made several attempts to address the issue. The United Nations has passed multiple resolutions condemning sexual violence in armed conflict, including resolutions 1325, 1820, and 1888, which specifically focus on the protection of women and girls during conflicts and promoting their participation in peace processes. In the context of the Democratic Republic of Congo, the UN has deployed peacekeeping missions, such as MONUSCO, which has a mandate to protect civilians, including by preventing sexual and gender-based violence. Furthermore, several NGOs and humanitarian organizations have been operating in the area, providing support and assistance to those who have been affected by sexual violence. Despite these efforts, the situation persists and remains a significant issue that needs ongoing attention. To effectively address the problem of wartime rape and sexual violence, a comprehensive approach is necessary. This includes: 1. Prevention: Strengthening legal frameworks and mechanisms to deter potential perpetrators and ensure that such actions are acknowledged and punished as war crimes and crimes against humanity. 2. Protection: Deploying effective peacekeeping forces and implementing early warning systems to protect vulnerable populations, particularly women, and support local initiatives aimed at promoting women's safety in conflict zones. 3. Prosecution: Strengthening the judicial systems within affected countries and the international community to pursue effective prosecution of those responsible for sexual violence. 4. Rehabilitation: Providing long-term assistance to survivors of sexual violence, including medical, psychological, legal, and economic support to facilitate their reintegration into society and improve their overall wellbeing. 5. Participation: Empowering women to participate in political and peace processes, which would foster more equitable and sustainable solutions to conflicts and help prevent further incidents of sexual violence. In summary, the resolution addresses the extensive use of rape as a weapon of war against Congolese women and calls for a comprehensive and coordinated international response to effectively tackle this issue."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They help the animals get food for energy, make sure their young survive, or ensure that they, themselves, survive. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive, increase the animals’ fitness. Animals with higher fitness have a better chance of passing their genes on to the next generation. If genes control behaviors that increase fitness, the behaviors become more common in the species. This occurs through the process of evolution by natural selection. I am facing a new situation today: Two bears are living in the same forest. One bear, named Teddy, often runs and is active in its daily life. The other bear, Fluffy, is lazy and hardly moves at all. Their levels of fitness are very different with Teddy having a much higher overall fitness level than Fluffy. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Who will make a worse parent? The answer is:","completion":"Fluffy, the lazy bear, would likely make a worse parent when compared to Teddy, the active bear. This conclusion is based on the knowledge acquired from the background article which discusses animal behaviors and their impact on fitness levels. The background article states that animal behaviors play crucial roles in ensuring the survival and well-being of the animals themselves, as well as their offspring. Behaviors that help animals or their young survive increase their fitness levels. Higher fitness levels result in a greater chance of passing on their genes to the next generation through the process of evolution by natural selection. In the new situation presented, Teddy and Fluffy exhibit different behaviors that could impact their levels of fitness. Teddy, being active and engaging in regular physical activities, is likely to be healthier, stronger, and more adapted to its environment. His higher fitness level would make him more capable of providing for and protecting his offspring, ensuring their survival. On the other hand, Fluffy is described as lazy and sedentary. This type of behavior could lead to a lower fitness level, as Fluffy may be less efficient at hunting for food, protecting territory, or responding to potential threats. As a result, Fluffy's offspring may face higher risks and lower chances of survival. Considering the information from the background article and the behaviors of Teddy and Fluffy, it can be inferred that Fluffy would likely make a worse parent due to his lower fitness level. This is because his behavior may not be conducive to providing the necessary resources and protection for his offspring to thrive, ultimately hindering their chances of survival and the passing on of genes to the next generation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Background: Sir Pelham Grenville Wodehouse (; 15 October 1881 - 14 February 1975) was an English author and one of the most widely read humorists of the 20th century. Born in Guildford, the son of a British magistrate based in Hong Kong, Wodehouse spent happy teenage years at Dulwich College, to which he remained devoted all his life. After leaving school, he was employed by a bank but disliked the work and turned to writing in his spare time. Context: There had been films of Wodehouse stories since 1915, when A Gentleman of Leisure was based on his 1910 novel of the same name. Further screen adaptations of his books were made between then and 1927, but it was not until 1929 that Wodehouse went to Hollywood where Bolton was working as a highly paid writer for Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM). Ethel was taken with both the financial and social aspects of Hollywood life, and she negotiated a contract with MGM on her husband's behalf under which he would be paid 2,000 a week. This large salary was particularly welcome because the couple had lost considerable sums in the Wall Street Crash of 1929. The contract started in May 1930, but the studio found little for Wodehouse to do, and he had spare time to write a novel and nine short stories. He commented, \\"It's odd how soon one comes to look on every minute as wasted that is given to earning one's salary.\\" Even when the studio found a project for him to work on, the interventions of committees and constant rewriting by numerous contract authors meant that his ideas were rarely used. In a 2005 study of Wodehouse in Hollywood, Brian Taves writes that Those Three French Girls (1930) was \\"as close to a success as Wodehouse was to have at MGM. His only other credits were minimal, and the other projects he worked on were not produced.\\" Wodehouse's contract ended after a year and was not renewed. At MGM's request, he gave an interview to The Los Angeles Times. Wodehouse was described by Herbert Warren Wind as \\"politically naive [and] fundamentally unworldly,\\" and he caused a sensation by saying publicly what he had already told his friends privately about Hollywood's inefficiency, arbitrary decision-making, and waste of expensive talent. The interview was reprinted in The New York Times, and there was much editorial comment about the state of the film industry. Many writers have considered that the interview precipitated a radical overhaul of the studio system, but Taves believes it to have been \\"a storm in a teacup\\", and Donaldson comments that, in the straitened post-crash era, the reforms would have been inevitable. Wind's view of Wodehouse's naivete is not universally held. Some biographers suggest that his unworldliness was only part of a complex character, and that in some respects he was highly astute. He was unsparing of the studio owners in his early-1930s short stories set in Hollywood, which contain what Taves considers Wodehouse's sharpest and most biting satire. Question: Can you name another film he worked on?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Another film that P.G. Wodehouse worked on is Those Three French Girls (1930)."},{"prompt":"If I tell you that Vertebrates have a spinal column, and ask you the question \\"what has a spinal column?\\", is the correct answer \\"bacteria\\"?

In 1928 3.7-inch became the preferred solution, but it took 6 years to gain funding. Production of the QF 3.7-inch (94 mm) began in 1937; this gun was used both on mobile carriages with the field army and transportable guns on fixed mountings for static positions. At the same time the Royal Navy adopted a new 4.5-inch (114 mm) gun in a twin turret, which the army adopted in simplified single-gun mountings for static positions, mostly around ports where naval ammunition was available. However, the performance of both 3.7 and 4.5-in guns was limited by their standard fuse No 199, with a 30-second running time, although a new mechanical time fuse giving 43 seconds was nearing readiness.

Summarize: The document shows that the government was aware of made-up data and illegal practices such as the dumping of vast quantities of unwanted fish. There are also concerns that unlawful fishing in NZ waters is threatening the world's rarest dolphin. Campaigners have called on McDonald's to drop New Zealand fish from menus. A study published earlier this week highlighted the long term problems of illegal fishing in New Zealand waters, concluding that the amount of fish taken from the seas was 2.7 times greater than the numbers reported. The study referred to data contained in internal memos, written by officials at the Ministry of Primary Industries. One of these documents, which is termed Operation Achilles, has now been published in full online. It paints a picture of a fishing industry that routinely discards full nets of fish back into the sea, even when government cameras are present. In the document, an official writes that \\"we have never had such compelling evidence to prove what we have known for a long time\\". The inspectors are concerned that footage recorded on several trawlers would leak to the media. They speculate that revealing the true scale of the illegal practices could cause extensive damage not just for the New Zealand fishing industry but for the economy as a whole. \\"A worst case scenario could see a large international company eg. McDonald's, refusing to buy our non-green image fish,\\" the report says. Up to 15% of McDonald's fish products in recent years were made from hoki, but the company told the BBC that they currently source 8% of their fish from New Zealand hoki. Hoki fishing has been certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) several times over the past 15 years. Since 2011, McDonald's has also carried the MSC sustainability label on its fish products in Europe. But there have long been concerns about the sustainable nature of hoki fishing in New Zealand. British retailer Waitrose once refused to stock the fish because of the bottom-trawling method used to catch the species. In the recent report on illegal fishing in New Zealand, researchers point to hoki as one of the most dumped and under-reported species between 1990 and 2013. \\"During the hoki season [crew] dumped every tow, two times a day. Even though the fish that had been caught were of good quality, we dumped them because the captain wanted to replace them with fresher fish,\\" according to one crew member interviewed by the scientists. As well as the illegal practices, the government memo draws attention to the impact of fishing on Maui's and Hector's dolphins, widely regarded as the most endangered dolphin species. About 50 of these small marine mammals are known to survive. In 2012, two of them were caught in a fishing net, although only one was reported to the authorities. In the leaked document, New Zealand fishing officials are clearly worried about the repercussions of such activities: \\"The deliberate non-reporting of Hector's dolphins... could have a similar if not more dramatic flow on negative effect.\\" A New Zealand government spokesperson told BBC News it had announced a review of the contents of the leaked document and therefore could not comment further at the present time. But reacting to the leaked documents, the New Zealand minister in charge of fishing, Nathan Guy, denied that the government was helping to cover up unsustainable practices. \\"There's been no cover-up here,\\" he told reporters in New Zealand. \\"These are internal, draft investigations, part of which has been unfortunately leaked.\\" A spokesman for McDonald's told BBC News that they placed their faith in the Marine Stewardship Council, who had asserted the New Zealand fish was sustainable. \\"We understand the importance of protecting marine wildlife, especially endangered species that share the ocean with the fish we use on our menu,\\" the company said in a statement to the BBC. \\"That's why we're proud of our global commitment to only source fish from a Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) certified sustainable fishery, including in New Zealand. \\"The New Zealand hoki fishery is considered one of the most well maintained and controlled fisheries in the world and was one of the first fisheries in the world to be awarded MSC certification for sustainable fishing.\\" But campaigners are not happy and are now calling on McDonald's to drop New Zealand fish from the menu and are asking people not to eat McDonald's fillet-of-fish. \\"People can vote with their wallets and send a strong message to the New Zealand government and fishing industry,\\" said Dr Barbara Maas, from Nabu International, which campaigns on behalf of the Maui's and Hector's dolphins. \\"We are not attacking McDonald's, they have a huge opportunity here to do the right thing and bring about some real change in the New Zealand fishing industry - they could say they saved the Maui's dolphins, and how good would that be for their brand?\\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook. Summary:","completion":"The New Zealand government was aware of the illegal dumping of vast quantities of unwanted fish and the use of incorrect data, according to a leaked document. The report also suggests that the country's illegal fishing is endangering the world's rarest dolphin. Campaigners are calling for McDonald's to stop using New Zealand fish in its restaurants. A study earlier this week indicated that the amount of fish taken from New Zealand waters was 2.7 times higher than officially reported. Around 15% of McDonald's fish products were made from New Zealand hoki in recent years. New Zealand hoki fishing has been repeatedly certified as sustainable by the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) and McDonald's fish products carry the MSC label in Europe. British supermarket Waitrose has refused to sell the fish due to the methods by which they are caught. In addition, hoki has been identified as one of the most dumped and under-reported species between 1990 and 2013."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The lawn looked uglier at the house than the cottage because the plants were pruned at the","completion":"house haphazardly, while at the cottage, they were carefully tended to and nurtured with great attention. The first step to rectify the situation at the house was to assess the damage done by the poor pruning choices and identify areas that needed immediate tending. Step 1: Assessing the damage. In this step, the goal was to group plants based on the severity of damage caused by haphazard pruning. This allowed for the development of a targeted plan to restore the health and aesthetics of the lawn. Plants suffering from major damage were prioritized, while healthy plants or those with minor issues would be addressed later. Step 2: Developing a recovery plan. After grouping the plants, a recovery plan was devised outlining the actions needed for each group. For severely damaged plants, the plan aimed at nursing the plants back to health through a combination of removing dead leaves and branches, re-pruning poorly cut areas, and providing supplemental nutrition. The plants with minor damage would be pruned more lightly and monitored closely to prevent further harm. Step 3: Executing the recovery plan. With a clear plan in place, it was time to implement it. The first actions focused on restoring the health of severely damaged plants. Each plant was carefully tended to and monitored to track progress. For plants with moderate to minor issues, a more preventative approach was used to ensure that they didn't suffer further damage. Step 4: Monitoring progress and adjusting the plan. As the process unfolded, the health and appearance of the plants were closely monitored. This allowed for adjustments to be made in response to unexpected setbacks or to capitalize on successes. By staying agile and responsive to the plants' needs, the chances of a successful recovery were greatly improved. Step 5: Ongoing maintenance. Once the overall health and appearance of the lawn had significantly improved, the focus shifted to maintaining the progress that had been made. This involved regularly checking on the plants, pruning them as needed, and ensuring they received the proper amount of water and nutrients. This ongoing attention would help to prevent future issues and establish a healthier, more visually appealing lawn at the house. Over time, with consistent care and effort, the lawn at the house began to emulate the beauty and lushness of the cottage's lawn. The contrasting appearance between the two spaces lessened, creating a harmonious and visually appealing environment that extended across the entire property. The key to this transformation was taking a systematic approach to identifying the problems, developing a plan, and implementing it with care and diligence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Seconds later he noticed smoke and a searing heat, before hearing an explosion as the phone he’d had for just six months ignited, melting through his shorts and two layers of skin on his upper right thigh. Instagram 2 iDon’t believe it… British mountain biker Gareth Clear shows his horror injuries he suffered after iPhone 6 exploded and melted through his shorts The burn was so severe he had to undergo skin graft surgery at the burns unit of the Royal North Shore Hospital. Mr Clear, who is originally from Winchester in Hampshire but has lived in Australia for the last six years, said: “It’s a bit random, the thing to be very specific about, the phone did hit the ground, it didn’t just spontaneously combust. “It was a one in one million chance I hit a part of the phone which pierced the lithium battery and it exploded.” Related stories AEROSOL EXPLOSION HORROR Schoolboy, 14, suffers horrific facial burns after setting fire to deodorant can in woods BOAt BLAST IN IBIZA Couple suffer horrific burns after boat explodes off Ibiza marina sending victims flying into sea PLAYTIME AGONY One-year-old girl suffered horrific burns when she touched playground ramp during heatwave DIED A HERO Cyclist who died in 100 mile race was cancer-survivor raising money to fight disease which killed his dad RIDE LONDON CRASHES Two cyclists airlifted to hospital after horror accidents on charity route He added: “I’m 36, I’ve had a mobile phone for 18 years of my life and for that thing to explode or short circuit and cause it to temporarily ignite. I could see the metal bending and all the lithium leaking out of the bottom end.” While the base of the phone looks like “something from a chemical explosion,” he said, the top remains perfectly in tact. Mr Clear will be house bound for the rest of the week and remain hooked up to a machine to prevent infection, but expects it will take weeks to recover. Facebook 2 Seeking answers… Mr Clear said Apple told him they would investigate the incident Dr Da-Wei Wang from the UNSW faculty of chemical engineering said it wasn’t uncommon for lithium ion batteries in mobile phones to overheat and ignite. “I think many examples show that, if you search on Google there are many images of mobile phones which have been overcharged, which may cause it to be overheated,” he said. But an explosion after an impact, he said, was most likely caused by a combination of overheating and a faulty design of the phone’s structure. Mr Clear said Apple yesterday told him they would investigate the incident. However an Apple spokeswoman declined to comment to the Daily Telegraph. Other recent reports include a man in Seattle who claimed his smartphone exploded in his pocket on July 23, and earlier this month in the UK a 19-year-old man claimed his iPhone 5s exploded while travelling on a fast moving train. ||||| A Sydney bicycle rider, who says he was severely burnt when his Apple iPhone exploded after a minor fall, is now on a mission to make people aware of the potential dangers of using such devices. Bondi management consultant Gareth Clear, 36, said his iPhone was in his back pocket and ignited after he had a fall from his bike while riding on Sunday afternoon. \\"I just saw smoke coming out of my back pocket...and then all of a sudden I felt this surging pain,\\" he said, adding that he felt a \\"searing heat\\" as the phone burnt through his riding shorts in a matter of seconds. \\"I just remember looking at my leg and I had this black discharge all down my leg and this smell of phosphorus​,\\" he said. Apple's Australia-based office have not commented on the incident, however it is understood they are speaking directly to Mr Clear about the incident. Each year the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission routinely receives around one to two reports of consumer injuries from mobile phone batteries. An ACCC spokesman said it was investigating the incident involving Mr Clear, in conjunction with NSW Fair Trading. Advertisement \\"The decreasing size and slimness of portable devices coupled with consumer expectations about battery life are a challenge for battery manufacturers,\\" he said. \\"Lithium batteries are vulnerable to significant physical impact, [which] may damage the extremely thin separators that keep the elements of the battery apart.\\" The ACCC recommends mobile phones are not stored in pockets when people's activities mean there is a chance of a significant physical impact. Mr Clear said his fall was only minor and occurred after his foot slipped on the bike pedal when he was about to start moving, causing him to lose his balance.

It can occur in even the best circuitry, due to defects, overheating, physical damage or external pressure, or a combination of the factors. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Link Gareth Clear, 36, of Bondi says his iPhone exploded, causing him serious burns, after he fell off his bike on the weekend. Photo: Supplied In 2011, a phone on a flight from Lismore to Sydney started emitting \\"a significant amount of dense smoke, accompanied by a red glow\\" and had to be extinguished. An investigation by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau later revealed a misplaced screw had punctured the battery case during a screen-replacement job, leading to a short circuit. Mr Clear said he did not blame Apple for his injury, and wanted to raise awareness about the potential dangers of iPhones. \\"The more pervasive these are in our lives and the more people use them with a lack of apprehension that something might go wrong, the more that these things will happen,\\" he said. In 2015-16 the ACCC's risk assessment of poor quality rechargeable lithium batteries and electrical wiring systems led to an interim product ban, followed by a two year mandatory safety standard, for self-balancing electric scooters. |||||Summary:","completion":"A mountain biker in Australia was left needing skin grafts after his iPhone exploded in his pocket.

Step 1: The first step is to analyze the given options and find the most appropriate one that relates to the context of the question. In this case, the context is about commuters moving quickly. Step 2: Let's examine the options: - road: Roads are where people travel, but they can include local streets and may not always be optimized for fast traffic flow, so it might not be the best choice. - freeway: Freeways are designed for high-speed, long-distance transportation and are typically aimed at facilitating faster movement with limited stops or intersections. - city: While the term 'city' refers to a populated area, it does not necessarily imply quick movement, as city traffic could be congested and slow. - race track and race: These options are less relevant in the context of commuters, as they primarily pertain to sporting events and not everyday traveling. Step 3: After evaluating the options, the choice of \\"freeway\\" stands out as the most logical option in the context of commuters moving quickly.

Its all too common- band makes mucho money- band becomes uninspired. The answer is:","completion":"This review would generally decrease the chances of buying the product. There are several reasons behind this. Primarily, the review clearly states dissatisfaction and disappointment with the product. The reviewer, while not considering themselves as a diehard fan of the brand in question – abbreviated 'DM' – which seems to be a band, does appreciate some of their creations showcasing 'funky grooves'. However, the reviewer has explicitly mentioned their discontent with the specific product, which in this context appears to be an album. Three key words used to describe the album are 'over-produced', 'dreary', and 'uninspired', all of which carry negative connotations. The term 'over-produced' usually refers to a sound that is artificially polished or manipulated to the point where it may lose its original spirit or intent. In a musical context, 'dreary' could suggest that the album lacks vitality, energy, or might be perceived as boring, while 'uninspired' hints at a lack of creativity or innovation in the music. Furthermore, the reviewer uses a narrative common in discussions about popular music – the idea that commercial success often leads to a decline in artistic quality. In this case, the reviewer suggests that this band might have fallen into this pattern, referencing an 'all too common' scenario where a band's creativity and inspiration decline post substantial monetary successes. This view inherently suggests that the product proves to be a letdown compared to the band's previous works, and hence the reviewer suggests caution while considering its purchase, leading to a decrease in the chances of buying the product. However, it is important to note that reviews are subjective and depend on individual tastes and preferences. While this review might decrease the likelihood of buying the product for some, others might still wish to experience the product themselves before making a final judgment.

In Maser's view, \\"neither Germany nor Japan were in a situation [of] invading the USSR even with the least perspective [sic] of success,\\" and this could not have been unknown to Stalin. Carr further stated that, for a long time, the primary motive of Stalin's sudden change of course was assumed to be the fear of German aggressive intentions. What is the answer to this question: The pact according to Edward Carr’s view was to provide what between Germany and the Soviet Union?","completion":"According to Edward Hallett Carr's view, the pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, known as the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, was primarily intended to provide a \\"breathing space\\" of immunity from German attack for the Soviet Union. In Carr's perspective, the \\"bastion\\" created by means of the Pact served as a line of defense against potential German aggression. Carr argued that a crucial advantage for the Soviet Union in signing this pact was the prospect that, in the event of an eventual war between the Soviet Union and Germany, the Western Powers, primarily Britain and France, would already be involved in the conflict. This involvement would potentially aid the Soviet Union in their efforts to resist any German attack. However, as noted in the article, this view has been disputed by historians such as Werner Maser. Maser believed that the perceived threat of German or Japanese invasion of the Soviet Union was more a legend propagated by Stalin and his regime, rather than a genuine and imminent risk. In Maser's assessment, neither Germany nor Japan were in a position to successfully invade the Soviet Union at that time, and he contends that Stalin must have been aware of this reality. Despite the ongoing debate among historians, Edward Carr's view on the purpose of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact posits that it was established to create a temporary period of immunity and a defensive barrier for the Soviet Union against potential German aggression."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which occurred first, the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle or the Battle of Zierikzee?","completion":"Title: A Tale of Two Battles: Mons-en-Pévèle and Zierikzee - Which Came First? Introduction: When diving into the depths of medieval Europe's military history, the 14th century stands out as a period marked by numerous wars and conflicts. Two noteworthy battles that took place during this era are the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle and the Battle of Zierikzee. Both battles, fought between different groups of European powers, have become defining moments in the history of their respective regions. But which of these two battles occurred first? In this article, we will explore the historical contexts, dates, and outcomes of these two significant events. Step 1: Introduce the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle The Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle, also known as the Battle of Mont en Pévèle or Pevelenberg, was fought on August 18, 1304. The conflict was part of the Franco-Flemish War (1297-1305), a larger struggle between the Kingdom of France, led by King Philip IV, and the County of Flanders, which at the time was under French rule and seeking independence. Step 2: Outline the context and outcome of the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle Before the battle, Flanders had experienced a defeat at the Battle of Furnes in 1303, leading to the Flemish Count, Guy of Dampierre, and his allies to regroup and gather more support. The French king, determined to maintain control over Flanders, moved to crush the rebellion once and for all. The battle took place near the village of Mons-en-Pévèle in the County of Flanders (now part of modern-day France) and was a fiercely disputed fight. Both sides suffered heavy casualties, but the French eventually emerged victorious. The outcome of the battle led to the eventual signing of the Treaty of Athis-sur-Orge in 1305, which would put an end to the conflict but harshly limit the liberties and independence of Flanders. Step 3: Introduce the Battle of Zierikzee The Battle of Zierikzee, on the other hand, took place on June 10, 1304. This particular battle was part of the ongoing conflict between the County of Holland, led by Count John II, and the County of Hainaut, led by Count William I. The battle was a significant event during the War of the Flemish Succession (1299-1305). Step 4: Outline the context and outcome of the Battle of Zierikzee The conflict began when John II, who was also the husband of the Flemish countess-in-exile, sought to claim the rights of his wife over the County of Flanders. Count William I of Hainaut resisted this claim, leading to an open confrontation between the two nobles. The Battle of Zierikzee took place near the island of Schouwen in the County of Holland (modern-day Netherlands). The forces of Hainaut, alongside their French allies, fought against the combined armies of Holland and the English, who supported John II's claims to the Flemish territories. The battle ended in a decisive victory for Count William, which further weakened John II's position in the War of the Flemish Succession. Step 5: Compare the dates and determine which battle came first Returning to our initial question, which of these two battles took place first? With the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle occurring on August 18, 1304, and the Battle of Zierikzee taking place just a couple of months earlier, on June 10, 1304, it is evident that the Battle of Zierikzee came first. Conclusion: In conclusion, when examining the timelines of the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle and the Battle of Zierikzee during the tumultuous 14th century, we find that the Battle of Zierikzee predates the Battle of Mons-en-Pévèle by approximately two months. It is essential to remember that while these battles were fought over different issues and stakeholders, they were both significant events that shaped the course of regional politics and history in medieval Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In other words, the acorn-type thing is stated as the reason for the tree being identified as an oak. The hypothesis, \\"It is called an oak because it possesses an acorn type thing on it,\\" essentially restates the premise slightly differently. Both the premise and hypothesis claim that an oak tree is labeled as such due to the presence of an acorn-like structure. Considering the similarity between the premise and the hypothesis, it appears that the premise does entail the hypothesis. Therefore, the answer is: I. yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In the first sentence, it is mentioned that \\"The American Chamber of Commerce and InvestHK, which oversees investment into the territory, are talking to other bands to ask them to step in.\\" This statement implies that these two organizations are collaborating to approach other bands in order to have them participate or replace a particular instance (presumably referring to a performance or show). The use of the verb \\"step in\\" suggests that these other bands need to fill a gap or assume a role. In the second sentence, it is stated that \\"The American Chamber of Commerce and InvestHK, which oversees investment into the territory, is talking to other bands to replace the Stones.\\" Here, the same two organizations are working together to approach other bands, just as in the first sentence. This time, though, the intended action is more explicitly defined: the goal is to replace the Stones, likely referring to the well-known music band \\"The Rolling Stones.\\" Despite different verbs being used (asking to \\"step in\\" versus outright replacing), the core message remains the same – the organizations are seeking out other bands as potential replacements. Based on the analysis of both sentences, it can be concluded that if the first sentence is true, the second one is also true, as they essentially convey the same information – the American Chamber of Commerce and InvestHK are working together to find other bands to replace the Stones.

It seems that the artists painted a scene after just a quick look at it.

Question: \\"Tinissa parallela\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","completion":"\\"Tinissa parallela\\" belongs to the category of 'animal'. Specifically, it is a species of moth within the family of Tineidae. These moths are commonly referred to as fungus moths or tineid moths, and they are known for their widely diverse lifestyles. Some species are detritivores, feeding on dead organic matter such as fungi, lichens, and various organic debris. Others are parasitic and can be found living in the nests of insects or are known to infest stored products. Tineidae is a large family of moths, with over 3,000 recognized species distributed worldwide. Despite their small size, they play a significant role in the ecosystem as decomposers and, in some cases, even as nuisance pests in human households. The unique diversification within the Tineidae family reflects the numerous different environments in which these moths can be found. Some species reside in forests and meadows, while others are discovered in caves, bird nests, debris, and even homes and food storage areas. The larvae of tineid moths are caterpillars that display distinctive feeding behaviors. To summarize, \\"Tinissa parallela\\" pertains to the animal category as it is a species of moth within the Tineidae family. Its role in the ecosystem highlights the importance of different species within the animal kingdom and the adaptability of certain groups to a variety of environments and food sources."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Do those questions have the same meaning? Choose from: I. no; II. yes;","completion":"I. no; While both questions revolve around the idea of opening a successful coffee shop, they focus on different locations and aspects. The first question asks about the conditions for a successful coffee shop in Boston. When considering a coffee shop in Boston, the following factors are essential for success: 1. Prime Location: Choose a location with high foot traffic, visibility, and accessibility. Preferably near universities, business districts, or tourist attractions. 2. Unique Selling Proposition: With several coffee shops in Boston, you need to distinguish your business by offering specialty coffee, unique food options, or having a creative interior design and atmosphere. 3. Local Market Analysis: Research the target demographic and competition in your chosen area to make informed decisions about pricing, menu offerings, and marketing strategies. 4. Skilled and Friendly Staff: A well-trained team will provide quality products and exceptional customer service, leading to loyal customers and positive word-of-mouth. 5. Effective Marketing: Utilize social media, local publications, and strategic partnerships to target your desired demographic and create a memorable brand identity. 6. Comfortable Seating and Wi-Fi: Offering comfortable seating options and free Wi-Fi will encourage customers to linger and increase the likelihood of repeat visits. 7. Sustainable Practices: Many Bostonians care about eco-friendliness, so including sustainable practices like using reusable cups and sourcing ethically-produced coffee beans could give your coffee shop an edge in the market. The second question focuses on opening a coffee shop in Jaipur and asks for ideas. Here are some ideas for a successful coffee shop in Jaipur: 1. Localize Your Offerings: Incorporate traditional Indian elements, such as masala chai or flavored lassis, along with popular global coffee drinks. Offer local snacks and treats that appeal to the taste preferences of Jaipur residents. 2. Embrace Cultural Heritage: Design the interior of your coffee shop with details that celebrate Jaipur's rich cultural heritage. Use elements of traditional Rajasthani architecture and art to create a unique and inviting ambiance. 3. Collaborate with Local Artisans: Partner with local artists and artisans to showcase their work in your coffee shop, creating a space where customers can appreciate and purchase local art and handicrafts. 4. Host Events: Organize regular events like poetry readings, live music, or workshops to create a community around your coffee shop and draw in new customers. 5. Blend Modern and Traditional Experiences: Offer a mix of modern amenities and technology, such as free Wi-Fi and charging stations, alongside spaces where customers can sit on cushions and enjoy a traditional Indian atmosphere. 6. Promote Local Tourism: With Jaipur being a popular tourist destination, consider offering maps, guides, and tour packages for customers to explore the local sights. 7. Community Involvement: Build a strong relationship with the local community by supporting local causes, participating in community events, and partnering with nonprofit organizations.

Write an article based on this summary: – China apparently doesn't have a whole lot of faith in Kim Jong Un's leadership abilities: Beijing has documented contingency plans in the event of a North Korean regime collapse, and they were recently leaked to Japanese media, the Telegraph reports. Among the plans: Detain important North Korean military and political leaders in special camps and monitor them, but also protect them from rival factions or other military powers (likely a reference to the US). Increase monitoring of the China-North Korea border. Create refugee camps along the border in case of civil unrest. Question anyone who attempts to enter the country and refuse anyone who could be dangerous. \\"I am sure that the US and South Korea have extensive plans in place, but the release of Chinese measures is new,\\" an expert explains. The Guardian reports that China has denied making any such plans, but experts still say the leaked plans could be legitimate.","completion":"Title: China's Contingency Plans for a North Korean Collapse China is widely regarded as North Korea's closest ally. However, the recent leak of Beijing's apparent contingency plans in case of a North Korean regime collapse suggests a lack of faith in Kim Jong Un's leadership abilities. The leaked plans outline various measures, including the detainment of military and political leaders, monitoring the China-North Korea border, and establishing refugee camps. Experts believe the release of Chinese measures is new, and despite China's denial of such plans, their legitimacy cannot be ignored. China's contingency plans, as reported by the Telegraph, include several notable measures: 1. Detainment of North Korean military and political leaders: The leaked plans outline a strategy to detain important North Korean personnel in special camps. These detainees would be protected from rival factions or other military powers, most likely referring to the United States. This measure is significant, as it shows that China not only doubts the stability of the North Korean regime but also fears potential conflicts and power struggles that may arise from its collapse. 2. Increased monitoring of the China-North Korea border: Amid rising concerns of North Korea's nuclear ambitions and potential threats from the regime, it is crucial for China to be prepared for any risks that may arise from a collapse. By increasing surveillance along the border, China aims to prevent any security threats from infiltrating the country, maintain stability within its borders, and closely monitor the situation in North Korea. 3. Establishment of refugee camps along the border: In the case of civil unrest following a regime collapse, a large number of North Korean citizens may flee the country in search of safety. To accommodate and assist these refugees, China plans to establish camps along the border, ensuring that individuals fleeing the chaos are provided with basic necessities and a temporary shelter. 4. Questioning and screening of individuals entering China: According to the leaked contingency plans, China intends to question anyone who attempts to enter the country from North Korea following a regime collapse. Entry will be denied to individuals considered dangerous, ensuring national security and reducing the risk of potential threats from infiltrating China. While China has denied making any such plans, experts find the leaked plans plausible. As one expert explains, \\"I am sure that the US and South Korea have extensive plans in place, but the release of Chinese measures is new\\". The denial from China could be to downplay its doubts about Kim Jong Un's leadership, given the fragile diplomatic relationship between the two countries. In conclusion, the leaked contingency plans showcase China's concern about the stability of the North Korean regime under Kim Jong Un's leadership. The plans highlight the need to protect China's national security and to address the geopolitical challenges that may arise from a North Korean collapse. This revelation also provides a unique insight into the potential strategies that major powers may employ if such a scenario occurs. Despite China's denial of these plans, their potential legitimacy cannot be overlooked, as they offer a significant glimpse into China's preparedness for a potential crisis in the Korean Peninsula."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Meanwhile, Ixnay, Ohnay and Amscray, the war profiteers from the first film have realized they've made a monster out of Hailstone and his cronies in letting them be too power hungry. They decided that they have had enough of the dictator they put in power, and want to help Herman retake the throne. Herman refuses to accept thier help until he finds out that they were sorry about the whole scenario about wanting to start a war and are willing to pay the price for their actions. To this end, he sends his daughter, the princess Glinda (disguised as Matty Herring in the first film) to try and assassinate Hailstone using an explosive pool ball strategically positioned in Hailstone's billiard table. Dictator Moe Hailstone of Moronica enjoys a shave, and fights Curly and Larry for a turkey (that is a parody of Hitler possibly wanting control in Turkey.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What type of mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain in Minnesota? Saint Anthony Falls, the only waterfall of its height on the Mississippi, played an important part in the development of Minneapolis. The power of the waterfall first fueled sawmills, but later it was tapped to serve flour mills. In 1870, only a small number of flour mills were in the Minneapolis area, but by 1900 Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain. Advances in transportation, milling technology, and water power combined to give Minneapolis a dominance in the milling industry. Spring wheat could be sown in the spring and harvested in late summer, but it posed special problems for milling. To get around these problems, Minneapolis millers made use of new technology. They invented the middlings purifier, a device that used jets of air to remove the husks from the flour early in the milling process. They also started using roller mills, as opposed to grindstones. A series of rollers gradually broke down the kernels and integrated the gluten with the starch. These improvements led to the production of \\"patent\\" flour, which commanded almost double the price of \\"bakers\\" or \\"clear\\" flour, which it replaced. Pillsbury and the Washburn-Crosby Company (a forerunner of General Mills) became the leaders in the Minneapolis milling industry. This leadership in milling later declined as milling was no longer dependent on water power, but the dominance of the mills contributed greatly to the economy of Minneapolis and Minnesota, attracting people and money to the region. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Minnesota mills were grinding 14.1% of the nation's grain using flour mills."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

But don’t expect such restraint outside the building, where both sides have announced noontime events on the City Hall steps facing Civic Center Plaza on Thursday. “Please join us to show your support for Ross Mirkarimi at the hearing and then for a noon rally to Stand With Ross on the Polk Street side of City Hall,” the embattled sheriff’s supporters announced in a recent e-mail blast to backers. UPDATE: Organizers of the “I Stand with Ross” campaign announced via e-mail Wednesday night that Mirkarimi’s wife, Eliana Lopez, will attend the rally. Lopez has been living in her native Venezuela with the couple’s 3-year-old son, Theo, since March. Lopez, an actress, made a short trip back to San Francisco last month to testify before the Ethics Commission on her husband’s behalf. During the same trip, a judge lifted the restraining order that had barred Mirkarimi from seeing his wife after he was arrested for misdemeanor domestic violence battery in January. Wednesday night’s e-mail stated that both Lopez and the child are now in the city. END OF UPDATE In the initial e-mail, the group told supporters that following the rally “you will have a chance to let the Ethics Commission know exactly how you feel about the mayor’s unprecedented attempt to usurp the will of the people in order to consolidate his power. Let them know that there is only one issue and that issue is not should Ross continue to be Sheriff, it is not did he bruise his wife’s arm, it is not can he effectively serve as Sheriff — it is only did he commit official misconduct by grabbing his wife’s arm — and the answer to that question is a resounding no!!!” Not so fast, countered leading advocates for victims of domestic violence, who scheduled a press conference at the same time and place. “On the same day that the Ethics Commission is slated to hold its last hearing on the question of whether Ross Mirkarimi should be removed from his post as Sheriff for abusing his wife, the city’s domestic violence community is coming together to urge commissioners to stay focused on the fact that Mirkarimi pled guilty to abusing his wife and as a result is not fit to serve as Sheriff,” stated a press release put out by the leaders of three organizations, La Casa de las Madres, Domestic Violence Consortium and Futures Without Violence. “The Ethics Commission is being reminded by the DV community to only consider the facts when making their recommendation of whether Mirkarimi be removed from office by the Board of Supervisors. In March, Mirkarimi pled guilty to a misdemeanor charge of false imprisonment related to harming his wife, Eliana Lopez.” Civics teachers may want to bring their students to City Hall Thursday for a first-hand glimpse at democracy in action. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"In San Francisco, there is a case against a man named Ross Mirkarimi, who was the sheriff. Some people think he should not be the sheriff anymore because he hurt his wife. The people who will decide this are the Ethics Commission. Both sides of the argument are planning to show their support or disagreement outside the building where the decision will be made. Ross Mirkarimi's wife, Eliana Lopez, will attend the rally too. The people who want Ross Mirkarimi to stay as sheriff say that he did not commit official misconduct, while others think he should not be sheriff because he hurt his wife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Herman Northrop Frye (July 14, 1912 - January 23, 1991) was a Canadian literary critic and literary theorist, considered one of the most influential of the 20th century. Frye gained international fame with his first book, Fearful Symmetry (1947), which led to the reinterpretation of the poetry of William Blake. His lasting reputation rests principally on the theory of literary criticism that he developed in Anatomy of Criticism (1957), one of the most important works of literary theory published in the twentieth century. The American critic Harold Bloom commented at the time of its publication that Anatomy established Frye as \\"the foremost living student of Western literature.\\" Once asked whether his critical theory was Romantic, Frye responded, \\"Oh, it's entirely Romantic, yes\\" (Stingle 1). It is Romantic in the same sense that Frye attributed Romanticism to Blake: that is, \\"in the expanded sense of giving a primary place to imagination and individual feeling\\" (Stingle 2). As artifacts of the imagination, literary works, including \\"the pre-literary categories of ritual, myth, and folk-tale\\" (Archetypes 1450) form, in Frye's vision, a potentially unified imaginative experience. He reminds us that literature is the \\"central and most important extension\\" of mythology: \\". . . every human society possesses a mythology which is inherited, transmitted and diversified by literature\\" (Words with Power xiii). Mythology and literature thus inhabit and function within the same imaginative world, one that is \\"governed by conventions, by its own modes, symbols, myths and genres\\" (Hart 23). Integrity for criticism requires that it too operates within the sphere of the imagination, and not seek an organizing principle in ideology. To do so, claims Frye, . . . leaves out the central structural principles that literature derives from myth, the principles that give literature its communicating power across the centuries through all ideological changes. Such structural principles are certainly conditioned by social and historical factors and do not transcend them, but they retain a continuity of form that points to an identity of the literary organism distinct from all its adaptations to its social environment (Words with Power xiii). Myth therefore provides structure to literature simply because literature as a whole is \\"displaced mythology\\" (Bates 21). Hart makes the point well when he states that \\"For Frye, the story, and not the argument, is at the centre of literature and society. The base of society is mythical and narrative and not ideological and dialectical\\" (19). This idea, which is central in Frye's criticism, was first suggested to him by Giambattista Vico. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: did he have any other works?","completion":"Yes, Herman Northrop Frye had other works besides Fearful Symmetry and Anatomy of Criticism. The quote from the article that supports this is: \\"Mythology and literature thus inhabit and function within the same imaginative world, one that is 'governed by conventions, by its own modes, symbols, myths and genres' (Hart 23).\\" While the quote does not specifically list the other works, it implies that Frye's body of work spanned a range of topics related to mythology, literature, and literary criticism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news.

For a local craft brewery, Church Brew Works does offer some very tasty options on draft and what I would consider to be the best beer flight in Pittsburgh - in terms of tasting experience. From a brewery standpoint, Church Brew Works certainly does not disappoint. From a food perspective, the brewery provides the standard pub options that would be expected. There aren't many stand out options on the menu, but it is certainly not difficult to find something to hold over ones appetite between pints of the enjoyable craft beer. The food selection leaves more to be desired, however, the food taste is pairs nicely with the beers on tap. This is certainly a location where the drink rules supreme and the food merely follows.

Background: Frenzal Rhomb is an Australian punk rock band that formed in 1992, with Jason Whalley on lead vocals and rhythm guitar during this entire period. In 1996, Lindsay McDougall joined the line-up on lead guitar and backing vocals. Three of the group's albums have entered the top 20 on the ARIA Albums Chart: A Man's Not a Camel (1999), Context: During 2003, Frenzal Rhomb's McDougall organised Rock Against Howard, a compilation album, by various Australian musicians as a protest against incumbent Prime Minister John Howard's government. It was released in August 2004, before the October federal election, when Howard's coalition was re-elected. In July 2004, radio station 2Day FM presenter Jackie O was to MC at the Bassinthegrass festival in Darwin. Jackie allegedly arrived late, causing Frenzal Rhomb to cut their setlist short by several songs. She attempted to speak with the audience. In protest, McDougall began playing AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" over her voice. Jackie was upset that she was unable to finish her announcement to the audience. Whalley later accused her and other music industry personalities of pushing original Australian bands aside to make way for short-term marketable acts such as Australian Idol and Popstars contestants. Jackie and her co-presenter, Kyle Sandilands, called Whalley on air during their next breakfast show. Whalley apologised for offending Jackie, but stood by his claims regarding the music industry. The conversation became heated as Sandilands told Whalley \\"Your songs being played on this network or the Triple M network... it's just not going to happen now\\"; to which Whalley argued that Frenzal Rhomb were almost never played on the Austereo network anyway. During the conversation, Sandilands told Whalley that he was bitter and sad. When Whalley pointed out that Sandilands is in a position to promote new Australian music but doesn't, Sandilands countered that Frenzal Rhomb is not played on the network \\"because it's pretty much shit\\". While Sandilands agreed that shows like Popstars and Australian Idol are interested in making \\"a quick buck\\", he also asserted that he doesn't \\"care about Australian Idol or Popstars\\". Sandilands argued that Whalley should not \\"pick fights with people that are female in the Northern Territory\\". Sandilands asserted that if he himself were present, \\"it would have been on for young and old\\". Whalley argued that gender was irrelevant to the issue, and in response to Sandilands' threat of violence asked Jackie if she was aware that her security guard had threatened a band technician with violence. Sandilands said he endorsed the threat of violence. Sandilands argued to Whalley that he has to \\"get over it\\" when Whalley recommended that radio DJs should promote original Australian music. In reply, Sandilands insinuated that Frenzal Rhomb, and bands in general, suffer from a lack of support because they are not \\"putting [their] stuff in front of the right people\\". ABC Television's Media Watch covered the exchange and presenter David Marr raised concerns about the interview: \\"Kyle and Jackie O are also part of a new generation of radio thugs\\". Patrick Joyce, general manager of Austereo in Sydney, responded to Sandilands' threats of black listing and violence, \\"Music content is decided by the programming directors based on research of the market... Austereo does not approve of threats being made to anyone... We have fully canvassed these issues with Kyle\\". Question: Why was it just an attempt? Answer:","completion":"It was just an attempt because McDougall's goal to interrupt Jackie O's announcement by playing AC/DC's \\"Thunderstruck\\" over her voice was not completely successful. Although he managed to disrupt her speech, Jackie O was still able to make her announcement to the audience at a later time. Furthermore, the incident escalated into a heated on-air conversation between Whalley and the radio hosts, which did not necessarily resolve any of the underlying issues regarding the promotion of original Australian music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Thank God his work will live and ... be the admiration of future students. I have hardly got to realize my lonely position yet. He was almost all the world to me.\\" Lady Bute, wife of his greatest patron, wrote, \\"Dear Burges, ugly Burges, who designed such lovely things – what a duck.\\" In Saint Fin Barre's, together with memorials to his mother and sister, there is a memorial plaque to Burges, designed by him, and erected by his father. It shows the King of Heaven presiding over the four apostles, who hold open the Word of God. Under the inscription \\"Architect of this cathedral\\" is a simple shield and a small, worn, plaque with a mosaic surround, bearing Burges's entwined initials and name. Legal complications obstructed Burges's wish to be buried in the cathedral he had built. Burges's own words on Saint Fin Barre's, in his letter of January 1877 to the Bishop of Cork, sum up his career, \\"Fifty years hence, the whole affair will be on its trial and, the elements of time and cost being forgotten, the result only will be looked at. The great questions will then be, first, is this work beautiful and, secondly, have those to whom it was entrusted, done it with all their heart and all their ability.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who caught a chill and returned to London is Burges.

Summarize the following: In order to be friends with a wide variety of people, you've got to have a wide variety of interests. With a wide variety of interests, you'll likely have something in common with everyone and it'll be easier to hold a conversation and let your relationship bloom. So join the choir. Volunteer at your local hospital. Start painting in your free time. Learn guitar. Join the soccer team. If you've ever wanted to do something, this is a good reason to do it. Understand the personality of a group you are trying to befriend. Figure out what unites them – is it a shared activity (e.g., debate team, journalism publication, love of performing music) or a harmonious balance of personality traits (talkative, sociable, quiet, etc.)? If you share this unifying quality with the group, then let your interest/personality/whatever it may be shining. When it comes to making new friends, most people are pretty shy. They tend to automatically assume you're not interested in friendship unless you say otherwise. Take a risk, put yourself out there, and ask for their phone number, Twitter or Instagram handle, or friend them on Facebook. Being online friends is the first step to being friends in real life. And then when you have their contact information, you both can invite each other to hang out, or even just make random small talk online. The more you talk to each other, the more comfortable you'll be with each other at school or wherever you naturally meet up. Be outgoing and proactive in inviting people to hang out and paying attention to when and where people are gathering. If you want to be friends with everyone, you have to initiate reaching out to groups and be sensitive to their habits. Again, people get nervous and shy around new people. They may want to hang out, but be too timid to ask. Go out a lot in order to hang out with different groups. However, do know that being friends with everyone can be very time and energy-intensive because you must be friendly, outgoing, and willing to spend time hanging out, leaving yourself very little time to yourself. Remember, you don't have to be outgoing in order to be a good person; it's perfectly fine to be shy and reserved, and you will make your own friends. However, if your goal is to befriend a wide range of people, you will have to put that effort out there. There's a saying that goes something like, \\"If you stop going, they'll stop inviting you.\\" And it makes complete sense – would you keep inviting a friend that turned you down time and time again? So as you're making these friends (especially in the beginning stages), accept the invitations that you get. How else do you expect the friendships to grow? Remember that each group will be different. They will use different words, find different things funny or respectable, or will have very different ways of \\"hanging out.\\" Observe what is appropriate for each group, and act accordingly, but don't change yourself just to fit in. You are who you are. When you're friends with everyone, you're going to have a lot of information floating around in your head. Is it Haley that likes rock music? Paul and Vinh are the lacrosse players? When you're with your new friends (or soon-to-be friends) use their name, ask them about something you know about them, and just smile. They'll feel special seeing that you remembered so much about them. One of the easiest things you can do to make good friends is to smile and just be happy. Make jokes, laugh, and help the group have a good time. Once they realize that you're a fun person to be around, you all will become friends. Summary:","completion":"To make friends with many people, it's good to have many interests. This way, you can find something you both like and talk about it. Join clubs, learn new things, and be part of different groups. Be brave and talk to new people, even if they seem shy. Ask for their contact information, like phone numbers or social media, so you can chat more. Invite people to hang out and learn about what they like to do. It's important to be friendly and spend time with different groups, but always be yourself. Remember the little things about your new friends and make them feel special. By being happy, making jokes, and having fun, everyone will enjoy being around you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Howard and Paul Keating were both people who led Australia, and they had some things in common.

Unaware of his departure, on October 6, Texians in Matagorda marched on Presidio La Bahía in Goliad to kidnap him and steal the 50,000 that was rumored to accompany him. On October 10, approximately 125 volunteers, including 30 Tejanos, stormed the presidio. The Mexican garrison surrendered after a thirty-minute battle. One or two Texians were wounded and three Mexican soldiers were killed with seven more wounded.The Texians established themselves in the presidio, under the command of Captain Philip Dimmitt, who immediately sent all the local Tejano volunteers to join Austin on the march to Béxar. At the end of the month, Dimmitt sent a group of men under Ira Westover to engage the Mexican garrison at Fort Lipantitlán, near San Patricio. Late on November 3, the Texians took the undermanned fort without firing a shot. After dismantling the fort, they prepared to return to Goliad. The remainder of the Mexican garrison, which had been out on patrol, approached. The Mexican troops were accompanied by 15–20 loyal centralists from San Patricio, including all members of the ayuntamiento. After a thirty-minute skirmish, the Mexican soldiers and Texian centralists retreated. With their departure, the Texian army controlled the Gulf Coast, forcing Mexican commanders to send all communication with the Mexican interior overland. The slower land journey left Cos unable to quickly request or receive reinforcements or supplies.On their return to Goliad, Westover's group encountered Governor Viesca. After being freed by sympathetic soldiers, Viesca had immediately traveled to Texas to recreate the state government. Dimmitt welcomed Viesca but refused to recognize his authority as governor.

Q:Information: - George Roger Waters (born 6 September 1943) is an English singer, songwriter, bassist, and composer. In 1965, he co-founded the progressive rock band Pink Floyd with drummer Nick Mason, keyboardist Rick Wright and guitarist, singer, and songwriter Syd Barrett. Waters initially served as the group's bassist, but following the departure of Barrett in 1968, he also became their lyricist, conceptual leader and co-lead vocalist. - A comprehensive world view or worldview is the fundamental cognitive orientation of an individual or society encompassing the entirety of the individual or society's knowledge and point of view. A world view can include natural philosophy; fundamental, existential, and normative postulates; or themes, values, emotions, and ethics. The term is a calque of the German word Weltanschauung , composed of \\"Welt\\" ('world') and \\"Anschauung\\" ('view' or 'outlook'). The German word is also used in English. - A rock opera is a collection of rock music songs with lyrics that relate to a common story. Rock operas typically are released as concept albums and are not scripted for acting, which distinguishes them from operas, although several have been adapted as rock musicals. The use of various character roles within the song lyrics is a common storytelling device. The success of the rock opera genre has inspired similar works in other musical styles, such as rap opera. - The Jeff Beck Group was an English rock band formed in London in January 1967 by former The Yardbirds guitarist Jeff Beck. Their innovative approach to heavy-sounding blues and rhythm and blues was a major influence on popular music. - Eric Patrick Clapton, (born 1945), is an English rock and blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. He is the only three-time inductee to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame: once as a solo artist and separately as a member of the Yardbirds and Cream. Clapton has been referred to as one of the most important and influential guitarists of all time. Clapton ranked second in \\"Rolling Stone\\" magazine's list of the \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" and fourth in Gibson's \\"Top 50 Guitarists of All Time\\". He was also named number five in \\"Time\\" magazine's list of \\"The 10 Best Electric Guitar Players\\" in 2009. - Progressive rock (shortened as \\"prog\\"; sometimes \\"art rock\\", \\"classical rock\\" or \\"symphonic rock\\") is a broad subgenre of rock music that developed in the United Kingdom and United States throughout the mid to late 1960s. Initially termed \\"progressive pop\\", the style was an outgrowth of psychedelic bands who abandoned standard pop traditions in favour of instrumentation and compositional techniques more frequently associated with jazz, folk or classical music. Additional elements contributed to its \\"progressive\\" label: lyrics were more poetic, technology was harnessed for new sounds, music approached the condition of \\"art\\", and the studio, rather than the stage, became the focus of musical activity, which often involved creating music for listening, not dancing. - Roger Keith \\"Syd\\" Barrett (6 January 1946 7 July 2006) was an English musician, composer, singer-songwriter, and painter. Best known as a founder member of the band Pink Floyd, Barrett was the lead singer, guitarist and principal songwriter in its early years and is credited with naming the band. Barrett was excluded from Pink Floyd in April 1968 after David Gilmour took over as their new guitarist, and was briefly hospitalised amid speculation of mental illness. - Pink Floyd were an English rock band formed in London. They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in the history of popular music. - \`\` What God Wants , Part I '' is the first song in a series of songs written and released by former Pink Floyd bassist , Roger Waters on his third solo album , Amused to Death . \`\` What God Wants '' is separated into three parts , much like Pink Floyd 's earlier work with \`\` Another Brick in the Wall '' . Though the song is in three parts , \`\` What God Wants Pt. 1 '' , was the only one to be released as a single . The song features the guitar playing of Jeff Beck . This part in particular deals with the contradictory duality and hypocrisy perceived by Waters in dogmatic religion and its power over man . The following parts , along with the other songs on the album , deal with worship not only in religion but also in regard to materialism and consumption . All together , its viewpoint is on the power of simplistic conformity ; how people adhere to something , not entirely by volition , but out of submission . - Amused to Death is the third studio album by Roger Waters. It was released in 1992, and is his most recent studio album. - Nicholas Berkeley \\"Nick\\" Mason (born 27 January 1944) is an English musician and composer, best known as the drummer of progressive rock group Pink Floyd. - Geoffrey Arnold \\"Jeff\\" Beck (born 24 June 1944) is an English rock guitarist. He is one of the three noted guitarists to have played with The Yardbirds (the other two being Eric Clapton and Jimmy Page). Beck also formed The Jeff Beck Group and Beck, Bogert & Appice. - Religion is a cultural system of behaviors and practices, world views, sacred texts, holy places, ethics, and societal organisation that relate humanity to what an anthropologist has called \\"an order of existence\\". Different religions may or may not contain various elements, ranging from the \\"divine\\", \\"sacred things\\", \\"faith\\", a \\"supernatural being or supernatural beings\\" or \\"some sort of ultimacy and transcendence that will provide norms and power for the rest of life.\\" - \\"Another Brick in the Wall\\" is the title of three songs set to variations of the same basic theme, on Pink Floyd's 1979 rock opera, \\"The Wall\\", subtitled Part 1 (working title \\"Reminiscing\\"), Part 2 (working title \\"Education\\"), and Part 3 (working title \\"Drugs\\"). All parts were written by Pink Floyd's bassist, Roger Waters. - James Patrick \\"Jimmy\\" Page, (born 9 January 1944) is an English musician, songwriter, and record producer who achieved international success as the guitarist and founder of the rock band Led Zeppelin. - The Wall is the eleventh studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd, released as a double album on 30 November 1979 by Harvest Records in the United Kingdom and by Columbia Records in the United States. Considered one of the most famous concept albums by any artist, \\"The Wall\\" features the band's only single to top various charts, \\"Another Brick in the Wall, Part 2\\", followed with \\"Run Like Hell\\" and \\"Comfortably Numb\\".

Notes Ken Layne of Wonkette, who ignited the speculation and has been warming himself at the resulting bonfire: \\"We’ve finally got something Sarah Palin won’t talk about, which is awesome.\\" Who will talk about it? Women with implants, of course. Layne reports that he \\"found this trove of insider data on a little website we like to call 'JustBreastImplants.com,' because that is the name of the website.\\" One commenter writes, \\"Don’t know if she had them done or if the other outfits just cover her assets up more,\\" but another counters: \\"I think she did…I mean BAM!\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"The rumors of former Alaskan Governor Sarah Palin having breast augmentation surgery have been making rounds on the grapevine recently. It first came to light when Ken Layne, from Wonkette, started speculating about it. The rumors caught fire and have been a hot topic of discussion since then. Layne has been capitalising on the speculation, stating that it's \\"awesome\\" that we've finally found a topic Sarah Palin is reluctant to discuss. However, an anonymous friend of Palin's has reached out to Us Weekly to believe that the talk surrounding this topic is simply preposterous. The source told the magazine, \\"It's absolutely ridiculous,\\" thus attempting to debunk the circulating claims about Palin's supposed cosmetic surgery. Despite the anonymous source's statement, the discussion hasn't ceased. Layne said that he found valuable data about this from an unlikely platform, aptly named - 'JustBreastImplants.com'. It's a website that offers a platform for individuals, especially women who have had implants, to share their experiences and knowledge. From this site, Layne supposedly gathered inside information related to Palin's alleged surgery. In the midst of the swirling rumors, two opposing opinions stood out in the public discourse. One user on the website posed the possibility that Palin might have opted for clothing that strategically hid her assets before, creating an illusion of a sudden 'enlargement'. In stark contrast, another user firmly believes that there is no doubt about Palin having undergone the procedure. The user confidently stated, \\"I think she did… I mean BAM!\\" due to the seemingly noticeable difference. In conclusion, the rumors of Palin's supposed breast augmentation surgery have certainly sparked a fiery debate, with some dismissing it as nonsense while others firmly believe in the noticeable difference. Despite the firm denial by a source close to Palin, the speculation refuses to settle down, fuelled by different opinions and inside data found on a breast implant-sharing platform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: By Tom Pedulla, USA TODAY OAKLAND  Perhaps it is only fitting that the Oakland Raiders, kicked around in the national press for their instability among other shortcomings, silenced their critics with a record-setting boot. Sebastian Janikowski's team-record 57-yard field goal with 2:30 left on the clock gave Oakland a 16-13 overtime victory against the New York Jets on Sunday. It also kept interim coach Tom Cable from playing a major role in what had all the makings of another Raiders misadventure. \\"Well, how about that!\\" said Cable after his team rebounded from a 34-3 pounding against the New Orleans Saints in his debut. \\"Let's talk about the character of this football team before we talk about anything else, how hard they played, how long they played.\\" BOX SCORE: Raiders 16, Jets 13 (OT) They did play hard and they did play for what seemed an eternity before their perseverance overcame an abundance of sins. The Raiders incurred 14 penalties for 85 yards and converted only four of 17 third-down opportunities. Things did not go smoothly on the sidelines, either. Cable, promoted from offensive line coach to replace Lane Kiffin in another of owner Al Davis' controversial decisions, opted to call a timeout an instant before New York's Jay Feely clanged a 52-yard field goal attempt off the left upright with three seconds left in regulation. Given a second chance, Feely banged the kick through to force overtime. That caused Cable to second-guess himself before everyone else had the chance to. \\"What do you do? I called it,\\" he said of the ill-fated timeout. \\"Yeah, I was kicking myself for a bit.\\" Thanks to Janikowski, what will be remembered most about this marathon is that Oakland snapped a three-game losing streak and improved to 2-4 while handing New York (3-3) a costly defeat. Cable never hesitated in allowing Janikowski the chance to be a hero, even though he risked giving legendary quarterback Brett Favre and the Jets ideal field position if things went badly. \\"I thought he was going to rip it and he did,\\" the coach said. \\"You've just got to believe in your players. That's what it's all about.\\" Janikowski broke his own mark for the longest field goal in team history. Janikowski broke his own mark for the longest field goal in team history. He had nailed a 56-yarder in the Raiders? 23-8 win over the Kansas City Chiefs in Week 2. Janikowsi was confident the second his latest bomb left his foot. \\"As soon as I hit it I started celebrating,\\" he said, \\"because I knew I hit it good.\\" Raiders players, and their black-clad fans, acted as if the downtrodden franchise had just won its first Super Bowl since the close of the 1983 season. \\"I didn't want to get hurt. I tried to stand up, but guys were just piling on top of me,\\" Janikowski said. \\"It felt good.\\" The outcome may provide a tremendous confidence boost for a club with young players at key positions, starting with quarterback JaMarcus Russell. After conservative play-calling led Oakland to go three-and-out on its first two possessions of overtime, Russell was turned loose on what proved to be the game-winning drive. He responded with a strike over the middle to wideout Javon Walker for 16 yards and then another to tight end Zach Miller for 27 yards. Oakland did not commit a turnover while New York was guilty of three. Russell, the top pick in last year's draft, finished 17 of 30 for 203 yards, including an 8-yard scoring pass to Walker. Favre closed 21 of 38 for 197 yards, but was hurt by two interceptions. The Jets' Thomas Jones rushed for 159 yards, but did not score a touchdown.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Kidneys filter waste out of blood - Composition of blood is regulated - Volume of water in blood is kept constant - PH is kept at a constant level - Kidneys help regulate blood pressure - Kidneys stimulate the making of red blood cells - Calcium levels are maintained. Question: suppose You are in more hot desert with no water happens, how will it affect Your urine output is lower. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less To understand the effect of being in a hot desert with no water on urine output, we must first grasp the role of the kidneys and the factors involved in urine production. The kidneys are essential organs that serve multiple functions within the body. Their primary responsibilities include filtering waste out of blood, regulating the composition of blood, maintaining a constant volume of water in blood, keeping the pH level constant, helping to regulate blood pressure, stimulating the production of red blood cells, and maintaining calcium levels. One key function of the kidneys is to control the balance of water in our bodies, which helps maintain blood pressure and overall hydration. When the body's water intake is sufficient, the kidneys will produce a normal amount of urine to maintain a stable blood volume. However, when the body's water intake is insufficient or water loss is increased, the kidneys adjust urine production to preserve water and prevent dehydration. In a hot desert environment with no water available, a person will become dehydrated due to the lack of water intake coupled with increased water loss. Water loss is intensified in this environment through sweat, which occurs as the body attempts to regulate its core temperature by promoting perspiration. When a person is dehydrated, the kidneys play a vital role in maintaining blood volume. They do this by reabsorbing more water back into the bloodstream and reducing the volume of urine produced. This process is regulated through the release of hormones such as anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) and aldosterone. When the body recognizes that it is dehydrated, it increases the production of these hormones, signaling the kidneys to retain more water. This will result in a lower urine output, which will be more concentrated, as the kidneys work to conserve water within the body. Therefore, if you are in a hot desert with no water available, your urine output would be lower (Answer B) as the kidneys try to conserve water. This response is an essential survival mechanism that allows the body to maintain proper hydration levels and prevent further complications, such as hypotension (low blood pressure), decreased organ function, and ultimately, shock. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that this is merely a temporary solution; in the long run, without adequate water intake, the individual would eventually suffer from severe dehydration and its life-threatening consequences."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

It was a seemingly wistful moment at the halfway mark of his presidency, before the celebratory parade and the evening's galas. Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its \\"never-ending journey\\" to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him. \\"I want to take a look one more time,\\" he told those surrounding him. \\"I'm not going to see this again.\\" And so, with his oath of office taken -- again -- and the speech delivered, the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past.

We wrote poetry for the class rather than prose this time since the","completion":"teacher wanted to explore our creative and metaphorical sides more deeply. The theme we were given was 'The Autumn of Life', which referred not just to the season but also to the metaphorical autumn years of one's life. Students in the class eagerly brushed the dust off their journals and opened their favorite writing apps, eager to create something that would evoke a sense of melancholy, beauty, and transformation. In their poems, many students chose to focus on the colors of autumn – the fiery red, rich orange, and deep yellow leaves that cascaded around their hometowns, creating a warm and vibrant atmosphere despite the chill in the air. They wrote about the harvest season and how their families and communities would come together to celebrate the hard work they had all put into growing and nurturing their crops. They drew comparisons to the autumn of one's life, symbolizing the remembrance and appreciation of the fruits of one's labor. Other students took a more somber approach, addressing the process of aging and the realization of one's own mortality. They expressed the feelings of losing one's youth and strength, but also the wisdom and insight that could only come with having lived a full life. They captured the change in perspective as the memories of bygone days provided a poignant backdrop against the reality of an ever-nearing end, making each moment in the present all the more precious. As the leaves fell from the trees, so, too, did the words spill from the pens and fingertips of the students onto the page or screen. The skies above them darkened, and the winds picked up, signaling the arrival of cold winter months. But within each poem were whispers of acceptance and peace as the writers faced the colder seasons ahead. The teacher was particularly moved by a poem written by a quiet girl named Emily. Her words captured a depth of emotion and insight that reflected maturity far beyond her years: \\"The Autumn of Life, so bittersweet and gold, A time to reflect upon the stories untold, The branches of memories, a lifetime unfurled, The beauty of living in this transient world. From the colors of warmth to the touch of the frost, Accepting the changes, yet not feeling lost, The wisdom of sages, and the bond of true friends, A treasure to hold as this season transcends. From youth's spring blossoms, through the summers that blaze, In autumn's reflection, I embrace the slow haze. The chill of the end may arrive swift and bold, But I find peace within, as I travel this road.\\" As each student read their poem in front of the class, there was a shift in the atmosphere; a shared understanding that time is not forever, and that life is a gift to be cherished. There were nods, smiles, and even some tears – realizations that they weren't just writing about themselves, but about experiences that they would one day share. After the last poem was read, the teacher praised their work and encouraged them to continue exploring the depths of their creativity and emotions through poetry. They could all see the power in words and the ability to capture fleeting moments and feelings. The bell rang, signaling the end of class, but their journey into the world of poetry and self-expression had only just begun. As they left the classroom and ventured into the world, each student carried with them the colors and essences of autumn, and an ever-growing understanding of the human experience. Through the power of poetry and the art of storytelling, they had gained the ability to see the beauty in the world's impermanence and to embrace the bitter-sweetness that lies within the autumn of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me.

I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. The manager probably believes that: Pick the correct answer from the following options: A. not enough information B. The waitress needs a raise. C. Something is wrong with the waitress. D. The restaurant should be closed down. Answer:","completion":"C. Something is wrong with the waitress. From the given story, it can be deduced that the manager would most likely believe that something is wrong with the waitress. During the incident, the waitress had consumed large amounts of coffee, smoked a cigarette, and was working multiple jobs, causing her to be physically and mentally exhausted. This ultimately led to her fainting while attending to her first table of customers, resulting in a head injury and considerable distress for everyone involved. The manager, witnessing the entire event, would reasonably infer that the waitress' condition was not normal and that something might indeed be wrong with her. Her extreme exhaustion, reliance on coffee and cigarettes, and underlying health issues could all be contributing factors to her unexpected syncope, or passing out. Though the other provided options mention the possibility of a raise, closing the restaurant, or withholding judgment due to lacking information, these options don't accurately reflect the manager's likely thought process given the scenario. The situation described did not indicate any issues with the waitress's performance that would lead to a raise or the closure of the restaurant. Instead, the manager would be most concerned about the well-being of the waitress, recognizing that her behavior and the subsequent incident were indicative of an underlying issue."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: This is one of the most important things to consider. Good beds don't always mean \\"soft,\\" so get one that provides good support to your back and make sure you are comfortable sleeping on it. Be sure to use a pillow that is comfortable and supportive for your sleeping style. Having the right pillow will ensure that you wake up feeling refreshed and pain-free. If you are comfortable, you will be more likely to sleep longer. Keep your bedroom properly ventilated so you get plenty of fresh air. Set the temperature of your room appropriately, not too warm or too cold. Typically this will be between 65 and 72 degrees Fahrenheit, but you should adjust the temperature so that you feel comfortable. Setting the temperature just slightly cooler than comfortable -- so that you're fine, but still need covers -- will help you sleep. If your room is stuffy, try cracking the window a bit before bed time. In addition to providing extra airflow and controlling room temperature, a fan produces a low, consistent level of background noise. This can help eliminate auditory stimuli that keep you from falling and staying asleep. Keep in mind that for some, a fan might not be helpful. If it doesn’t work for you, then don’t use one. Try to keep your room dark at all times. Your brain is stimulated by light signal, so keeping a dark room helps you get to sleep faster. You can help with this by installing blackout blinds or curtains This applies even to small lights, like those on your T.V., a digital clock or D.V.D. player. The absence of light eliminates the presence stimuli that can alter or affect your sleeping patterns. If there is some reason you cannot, or do not wish to, install blinds or curtains, you can invest in a sleep mask to help simulate darkness. Check if your room is free from mosquitoes and other pests. Also, if you have pets in your home, make sure they can’t access your bed or enter your room to avoid disturbances while sleeping. There is evidence that it is easier to sleep in a fresh, clean, or nice smelling space. Try spraying your room with a mild room spray to lighten up your mood and the ambience in your bedroom. If you choose to use scented candles, be sure to put them out before falling asleep to avoid fires in the home.

Their route varied from night to night, but the ultimate destination was never in question. \\"May I help you?\\" The worn-out speaker was crackly, but he still recognized the particularly twangy East Texas voice of Fontana Fry. Over his six years of vocal training, he had become acutely aware of accents. This is true of all classically trained singers. Great emphasis is placed on precise pronunciation and enunciation. It is mandatory that the singer's repertoire include works written in English, Latin, Italian, German, and French. So, by the time Greg finished his graduate degree, his accent had been all but eliminated. He sounded somewhat like a network news anchor instead of an East Texan. \\"I would like a large--\\" \\"--a large dipped cone, the usual. Right?\\" The Dairy Queen drive-thru ordering station was located out in front of the restaurant, on the right side. He looked up, and saw the 19 year-old waving at him. She looked so cute in her little Dairy Queen outfit. Fontana was in her first year at Kilgore College. She planned to be an elementary teacher. He knew she would be a good one. Greg had met Fontana a few months earlier when she brought her 13-year-old brother to the studio to enroll for guitar lessons. The boy was holding a U.S. made, 1968 Harmony acoustic guitar his uncle gave him. The body and the frets were badly worn, but the instrument still played beautifully. It looked somewhat like a large violin, with arched top and f-holes. That shape produces a more mellow sound than flattops. And the guitar's age contributed additional warmth to the tone.

Option I: 1. Shred the newspaper, which increases its surface area and speeds up its decomposition. 2. Wet the shredded newspaper, providing moisture which is essential for the composting process. 3. Use the wet shredded newspaper in compost for raised beds or as mulch, contributing to the organic matter and soil health. 4. Line the beds with newspapers before putting the soil, offering another way to recycle newspapers and provide insulation. 5. Wet and weigh down the lined newspaper with foil, locks, and bands, helping hold the newspapers in place and provide mulch and insulation. 6. This option acts as a substitute for garden fabric, saving money and resources. Option II: 1. Shred the newspaper, which increases its surface area and speeds up its decomposition. 2.

Wet and weigh down the lined newspaper with soil, rocks, and sand, helping hold the newspapers in place and provide mulch and insulation. 6. This option acts as a substitute for garden fabric, saving money and resources. Both solutions essentially involve the same primary steps to recycle newspapers and use them in the garden. The main difference is in weighing down the newspapers at the end of the process. Option I uses foil, locks, and bands to hold the newspaper in place, while Option II uses more naturally occurring materials like soil, rocks, and sand. Considering the goal of recycling newspapers and using them in the garden, Option II is a better solution because it utilizes more natural materials, which is relatively eco-friendlier and more conducive to gardening. Additionally, Option II is likely more cost-effective, as soil, rocks, and sand are more readily available than foil, locks, and bands."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To do this, add 180 to both sides of the equation: 504 + 180 = -57*v 504 + 180 = 684, so the equation becomes: 684 = -57*v Step 3: Solve for v. To solve for v, divide both sides of the equation by -57: 684 / -57 = (-57*v) / -57 (-684) / 57 = v Step 4: Simplify the fraction if possible. Divide both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD). In this case, the GCD of 684 and 57 is 3.

Lennon's debut solo album, John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band (1970), was received with praise by many music critics, but its highly personal lyrics and stark sound limited its commercial performance. Critic Greil Marcus remarked, \\"John's singing in the last verse of 'God' may be the finest in all of rock.\\" The album featured the song \\"Mother\\", in which Lennon confronted his feelings of childhood rejection, and the Dylanesque \\"Working Class Hero\\", a bitter attack against the bourgeois social system which, due to the lyric \\"you're still fucking peasants\\", fell foul of broadcasters. In January 1971, Tariq Ali expressed his revolutionary political views when he interviewed Lennon, who immediately responded by writing \\"Power to the People\\". In his lyrics to the song, Lennon reversed the non-confrontational approach he had espoused in \\"Revolution\\", although he later disowned the message, saying that it was borne out of guilt and a desire for approval from radicals such as Ali. Lennon became involved with Ali in a protest against the prosecution of Oz magazine for alleged obscenity. Lennon denounced the proceedings as \\"disgusting fascism\\", and he and Ono (as Elastic Oz Band) released the single \\"God Save Us/Do the Oz\\" and joined marches in support of the magazine.

I expressed my vicious frustration for the place and thought constantly of the passing hours, counting them down as they went. Because of this I was thankful for the eight to ten I would use up easily in my escapes to the world behind my eyelids. There I was free and could experience a life unhindered by limitations of ethics or gravity. When I'd awake I'd write what I could remember of my escapes on the obtrusive legal pad. I had the suspicion that the attendants would come in and read my thoughts as I was eating meals or watching TV and I wondered if this was hindering my ability to get out. I wondered what kind of opinions and judgments they were forming about me. I had bared my soul on those pages explaining desperately how the thoughts would not leave even in this place, where it mattered most that they were gone. The fuckers would never leave.

Please answer the following question: Information: - The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea (often abbreviated to RBKC) is an inner London borough of Royal borough status, to the west of the centre. As the smallest borough in London and the second smallest district in England, this urban area is one of the most densely populated in the United Kingdom. - The London Underground (also known simply as the Underground, or by its nickname the Tube) is a public rapid transit system serving Greater London and some parts of the adjacent counties of Buckinghamshire, Essex and Hertfordshire in the United Kingdom. - Notting Hill Gate is a London Underground station in the street known as Notting Hill Gate . On the Central line , it is between Holland Park to the west and Queensway to the east . On the District line and Circle line it is between High Street Kensington and Bayswater stations . It is on the boundary of Travelcard Zone 1 and Zone 2 . - Buckinghamshire (or ), abbreviated Bucks, is a county in South East England which borders Greater London to the south east, Berkshire to the south, Oxfordshire to the west, Northamptonshire to the north, Bedfordshire to the north east and Hertfordshire to the east. - The Tube map is a schematic transport map of the lines, stations and services of London's public transport systems, the primary system being London Underground, known colloquially as \\"the Tube\\", hence the map's name. The first schematic Tube map was designed by Harry Beck in 1931, and it has since been expanded to also include today the Docklands Light Railway, London Overground, TfL Rail, Tramlink and the Emirates Air Line cable car. - Upminster is a suburban town in east London, England, and part of the London Borough of Havering. Located east-northeast of Charing Cross, it is one of the locally important district centres identified in the London Plan, and comprises a number of shopping streets and a large residential area. It was historically, a rural village in Essex and formed an ancient parish. Although peripheral to London, the town has good transport links; it was first connected to central London by rail in 1885 and has a terminal station on the London Underground network. The economic history of Upminster is characterised by a shift from farming to garden suburb. As part of the suburban growth of London in the 20th century, Upminster significantly expanded and increased in population, becoming part of Hornchurch Urban District in 1934, and has formed part of Greater London since 1965. - Earl's Court is a district in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in central London, bordering the sub-districts of South Kensington to the east, West Kensington to the west, Chelsea to the south and Kensington to the north. The Earl's Court Exhibition Centre was one of the country's largest indoor arenas and a popular concert venue until its closure in 2014. - Hertfordshire (often abbreviated Herts) is a county in southern England, bordered by Bedfordshire to the north, Cambridgeshire to the north-east, Essex to the east, Buckinghamshire to the west and Greater London to the south. For government statistical purposes, it is placed in the East of England region. - Edgware Road is a major road through north-west London, starting at Marble Arch in the City of Westminster (south end) and running north-west to Edgware in the London Borough of Barnet. It is also a boundary between several North London boroughs. The route has its origins as a Roman road (part of Watling Street) and therefore runs for 10 miles in an almost perfect straight line, which is unusual in London. It is part of the modern A5 road. It undergoes several name changes along its length, including Maida Vale, Kilburn High Road, Shoot Up Hill and Cricklewood Broadway; but the road is, as a whole, known as the Edgware Road, as it is the road to Edgware. - Notting Hill is an affluent district in West London, located north of Kensington within the Royal Borough of Kensington & Chelsea as well as Westminster. Notting Hill is known for being a cosmopolitan neighbourhood, hosting the annual Notting Hill Carnival and Portobello Road Market. - The Piccadilly line is a line of the London Underground, coloured dark blue on the Tube map. It is the fourth busiest line on the Underground network on the basis of the number of passengers transported per year with 210,000,000. It is mainly a deep-level line, running from the north to the west of London via Zone 1, with a number of surface sections, mostly in its westernmost parts. It is named after the road above it between Hyde Park Corner and Piccadilly Circus. Some of its stations are shared with the District line and some are shared with the Metropolitan line. It is the second longest line on the system, after the Central line, and has the second most stations, after the District line. It serves many of London's top tourist attractions including Harrods (Knightsbridge), Hyde Park, Buckingham Palace (within walking distance from Green Park), Piccadilly Circus, Leicester Square and Covent Garden, as well as London Heathrow Airport, the busiest airport in Europe. The line shares tracks with the Metropolitan line between Uxbridge and Rayners Lane, and with the District line between Hanger Lane Junction and Acton Town, then runs parallel with the District line between Acton Town and Barons Court. - Notting Hill Gate is one of the main thoroughfares of Notting Hill, in the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea. Historically the street was a location for toll gates, from which it derives its modern name. - Central London is the innermost part of London, England. There is no official definition of its area but its characteristics are understood to include a high density built environment, high land values, an elevated daytime population and a concentration of regionally, nationally and internationally significant organisations and facilities. Over time a number of definitions have been used to define the scope of central London for statistics, urban planning and local government. - Paddington is an area within the City of Westminster, in central London. Formerly a metropolitan borough, it was integrated with Westminster and Greater London in 1965. Three important landmarks of the district are Paddington station, designed by the celebrated engineer Isambard Kingdom Brunel and opened in 1847; St Mary's Hospital; and Paddington Green Police Station (the most important high-security police station in the United Kingdom). - Rapid transit, also known as heavy rail, metro, subway, tube, or underground, is a type of high-capacity public transport generally found in urban areas. Unlike buses or trams, rapid transit systems are electric railways that operate on an exclusive right-of-way, which cannot be accessed by pedestrians or other vehicles of any sort, and which is often grade separated in tunnels or on elevated railways. - The District line is a London Underground service that crosses Greater London from east to west. From Upminster, the eastern terminus, the line runs through Central London to Earl's Court before dividing into three western branches, to Ealing Broadway, Wimbledon and Richmond. There is a short branch that goes from Earl's Court to . A branch also runs north from Earl's Court to Edgware Road via Paddington. Coloured green on the tube map, the line serves 60 stations in , and with bridges across the Thames on the Wimbledon and Richmond branches is the only London Underground line to cross the river in this way. The track and stations between Barking and Aldgate East are shared with the Hammersmith & City line, and between Tower Hill and Gloucester Road and on the Edgware Road branch with the Circle line. Some of the stations are shared with the Piccadilly line. Unlike London's deep-level tube railways, the railway tunnels are just below the surface, and the trains are of a similar size to those on British main lines. What is the relationship between 'notting hill gate tube station' and 'royal borough of kensington and chelsea'? A:","completion":"The relationship between Notting Hill Gate Tube Station and the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea is that the tube station is located within the borough.

The early scenes of the film show him filming his conversation in the hospital with his dying grandfather. Through the eyes of Simon we see the grandfather as a caring, wise man, while through the perspective of his uncle we see the racist, backwards side. Simon's grandfather hated Simon's father and claims that he intended to kill Simon's mother in the car crash when, as Simon finds out at the film's conclusion, he had an eye condition. This condition prevented him from being able to drive at night, as the glare from oncoming headlights would blind him. The evening of the car crash reveals a different side of the story, causing the memories of each character to meet head on, connecting disparate stories of each character to unite in an Egoyanesque conclusion.Simon's family narrative is cleverly knit into a news story presented to Simon by his high school French teacher as a translation exercise. An article is read by the teacher about an attempted bombing of an aircraft by a man who put explosives in his pregnant wife's luggage. Simon gets the idea to translate the story and write it from the perspective of the child in the woman's womb. The teacher encourages Simon to develop his story as a drama exercise, however Simon presents it to the class and to the world via the Internet as if he really was that child. The teacher's silence, as we find out later, is owing to her relationship with Simon's late father who died, with his mother, in a car crash when he was still a child. The narrative of the car crash and the attempted bombing of the plane become intertwined as a way for the characters to deal with their past experiences, which they have all been trying to deny.The film is about a search for identity in a digital age where the truth is oftentimes irrelevant. Simon's story of his suicide bomber father is met on the Internet with sympathy, anger, and even support as we see a skinhead on webcam telling Simon that his father was a hero....

Maier was abducted Monday night from the yard of her home... (Associated Press) Authorities on Thursday said 38-year-old Paul S. Smith of Hawk Point, Mo., was the suspect in the Monday abduction of Alisa Meier, who was found alive and unharmed the following evening. Smith died late Wednesday at a St. Charles hospital. \\"It's over,\\" St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch said at a news conference. \\"There's no reason to believe at this point that anyone else was involved.\\" Smith was convicted in 1995 of sodomy in a case involving a 10-year-old boy, according to the Missouri State Highway Patrol's registry of sex offenders. He served about 11 years in prison. Alisa, a little girl with big brown eyes, was snatched from the front yard of her Louisiana, Mo., home about 8 p.m. Monday while her mother was inside cooking dinner. Her 6-year-old brother, Blake, told police a young man in a dark-colored car pulled up and ordered Alisa to get in. A little more than 24 hours later, a dark-colored car was seen at a car wash in St. Louis County, some 70 miles to the south. About the same time, a child was seen wandering around the car wash. It turned out to be Alisa. Police followed up on more than 100 leads in the search for her abductor. It wasn't a tip, though, that led to Smith. Once Alisa was found safe, police noticed she was wearing new clothes. Tags on the clothes indicated they came from Wal-Mart, and police traced them to a store in Troy, about halfway between Louisiana and St. Louis County. Surveillance video from the store showed a man matching Smith's description. Smith also bought cigarettes at the store, requiring him to give a date of birth, which aided in the investigation. Fitch said the video surveillance did not indicate that Alisa was in the store with Smith when he bought the clothes. About 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, officers approached a tiny home in Hawk Point, Mo., a small community not far from Troy. Smith was spray painting his dark-colored car silver when officers approached, Fitch said. Without warning, Smith pulled out a handgun and shot himself. He died about six hours later. Authorities credited an Amber Alert, media and public attention for Alisa's safe return. Relatives have said the girl was unharmed and that she told them she was treated well during her captivity, except for a haircut apparently administered by the suspect, perhaps to conceal her identity. Louisiana Police Chief Rich Hughes said the town of 3,800 residents had rallied around Alisa and her family. \\"A small community, you can imagine how this impacts them,\\" Hughes said at a news conference in St. Louis County. \\"To see Alisa come back home is great.\\" Her great-aunt, Angela Reddick, said a welcome-home party was planned for Saturday. \\"We're just so happy,\\" Reddick said. \\"We can't wait to see her and give her a big hug.\\" Celebratory messages graced church billboards and an electronic bank sign as Louisiana rejoiced in Alisa's safe return. Visitors to the family's small frame home left balloons and teddy bears on the porch and in the yard. \\"I turned on the news and my wife and I both started crying and fell down to our knees and thanked the Lord,\\" Terry Cook, a pastor who helped organize a prayer vigil for the child Tuesday night. The vigil drew 400 people, more than the town's Fourth of July festival. Fitch said law officers continue to investigate Smith's background and whether he may have been involved in other unsolved missing child cases. Among them is the case of Bianca Piper, a 13-year-old girl who went missing from her home near Foley, Mo., in 2005. Foley and Louisiana are both situated along Missouri Route 79, and are about 25 miles apart. \\"You can't ignore the similarities,\\" Fitch said. ||||| Thursday July 8, 2010 - Louisiana, Missouri - Roy Harrison, right, holds his four-year-old granddaughter Alisa Maier after she arrived home after being abducted Monday evening allegedly by Paul S. Smith of Lincoln County. She was found in Fenton about 26 hours later. Christian Gooden cgooden@post-dispatch.com UPDATED, 1:45 p.m. with details of Alisa's return home. LOUISIANA, Mo. -- Alisa Maier arrived home at 1:25 p.m. today to the cheers of about two dozen relatives and friends. They had been waiting on the front lawn of the family home at 320 North Carolina Street, where she had been when a kidnapper snatched her Monday evening. Alisa, 4, wore a red shirt with an American flag on front, red pants and pink flip-flops. Her mother, Kimberly Harrison, walked her to the front door beneath a large banner saying, \\"Welcome Home Alisa.\\" Her father, David Maier, had driven the family home in a Chevrolet Impala, then followed them in with the overnight bags. He stopped briefly to speak with the reporters. Asked about the ordeal, he said, \\"You don’t want to know. I’ve been numb this whole time this has been going on.\\" Asked about Alisa and whether she has told them much, he said, \\"She’s happy. I’m not pushing her to say anything.\\" Kimberly Harrison spoke from the family porch. \\"I really missed her. I’m just glad she’s home right now,\\" she said. A few moments later, Alisa came back out on the porch, ready to play. A cousin, Carissa Doyle, gave Alisa a hug. Before the arrival, grandfather Roy Harrison did a somersault on the lawn after one of the kids did a back flip. On Wednesday, after Alisa had been returned to her family in Fenton, he had said, \\"I’d to a back flip if I could, but I’m just too dadgum old.\\" His quote was widely reported from coast to coast. Angela Reddick, a great aunt, said of Smith, \\"I wish we could have faced him in court. It’s justice in a way, because now he’s facing his maker.\\" Great-grandmother Mary Foiles sought to find something redeeming in Smith’s decision to relase Alisa on Tuesday night at the Fenton Car Wash. \\"I believed that man had enough good in him that God could touch him,\\" Foiles said. \\"Either that, or he was so afraid, he let her go. Or maybe both.\\" Earlier today, police said they are confident that Paul S. Smith, the sex offender who shot himself to death Wednesday is the man who kidnapped Alisa, then released her 26 hours later in Fenton. And investigators were led to Smith after a Walmart store released video of him buying new clothing for Alisa. They knew it was Walmart clothing based on the tags inside the new clothes she had on when he dropped her off alive at a Fenton strip mall. Those new details emerged Thursday morning at a press conference led by St. Louis County Police Chief Tim Fitch in Clayton. \\"We are confident, at this point, that he is the suspect,\\" Fitch told reporters. After executing search warrants on Smith's cell phone records, his car and home, Fitch said: \\"We have recovered evidence to lead us to believe that he is the one who abducted Alisa.\\" Smith, 38, died about 10:30 p.m. Wednesday at St. Joseph Health Center in St. Charles from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. He shot himself with a small-caliber handgun as police approached him outside his Hawk Point, Mo., home to question him in the kidnapping. He was considered a \\"person of interest\\" at that point. Smith was painting a dark-colored car 1991 Mazda Protege when police approached him, at a home on Highway D in Hawk Point. Investigators said they didn't see Alisa in the Walmart video. Police went to the Walmart in Troy, Mo., after seeing the tags in new clothing. \\"The child's clothes had been changed, so we were able to track that back,\\" Fitch said. The video, of course, didn't give police his name, but Smith apparently also bought cigarettes at checkout, triggering the need for him to supply the cashier with identification with his date of birth. That information helped lead police to Smith. Fitch said investigators pulled off good, old-fashioned police work to find Smith. An earlier report that a relative tipped police off to Smith was erroneous, he said. Police believe Smith acted alone. Fitch thanked the public and the media for their assistance in the case. He told reporters, \\"You and the public put pressure on Mr. Smith.\\" Alisa was abducted from the front lawn of her Louisiana, Mo., home Monday evening, shortly after her mother called her to dinner. Her 6-year-old brother was the only eyewitness, and he provided police with a description of the man and the car. Alisa reappeared almost 26 hours later, wandering alone at a car wash in Fenton. Fitch said he wasn't sure why Smith chose Fenton to drop the girl off. He said Smith has a relative in south St. Louis but police were unaware of any dealings he had in Fenton. Fitch also said that Smith was familiar with Lousiana, Mo., but police aren't sure what brought him to that area Monday, the day of the kidnapping. Meanwhile Thursday morning, Roy Harrison, the quotable grandfather, told the Post-Dispatch that Alisa was watching a television newscast in a St. Louis area hotel room with her mother and father when she saw a picture of Smith flash on the screen Wednesday. \\"Without prompting, she said, 'He cut my hair,'\\" Harrison said. The kidnapper apparently cut Alisa's hair to disguise her or make her look like a boy. Separately, back in the girl's hometown of Louisiana, Mo., Alisa's brother, 6-year-old Blake, was watching television with his grandmother and aunt. Blake was the lone witness to the abduction. He too recognized Smith's photograph, Harrison said. \\"Blake said, 'That's the man,'\\" Harrison said. \\"And he was scared.\\" Harrison said that, after seeing Smith's mugshot, he thinks Blake did a great job of providing such a detailed description for a little boy under stress. \\"I think he was right on,\\" Harrison said. Harrison joked that family members may be talking with Blake about a possible career in law enforcement, because he has an eye for detail.

O'CONNELL poconnell@post-dispatch.com > 314-340-8126 STEPHEN DEERE sdeere@post-dispatch.com > 314-340-8116 and CHRISTINE BYERS cbyers@post-dispatch.com > 314-863-2821 LOUISIANA, Mo. -- The prime suspect in the abduction of a Louisiana, Mo., girl shot himself in the head when authorities closed in Wednesday afternoon, a day after the 4-year-old was found alive in a St. Louis County strip mall parking lot. Police converged on the rural residence in Hawk Point in Lincoln County about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday after receiving information that the man who may have taken 4-year-old Alisa Maier lived there. Police sources said the suspect is Paul S. Smith, a sex offender who lived at a home on Highway D in Hawk Point. Smith was spraypainting his car silver when police approached, a police source said. He lived nearly six hours after shooting himself. Smith, 38, matches the general description of the abductor. His dark-colored car - the one he was painting - matched the description of the car involved in the abduction, police said. Alisa was abducted from the front lawn of her Louisiana home Monday evening, shortly after her mother called her to dinner. She reappeared almost 26 hours later, wandering alone at a car wash in Fenton. She was reunited with her parents, David Maier and Kimberly Harrison, early Wednesday morning at the county police's Fenton precinct. Officers and family then drove into St. Louis at 4:30 a.m. to Cardinal Glennon Children's Medical Center, where doctors examined her. Alisa's grandfather Roy Harrison told reporters that Alisa and her family were in a hotel in an undisclosed location and would not go home for a while. He said Alisa was fine. \\"No harm at all,\\" Harrison said when asked whether she had been hurt. Police in St. Louis County would not discuss the medical examination of Alisa done Wednesday. Investigators said that when she was taken to the hospital late Tuesday night she was tired and did not say much. Smith, the suspect, was convicted in 1995 of sodomy of a 10-year-old and served about 11 years in prison. He is listed on the Missouri sex offender registry as a noncompliant offender, meaning he has not informed authorities of his current address. Records confirm Smith as linked to the Highway D address. Other records show addresses for him in St. Louis and in Rolla. Smith's middle name is variously listed in records as Steven and Serling. TIP POINTS TO SUSPECT A police source said a tip from one of Smith's relatives had pointed authorities to the suspect. Lincoln County Capt. Shayne Duryea said three sheriff's deputies went to the property after the tip was passed along from Louisiana police. They approached the man in his driveway. He had a handgun and they ordered him to put the gun down, Duryea said. He refused and shot himself in the head, Duryea said. Smith received a suspended execution of sentence earlier this year for tampering with a motor vehicle and receiving stolen property in Lincoln County. He also served three days in jail two weeks ago after a 2009 guilty plea for marijuana possession and unlawful use of drug paraphernalia, according to court records. Another person connected to the Highway D address, James B. Oellermann, also is listed on the state's sex offender registry. Oellermann, 54, was convicted of first-degree child molestation of a 7-year-old girl in Troy, Mo. He was sentenced in 2004 to five years in prison. Oellermann also has a prior conviction for possession of child pornography. Police have not said that Oellermann was involved in Alisa's abduction. Two people at the Fenton Car Wash, on Gravois Road just east of Missouri Highway 141, called police about 9:45 p.m. Tuesday to report having seen a little boy abandoned by a man who drove off in a dark-colored clunker. Officers soon learned that the child with a new short haircut was Alisa, the object of a wrenching day of searching and prayers in Louisiana. ‘HE'S MY HERO' Before officers closed in on Smith, police said they were looking for a dark-colored, mid-sized four-door sedan, with no wheel covers on the driver's side and a blown or missing muffler. The description of the car by callers in Fenton was similar to the one given by Alisa's brother Blake, 5, the only person to witness the abduction. \\"He's my hero,\\" Roy Harrison, their grandfather, told reporters who camped in front of the family home on North Carolina Street, barely a block from the Louisiana city hall and police station. \\"I'd do a back flip if I could, but I'm just too dadgum old. I had faith we'd get her home. I won't lie to you and tell you that I wasn't worried about the worst.\\" So were many residents of this river town of 3,900. Hundreds spent Tuesday searching back roads and handing out fliers. St. Louis County police chief Tim Fitch said county officer Sean Becker arrived first at the car wash and asked the child, \\"Are you a little boy or a little girl?\\" When she said she was a girl, Fitch said, Becker asked for her name. \\"Alisa,\\" the girl said. Fitch said Becker then radioed to verify the full name of the missing girl in the northern Missouri Amber Alert. When he asked for her last name, she gave it. Cardinal Glennon spokesman Bob Davidson said the family was exhausted but relieved. \\"They're tired because they've been through a lot, but they're also elated,\\" said hospital spokesman Bob Davidson. \\"Alisa was sitting on her mother's lap, and it looks like her mom will never let her go. Ultimately, it's the greatest of days because a little girl has been reunited with her family.\\" Davidson said David Maier asked him to thank the public for their prayers, concerns and volunteer work in the Louisiana area. ‘A GREAT THING' While the family stayed away from their home Wednesday, residents dropped by North Carolina Street all day, leaving flowers, a homemade sign welcoming her home, balloons and other gifts. \\"It was a great thing to wake up to,\\" flower-bearing Barbara Deacon said of the good news. Another woman left a pink stuffed-toy puppy bearing Alisa's name. At the Mercantile Bank downtown, the electronic sign board had flashed the Amber Alert of Alisa's disappearance all day Tuesday. On Wednesday, its scrolling letters said, \\"Welcome Home Alisa!!!\\" The Elks Lodge parking lot, which had been jammed Tuesday with volunteers' vehicles, was empty Wednesday. Jason Yoder, who works at a Shell station in town, said FBI agents came by to retrieve the station's surveillance video shortly after the investigation began. On Wednesday, he wondered whether all the canvassing and leafletting had put pressure on the kidnapper. \\"It was a really good thing she was found so quickly,\\" Yoder said. Similar sentiments were expressed Wednesday near the Fenton Car Wash, where police tape marked off the scene. But the idea that the case reached Fenton seemed disturbing to people who passed by. \\"It about gives me the chills,\\" said Bob Connelly, an onlooker. \\"It's a miracle just to find her alive.\\" Jesse Bogan, Tim O'Neil, Denise Hollinshed and Susan Weich of the Post-Dispatch contributed to this report. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Louisiana, Missouri police have identified 38-year-old Paul S.

Note to Self: Double-Check Those Electric Bills Are you one of those people who pay monthly electric and gas charges without closely looking at the bills? (You know who you are.) If so, you may want to start paying closer attention to the details of your power consumption and your costs. Or you could end up like Grace Edwards, a resident of Cheshire, Conn., who overpaid thousands of dollars on her electric bill for costs that she was not actually responsible for paying. (Two Connecticut newspapers reported her tale, which was brought to our attention by The Consumerist). How, you may wonder, could this happen? According to The Hartford Courant, Ms. Edwards and her late husband had bought their house in 1987 from a developer who, it seems, had been footing the bill for two streetlights in the subdivision. She didn’t realize she was continuing to pay for the lights until she tried to sell the home. A potential buyer asked for a history of its utility costs, which led to a close examination of past statements. It turned out that two mysterious line items on her bill — “9500 Lumen HP Sodium” and “6300 Lumen HP Sodium” — were for the electrcity powering the street lights. She contacted Connecticut Light and Power, which removed the streetlight items from her bill, but did not reimburse her for the past costs. She next sought help from the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority, to no avail. She ended up going to the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, which helped resolve the matter in her favor. The utility reimbursed her for the past costs, plus interest, for a total of 10,491.21 — and apologized. Joe Rosenthal, principal lawyer with the consumer counsel office, said that the office normally represents consumers as a group in rate disputes, rather than as individuals, but that “we were happy to help.” Ms. Edwards’s bills contained a line item for the lights. It wasn’t clear to her what the item represented, he said — although it should have been clear to the utility. (The Courant reported that Ms. Edwards had previously been told that the charges were for an air-conditioning system or even a whirlpool bath). Regardless, he said, “They paid her back. The outcome was a good one.” Ms. Edwards could not be reached for comment. But Bucks suspects she now agrees that it is a good idea for ratepayers to closely inspect their utility bills — and any other statements, for that matter — and demand an explanation of any strange charges before signing the monthly check. Have you ever caught an error in a utility bill? Were you able to have the problem resolved? What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a woman named Grace Edwards from Cheshire, Connecticut, who discovered she had overpaid thousands of dollars on her electric bills due to charges she was not responsible for. The issue began when she and her late husband had bought their house in 1987 from a developer who had been paying for two streetlights in the subdivision, a cost that was unknowingly passed on to her. The error was discovered when a potential buyer of her home requested a history of utility costs, leading to a close examination of past statements. Two mysterious line items related to the streetlights were found on her bill. Upon discovering the issue, Edwards contacted Connecticut Light and Power, which removed the streetlight charges from her bill but did not reimburse her for past costs. After seeking help from the state Public Utilities Regulatory Authority and the state’s Office of Consumer Counsel, she was eventually reimbursed for the past costs, plus interest, totaling 10,491.21, and the utility company apologized. The article highlights the importance of scrutinizing utility bills and other statements to identify and resolve any errors, as Edwards likely would not have discovered the issue if not for the potential buyer's request. It also shares how she pursued different avenues of assistance in order to have the matter resolved in her favor and encourages others to do the same if they encounter similar situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Napalm Death are a British extreme metal band formed in Meriden, West Midlands, England, in 1981. While none of its original members remain in the group since December 1986, the lineup of vocalist Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway, bassist Shane Embury, guitarist Mitch Harris and drummer Danny Herrera has remained consistent of the band's career since 1992's Utopia Banished, although, from 1989 to 2004, Napalm Death were a five-piece band after they added Jesse Pintado as the replacement of one-time guitarist Bill Steer; following Pintado's departure, the band reverted to a four-piece rather than replace him. Napalm Death are credited as pioneers of the grindcore genre by incorporating elements of crust punk and death metal, using a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdrive bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of incomprehensible growls, or high-pitched shrieks, extremely short songs, fast tempos, and sociopolitical lyrics. The band's debut album Scum, released in 1987 by Earache Records, proved substantially influential throughout the global metal community. With the departure of Broadrick and Bullen, the band had to look for new members. Guitarist Bill Steer played in a band based in Liverpool, called Carcass and given the affinity between the bands, he joined Napalm Death while still playing an active role in Carcass. The band asked a friend, Coventrian (Lee Dorrian), to join as vocalist due to his good relationship with the band (he had organised a number of concerts for the band), even though he had never been in a band before. This line-up recorded the B side of the Scum LP at Rich Bitch studios in May 1987, and the album was released through Earache Records. Bill Steer also came third place on Decibel Magazine's \\"Top 20 Death Metal guitarists of all time.\\" The band promptly lost another member just after they undertook a short tour after the release of Scum. Jim Whiteley left the group (and subsequently joined Weston-Super-Mare based band Ripcord with whom the aforementioned tour had been shared) and Shane Embury (former drummer of Unseen Terror) moved to bass. The band then appeared on two compilation records ('North Atlantic Noise Attack' and the 'Pathological Compilation'), recorded two Peel sessions and a split 7\\" with Japanese band S.O.B. They also returned to Rich Bitch studio once more and recorded their second album: From Enslavement to Obliteration. A follow-up release to \\"Enslavement...\\" came in the form of the six song 12\\" EP \\"Mentally Murdered\\", which was to be the last recording with the Harris/Steer/Dorian/Embury line-up. This EP was recorded at the Slaughterhouse Studios and took on a slightly different sound, blending grindcore with death metal. Following the release, Napalm Death were featured on national television in the United Kingdom in a heavy metal special by Arena (BBC 2). The band continued to tour, but as soon as they came back home from Japan, in July 1989, Steer and Dorrian left the band: Steer decided to dedicate himself full-time to Carcass, while Dorrian formed the doom metal group Cathedral. The group recruited Jesse Pintado (ex-Terrorizer) on guitar and Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway (ex-Benediction) as vocalist. This line-up took part in the Grindcrusher tour organised by Earache Records and featuring fellow label-mates Carcass, Bolt Thrower and Morbid Angel. The group recruited Mitch Harris (ex-Righteous Pigs) as second guitarist after the tour.

On 1 January 1948 Ferrier left for a four-week tour of North America, the first of three transatlantic trips she would make during the next three years. In New York she sang two performances of Das Lied von der Erde, with Bruno Walter and the New York Philharmonic. Alma Mahler, the composer's widow, was present at the first of these, on 15 January. In a letter written the following day, Ferrier told her sister: \\"Some of the critics are enthusiastic, others unimpressed\\". After the second performance, which was broadcast from coast to coast, Ferrier gave recitals in Ottawa and Chicago before returning to New York and embarking for home on 4 February.During 1948, amid many engagements, Ferrier performed Brahms's Alto Rhapsody at the Proms in August, and sang in Bach's Mass in B minor at that year's Edinburgh Festival. On 13 October she joined Barbirolli and the Hallé Orchestra in a broadcast performance of Mahler's song cycle Kindertotenlieder. She returned to the Netherlands in January 1949 for a series of recitals, then left Southampton on 18 February to begin her second American tour. This opened in New York with a concert performance of Orfeo ed Euridice that won uniform critical praise from the New York critics. On the tour which followed, her accompanist was Arpád Sándor (1896–1972), who was suffering from a depressive illness that badly affected his playing. Unaware of his problem, in letters home Ferrier berated \\"this abominable accompanist\\" who deserved \\"a kick in the pants\\". When she found out that he had been ill for months, she turned her fury on the tour's promoters: \\"What a blinking nerve to palm him on to me\\".

Question: I can use this background: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations in check. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. For their part, protozoa are important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Despite Anthony Field's expressed dislike of the term, preferring to refer to it as \\"preserving the good name of The Wiggles\\", the group has stressed the importance of their brand and were protective of it. They remained as independent as possible, and retained full creative control and ownership of every aspect of their business. As Field stated, The Wiggles Pty Ltd was \\"not your regular 'corporate culture'\\". They made decisions by consensus and made business decisions based upon their experience as performers and their knowledge of early childhood education. They made careful decisions regarding their endorsements of toys and other products, and avoided over-extending their brand by only licensing products that correlated with their image. They had high expectations regarding the behaviour and attitude of everyone associated with the group.The Wiggles became formally consolidated in 2005. The group's board of directors consisted of the original three members, Paul Field, who has been general manager of operations since the group was formed and their manager since the mid-1990s, and Mike Conway, who had worked for Ernst & Young in England and become their general manager in 2001. In 2009, the Australian rock band AC/DC knocked The Wiggles, who earned A45 million, from the top of Business Review Weekly's (BRW) list of top entertainment earners for the first time in four years.

Hypothesis: A dog having the best day ever. .Choose the correct answer: Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis? Pick from: -- yes -- it is not possible to tell -- no","completion":"It is not possible to tell. The premise describes a big tan dog running through a grass field with his tongue hanging out. This description outlines a series of observable behaviors in the dog —namely its running in a field and its tongue hanging out— which might typically be associated with dogs being energetic, engaging in physical activity, or possibly dealing with heat (as dogs pant to cool themselves). However, to arrive at the hypothesis that the dog is 'having the best day ever' would require us to know more than what is presented in the premise. This is because 'having the best day ever' is a highly subjective and anthropomorphic interpretation of the dog's state of being. It would require deeper insight into the dog’s feelings and emotions, which are intrinsically inaccessible without additional context, understanding of the dog's normal behavior, or ability to discern the animal's mood. For example, the dog may typically enjoy running in fields, or it may be running because it's being chased or is scared. Similarly, the dog's tongue hanging out could indicate happiness and enjoyment, but it might also be a response to excessive heat or fatigue. In other words, without more information, we can't confirm that these observable behaviors equate to the dog enjoying itself, let alone 'having the best day ever'. To conclude such would be to make an assumption based on incomplete information, veering away from logical deduction. Therefore, it's not possible to tell, based only on the given premise, whether we can conclude the given hypothesis."},{"prompt":"Information: - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions.

Read this and answer the question Animals are generally considered to have evolved from a flagellated eukaryote. Their closest known living relatives are the choanoflagellates, collared flagellates that have a morphology similar to the choanocytes of certain sponges. Molecular studies place animals in a supergroup called the opisthokonts, which also include the choanoflagellates, fungi and a few small parasitic protists. The name comes from the posterior location of the flagellum in motile cells, such as most animal spermatozoa, whereas other eukaryotes tend to have anterior flagella. The opisthokonts also include what other organisms?","completion":"The opisthokonts, as mentioned in the passage, include several categories of organisms: animals, choanoflagellates, fungi, and a few small parasitic protists. This supergroup is characterized by the shared feature of a single posterior flagellum, as seen in animal sperm cells and other motile cells. 1. Animals: This group is arguably the most recognized within the opisthokonts. It includes a wide range of organisms, from invertebrates like sponges and jellyfish, to more advanced creatures like reptiles, birds, and mammals. Animals are multicellular and heterotrophic, meaning they can't synthesize their own food and must consume other organisms for energy. 2. Choanoflagellates: These are unicellular or colonial eukaryotic cells that are considered the closest living relatives to animals. They have a distinctive 'collared' cell morphology similar to the choanocytes in some sponges. 3. Fungi: This is another diverse group within the opisthokonts, including the familiar mushrooms, yeasts, and molds. Fungi, like animals, are also heterotrophic. However, fungi are mainly saprophytic (they live on dead or decaying organic matter) or parasitic, while some form mutualistic associations, such as mycorrhizal fungi that form relationships with plant roots. 4. Parasitic Protists: These are small, often microscopic organisms, which are parasitic in nature. Parasitic protists are responsible for several major diseases in humans and other animals, such as malaria (caused by Plasmodium), sleeping sickness (caused by Trypanosoma), and giardiasis (caused by Giardia). The unifying feature of the opisthokont group is the positioning of the flagellum. In motile cells of these organisms, it is located at the posterior (back end), a difference that sets them apart from most other eukaryotic groups, which typically carry their flagella at the anterior (front end). This is where the group gets its name: 'opistho-' comes from the Greek for 'behind,' and 'kont,' means 'flagellum.'"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I've been to many a beer fests and a few hosted by Motley Brews. I had a great time at this festival. VIP tickets were 55 in advance and included admission to the private VIP area (complete with special brews and free food), early admission (get in at 2PM instead of 3PM), and admission to the entire event. It was definitely worth it and I would highly recommend doing VIP at beer fests if you have the funds to do so. First, the food in the VIP area was delicious and helped me maintain a certain level of sobriety throughout the afternoon. The portions were small enough to allow me to sample all the items (spicy sausage, mac and cheese, and yummy tacos with mango salsa) but big enough to keep me full. The area for the event at Sunset Park was much smaller than I had anticipated and looked much bigger on the map. For this reason, it was hard to tell where some of the lines began and ended. A tad annoying, but oh well. I love that they provided a detailed map so I could plan out my afternoon accordingly without having to scope out the area too much. I also appreciate that they had hydration stations set up with tons of water and the awesome mister fan thing was going. As most people lamented about, it was a really hot afternoon attributed to a really hot random week in April, but hey, Motley Brews can't control the weather so it's silly to ding them for that. Parking was a pain though. I don't remember any signage on the street pointing us in the right direction, and the parking staff seemed a tad clueless on how to organize and direct traffic. Also, the ladies restrooms ran out of toilet paper during the afternoon and the sinks (while I'm thankful they had sinks) also ran out of paper towel. I wished there had been a set of private bathrooms in the VIP area. It would've just been a nice added touch for the money. I know some people complained about the size of the tasting cup (about 4oz), but it's a tasting cup! The goal is sample beer, not get smashed (although I know many people had that goal going into the event). If you really wanted to appreciate beer and find new favorites, it was a decent sized cup to accomplish the task. Choose the sentiment of this review?

Idris Ali, 51, of Cardiff, and Alan Charlton, 56, from Somerset, have appealed against their convictions. Charlton was jailed for life in 1991 for murdering Karen Price while Ali was freed in 1994 after his conviction was quashed and he admitted manslaughter. The Court of Appeal heard on Tuesday he had no involvement in Karen's death. Karen disappeared from a children's home in 1981 and her body was found wrapped in a carpet in a property on Fitzhamon Embankment in 1989. Both men have had their cases referred to Court of Appeal by the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), which investigates potential miscarriages of justice. The appeals are based on claims evidence from the key trial witness, known only as D, could not be relied upon. Ali now says he only pleaded guilty to the lesser charge in order to get out of prison. His lawyers have argued a medical expert believed Ali's \\"significant intellectual impairment\\" made him more likely to make things up and he was a \\"habitual liar\\". William Hughes QC said: \\"He had been in prison for more than three-and-a-half years. \\"It was four days before Christmas and he had a good inkling that, if he were to plead guilty, he would be released there and then.\\" The court also heard Ali's \\"history of telling lies\\" meant his admission of guilt should be treated with the \\"utmost care\\". After Ali admitted manslaughter in December 1994, he was released from prison, having served three years and nine months behind bars. He pleaded guilty on the basis that evidence given by D was accurate; she said she was present when Charlton attacked Karen at his flat in Fitzhamon Embankment. The court heard Ali admitted holding Karen's hands while Charlton beat her, but he said he only did so because he was afraid of Charlton and did not intend for her to suffer serious harm. Charlton's lawyers claimed on Monday police officers involved in the investigation \\"put pressure\\" on key trial witnesses. The hearing continues.","completion":"Idris Ali and Alan Charlton, both previously convicted in relation to the murder of Karen Price in 1981, have appealed against their convictions, with Ali's defence arguing his intellectual impairment made him prone to false confessions and both men questioning the reliability of key trial witness evidence which suggested Ali had assisted Charlton in the assault; meanwhile, Charlton's defence claimed police had pressured key trial witnesses during their investigation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: Alan Bean, mission, Apollo 12. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"Alan Bean was an American astronaut, test pilot, and aeronautical engineer who played a significant role in the mission Apollo 12, the sixth manned flight in NASA's Apollo program. Born on March 15, 1932, in Wheeler, Texas, Bean graduated from the University of Texas with a degree in Aeronautical Engineering in 1955. He then joined the U.S. Navy, and upon completion of his training, served as a test pilot and flight instructor. Bean was selected as an astronaut by NASA in 1963, as part of Astronaut Group 3. Apollo 12 was the second manned mission that successfully landed on the moon, following the historic Apollo 11 mission. Launched on November 14, 1969, from Kennedy Space Center in Florida, Apollo 12's primary goal was to carry out extensive scientific experiments and exploration of the lunar surface. The mission was commanded by veteran astronaut Charles \\"Pete\\" Conrad, with Alan Bean serving as Lunar Module Pilot and Richard F. Gordon Jr. as Command Module Pilot. The Apollo 12 mission had three major components: the Command Module (CM) \\"Yankee Clipper,\\" the Lunar Module (LM) \\"Intrepid,\\" and the Lunar Roving Vehicle (LRV). The CM was a cone-shaped craft used to transport the astronauts between the Earth and lunar orbit. The LM was designed to transport two astronauts from the CM to the moon's surface and back. The LRV was a small electric vehicle that was used for the first time on the Apollo 15 mission; however, Apollo 12 astronauts used a handcart to transport their scientific instruments and lunar rock samples. Upon reaching the lunar orbit, Gordon remained in the CM, while Conrad and Bean descended to the lunar surface on the LM \\"Intrepid.\\" Apollo 12's landing site was the Ocean of Storms, near the Surveyor 3 spacecraft, which had landed on the moon in April 1967. The primary objectives of the mission were to retrieve the Surveyor 3 camera, collect rock samples, deploy scientific instruments, and conduct experiments. During their stay on the lunar surface, which lasted approximately 32 hours, Conrad and Bean carried out two extravehicular activities (EVAs) or moonwalks, with a total duration of nearly eight hours. They deployed the Apollo Lunar Surface Experiments Package (ALSEP), a set of scientific instruments, to measure seismic activity, lunar atmosphere, and solar wind. The astronauts collected over 75 pounds (34 kilograms) of lunar rock and soil samples, including parts of Surveyor 3, which provided valuable insights into the moon's geological history and the effects of long-term exposure to the lunar environment. Apollo 12's return journey to Earth began on November 20, 1969, with the LM's ascent stage lifting off from the moon's surface. The ascent stage docked with the waiting CM, where Conrad, Bean, and Gordon prepared for their voyage back to Earth. They splashed down in the Pacific Ocean on November 24, 1969, successfully concluding the mission. The Apollo 12 mission played a vital role in advancing our understanding of the moon and in paving the way for future manned lunar missions. Alan Bean's contribution as an astronaut and Lunar Module Pilot was critical to the success of the mission. Apart from his career as an astronaut, Alan Bean was also an accomplished artist, renowned for his paintings depicting human space exploration and the Apollo missions. Bean passed away on May 26, 2018, at the age of 86, leaving behind a legacy of exploration and inspiration that will continue to inspire future generations of astronauts and space enthusiasts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I am thrilled to share an incredible new discovery with you that can elevate our upcoming event, expand our culinary horizons and provide an unforgettable seafood adventure. Allow me to introduce Pompano, a versatile and delightful fish that we must absolutely consider incorporating into the menu. A little background on Pompano - it is a marine fish species predominantly found in the warm coastal waters of the Atlantic Ocean as well as the Gulf of Mexico. Often referred to as the \\"world's most edible fish\\" by renowned food critic Jason Epstein, Pompano has gained widespread attention from culinary enthusiasts and seafood lovers alike. Its distinct flavors and adaptability in numerous dishes make it a fantastic addition to any dining affair. The golden Pompano, in particular, is known for its tender, flaky, and mild-tasting meat that carries a hint of sweetness. Complimented by its firm texture, this fish holds remarkably well in various cooking methods including grilling, pan-searing, frying, and even baking. Its versatility does not end with the kitchen, as it can be combined with different seasoning combinations and styles ranging from European to Asian cuisines. Drawing inspiration from these diverse culinary possibilities, our chef has meticulously crafted a sample Pompano menu to provide a truly unique gastronomical experience. Here's a taste of what we can offer: 1. Grilled Pompano with Citrus-Herb Marinade - A perfectly grilled portion of Pompano drizzled with a citrus-infused herb mixture for a refreshing finish. 2. Pan-Seared Pompano with Brown Butter Sauce - Lightly coated with seasoned flour, seared to perfection and served with a decadent brown butter sauce for a rich and aromatic dining experience. 3. Pompano en Papillotte - A delicious medley of Pompano, julienned vegetables, white wine, and herbs wrapped delicately in parchment paper and steamed to perfection for a succulent dish that unfolds in every bite. 4. Pompano Sashimi - Thinly sliced raw Pompano served on a bed of ice with a side of soy sauce and wasabi, showcasing the freshness and natural flavors of this delicate fish. 5. Pompano Fish Tacos - Tender chunks of Pompano, lightly battered and fried, tucked into warm tortillas and garnished with tangy slaw and a zesty sauce for a delightful take on a classic. In addition to delivering a sumptuous seafood experience, I am pleased to inform you that Pompano is considered a sustainable and eco-friendly choice.

With the re-signing of Giguere to a four-year contract in the off-season and the acquisition of Jonas Hiller from Switzerland, the Ducks attempted to trade Bryzgalov, but were unable to. General Manager Brian Burke claimed he had a deal worked out at the 2007 NHL Entry Draft, but could not finish it. As a result, on 16 November 2007, Bryzgalov was placed on waivers and claimed by the Phoenix Coyotes the following day, on 17 November. In his first game with the team that same day, Bryzgalov made 27 saves for his third career shutout in a 1-0 win over the Los Angeles Kings. Phoenix promptly signed him to a three-year contract extension and he went on to record 26 wins in 55 games for the Coyotes as they battled for a playoff spot, establishing himself as the club's starting goaltender. Bryzgalov again recorded 26 wins for the Coyotes during the 2008-09 season, though the Coyotes did not qualify for the playoffs. But the 2009-10 season would be a different story for Bryzgalov and the Coyotes, who would qualify for the playoffs for the first time since 2002 on the back of Bryzgalov's 42 victories. The fourth-seeded Coyotes would face-off against the veteran Detroit Red Wings in the Western Conference Quarter-Finals. The series proved to be a see-saw battle that eventually saw Detroit prevail in seven games. Bryzgalov averaged 3.43 goals against per game during the series. Despite the uncertainty surrounding the Coyotes during the 2010-11 season, Bryzgalov's 36 wins helped them to the sixth seed in the Western Conference and a return trip to the playoffs. Once again, the Coyotes faced the Red Wings. Despite Bryzgalov's strong play throughout the regular season, he struggled in the playoff rematch with Detroit, averaging 4.36 goals against per game as the Red Wings swept the Coyotes in four straight games. Set to become an unrestricted free agent in the off-season, the Coyotes did not meet Bryzgalov's asking price for a contract extension. On 6 June 2011, Bryzgalov's negotiation rights were traded to the Philadelphia Flyers for a third-round pick in the 2012 NHL Entry Draft, forward Matt Clackson, and future considerations. Bryzgalov averaged 33 victories a season the past four seasons with the Coyotes.","completion":"This text is about Ilya Nikolayevich Bryzgalov, a Russian former professional ice hockey goaltender."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Information: - The Jurassic (from Jura Mountains) is a geologic period and system that spans 56.3 million years from the end of the Triassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Cretaceous Period Mya. The Jurassic constitutes the middle period of the Mesozoic Era, also known as the Age of Reptiles. The start of the period is marked by the major TriassicJurassic extinction event. Two other extinction events occurred during the period: the Pliensbachian/Toarcian event in the Early Jurassic, and the Tithonian event at the end; however, neither event ranks among the \\"Big Five\\" mass extinctions. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Andinichthyidae is a prehistoric family of catfishes from the Cretaceous of South America . - Catfish (or catfishes; order Siluriformes or Nematognathi) are a diverse group of ray-finned fish. Named for their prominent barbels, which resemble a cat's whiskers, catfish range in size and behavior from the three largest species, the Mekong giant catfish from Southeast Asia, the wels catfish of Eurasia and the Piraíba of South America, to detritivores (species that eat dead material on the bottom), and even to a tiny parasitic species commonly called the candiru, \\"Vandellia cirrhosa\\". There are armour-plated types and there are also naked types, neither having scales. Despite their name, not all catfish have prominent barbel. Members of the Siluriformes order are defined by features of the skull and swimbladder. Catfish are of considerable commercial importance; many of the larger species are farmed or fished for food. Many of the smaller species, particularly the genus \\"Corydoras\\", are important in the aquarium hobby. Many catfish are nocturnal, but others (many \\"Auchenipteridae\\") are \\"crepuscular\\" or \\"diurnal\\" (most \\"Loricariidae or\\" \\"Callichthyidae\\" for example). - Brazil, officially the Federative Republic of Brazil, is the largest country in both South America and Latin America. As the world's fifth-largest country by both area and population, it is the largest country to have Portuguese as an official language and the only one in the Americas. Bounded by the Atlantic Ocean on the east, Brazil has a coastline of . It borders all other South American countries except Ecuador and Chile and covers 47.3% of the continent's land area. Its Amazon River basin includes a vast tropical forest, home to diverse wildlife, a variety of ecological systems, and extensive natural resources spanning numerous protected habitats. This unique environmental heritage makes Brazil one of 17 megadiverse countries, and is the subject of significant global interest and debate regarding deforestation and environmental protection. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - Southern Cone is a geographic region composed of the southernmost areas of South America, south of and around the Tropic of Capricorn. Traditionally, it covers Argentina, Chile and Uruguay, bounded on the west by the Pacific Ocean, and south to the junction between the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans, which is the closest continental area of Antarctica (1000 km). In terms of social and political geography, the Southern Cone comprises Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Southern Brazil and sometimes Paraguay. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents. Ordered from largest in size to smallest, they are: Asia, Africa, North America, South America, Antarctica, Europe, and Australia. In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil).

Make this lower case.","completion":"The phrase \\"Turn regularly around in the pan\\" suggests that you're most likely referring to the process of evenly cooking food in a pan by consistently rotating or flipping it. This allows the food to cook uniformly and prevents any side from becoming overcooked or burnt, while also ensuring that it reaches the perfect texture, color, and crispiness. When cooking in a pan, turning regularly is essential for several reasons: 1. Uniform Cooking: As mentioned earlier, turning the food regularly ensures that each side has an equal opportunity to cook and reach the desired level of doneness. This is particularly important when cooking at high temperatures or with items that require quick cooking, like thin cuts of meat, fish, or vegetables. 2. Prevention of Overcooking: By turning the food regularly, you help to ensure that no one side stays in contact with the hot surface of the pan for too long, which can lead to overcooking or even burning. 3. Texture and Color: Depending on the type of food being cooked, turning it regularly can help to achieve a desirable texture, such as a crispy and golden-brown exterior on a piece of fried chicken. 4. Cooking Efficiency: For certain types of food, such as sautéed vegetables or a stir-fry, moving the items around in the pan helps to cook them more efficiently, as it evenly distributes the heat source and allows all of the ingredients to cook at a similar rate. Now, to address the second part of your question, \\"Make this lower case,\\" here is the given phrase converted to lower case letters: \\"turn regularly around in the pan\\" It appears that you've requested for the given phrase to be changed into lower case, which has been done above.

This date was adopted at the first convention of the IFB, held in Colombo on October 4, 1969.

Peguilly d'Herbemont was born on 25th June 1888 into an old French noble family of the same name. In her youth she led the conventional and protected existence, lack of great activity, of a girl from a \\"good family\\", an existence reminding of the life of the aristocracy before the French Revolution. She never visited a public school, but was educated by German and English governesses and nuns. Her movements were restricted and were mainly confined to the family positions in Paris and Belgium, but she spent most of her time at the castle of Charmois not far from Verdun. In the process of helping individual blind people across the road, Peguilly d'Herbemont was made aware by narrow scrapes which almost led to accidents, of the dangerous situation of the visually impaired brought about by the steadily increasing traffic on the roads. She first spoke about measures to protect the blind against street hazards to her mother in 1930, but she was of the opinion that it was unfit for a lady of good society to create a public outcry and advised her to stick to the transcription of books, a popular pastime of ladies of rank at the time. But the idea did not leave her. The urgent wish to encourage the integration of the blind into society by providing them with a means of moving about more freely without endangering others, and at the same time attracting the attention of passers-by ready to offer assistance, caused her to take the unusual step of writing to the editor of the Paris daily Echo de Paris in which she suggested issuing the blind of the Paris region with white sticks similar to...

Native women in Hong Kong used to be situated within the context of Chinese family and society, in which they were treated the same as Mainland women or Taiwanese women. Under the traditional Chinese patriarchy structure, the society was male-dominated, and women had a relatively subordinate familial role. However, there are cultural differences between Mainland Chinese citizens and citizens of Hong Kong. During the British colonial period the emergence of Western culture (i.e. \\"Westernization\\") created a mix of traditional Chinese culture and Western values. Women were in the workforce as early as the 1920s, but the small population of them often had to fight vigorously for equality of work rights. With the shift of Hong Kong's economy from manufacturing industry to services industry since the 1980s, there is a growing demand for white collar workers. Abundant job opportunities are hence available for both men and women. Employment in Hong Kong can be enjoyed by women, who possess rights, such as maternity protection and sick leave. Nevertheless, women in Hong Kong are aware of the difficulties they face in being a woman in the workforce. For example, when surveyed, both men and women working in Hong Kong stated that they preferred to have a male supervisor over a woman supervisor. In 2016, there are 49.3% females and 50.8% males in the employed population. In spite of the open-minded and relatively westernised culture in Hong Kong, the seemingly equal and fair workplace still poses obstacles on the way of women's career paths. 61.8% of females and 51.6% of males agreed that women have to sacrifice more than men for career success. Interestingly, 72.1% of females agreed that an increasing number of successful women is a positive social phenomenon, while only 59.6% of males shared the same view. The data showed that men, having the invisible privilege obtained from unequal gender perceptions, are content with the current situation and are slightly reluctant to the rising status of women, which might pose a threat to their career prospects. The Hong Kong media clearly reflects the social stereotypes and norms. Performers of authority roles are mostly men, with commentaries and voice overs mainly heard in male voices as well, whereas women are chiefly depicted in domestic roles and gender-specific professions, for example, secretaries and nurses. Despite the high education level and prospective vision women possess, it is uncommon to see women working on Hong Kong corporate boards and in senior management roles. Women account for only 11% of total director pool of Hong Kong's listed issuers and 33% of senior management roles, while the number of female participating in the labor force, which is 54% of the entire female population, lags behind many developed countries (67.6% in the US and 71% in the UK). The number of women in politics is also worryingly small. In the legislative council, there are only 12 female members among the 70 elected members. Comparing to 10 female members among the 60 elected members in 1998, women are clearly under-represented in the legislative stage of the city and such inadequacy will lead to prolonged suppression in women's rights and gender inequality. Ask a question about this article.","completion":"Okay kiddo, let's think about it like playing a game of soccer where boys and girls are playing together. Long time ago in Hong Kong, and many other places, boys were considered to be the main players, they were given all the important roles, while girls were more like cheerleaders. But then things began to change. Girls started to play soccer too, not just cheer. But, even though now girls can play the game, they still have to struggle more than boys to do so. It's like saying girls, even though they are allowed to play, still have to prove they can run as fast, or kick as strong. In the world of work, this means sometimes girls have to work harder than boys to show they're just as good. And remember how sometimes you prefer to have Uncle Bob as your team captain instead of Aunt Sue? Well, sadly many adults also say they prefer to work for a man rather than a woman. In the big grown-up world of work, some roles or jobs are like the important positions in a soccer game (like being the team captain or the star player). These are often taken by men, while women mostly get roles like playing as wingers or defenders. Women also don't get to be team captains (or big bosses) as often as men, even if they have the right skills or knowledge. Oh, and sadly in politics (which is like the rules committee for the big soccer game of life), there are not as many women as men too. This makes it harder for girls' voices to be heard and for rules to be changed to allow them to play the soccer game as fully as the boys. It's like when you have too many boys making the soccer rules and they decide to make rules that make it easier for boys to play and score goals. Without more girls on the rules committee, it could take a long time to get rules that are fair for everyone. Phew! Does that help, little one?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: One of the challenges that every community faces, particularly teams inside a larger community, is the ability to coordinate what goals and ambitions the team is going to work on. Traditionally this has always been somewhat ad-hoc: people join a team and work on whatever they feel like. Ideas are ten-a-penny though. For most teams that work on larger projects (such as events, software, products and more) to actually be productive, coordinating this work can be complex: some projects require coordination across many people with different skill-sets, time-availability and resources. Something I would like us to work towards in the Ubuntu community is encouraging a culture of best-practise in how we plan our work and coordinate our awesome teams to work together on projects. I believe this kind of coordination can help our teams increase the opportunity for success in their work, feel more empowered and productive and provide greater insight to people outside those teams on what the team is doing. An effective way of doing this is to build a Roadmap for each cycle. This provides an opportunity to capture a set of goals the team will work together to achieve in each six-month period. This article outlines how to build such a Roadmap. While at first a roadmap can feel a little like a nod to the gods of bureaucracy, they actually possess many benefits: * Direction – one of the biggest complaints teams often report is a lack of direction. If a team gets into the habit of creating a roadmap at the beginning of a cycle, it gives the team a sense of focus and direction for the coming cycle. * Documented commitments are more effective – a common rule in Project Management training is that actions assigned to people in a shared document are more effective than ad-hoc or private commitments. By documenting who will work on what in a cycle and putting their name next to an action can help seal a sense of accountability for their contributions to the project. * Feeling of success – regularly revisiting a roadmap and...

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize the following: If your child acts differently than they used to before the event, it may mean that something is wrong. Look for an increase in anxiety-related behaviors. It's common for children to start having difficulty with everyday life after experiencing a trauma. They may resist things like bedtime, attending school, or spending time with friends. Their performance in school might slip and they may experience behavioral regression. Take note of anything that's become a problem after a traumatic event. The child may feel lost without a person they trust, or a favorite object like a toy, blanket, or stuffed animal. A traumatized child may become extremely upset if this person or object is not with them, because they feel unsafe. Children who have experienced a trauma may develop separation anxiety from parents or caregivers and fear being apart from them. Some children withdraw and \\"disconnect\\" from family or friends instead, preferring to be alone. Children who have been traumatized may have difficulty falling or staying asleep, or resist bedtime. They may be afraid to sleep alone at night, with the light off or in their own room. They may have an increase in nightmares, night terrors, or bad dreams. The child may ask questions about if it will happen again, or ask about taking steps to prevent it (such as repeatedly asking people to drive safely after a car accident). Reassurance from adults is unlikely to soothe their fears. Some children may obsess over preventing the event in the future, such as constantly checking the smoke alarm after a house fire. This may turn into Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder. Children might replay the event repeatedly in their art or play, like drawing the event over and over again, or repeatedly crashing toy cars into things. Adults were not able to protect them in the past, so they might reason \\"who can?\\" and decide that nobody can keep them safe. They may not believe adults who try to assure them. If a child has been traumatized, they may have difficulty trusting others as a defense mechanism, as they're unable to view other people or places as safe. A child who was abused by an adult may start fearing other adults. For example, a girl who was hurt by a tall, blond man may be afraid of her tall, blond uncle because he looks similar to the man who hurt her. If a child experienced a traumatic event in a specific location, they may avoid or become fearful of the place in question. Some children may be able to tolerate it with help from a loved one or security object, but be unable to bear being left there alone. For example, a child abused by a therapist may scream and cry if they see the therapy building, and may panic if they even hear the word \\"therapy.\\" The child may blame themselves for the traumatic event because of something they did, said, or thought. These fears are not always rational; the child may blame themselves for a situation in which they did nothing wrong, and could not have made things any better. This may lead to obsessive-compulsive behavior. For example, maybe a boy and his sister were playing in the dirt when the traumatic event happened, and now he feels the need to keep everyone perfectly clean and away from dirt. A traumatized child may feel alienated, and may be uncertain how to interact normally with others, or not interested. Or, they may want to talk about or replay the traumatic event, which could annoy or upset other children. A child who has been traumatized may struggle with friendships and appropriate dynamics. They may become extremely passive towards their peers, or try to control or bully them. Other children withdraw, feeling unable to connect to their peers. Children who have been sexually abused may try to mimic the abuse in their play, so it's important to watch how a child plays with peers after trauma. Trauma can result in hypervigilance and the child may always be \\"on guard\\". A child may become afraid of wind, rain or sudden loud noises, or seem fearful or aggressive if someone gets too close to them. Children who have been traumatized tend to develop new fears, and may talk or worry about them extensively. It may seem like nothing can soothe the fear and reassure them that they're safe. For example, if the child experienced a natural disaster or is a refugee, the child may talk about worries that their family will not be safe, or will not have anywhere to live. A traumatized child may obsess over their family's safety and try to protect their family. A suicidal child may start talking a lot about death, give away items, withdraw from social activities, and talk about what you will do after they are dead. After a trauma, some children fixate on death and may talk or read about it excessively, even if they aren't necessarily suicidal. If there was a death in the family, talking about death isn't always a sign of suicidality. Sometimes, it's just a sign that they're trying to understand death and mortality. Still, if it is happening a lot, it may be worth investigating if something is wrong. If you think there may be problems, take your child to a psychologist or psychiatrist. Watch your child's eating habits, sleep, mood, and concentration. If any of these change dramatically or seem unusual, it's best to investigate it. Trauma can mimic other conditions. For example, some children become hyper, impulsive, and unable to concentrate after experiencing a trauma, which is frequently mistaken for ADHD. Others may seem defiant or aggressive, which can be misconstrued as simple behavioral problems. If something's wrong, get a professional involved. Summary:","completion":"Trauma in children can cause a range of changes in behavior, including increased anxiety, difficulty with everyday activities, regression, separation anxiety, and difficulties with trust and social interactions. They may develop new fears, obsess over prevention or family safety, and struggle with sleep. Trauma can mimic other conditions like ADHD or behavioral problems, making it essential to closely monitor changes in the child's habits, mood, and concentration. If you notice significant changes or suspect something is wrong, consult a psychologist or psychiatrist for professional help."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

About a month ago, after replacing the ink cartridges, I noticed that the black ink was streaking badly - so badly, that I can't use it to write cover letters or send out my resume. I followed instructions to clean the print head, with no improvement. On calling Brother, I was told the print head needs to be replaced. It turns out the print head costs 135 to 150, and nearly everyone with this printer has had the same problem!

In 1966, the level of social and artistic correspondence among British and American rock musicians dramatically accelerated for bands like the Beatles, the Beach Boys and the Byrds who fused elements of cultivated music with the vernacular traditions of rock. According to Everett, the Beatles' \\"experimental timbres, rhythms, tonal structures, and poetic texts\\" on their albums Rubber Soul and Revolver \\"encouraged a legion of young bands that were to create progressive rock in the early 1970s\\". Academics Paul Hegarty and Martin Halliwell identify the Beatles \\"not merely as precursors of prog but as essential developments of progressiveness in its early days\\". After the release of Rubber Soul, many \\"baroque-rock\\" works would soon appear, particularly due to its track \\"In My Life\\". Citing a quantitative study of tempos in music from the era, musicologist Walter Everett identifies Rubber Soul as a work that was \\"made more to be thought about than danced to\\", and an album that \\"began a far-reaching trend\\" in its slowing-down of the tempos typically used in pop and rock music. Although the Kinks, the Yardbirds and the Beatles themselves (with \\"Ticket To Ride\\") had incorporated droning guitars to mimic the qualities of the sitar, Rubber Soul's \\"Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)\\" is generally credited as sparking a musical craze for the sound of the instrument in the mid-1960s -- a trend which would later be associated with the growth of raga rock, Indian rock, and the essence of psychedelic rock. In terms of bridging the relationship between music and hallucinogens, the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the most pivotal. Revolver ensured that psychedelic pop emerged from its underground roots and into the mainstream. Author Carys Wyn Jones locates Sgt. Pepper's, along with Pet Sounds, to the beginning of art rock. Both albums are largely viewed as beginnings in the progressive rock genre due to their lyrical unity, extended structure, complexity, eclecticism, experimentalism and influences derived from classical music forms. For several years following Sgt. Pepper's release, straightforward rock and roll was supplanted by a growing interest in extended form. Several of the English psychedelic bands who followed in the wake of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's developed characteristics of the Beatles' music (specifically their classical influence) further than either the Beatles or contemporaneous West Coast psychedelic bands. AllMusic states that the first wave of art rock musicians were inspired by Sgt. Pepper's and believed that for rock music to grow artistically, they should incorporate elements of European and classical music to the genre. Answer this question \\"What is progressiveness?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Progressiveness is the idea of making rock music more artistic and thoughtful by incorporating elements of European and classical music, creating more complex and experimental sounds.

Does scene mean the same thing in these two sentences?","completion":"No, the word \\"scene\\" does not mean the same thing in these two sentences. In English, words can have multiple meanings depending on the context in which they are used. In this case, the word \\"scene\\" has different meanings in the two sentences. In Sentence 1, \\"He made a scene\\" refers to causing a commotion, drawing attention, or creating a public disturbance. In this context, \\"scene\\" generally implies an outburst or disruptive behavior. It could involve arguing loudly, making a fuss, or expressing strong emotions in a public setting. When someone makes a scene, their behavior is typically seen as inappropriate and embarrassing for the people around them. For example, if someone were to yell at a waiter in a crowded restaurant, they might be said to have \\"made a scene.\\" In Sentence 2, \\"The play is divided into three acts, and in total twenty-five scenes,\\" the meaning of \\"scene\\" is very different. In this context, a \\"scene\\" is a term used in theater and drama to describe a specific part of a play or performance. During a scene, the events of the story unfold, and the characters interact with one another. Scenes are typically bound by time, location, and character continuity. In other words, each scene takes place in a single setting and involves the same characters. A play is often divided into several acts, which are larger structures that help organize the narrative. Each act is further divided into multiple scenes to break the story down into smaller, more manageable units. The scenes in a play can vary in length, and they often represent different settings, events, or character dynamics. By putting together a series of scenes with various events, emotions, and actions, playwrights and directors engage the audience and tell a compelling story. In summary, although the word \\"scene\\" appears in both sentences, the meanings are vastly different. In Sentence 1, \\"scene\\" denotes disruptive behavior or a public outburst, whereas, in Sentence 2, \\"scene\\" refers to a specific segment within a play that helps to craft the overall plot and narrative. These varied meanings are shaped by the context in which the word \\"scene\\" is used."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] and the situation: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea.

What sport does Dave Silk and Miracle on Ice have in common? Answer:","completion":"Dave Silk and Miracle on Ice have ice hockey in common. Here's a detailed explanation of why this is the case. Dave Silk is a former American ice hockey player who was born on January 1, 1958, in Scituate, Massachusetts. He is best known for his role on the United States ice hockey team that competed in the 1980 Winter Olympics, held in Lake Placid, New York. Silk played as a forward and was an important contributor to the team's success throughout the tournament. The Miracle on Ice is a term that refers to a specific game during the 1980 Winter Olympics between the United States and the heavily favored Soviet Union ice hockey teams. The game took place on February 22, 1980, and has since been considered one of the most memorable and significant moments in the history of American sports. It was an intense match, but ultimately, the underdog United States team managed to defeat the Soviet Union with a score of 4-3. This victory was groundbreaking for various reasons, such as the ongoing political tension between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. Furthermore, the Soviet Union had dominated international ice hockey competitions since the 1960s, winning gold at nearly every Winter Olympics and World Championship event. The American team's win, which was made up primarily of amateur and collegiate players, was a major upset that no one had anticipated. The Miracle on Ice game was a turning point, demonstrating that the gap between the US and the Soviet Union wasn't as vast as previously thought. Buoyed by their win, the United States team went on to defeat Finland in the final game of the Olympic tournament, securing the gold medal. Dave Silk was an integral part of the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team that achieved this miraculous victory. He appeared in all seven games during the tournament and scored two goals, contributing to the team's overall success. After the Olympic victory, Silk continued his professional ice hockey career, which included playing in the National Hockey League (NHL) for the Boston Bruins, Winnipeg Jets, Detroit Red Wings, and the New York Rangers. In conclusion, both Dave Silk and Miracle on Ice are inherently connected through their involvement in the sport of ice hockey. Dave Silk was a key player on the 1980 US Olympic ice hockey team that accomplished the stunning victory against the Soviet Union, known today as the Miracle on Ice. This shared connection illustrates how the world of sports can create memorable and historic moments that capture the imagination of fans and athletes alike."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The problem looks like this: -5 * i + 148 - 128 = 0 First, let's look at these numbers 148 and 128. When you subtract 128 from 148, you get: 148 - 128 = 20 Now, our problem looks simpler: -5 * i + 20 = 0 We want to get i all by itself, so let's move the number 20 to the other side of the equal sign. We do this by subtracting 20 from both sides of the equation: -5 * i = -20 Now, we want to find out how many times -5 fits in -20. To figure this out, we divide both sides of the equation by -5: i = -20 / -5 Now, let's work on this division. When you divide a negative number by another negative number, you get a positive number. So, i = 20 / 5 Finally, when you divide 20 by 5, you get the number 4: i = 4 So there you have it! The solution to the math problem is i = 4.

Plot title: Sin Nombre Movie plot: Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping.... My question: Who is being initiated into the gang?

Reggaetoneros El Father, Daddy Yankee, Don Omar destapan su fe cristiana Wednesday, February 11th 2009, 11:30 AM El reggaetonero HÃ©ctor El Father. \\"Lo tenÃ­a todo pero en realidad no tenÃ­a nada, porque ni la fama ni el dinero podÃ­an llenar el vacÃ­o que sentÃ­a en mi corazÃ³n. Ahora siento una felicidad que no puedo ni explicar\\", confiesa el reggaetonero HÃ©ctor El Father. Su verdadero nombre es HÃ©ctor Delgado, y desde hace cinco meses es miembro de la iglesia cristiana Pentecostal Misionera en Puerto Rico. El nuevo cristiano reconoce que su vida personal y artÃ­stica ha cambiado totalmente, al punto que se reconciliÃ³ con Jennifer Ca-rrasquillo, madre de su hijo HÃ©ctor Joel, y ahora su esposa legal. En cuanto a la parte artÃ­stica, lanzÃ³ su primer disco cristiano, \\"El juicio final\\". \\"En este disco se pueden encontrar canciones para entender que Cristo es el camino. Ahora tengo una vida eterna que no tiene comparaciÃ³n, vivo para dar un mensaje que Dios aportÃ³ en mi corazÃ³n para esta humanidad\\". Con mÃ¡s reserva y tal vez mÃ¡s aÃ±os de tradiciÃ³n, en casa de RamÃ³n Ayala, conocido como Daddy Yankee, se practica el cristianismo, y uno de sus hermanos, Melvin Ayala, es pastor cristiano. \\"En mi caso no es que quiera seguir a mi hermano, pero sÃ­ quiero seguir al SeÃ±or, que es lo importante. A mi hermano lo respeto y lo amo, pero cuando uno va a la iglesia uno tiene que seguir al SeÃ±or\\", dice. Aunque no tiene planes de incluir mÃºsica religiosa en sus discos, reconoce que su fe surgiÃ³ en momentos difÃ­ciles en su vida, cuando a los 17 aÃ±os fue herido por una bala en su pierna derecha y quedÃ³ cojo de por vida, aunque aprendiÃ³ a disimular a la perfecciÃ³n este problema. \\"Gracias a Dios, a pesar de que tengo esta limitaciÃ³n fÃ­sica, no dejo que eso me domine ni pienso que me vaya a ser mÃ¡s dÃ©bil\\", declara. Omar LandrÃ³n o Don Omar, radicado en Nueva Jersey y casado con la presentadora del tiempo de \\"Primer Impacto\\", Jackie Gue-rrido, afianza cada vez mÃ¡s su creencia en el cristianismo, que profesa su esposa desde hace varios aÃ±os. \\"Ella es la persona que me da la palabra que me apacigua, y que me habla de Dios. Es la persona con la que puedo hablar de las cosas bonitas que hace Dios todos los dÃ­as\\", dice. Mientras tanto, uno de los pioneros del rap en espaÃ±ol, Luis Armando Lozada, conocido como Vico C y considerado el filÃ³sofo de este gÃ©nero musical. Vico C vive desde hace mÃ¡s de dos dÃ©cadas bajo la normas cristianas con su esposa Sonia Torres y sus cinco hijos en Orlando, Florida, y es autor de \\"La recta final\\", un tema rap cristiano popular. \\"Hace mÃ¡s de 20 aÃ±os asistÃ­ a una iglesia cristiana por invitaciÃ³n de un amigo, y a partir de ese dÃ­a las letras de mis nuevas canciones tienen un mensaje de fe. Siempre he sido un hombre de fe y aÃºn en los momentos mÃ¡s difÃ­ciles siempre volvÃ­ al camino de Dios\\", expresa. Por supuesto, existen intÃ©rpretes del gÃ©nero urbano que rechazan las tendencias cristianas en esta mÃºsica, como el caso de Calle 13, que en el estribillo del tema \\"Fiesta de locos\\" incluido en su Ãºltimo Ã¡lbum \\"Los de atrÃ¡s vienen conmigo\\", dicen: \\"Yo sÃ© que mi mÃºsica es profana, pero cuando deje de vender, harÃ© mÃºsica cristiana\\". A crÃ­ticas como Ã©sta, HÃ©ctor Delgado responde: \\"No los puedo juzgar porque yo salÃ­ de ahÃ­ y asÃ­ como Dios tuvo misericordia conmigo, yo sÃ© que va a tener misericordia con ellos. Estamos orando para que sepan que hay muchas alternativas, pero que Cristo es la soluciÃ³n y la verdadera felicidad\\".

The reviewer also mentions that there were many other episodes, some of which the reviewer deems better. Lastly, the reviewer suggests that these episodes should be released on disc and sold. Step 3: Assess the presented opinions - The reviewer shows appreciation for the original VHS tapes and the series but believes that some episodes were better than the one currently on disc.

(Associated Press) FILE - In this Sept. 26, 2013 file photo, Joseph Hunter, center, a former U.S. Army sniper who became a private mercenary, is in the custody of Thai police commandos after being arrested in Bangkok, Thailand. Hunter, already serving a 20 year term for plotting to kill a DEA agent, goes on trial in New... (Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — A former U.S. Army sniper and two other ex-American soldiers agreed to become contract killers for an international crime boss who wanted to settle a score with a real estate agent in the Philippines he thought had cheated him on a land deal, a prosecutor said Tuesday in opening statements at the trial of the three men. Joseph Hunter, a onetime sergeant with a Special Forces background, Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell have denied they planned the 2012 execution-style hit — a case that's provided an inside glimpse into the secret fraternity of private mercenaries willing to kill in cold blood for cash. Prosecutors said the 52-year-old Hunter was working as a security chief for weapons and drug trafficker Paul Le Roux when he recruited Samia and Stillwell to travel from their homes in Roxboro, North Carolina, to the Philippines for what was called \\"ninja work.\\" Hunter provided firearms and silencers and told them Le Roux would pay them 35,000 a piece to get the job done, Assistant U.S. Attorney Patrick Egan said in federal court in Manhattan. The broker, Catherine Lee, was on a \\"kill list\\" that self-styled assassins with military backgrounds saw as a golden opportunity, Egan said. \\"If Paul Le Roux wanted somebody killed, these guys got the call,\\" he said. \\"For these men, more murders meant more money.\\" Samia, 43, and Stillwell, 50, did surveillance on Lee before contacting her pretending to be potential clients, the prosecutor said. While returning from a trip to the countryside outside of Manila, Samia pulled out a .22-caliber gun and killed Lee by shooting her twice in the face as she sat in the back seat of a van, he said. Lee's body was found on a pile of garbage on the side of the road, Egan said. After being paid, her killers were ordered back to the United States, where they were arrested in 2015. An investigation turned up a picture on Stillwell's phone of a bloody head wrapped in a towel that was taken around the time of Lee's death, authorities said. He also admitted being behind the wheel of the van when she was shot, they added. Prosecutors said other evidence includes a secretly recorded video of Hunter from a sting in Thailand that resulted in a separate conviction for plotting to kill a Drug Enforcement Administration agent. They said he's overheard talking about killing people for Le Roux, including a Filipino real-estate agent. On Tuesday, defense attorneys asked jurors to keep an open mind, saying the case lacked eyewitness, forensic and other conclusive evidence needed to convict. They also told them not to trust shady government witnesses like Le Roux, who has pleaded guilty and is cooperating. Hunter's attorney, Cesar De Castro, suggested the government couldn't prove its case. Samia only agreed \\"to do legitimate, legal security work,\\" said his lawyer, Jeremy Schneider. Stillman's lawyer, Robert Ray, didn't deny his client's statements about being in the van but claimed he never joined a murder conspiracy. \\"It just didn't happen,\\" Ray said. ||||| The other two defendants, Adam Samia, a former Army sniper, and Carl D. Stillwell, a onetime weapons trainer, are accused of carrying out the murder on Mr. Hunter’s orders. All three have pleaded not guilty and deny the charges. The trial began on Monday with jury selection. Mr. Le Roux oversaw smuggling rings on four continents, prosecutors say, and is expected to emerge from the shadows for the first time to testify against his former henchmen. For more than 20 years, Mr. Le Roux was an enterprising kingpin with illicit businesses that included running weapons in the Philippines, smuggling opioids from Mexico to Texas and cultivating hallucinogenic plants at a secret compound in Somalia, authorities said. All of that ended in late 2012 when Mr. Le Roux, now in his 40s, was arrested in Liberia by the Drug Enforcement Administration and began to cooperate with the American authorities. In one of his first clandestine jobs, he helped the government arrange a sting operation in Phuket, Thailand, in 2013 that led to the arrests of Mr. Hunter and a group of other men, who were charged with planning to assassinate a D.E.A. agent and one of his informants. Photo Mr. Hunter pleaded guilty to those charges and was ultimately sentenced to 20 years in prison. But in October, federal prosecutors in New York unsealed a new indictment charging him with a different crime: orchestrating the plot to kill Ms. Lee, a real-estate agent, on Mr. Le Roux’s behalf. Because the case in Thailand included allegations that Mr. Hunter and his partners had conspired to ship cocaine into New York, it was prosecuted by the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan. Manhattan prosecutors are handling the current case as well, saying it emerged from the same investigation. On the witness stand, Mr. Le Roux is expected to explain how in 2008 two of his employees, David Smith and John O’Donoghue, set up a company called Echelon Associates, which hired former soldiers to provide security on his gold-buying trips to Africa and to oversee his illegal shipments of military weapons, according to court papers.

He is also likely to recount how Mr. Smith was murdered in 2010 (after he was caught stealing gold) and how Mr. Hunter — promoted to replace him — went on to hire Mr. Samia and Mr. Stillwell in the plot to kill Ms. Lee, according to court papers.

In those recordings, Mr. Hunter can be heard telling the men he recruited in the plot against the D.E.A. agent that he had killed other people for Mr. Le Roux in the past — among them, a Filipino real-estate agent. Mr. Hunter’s lawyer, Cesar de Castro, tried unsuccessfully to have the recordings thrown out, arguing they were obtained illegally and were not proof of a crime. While the government has never detailed a specific motive for Ms. Lee’s murder, it has provided evidence that Mr. Hunter helped get Mr. Samia, 43, and Mr. Stillwell, 50, firearms and silencers, and later paid them 35,000 each for what court papers say he called an act of “ninja work.” Prosecutors say the two men sent the payments back to their loved ones in North Carolina in illegal “structured transfers” intended to evade detection. They have also said that Mr. Stillwell kept a photo on his cellphone of “a wounded human head” taken around the time Ms. Lee was killed. When Mr. Samia was arrested in North Carolina in 2013, he told two agents from the D.E.A. that he had worked with Mr. Hunter in Africa, mostly providing protection to a business owner who bought gold on the continent and shipped it to Hong Kong and Dubai, court papers say. Mr. Samia acknowledged that he had also traveled to the Philippines on Mr. Hunter’s orders, but only, he said, to perform “security work and advance work,” according to the court papers. In his own interview with the D.E.A., however, Mr. Stillwell admitted that he and Mr. Samia had met Ms. Lee in the Philippines under the guise of asking her to take them on a tour of real-estate properties in the countryside. He said he was driving the van when Mr. Samia abruptly shot the woman in the face. According to court papers, Mr. Samia later disposed of her body, leaving it lying on a pile of garbage, Mr. Stillwell told the agents. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A former U.S. Army sniper, Joseph Hunter, and two other ex-American soldiers are on trial accused of becoming contract killers for international crime boss Paul Le Roux, who allegedly sought to settle a score with a real estate agent in the Philippines he thought had cheated him on a land deal. Hunter, who is already serving a 20-year prison sentence for plotting to kill a DEA agent, is alleged to have provided the firearms and silencers to Adam Samia and Carl David Stillwell, who executed the 2012 hit on Catherine Lee.

Plot title: Noriko's Dinner Table Movie plot: The film is divided into 5 chapters, the first four of which are named after characters in the film: Noriko, Yuka, Kumiko and Tetsuzo, in that order. The plot is told non-linearly and shifts between the perspectives of Noriko, Yuka and Tetsuzo. A shy and demure 17-year-old teenage girl named Noriko Shimabara (Kazue Fukiishi) lives with her quiet family, formed by her sister Yuka (Yuriko Yoshitaka), her mother Taeko (Sanae Miyata), and her father Tetsuzo (Ken Mitsuishi), in Toyokawa, Japan. Noriko finds her small-town life unsatisfying and craves to move to Tokyo, assuming she would live a more active life there. This sentiment is especially encouraged when she finds that her elementary school friend Tangerine (Yoko Mitsuya) is now working independently as an idol. Noriko's father is strictly against her going to the city, and plans on having her join a local university after school. Feeling alienated and misunderstood by her parents, Noriko resorts to the internet where she finds Haikyo.com, a website where other teenagers from Japan gather. There, after making new and unknown friends, she feels truly at \\"home\\" and eventually, on December 10, 2001, runs away from her unhappy life to Tokyo, where she plans on meeting the website's leader, a mysterious girl who uses the screen name \\"Ueno Station 54\\". Once in Tokyo, Noriko logs onto the website and contacts Ueno54. They meet up at Locker #54 in Ueno Train Station, where it is revealed that she is a young woman named Kumiko. She introduces Noriko to her family and takes Noriko to visit her grandparents. As it turns out, however, Kumiko has no real family, and the people she introduced Noriko to are paid actors working for Kumiko's organisation, I.C. Corp. The organisation offers paid roleplay services to interested clients, allowing them to fulfil their fantasies of a happy family life.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose \\"the rocks are where the oceans tides get water on them\\" happens, how will it affect less cracks form in the rocks. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation has an indirect effect on the process. If the rocks are located where ocean tides get water on them, it will create a different environment for the process of rock breakdown to occur. The constant wetting and drying of rocks due to tidal action may facilitate the process of rock breakdown. In this case, the continuous exposure to water from ocean tides provides an ample source of water to seep into the rocks. This may lead to more instances of water freezing and thawing, which can result in the formation of cracks in the rocks. Additionally, the wetting and drying cycle from the tidal action may also contribute to the expansion and contraction of rocks, leading to further cracking. However, the presence of the ocean water might also provide a buffering effect for temperature fluctuations, potentially leading to fewer cracks forming due to heating and cooling. The water may absorb or distribute the heat more evenly on the rocks, preventing the extreme temperature changes that can cause cracks to form. Overall, the supposed perturbation of having rocks located in areas where ocean tides regularly expose them to water might lead to more opportunities for the water to freeze and thaw, accelerating the rock breakdown process. However, the tidal action could possibly reduce the temperature-related cracking, slightly lessening the overall cracking in the rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Then, at the age of twenty, he became sick. He was so young, but the doctors said to his family, \\"He has only two more years to live.\\" As a matter of fact, the doctors were wrong---- he didn't die.

Patricia enjoyed cleaning small pieces.","completion":"Mary had an easier time cleaning LEGOs than Patricia because Mary enjoyed cleaning small pieces. In this sentence, the reason for Mary's ease in cleaning LEGOs compared to Patricia is due to her enjoyment in handling these small pieces. Her fondness for such a task might stem from her inclination towards careful and detailed work, meticulous organization, or simply the satisfaction derived from completing the task efficiently. Engaging in activities that one enjoys often makes the task seem less burdensome and makes one more focused, which leads to better performance. On the other hand, Patricia's exact feelings towards cleaning small pieces were not mentioned in the sentence. However, we can assume that she did not share the same level of enjoyment for it as Mary did, given the comparison drawn between the two. When people engage in tasks they do not enjoy, they tend to find those activities more challenging or tedious. This might be the case for Patricia, who may have found the cleaning of the small LEGO pieces tiresome or uninteresting. Her lack of enthusiasm could have negatively impacted her efficiency in the task, making it harder for her to clean the LEGOs compared to Mary. In conclusion, Mary had an easier time cleaning LEGOs than Patricia because she enjoyed handling and cleaning small pieces. This enjoyment likely led to increased focus, efficiency, and satisfaction with the task, whereas Patricia, who did not necessarily share this same enjoyment, found the chore comparatively more difficult."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century? from the following article ? Pierre Benjamin Monteux (pronounced [pjɛʁ mɔ̃.tø]; 4 April 1875 – 1 July 1964) was a French (later American) conductor. After violin and viola studies, and a decade as an orchestral player and occasional conductor, he began to receive regular conducting engagements in 1907. He came to prominence when, for Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes company between 1911 and 1914, he conducted the world premieres of Stravinsky's The Rite of Spring and other prominent works including Petrushka, Ravel's Daphnis et Chloé, and Debussy's Jeux. Thereafter he directed orchestras around the world for more than half a century. From 1917 to 1919 Monteux was the principal conductor of the French repertoire at the Metropolitan Opera in New York. He led the Boston Symphony Orchestra (1919–24), Amsterdam Concertgebouw Orchestra (1924–34), Orchestre Symphonique de Paris (1929–38) and San Francisco Symphony (1936–52). In 1961, aged eighty-six, he accepted the chief conductorship of the London Symphony Orchestra, a post which he held until his death three years later. Although known for his performances of the French repertoire, his chief love was the music of German composers, above all Brahms. He disliked recording, finding it incompatible with spontaneity, but he nevertheless made a substantial number of records. Monteux was well known as a teacher. In 1932 he began a conducting class in Paris, which he developed into a summer school that was later moved to his summer home in Les Baux in the south of France. After moving permanently to the US in 1942, and taking American citizenship, he founded a school for conductors and orchestral musicians in Hancock, Maine. Among his students in France and America who went on to international fame were Lorin Maazel, Igor Markevitch, Neville Marriner, Seiji Ozawa, André Previn and David Zinman.

She has a remarkable talent which may prove the survival of the human spirit after death, for Coral is a medium who draws the portraits of spirits who contact her. Coral, whose parents were spiritualists, was brought up in Harrow, North London, where she attended a local spiritualist church. She studied art at the local college, where she specialized in textile design. Even though, at the time, she wasn't very good at drawing portraits, she met a medium who told her she would be a psychic artist. She doesn't actually see the dead nor are her hands controlled by the spirits; instead she 'feels' them coming through. Early in her career she drew the portraits of 'spirit guides' from whom she had received help. These portraits of guides, who included Red Indians, nuns and monks, were remarkable, yet could have been attributed to the working of a strong imagination. She also drew portraits by holding on to letters that had been written by people who had since died. Coral says, 'I know exactly what to draw without thinking about it. It's involuntary, like breathing or walking.' Not only are her portraits a good likeness but she sketches her subjects in clothes they would have worn in life. Coral has displayed her talent at public meetings around the world. At one gathering there was a woman whose grandfather had just died. Her name was Phyllis Timms. Coral made a sketch of a man who had a long moustache and Phyllis recognized the man as her grandfather. However, she was reluctant to acknowledge the portrait without extra proof. Coral then said that the colour green was a link with the man whom she had drawn. Mrs Timms, whose maiden name had been Green, understood the significance of the comment and claimed the portrait. There are some people for whom this is evidence of survival from beyond the grave. Others, who have their reservations, may put it down to an extraordinary kind of extrasensory perception . Whatever... Question: According to the passage, Coral can draw the spirits most probably because _ . - she could see the spirits. - she learned it from college. - she had a strong imagination. - she was gifted to feel the spirits.","completion":"According to the passage, Coral can draw the spirits most probably because she was gifted to feel the spirits."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs .","completion":"The sentiment of the given movie review sentence, \\"topics that could make a sailor blush - but lots of laughs,\\" can be interpreted as mixed or generally positive. To begin with, the phrase \\"topics that could make a sailor blush\\" conveys a slightly negative aspect, suggesting that the movie deals with topics that are typically considered crude, inappropriate, or risqué. The idiom \\"make a sailor blush\\" alludes to the historical stereotype of sailors being prone to using coarse language and engaging in vulgar conversations. In this context, the movie likely tackles themes or issues that might shock or offend certain audiences due to their explicit nature or controversial subject matter. On the other hand, the second part of the sentence, \\"but lots of laughs,\\" takes a more positive perspective, highlighting the movie's comedic appeal. This phrase implies that despite the potentially offensive content, the film manages to garner significant laughs and embrace its comedic elements. As a result, the movie succeeds in providing entertainment for its viewers and counterbalances the possible discomfort some may experience due to its controversial topics. Taking both aspects into consideration, the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards the positive side because the review acknowledges the movie's ability to generate laughter and entertainment, even with the inclusion of risqué or offensive material. The sentence could be interpreted as a cautious recommendation, suggesting that while the content may not be suitable for everyone, those who can appreciate or overlook the crude aspects will find enjoyment in the humor it offers."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: An alien passing by Earth in a UFO to write a report on two random cities so that his government can better understand what the people of Earth are like. He first flies over Nillmar, a city in France, which uses burns coal as its main production of electricity. After observing Nillmar, the alien flies over to Springfield, a city in the United States, that decided to use nuclear power to fuel itself. After taking his notes, the alien leaves and is eager to report back to his superiors about what he discovered. Answer this question please: Which city will need to change its method of electricity production later? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given information, Springfield, the city that uses nuclear power as its main source of energy, would need to change its method of electricity production later. The reason for this is because even though nuclear fission uses radioactive elements which are limited and might run out sooner than fossil fuels, on a comparative scale, coal, as the major energy source for Nillmar, would likely run out sooner due to its wider usage for electricity production globally. Furthermore, the environmental impact of nuclear power is lesser as it does not release air pollution or cause acid rain and global warming unlike burning of fossil fuels."},{"prompt":"Q: What is the growing root tip protected by?

Which all leads me up to the last few days . What is a big reason for the narrator 's love of Auburn ?","completion":"The narrator's love for Auburn can be attributed to various factors that greatly affected their experience in the town. One significant reason is the unexpected discovery of a vibrant Cuban community within Auburn. Initially, the narrator arrived in Auburn with zero expectations, assuming that there might not be much in terms of cultural presence or connections to their Cuban roots. To their delight, they discovered both a flourishing Cuban population and their supportive environment. This Cuban community in Auburn comprises an authentic Cuban restaurant that the narrator appreciates. The presence of such a restaurant serves as an essential aspect of their connection to their culture, as food plays a critical role in defining and preserving one's cultural identity. Being able to indulge in authentic Cuban cuisine helps the narrator feel closer to their roots and adds to their fondness for Auburn. Furthermore, the narrator emphasizes that there is a significant number of native Auburnians who display genuine interest and sympathy towards Cubans and Cuban-American affairs. This open-heartedness and cultural acceptance offers the narrator a sense of inclusiveness, warmth, and belonging. It demonstrates that the people of Auburn are not just indifferent to the presence of the Cuban community but actively interested in learning about their culture and providing support where needed. In conclusion, it is evident that the narrator's love for Auburn primarily stems from the unexpected discovery of a thriving Cuban community in the town, manifested in the form of an authentic Cuban restaurant. Additionally, the welcoming and interested nature of native Auburnians towards Cubans and Cuban-American affairs fosters an environment of acceptance and inclusivity, further increasing the narrator's admiration and affection for Auburn. This combination of cultural familiarity, connections to their roots, and warm community relations greatly contribute to the narrator's love for the town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Paul Reubens (ne Rubenfeld; born August 27, 1952) is an American actor, writer, film producer, game show host, and comedian, best known for his character Pee-wee Herman. Reubens joined the Los Angeles troupe The Groundlings in the 1970s and started his career as an improvisational comedian and stage actor. In 1982, Reubens put up a show about a character he had been developing for years. Context: Reubens auditioned for Saturday Night Live for the 1980-1981 season, but Gilbert Gottfried, who was a close friend of the show's producer and had the same acting style as Reubens, got the place (ironically, Gottfried would later get in trouble for joking about Reubens' indecent exposure arrest as an award presenter at the Emmys). Reubens was so angry and bitter that he decided he would borrow money and start his own show in Los Angeles using the character he had been developing during the last few years, \\"Pee-wee Herman\\". With the help of other Groundlings like John Paragon, Phil Hartman and Lynne Marie Stewart, Pee-wee acquired a small group of followers and Reubens took his show to The Roxy Theatre where \\"The Pee-wee Herman Show\\" ran for five sellout months, doing midnight shows for adults and weekly matinees for children, moving into the mainstream when HBO aired The Pee-wee Herman Show in 1981 as part of their series On Location. Reubens also appeared as Pee-wee in the 1980 film Cheech & Chong's Next Movie. Although it was Reubens in the role of Pee-Wee, the end credits of the movie billed him as Hamburger Dude. Reubens' act had mainly positive reactions and quickly acquired a group of fans, despite being described as \\"bizarre\\", and Reubens being described as \\"the weirdest comedian around\\". Pee-wee was both \\"corny\\" and \\"hip\\", \\"retrograde\\" and \\"avant-garde\\". When Pee-wee's fame started growing, Reubens started to move away from the spotlight, keeping his name under wraps and making all his public appearance and interviews in character while billing Pee-wee as playing himself; Reubens was trying to \\"get the public to think that that was a real person\\". Later on he would even prefer his parents be known only as Honey Herman and Herman Herman. In the early and mid-1980s, Reubens made several guest appearances on Late Night with David Letterman as Pee-wee Herman which gave Pee-wee an even bigger following. During the mid-1980s, Reubens traveled the United States with a whole new The Pee-wee Herman Show, playing notably at the Guthrie Theater in Minneapolis, Caroline's in New York City and, in 1984, in front of a full Carnegie Hall.

It is one of the most important natural and historical areas in Florida. Paynes Prairie is located near Gainesville. It is large, 21,000 acres. This protected land is called a preserve. The Florida Park Service manages the preserve. The Paynes Prairie basin was formed when limestone dissolved and the ground settled. It is covered by marsh and wet prairie vegetation. There are areas of open water. During brief periods it has flooded enough to be considered a lake. Except for that, the basin has changed little through time. Man has lived on Paynes Prairie a very long time. He lived there as far back as 10,000 B. C. At one time, the Seminoles lived there. The prairie is thought to have been named after King Payne, a Seminole chief. During the late 1600s, the largest cattle ranch in Florida was on Paynes Prairie. Today, Paynes Prairie is preserved land. It is occupied by visitors and Florida Park Service employees. Willam Bartram visited Paynes Praire. Bartram was the first person who portrayed (described) nature through personal experience as well as scientific observation. He lived 200 years ago. He visited Paynes Prairie in 1774. At that time he described it. He called Paynes Prairie the \\"great Alachua Savannah.\\" Most of the animal life, which Bartram described, is still here. A large number of sandhill cranes, hawks and waterfowl are here in winter. The animal _ is increased by the presence of pine flatwoods, hammock, swamps and ponds.

All of the pupils have been subsequently removed, last leaving in September. Council begun a consultation on the future of the school on October 27 and it will run until 21 November. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: A School Gets in Trouble for Not Being Nice to Others Once upon a time, there was a little school called Ravenstonedale Endowed School in a place called Cumbria. This school was really small, with only 13 kids attending it. One day, some important people from a group called Ofsted came to visit the school. Ofsted is a group that makes sure schools are doing a good job teaching kids and being nice places to learn. During their visit, the Ofsted people saw something very bad happening in the school. Some kids were acting mean to others by saying bad words and using unkind language about each other's skin colors and who they liked. This is called racist and homophobic behavior, and it is not OK, because all people should be treated nicely, no matter who they are or where they come from. Because the school was not doing a good job at teaching the kids to be kind and respectful, Ofsted decided to put the school under a thing called \\"special measures.\\" This means that the school has to work extra hard to fix their problems and show that they can be a good place for kids to learn and grow. Sadly, because of what happened, all the 13 kids' parents decided to take them out of the school to find a better and friendlier place for them to learn. The last kid left the school in September. Now, the people who are in charge of schools in the area, called the Council, are trying to figure out what to do with the school. They started talking to people about it on October 27th and will keep talking until November 21st. They want to make sure that if the school stays open, it will be a good and safe place for kids to learn in the future. In conclusion, it is very important for all of us to be kind, respectful, and understanding to one another, no matter where we come from or what we believe in. That way, we can all learn and grow together in a happy and loving environment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can. While answering think step-by-step and justify your answer. Detailed Instructions: Given a post that is a real-life anecdote of a complex ethical situation and a question asks if AUTHOR, NOBODY, EVERYBODY, or OTHER is wrong in the situation. Answer the question and classify your answers into yes or no. Q: Is OTHER wrong in the post ? POST : There's a couple I know who are dating and the guy is head over heels for her but she doesn't feel the same. She's cheated on him at least once (in the last 2 months) and flirts with her ex's on a regular basis, as well as reminiscing about the times she spent with her ex saying \\"look I was actually happy then\\". She constantly posts pictures of her and her ex on her private story. I think it would be better for him long run but at the same time he seems to be very happy with her. So WIBTA if I let him know what's been going on? A:","completion":"In this situation, it seems that OTHER refers to the person considering whether or not to inform the guy about the girl's actions. To answer the question - Is OTHER wrong in the post? Step 1: Evaluate the situation The guy seems happy in the relationship even though the girl is cheating on him and flirting with her ex's. Step 2: Consider the potential consequences If OTHER informs the guy about the girl's behavior, it may lead to a confrontation and potentially the end of their relationship. The guy might appreciate knowing the truth, but it could also hurt him. On the other hand, if they don't say anything, they are enabling the girl's behavior and allowing the guy to potentially get hurt more in the long run. Step 3: Compare the options Informing the guy might lead to immediate pain but could save him from further distress down the line. On the flip side, not telling him may allow the relationship to continue without any immediate issues, but the girl's behavior could escalate and cause more significant harm later on. Step 4: Justify the answer Given the information provided, it appears that the OTHER, who is considering revealing the truth, is not wrong for wanting to disclose the girl's behavior. Their intentions seem to be focused on protecting the guy from further emotional pain, even though it may cause immediate discomfort. Therefore, the answer to the question is NO, OTHER is not wrong in this situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Wilhelm was one of eleven children born to poor tenant farmers John and Ethel (nee Stanley) Wilhelm in Huntersville, North Carolina. He played baseball at Cornelius High School in Cornelius, North Carolina. There, he began experimenting with a knuckleball after reading about pitcher Dutch Leonard. After his retirement as a player, Wilhelm managed two minor league teams in the Atlanta Braves system for single seasons. He led the 1973 Greenwood Braves of the Western Carolinas League to a 61-66 record, then had a 33-33 record with the 1975 Kingsport Braves of the Appalachian League. He also worked as a minor league pitching coach for the New York Yankees for 22 years. As a coach, Wilhelm said that he did not teach pitchers the knuckleball, believing that people had to be born with a knack for throwing it. He sometimes worked individually with major league players who wanted to improve their knuckleballs, including Joe Niekro. The Yankees gave Wilhelm permission to work with Mickey Lolich in 1979 even though Lolich pitched for the San Diego Padres. Wilhelm was on the ballot for the Baseball Hall of Fame for eight years before he was elected. After Wilhelm failed to garner enough votes for induction in 1983, sportswriter Jim Murray criticized the voters, saying that while Wilhelm never had the look of a baseball player, he was \\"the best player in history at what he does.\\" He fell short by 13 votes in 1984. Wilhelm was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1985. At his induction ceremony, he said that he had achieved all three of his initial major league goals: appearing in a World Series, being named to an All-Star team, and throwing a no-hitter. He and his wife Peggy lived in Sarasota, Florida. They raised three children together: Patti, Pam, and Jim. Wilhelm died of heart failure in a Sarasota nursing home in 2002.

The family live in a beautiful home on the Pacific Northwest waterfront. When Nick scores yet another business triumph, he buys a yacht to celebrate. Leaving Matty with their friend Angie, who is a teacher at Matty's preschool, the couple set sail for a romantic weekend. But Libby drinks too much wine and passes out. When she wakes, she is covered in blood and Nick is gone. Dizzy and disoriented, she follows a trail of blood to the upper deck. Nick is not there but Libby sees a knife and picks it up. The lights of a Coast Guard boat flash and a voice orders Libby to drop the knife. A mayday was received from the Parsons' yacht. Libby is taken into custody but Nick has seemingly vanished. Tests reveal that the blood found on the yacht was the same type as Nick's. It is presumed that the couple had an argument and Libby attacked Nick. He managed to send a mayday alert before falling or being pushed overboard.Despite the fact that no body is found, Libby is charged with murder. No one believes her story, not even the sheriff who is a family friend. Frantic over what will happen to Matty if she is found guilty, Libby signs over custody to Angie.

Please answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Who hasn't enjoyed eating peanuts? Did you know that although peanuts look like nuts and taste like nuts, they aren't nuts at all? They belong to the pea family, so they are called peanuts. The peanut grows flowers above ground, but its \\"fruit\\" grows underground. It grows in more countries than most other \\"nuts\\". The peanut is a native South American plant. Scientists believe that it grew wild in Brazil long ago. They think that for several thousand years the early peoples of South America made it a part of their diet. These peoples were nomads who moved on when a natural food could no longer be found in one area. Along the way they probably let fall some peanuts, which got into the ground and grew. This is believed to be the way the plant reached the place where the Incas lived. The Incas, from about 1100 to 1532, thought highly of peanuts. The peanuts were eaten in several forms and used as sacrificial offerings to the Incan Sun God. Later in the 16thcentury, European soldiers had brought peanuts to other parts of the world, including North America, Africa, Asia, Europe, and Pacific Islands. Although peanuts were found native in South America, they are now grown in almost every country that has warm weather. India produces the most peanuts. China's production is next, followed by the United States. The peanut is special in more ways than one. It can be eaten raw, boiled, roasted, or fried. Hundreds of widely different products have been made from it. Carver, an American scientist, set himself the task of discovering new uses for eating and for many other products. Peanuts are very highly _ and are also high in protein . Americans use about seven-tenths of their protein in the form of meat. In India, where the poor can't pay for meat or milk, peanut meal and peanut milk have been produced. These have been a great help to the poor. New products are continually being made from peanuts, among them peanut cheese and a powder that becomes peanut butter when water is added. The fact is that peanuts are so healthy...

In an economically depressed environment in which many are out of work, more gather by the docks each morning hoping to secure work for that day than can be hired, placing Johnny Friendly and his forces in a position to exploit them. Those who complain of the working conditions or wages one day don't work the next day, or are placed in harm's way. Consequently, most tolerate being abused.After befriending both the sister (Eva Marie Saint) of the murdered man and the local priest (Karle Malden), Terry gradually becomes a man of deeper morality, and starts to speak of acts against Friendly, who will soon go on trial. Terry finds his breaking point when his brother is murdered by Friendly's thugs, and causes him to entertain thoughts of testifying against Friendly. Still, he struggles to find the courage to do so, until the priest persuades him to.Once he betrays Friendly, Terry is without the work that always came his way when he and his brother were trusted and valued associates. Still, he confronts Friendly by the docks and when all the dock workers are witness to the brutal beating of Terry by Friendly, they refuse to work unless Terry is also allowed to work.

Q: Context_1 : The Body in the Library is a 1984 television film adaptation of Agatha Christie's 1942 detective novel \\"The Body in the Library\\", which was co-produced by the BBC and the A&E Network. The film uses an adapted screenplay by T. R. Bowen and was directed by Silvio Narizzano. Starring Joan Hickson in the title role, it was the first film presented in the British television series \\"Miss Marple\\" and premiered in three parts from 26 to 28 December 1984 on BBC One. In the United States the film was first broadcast on 4 January 1986 as a part of PBS's \\"Mystery!\\". In his review in \\"The New York Times\\", critic John J. O'Connor wrote: \\"Miss Christie would no doubt approve of Joan Hickson, the veteran British character actress who plays Miss Marple... This BBC/Arts & Entertainment co-production offers an especially good example of Agatha Christie in adaptation. The characters are nicely realized and the suspense holds. Miss Hickson is lovely, neither as awesome as Miss Rutherford nor as overly cute as Helen Hayes. And the supporting cast is admirable, particularly Gwen Watford as Dolly and David Horovitch as Inspector Slack. As someone notes about the case, 'you'll have to admit it has all the bizarre elements of a cheap thriller.' Once hooked, you won't be able to turn it off.\\" Context_2 : Murder on the Nile (1944) is a murder mystery play by crime writer Agatha Christie, based on her 1937 novel \\"Death on the Nile\\". The notable John Anderson chose to portray McNaught in this play before retiring from the stage.

It is unusual for Agatha Christie plays in more than one way: for example, it is an original play, not based on a story or novel; and though there is a murder in the story, it is a melodrama more than a typical 'whodunnit' mystery as the murder takes place on stage. Context_5 : The Mousetrap is a murder mystery play by Agatha Christie. \\"The Mousetrap\\" opened in London's West End in 1952, and has been running continuously since then. The longest running West End show, it has by far the longest initial run of any play in history, with its 25,000th performance taking place on 18 November 2012. The play is known for its twist ending, which the audience are traditionally asked not to reveal after leaving the theatre.

The title character was played by Geraldine McEwan from the first to third series, until her retirement from the role. She was replaced by Julia McKenzie from the fourth series onwards. The first six episodes were all adaptations of \\"Miss Marple\\" novels by Christie. Subsequent episodes were derived both from works featuring Miss Marple but also Christie novels that did not feature the character. Context_7 : The Agatha Christie Memorial is a memorial to author and playwright Agatha Christie, located at the intersection of Cranbourn Street and Great Newport Street by St Martin's Cross near Covent Garden, in London, United Kingdom. It is located in the heart of London's theatre district.

Context_8 : Miss Marple is a British television series based on the Miss Marple murder mystery novels by Agatha Christie, starring Joan Hickson in the title role. It aired from 26 December 1984 to 27 December 1992. All 12 original Miss Marple Christie novels were dramatised. The adaptations were written by T. R.

In addition to its availability on VHS and DVD, the series began to be released on Blu-ray Disc in October 2014, marking its 30th anniversary. Context_9 : Martin Miller, born Rudolph Muller (2 September 1899 – 26 August 1969) was a Czech-Austrian character actor who played many small roles in British films and television series from the early 1940s until his death. He was best known for playing eccentric doctors, scientists and professors, although he played a wide range of small, obscure rolesincluding photographers, waiters, a pet store dealer, rabbis, a Dutch sailor and a Swiss tailor.

Academy Award-winning star Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Elliot is a bankrupt actress of a certain age struggling to accept her new non-wealthy reality. She is in denial, and confident she can somehow build herself up again and re-launch her career to its earlier brilliance. After suffering another big disappointment while vainly striving to get that last one good role, she gets drunk, is arrested for DUI, and spends a night in jail. She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen, a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days and, helped by Margaret's daughter Gretchen, tries to help Margaret see that her big screen days as a famous actress are already over.

Her old agent manages to get her a screen test for a role in a film she'd always wanted to play.

Q: The animals of the Pridelands gather to witness the celebration of the newborn cub, Kiara, daughter and firstborn offspring of King Simba and Queen Nala. Simba's father, Mufasa, proudly watches over the ceremony from the Heavens above. As she grows older, Kiara becomes annoyed with her father's overprotective parenting. Simba assigns Timon and Pumbaa to follow her. Kiara ignores her father's warning and the duo's attention and enters the \\"Outlands,\\" where she meets Kovu, a cub who was chosen by Simba's uncle Scar to be his heir. When Kovu retaliates to Kiara's playing, Simba confronts the young cub just as Zira, Kovu's mother, confronts him. Zira reminds Simba of how he exiled her and the other Outsiders, and she reveals that she selected Kovu to be Scar's successor.After returning to the Pride Lands, Simba sends Nala and the rest of the pride back to Pride Rock while he lectures Kiara about the danger posed by the Outsiders. Simba then tells her that they are a part of each other. Meanwhile in the Outlands, Zira reminds Kovu that Simba killed Scar and exiled the lions who respect him. Kovu explains that he does not think it is so bad to have Kiara as his good friend, but Zira realizes she can use Kovu's friendship with Kiara to seek revenge on Simba.Several years later, Kiara begins her first solo hunt, but Simba has Timon and Pumbaa follow her in secret, causing her to hunt away from the Pride Lands. As part of Zira's plan, Kovu's siblings Nuka and Vitani trap Kiara in a fire, allowing Kovu to rescue her. Unable to thank the young rogue, Simba is forced to accept Kovu's asylum since Kovu rescued Kiara. Later that night, Simba has a nightmare about attempting to save Mufasa from falling into the stampede but is stopped by Scar who then morphs into Kovu and throws Simba off the cliff to his death.The next day, Kovu contemplates attacking Simba as he was instructed to, but he teaches Kiara how to hunt instead and eventually realizes his feelings for her. Later, Kiara and Kovu stargaze where they talk about the Great Kings of the Past and Kovu wonders if there is a darkness in him like there was in Scar. Simba watches the two from afar and Nala convinces him to give Kovu a chance. Kovu attempts to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Rafiki interrupts and leads them to the jungle, where he introduces them to \\"upendi\\", which means love in Swahili. The two lions fall in love. That night, Simba allows Kovu to sleep inside Pride Rock with the rest of the pride, but Vitani tells Zira about Kovu's failure to kill Simba.The next day, Kovu wants to reveal his mission to Kiara, but Simba takes him around the Pride Lands and tells him the real story of Scar. They fall into Zira's trap and the Outsiders attack Simba. Kovu attempts to intervene, but Vitani injures him. Nuka attempts to kill Simba, but Simba flees and Nuka is killed. Zira scratches Kovu for his brother's death, causing him to turn on her. Kovu attempts to plead Simba for his forgiveness, but is exiled. Kiara makes Simba realize that he is acting irrationally, and flees to find Kovu. The two lions later find each other and profess their love. Kovu wants to start a pride of his own with Kiara, but she tells him to return to the Pride Lands and reunite their prides.The Outsiders and Pridelanders fight, but Kovu and Kiara intervene and tell Zira and Simba to stop fighting. Vitani and the Outsiders side with the Pridelanders. Zira attempts to kill Simba, but Kiara pushes her over a cliff, dangling over a storm-swollen river. Kiara offers her help, but Zira refuses and falls to her death. Rescuing Kiara, Simba reconciles with the Outsiders and Kovu, allowing them to rejoin the Pride Lands. Simba accepts Kovu as his son-in-law and the future king and Kiara the future queen. Simba looks up at the sky to hear the approval of his father, who says he is proud of him.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person that said the album released in 1982 offered a middle ground between funk and jazz? A few weeks after Of Human Feelings was recorded, Mwanga went to Japan to negotiate a deal with Trio Records to have the album released on Phrase Text. Trio, who had previously released a compilation of Coleman's 1966 to 1971 live performances in Paris, prepared to press the album once Mwanga provided the label with the record stamper. Coleman was also set to perform his song \\"Skies of America\\" with the NHK Symphony Orchestra, but cancelled both deals upon Mwanga's return from Japan. Mwanga immediately quit after less than four months as Coleman's manager. In 1981, Coleman hired Stan and Sid Bernstein as his managers, who sold the album's recording tapes to Island Records. He signed with the record label that year, and Of Human Feelings was released in 1982 on Island's subsidiary jazz label Antilles Records. Billboard magazine published a front-page story at the time about its distinction as both the first digital album recorded in New York City and the first digital jazz album recorded by an American label.According to jazz writer Francis Davis, \\"a modest commercial breakthrough seemed imminent\\" for Coleman, who appeared to be regaining his celebrity. German musicologist Peter Niklas Wilson said the album may have been the most tuneful and commercial-sounding of his career at that point. The album's clean mix and relatively short tracks were interpreted as an attempt for radio airplay by Mandel, who described its production as \\"the surface consistency that would put it in the pop sphere\\". Of Human Feelings had no success on the American pop charts, only charting on the Top Jazz Albums, where it spent 26 weeks and peaked at number 15. Because the record offered a middle ground between funk and jazz, McRae argued that it consequently appealed to neither demographic of listeners. Sound & Vision critic Brent Butterworth speculated that it was overlooked because it had electric instruments, rock and funk drumming, and did not conform to what he felt was the hokey image of jazz that many of the genre's fans... The answer is:","completion":"McRae is the last name of the person that said the album released in 1982 offered a middle ground between funk and jazz."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Movie plot title: Wall Street Movie plot: In 1985, Bud Fox (Charlie Sheen) is working as a junior stockbroker in New York City at Jackson Steinem &amp; Co. He wants to work with his hero, Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas), a legendary Wall Street player. After calling Gekko's office 59 days in a row trying to land an appointment, Bud visits Gekko on his birthday with a box of Gekko's favorite, contraband Cuban cigars. Impressed at his sheer boldness, Gekko grants Bud an interview. Bud pitches him stocks, but Gekko is unimpressed. Desperate, Bud provides him some inside information about Bluestar Airlines, which Bud learned in a casual conversation from his father, Carl (Martin Sheen), the union leader for the company's maintenance workers. Intrigued, Gekko tells Bud he will think about it, but also that he \\"[looks] at a hundred deals a day,\\" but \\"[chooses] one.\\" A dejected Bud returns to his office. However, Gekko places an order for Bluestar stock and becomes one of Bud's clients. Gekko gives Bud some capital to manage, but the other stocks Bud selects lose money. Gekko gives Bud another chance, and tells him to spy on British CEO Sir Lawrence Wildman (Terence Stamp) and discern Wildman's next move. Bud learns that Wildman is making a bid for a steel company. Through Bud's spying, Gekko makes big money, and Wildman is forced to buy Gekko's shares off him to complete his takeover. Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, including a penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and a trophy girlfriend, interior decorator Darien (Daryl Hannah). Bud is promoted to a senior stockbroker as a result of the large commission fees he is bringing in from Gekko's trading, and is given a corner office with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers to provide more income for him and Gekko. Unknown to Bud, several of his trades attract the attention of the Securities and Exchange Commission.

To do this, subtract 768 from both sides of the equation. 192*d + 768 - 768 = 0 - 768 192*d = -768 Step 4: To solve for d, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 192.

In many ways, they are very different. But what are the differences? Hu Peng of Wuhan and four friends decided to find them out. Earlier this month, they lived for a week in Caidian, a village near Wuhan. Hu and his friends went door to door in Caidian and asked the kids there lots of questions. They wanted to learn more about village kids' everyday lives, so they asked these questions like --Do your parents teach you how to do housework? How much money do you usually spend on dinner? What would you do if a thief came into your house? They also asked 150 city kids the same questions.What's the Difference? Last week the team gave a report to their class. There are lots of differences between children's lives in cities and those in villages. The biggest difference is independence. Hu's team said that 60 percent of city kids couldn't do much housework, but 90 percent of village kids could care for themselves. City kids told Hu they cared about school a lot, and they had no time for washing clothes or making their beds. Village kids said they helped their parents with housework a lot. They cooked, did some cleaning and fed animals. Hu's team also found that village kids had less pocket money . Many never used computers. They played in rivers or on mountains. Some didn't really like to make new friends. Hu and his friends said their trip gave them more self-confidence because they were doing something by themselves. But _ also made them a little worried because they saw they still had a lot to learn. \\"When we grow up, our parents can't take care of us,\\" said Hu. \\"We have to learn to take care of ourselves.\\" Shen Guanquan, one of Hu's friends said, \\"When children learn to care for themselves, they learn to do lots of things.\\" The answer is:","completion":"Based on the article, which of the following statements best describes the primary difference between the lives of city kids and village kids?

While you don't need to become proficient in Klingon, you should make an attempt to understand your partner's obsessions. Follow some of the movies, books, and games that your partner loves. Who knows--maybe they'll become your obsessions, too. A relationship is a two-way street. You should show some interest in your partner's passions, and demand that your partner do the same for you. Don't worry if you don't understand some of your partner's passions. While some shared interests are important, you don't need to share all of them. Your partner's nerdy obsessions and social awkwardness make them who they are. You shouldn't try to change them, and moreover, you won't be able to. If you can't accept them, then you probably shouldn't be together. Don't tease your partner for their mysterious obsessions. They've likely had to put up with such teasing their entire life, and more of it will only cause them to withdraw. Nerds often thrive on routine. They are very sensitive to change, whether it be at work, on the road, or at home. Simply moving an item in your partner's room might upset them. You partner may have a designated space in the home where they like to work or pursue their hobbies undisturbed. They value the predictability and security of this space, so be certain not to violate any boundaries. Ask before cleaning their space or moving any of their things. If you are the type of person that craves spontaneity, dating a routine-oriented nerd might seem challenging. However, you can still do spontaneous things with your partner, like traveling, by combining more spontaneous activities with more structured activities. For example, if you want to go on vacation with your partner, have a balance of very structured, highly scheduled days, and days that are more laid back. This might sound counterintuitive. Shouldn't the nerd be explaining to you? The truth is, you'll probably know more about many subjects than your partner. Nerds tend to specialize in one area of knowledge, which means you'll probably know more than they do about more mainstream things, like cars, pro football, and non-science-fiction movies. Don't belittle your partner for not knowing much about mainstream topics. Instead, try patiently explaining. Your partner's friends are important to them. You should take an interest in them, despite the fact that they'll probably be pretty nerdy, too. That's not to say you need to spend every night LARPing together. Rather, make sure you hang out with them sometimes, ask them questions, and are generally friendly. You may not like all of your partner's friends, but you should accept them.

Help as much as you can. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Gauri Nanda sees a wearable computer as a handbag -- one that's built out of four-inch squares and triangles of fiber, with tiny computer chips embedded in it. It looks, feels and weighs like your typical leather purse. That's where similarities end: This bag can wirelessly keep track of your belongings and remind you, just as you're about to leave the house, to take your wallet. It can review the weather report and suggest that you grab an umbrella. This purse can even upload your favorite songs onto your scarf. Sure, a computing purse and scarf set may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But these devices, part of next generation of wearable computers, could become commonplace within a few years. DuPont created new super strong fibers that can conduct electricity and can be woven into ordinary-looking clothes. And the chipmaker developed chip packaging allowing wearable computers to be washed, even in the heavy-duty cycle. As a result, these new wearable devices are different from the heavy and downright silly versions of the recent past, which often required users to be wrapped in wires and type on their stomachs. Unlike their predecessors, these new wearable computers also make economic sense. When her bag becomes commercially available in two to three years, Nanda expects it will cost around 150, which is the price of an average leather purse. Here's how the bag works: You place a special radio-signal-transmitting chip on to your wallet. A similar radio in your purse picks up the signal and notifies you that you've forgotten to take your wallet. In turn, sensors on your purse's handles will notify the computer that you've picked up the purse and are ready to go. _ Indeed, more people will want to cross that bridge in the coming years -- making for a booming market for wearable computers that don't like something out of science fiction.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Israel housing minister approves 1G new settlement homes in West Bank, east Jerusalem JERUSALEM – Israel's housing minister on Sunday gave final approval to build nearly 1,200 apartments in Jewish settlements, just three days before Israeli-Palestinian peace talks are to resume in Jerusalem. There was no immediate Palestinian comment, though the announcement by Housing Minister Uri Ariel was bound to deepen the atmosphere of distrust as the two sides head into talks after a five-year freeze. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas had long insisted he would not resume talks without an Israeli settlement freeze, arguing that the expansion of settlements is pre-empting the outcome of negotiations. The Palestinians want to establish a state in the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem, captured by Israel in 1967. Israel has built dozens of settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem that are now home to some 560,000 Israelis. In the end, Abbas agreed to enter talks without a settlement freeze. In an apparent tradeoff, Israel agreed to release 104 long-held Palestinian prisoners in four installments over several months, with the first group of 26 to be freed Tuesday. In Sunday's announcement, the Housing Ministry said 1,187 apartments had been given final approval, the last stage before issuing tenders to contractors. Of those, 793 will be built in neighborhoods for Jews in east Jerusalem, annexed by Israel shortly after the 1967 Mideast war. Most of the international community does not recognize the annexation. In addition, 394 apartments are to be built in several large West Bank settlements, including Maaleh Adumim, Efrat and Ariel. The latter sits in the heart of the West Bank, and its expansion could be particularly problematic for negotiators trying to carve out a viable Palestinian state. The housing minister, a leading member of the pro-settler party Jewish Home, said construction would continue. \\"No country in the world takes orders from other countries where it can build and where it can't,\\" Ariel said in his statement. \\"We will continue to market housing and build in the entire country ... This is the right thing at the present time, for Zionism and for the economy.\\"","completion":"In Jerusalem, the Israel housing minister has said it is okay to build almost 1,200 new homes in Jewish settlements, just before peace talks with Palestinians were going to start. This may make the Palestinians unhappy, because their leader did not want new settlements before talking about peace, but they agreed to talk anyway. Palestinians want to have their own country in some areas that Israel controls, and they think new settlements make this difficult. Some people outside Israel don't agree with these decisions either."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Write highlights for this article: Two men in a helicopter have saved a birthing southern right whale in Western Australia from an imminent shark attack- and luckily, one of the men on board was able to photograph the extraordinary sequence of events. On Wednesday, tourism operator Sean Blocksidge was flying on a helicopter with his friend, helicopter pilot Brett Campany, taking aerial photographs off the coast of Cowaramup Bay, south of the Margaret River in Western Australia. From a great height, they first spotted the calving whale - and almost immediately after, a predator shark heading straight for the helpless mammal in the shallows. 'As we flew by the Wilyabrup cliffs about 1500 feet in the air, Brett and I spotted something. It looked like a really big fish from that high up! On closer inspection, we realised that it was a Southern Right Whale giving birth,' Mr Blocksidge told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video. A story in photographs: From 1500 feet, Sean Blocksidge and Brett Campany spotted what looked like 'a really big fish' (photographed from the helicopter, pictured bottom right) close to shore off the coast of Cowaramup Bay. The friends soon realised that they had found a southern right whale giving birth to her calf. Brett Campany dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from a calving southern right whale off the coast of Cowaramup Bay. 'We get more than 30,000 whales migrating along the west coast at peak season every year. We see whales all the time, you'll see at least one a day. 'So you get to understand whale behaviour. I'd seen a whale calving quite recently so I knew what was happening when I saw the whale on Wednesday. You could tell that she was giving birth because they come close to shore and have certain mannerisms.They come close to the water's surface and arch their backs.' It was then that the pair spotted the bronze whaler shark and with only seconds to react, took it upon themselves to prevent the inevitable tragedy. Whilst watching the pregnant whale in the shallows, Mr Campany spotted a four-metre shark (pictured) in the distance, heading straight for the whale. 'We could see a shark moving down the beach. You could tell, it was coming quite quickly. It was massive, about four metres long and heading straight for the southern right. 'We only had seconds to think about it. There was no time, but we had to do something.' 'I mean, I'm all for letting nature do it's thing. We wouldn't normally interfere at all but it would be too sad if we left the shark to attack the brand new calf right after the poor mother gave birth.' Mr Campany dropped the helicopter down and closed in on the shark, to chase it away from the vulnerable calving whale and towards deeper waters. Throughout the whole ordeal, Mr Blocksidge kept taking photographs - a courageous task considering his chopper door was open the entire time. 'It was pretty cool to see what the helicopter could do. We turned sideways at one point when we were directly over the shark. I'd left my door open while I took photographs to get a better shot, so I was pretty nervous when I was hanging sideways directly over the shark with nothing between us!' 'It all happened so quickly but I just tried to keep clicking to get some photos. The shark high-tailed it out of there very quickly, he got a pretty big fright, I think,' Mr Blocksidge said. Brett Campany dropped the helicopter down to herd the shark back out to deeper water and away from the calving southern right whale. Sean Blocksidge tried to take photographs - a courageous task, with his door open and the helicopter on its side while they hovered over the shark. 'We couldn't believe what was happening, things just kept popping up before our eyes, it didn't seem real!' said Mr Blocksidge. 'We were near Williaborough beach and landed on the sand to give the whale plenty of space, because we didn't want to disturb her. We didn't want to stress the poor whale while she gave birth, but we were keeping an eye on her to make sure she was okay. Mr Campany landed the helicopter on the sand once the shark had been herded away from the whale and out to deeper water. From a safe distance, the men both watched the whale in the shallows. 'A pod of about 20 dolphins arrived to circle the birthing whale, it was really quite amazing - like the call of nature. We decided to fly off before the whale gave birth because we knew she was safe. The dolphins made a ring around her to protect her. 'We had a laugh and said well, we can leave because we know the dolphins are here to manage the maternity ward for the night!' said Mr Blocksidge. 'It was just amazing - nature at work. It's something you never forget.' 'It was like nature's call!' Mr Blockside and Mr Campany were amazed when a pod of around 20 dolphins arrived, encircling the expectant mother whale to protect her. The men left, assured the whale was safe with the dolphins there to 'manage the maternity ward.' 'It was like nature's call!' Mr Blockside and Mr Campany were amazed when a pod of around 20 dolphins arrived, encircling the expectant mother whale to protect her.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'd love to give this movie a 10/10, but in its existing state I can only go to 8/10 tops. The post-Code editing (read: destroying) of this film warrants a 2-point demerit. From my very limited knowledge of film history, Baby Face was apparently one of two movies that finally broke the camel's back and brought the full wrath and enforcement of the Production Code into play in 1934. (I don't know what the other movie was.) As a result, the movie in its original incarnation was never allowed to be re-released after 1934. It was chopped and edited to bits, and no original version is known to exist today. The best that we can see today is the version that TCM (Turner Classic Movies) shows, but that is blatantly edited in several scenes, and has a really disappointing \\"happy ending\\" slapped onto the end. All the above being said, the movie is still pretty darned great and lots of fun to watch. Barbara Stanwyck is, as always, absolutely amazing and wonderful. She is so beautiful and powerful; she just owns the whole movie! She plays a woman who's been used by men her entire life, starting with her father who pimps her out to the local Erie, PA steel workers as well as to local politicians in a quid pro quo of 'if you don't shut down my speakeasy I'll let you sleep with my daughter'. When the father dies in a fiery explosion near the beginning of the flick, the smile on Stanwyck's face is priceless. After the fire, Stanwyck leaves Erie with her maid and heads to New York City. She sets her sights on a skyscraper and starts literally working her way to the top. Starting out with the personnel clerk in the HR department, she sleeps with him to get an entry level position at the bank. From there, she sleeps with man after man after man (including a very young John Wayne) using each new man to help her land a higher paying job on a higher floor of the skyscraper, with increasingly powerful male bosses cum sugar daddies. Stanwyck stops at nothing in her rise to the top. It is great fun to see her and her maid in increasingly fancier clothes and apartments as Stanwyck works her way up the corporate ladder. Stanwyck is the ultimate femme fatale, manipulating, she-vixen in this flick! If you watch this movie, I recommend stopping when you see the George Brent character (Courtland Trenholm) die in Stanwyck's arms. Skip the remaining 3 minutes or so! The \\"happy ending\\" slapped on to the end of the movie for post-Code audiences is insulting to the audience's intelligence and lame beyond belief: the bank board members are sitting around a table expositing about Mr. and Mrs. Trenholm's million dollar donation to the bank and how they are living happily but poor in Erie, with former VP Trenholm now working in the steel mills - cut to the exact same footage of a steel plant that we saw in the beginning of the movie - \\"The End\\". PUH-LEEZE - HOW LAME! The movie originally ended with George Brent succeeding in his suicide attempt. I think that ending fits the overall mood of the movie much better than the slapped on post-Code ending. I certainly hope that a print of the original pre-Code version of this flick is discovered during my lifetime (update: the original HAS been found and should be out on DVD and/or TCM in 2006!). Until then, I'll enjoy the TCM version and switch it off before the lame-o post-Code ending. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The reviewer enjoys the movie but feels that the editing and changes made for the post-Code version deserve a 2-point demerit. They still think the movie is great and fun to watch, with Barbara Stanwyck giving an amazing performance. However, they express disappointment in the \\"happy ending\\" added to the post-Code version of the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Chinese title means \\"\\"The Unceasing Path\\"\\", a reference to Avici, the lowest level of Hell in Buddhism, where one endures suffering incessantly.

The premise focuses on the fact that the person has missed the first series of Katherine Hepburn's show touring the gardens of Europe, while the hypothesis claims that they have watched it. To conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis, there must be a logical connection between the two statements that guarantees the truth of the second statement (hypothesis) given the truth of the first statement (premise).

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Personal auto insurance usually has a livery exclusion, meaning your passengers and car will not be covered if you are using it for hire. Start searching for a business auto policy that covers livery service early, as it can take 4 to 6 weeks to get in place. Most clients find their limousines online, so a website is vital. Unless you are an experienced site designer, you will probably want to hire a professional to create a polished website. Web designers will build your site and take care of registering your domain name and selecting a webhost. The more you pay, the more input you will have in creating a unique site. The cost of web design varies depending on whether you use a solo developer in the US (25-100/hr), an offshore web company (10-40/hr), or an established US agency (60-200/hr). Offshore firms can design sites starting at around 500, while the cost of a US firm will usually range from 5,000-10,000, with solo developers falling somewhere in-between. You will most frequently be charged by the minute for your toll-free numbers. Call around for the best rates. Once you have the number, you can print business cards with it and your website. These cards are a key way to grow your business. You will give them to customers and leave them at clubs and hotels. If you are establishing a virtual call center, you will need to negotiate contracts with existing limousine companies that specify the commission you will receive. Otherwise, you will need to purchase a vehicle. A black Town Car is a good starter for airport transfers and corporate customers. It is less expensive than a stretch limo. A stretch limo is necessary for most of the most lucrative services – weddings, funerals, proms and graduations – so you’ll want to add one to your fleet as soon as possible. Start with a white limo, as these are most popular for weddings, proms, graduations, and other special events. If possible, purchase both a black sedan and a limousine so that you can provide the full range of services – airport and corporate business during the week, and special events on the weekends. You can install a meter in your car, but limousine drivers are increasingly opting for online services that schedule appointments, notify drivers where to pick up customers, and handle payment. Even if you know your town like the back of your hand, there will be addresses that you’ve never heard of. A navigation system will not only ensure that you don’t get lost, it can also help you avoid traffic, thereby greatly improving your clients’ experience. Advertising is the key to succeeding in the limousine business. The more inquiries you receive, and the more of those inquiries you convert into sales, the more money you can make. A polished website and business cards are a key starting point. Also consider: Pay-per-click advertising – Buying internet traffic is the quickest way to bring people to your website. However, make sure you are targeting the right audience. Clicks cost you money, and if tons of visitors leave without purchasing your services or product, you can lose money. The two major advertisers are GoogleAds and Facebook. Craigslist, the yellow pages, and radio spots – Make sure you have a professional ad in both the yellow pages and craigslist, for those who search there. Radio spots can be effective, though they are more expensive than internet advertising. Hotels and night clubs – Talk with the manager and drop off your card. Consider giving 5% commission to hotel doormen and club staff. If someone needs a limo, you want to be the person they recommend.

Write a text based on \\"india expels four pakistan embassy officials\\" Text:","completion":"Title: Diplomatic Tensions Escalate: India Expels Four Pakistan Embassy Officials Introduction: Diplomatic relations between India and Pakistan have been marked by turbulence and occasional hostility since the partition of British India in 1947. In a recent act of escalating tensions, India announced the expulsion of four Pakistan embassy officials amid mounting accusations of espionage and concerns over national security. This dramatic move has raised questions about the future of diplomatic relations between the two nuclear-armed South Asian neighbors and whether any genuine resolution is possible without third-party intervention. Background: The long-standing feud between India and Pakistan is rooted in territorial disputes, particularly over the erstwhile princely state of Jammu and Kashmir. Numerous wars, skirmishes, and incidents of armed hostility have punctuated the uneasy peace between the two nations since gaining their independence. The presence of nuclear weapons in both countries has further cemented the adversarial nature of the relationship, as any outbreak of major hostilities carries the risk of escalating into a catastrophic nuclear exchange. India's Decision to Expel Pakistani Officials: The Indian government opted to expel four Pakistani embassy officials after credible intelligence reports suggested they were involved in spying activities and colluding with various anti-India elements. The Indian External Affairs Ministry declared these individuals 'persona non grata' and directed them to leave the country within the next 48 hours. Such a move is regarded as a severe diplomatic insult, as diplomats are traditionally immune from prosecution under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. Pakistan's Reaction and Reciprocal Measures: Predictably, Pakistan responded to the expulsions with anger and indignation, vehemently denying the allegations of espionage and accusing India of attempting to undermine its diplomatic presence in New Delhi. In a tit-for-tat move, the Pakistani government expelled an equal number of Indian high commission officials and accused them of engaging in espionage activities. Such reciprocal measures are typical in instances of diplomatic conflict, but they invariably heighten tensions and limit the potential for constructive dialogue between the disputing parties. Impact on Bilateral Relations: The expulsions of embassy officials from both countries have undoubtedly strained the already fragile diplomatic relationship between India and Pakistan. The mutual accusations of espionage and the high-profile nature of the expulsions may serve to reinforce the deep suspicion and mistrust that has characterized their interactions in recent decades. Furthermore, this development has the potential to hamper ongoing peace talks and derail any progress made towards resolving underlying disputes, such as the issue of Jammu and Kashmir. Prospects for Conflict Resolution: The expulsion of Pakistani embassy officials from India (and vice versa) highlights the urgent need for conflict resolution and trust-building measures to normalize diplomatic relations between the two nations. Currently, there are several international organizations and forums available for facilitating dialogue, such as the United Nations and the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). However, both countries must be willing to set aside deep-seated differences and engage in honest, constructive dialogue if a sustainable resolution to these issues is to be achieved. Conclusion: The recent expulsion of four Pakistani embassy officials from India has further strained the already tense relationship between the two neighbors. While this move is unlikely to lead to any immediate outbreak of hostilities, it nonetheless underscores the need for both parties to invest in meaningful dialogue and cooperation to reduce tensions and engender a more productive diplomatic relationship. Outside intervention from impartial actors may be necessary to facilitate this process, but ultimately, India and Pakistan must take responsibility for building confidence and trust within their own bilateral dealings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options: - acknowledgment - price - fresh produce - smooth skin - good credit The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"fresh produce\\" The reasoning behind this choice is that one of the most significant benefits and the main reason people usually prefer going to a farmer's market over a grocery store is because they can get fresh produce. Freshly harvested fruits and vegetables are often more nutritious and tastier. While the other options like 'price', 'acknowledgment', 'good credit', or 'smooth skin' could also be potential reasons for some people, they don't necessarily align with the common reasons for preferring farmers' markets. For instance, 'price' can be variable -some farmer's markets might be cheaper or more expensive than the grocery stores. 'Acknowledgment' and 'good credit' don't seem closely related to the context. 'Smooth skin' could be a benefit of using fresh produce but it's more of a resulting effect, not a direct reason to go to the farmer's market.

(August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...

Although they both export the same amount of wine, they use different sources of power to generate their electricity. Chien uses coal to power the city and Marisol uses nuclear power plants to produce electricity. The citizens of both cities are voting on whether to continue their current method of electricity generation. and a hint : In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out.

The mines, located in the picturesque Laxey Valley, played a crucial role in the island's economy during the 19th century, and the Laxey Wheel was designed to provide sufficient power to pump water out of the mines to allow for continued mineral extraction. The Laxey Wheel has an impressive diameter of 72 feet 6 inches (22.1 meters) and a large wooden axle, which was quite an engineering feat at the time. It was designed by the celebrated Victorian engineer Robert Casement, who used the innovative technology of the time to create this remarkable and enduring structure. Water is channeled to the top of the wheel through a viaduct, which powers the rotation of the wheel. The rotation then powers a series of underground pumps, which extract the water from the mine shafts, thus ensuring the mines remain dry and operational. The wheel continues to function today, although the mines themselves ceased operation in 1929. Today, the Laxey Wheel serves as a symbol of the Isle of Man's industrial past and is a popular tourist attraction. It has been carefully restored and preserved by the Manx National Heritage, which manages various historical sites and cultural institutions on the island. Visitors can marvel at the scale, ingenuity, and elegance of this colossal Victorian engineering masterpiece while learning about the island's unique cultural heritage and its importance in the history of the Isle of Man."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person Ray pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album?, using the article: In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go., what would be the answer ? Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question is: Quaife. The person Ray Davies pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album was Pete Quaife, who had left the band and formed a new one named Maple Oak."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. New Year’s resolutions are great, unless you don’t really resolve to do anything. Then they become a list of wishes. Unless you are going to determine steps to make your wishes turn into goals AND you’re going to follow through with those steps, you probably should not make New Year’s resolutions. Full disclaimer before we completely dive in: I’m not against setting goals. I have always been a goal setter and sometimes even a goal achiever. If you’re the same, you may enjoy this audible, or if you’re interested in developing and achieving SMART goals try this e-book or this book. Why You Shouldn’t Make New Year’s Resolutions You’ll probably write the same things on a sheet of paper that you did the year before. Some of the common resolutions we’ve all heard are: Lose weight, exercise, spend less, save more, travel, go to church, and so on and so forth. There’s a reason these are common. We hear them (or write them) time and time again and…nothing changes. By mid-January, they’ll be long forgotten. Maybe even before January 15th, they aren’t a thought in our minds. They were good ideas two weeks prior (and the years before that), but that’s what they have remained…ideas. You didn’t think of a route to your destination. Saving money sounds great, but do you know what you’re already spending? Do you know what you need to cut and where you’ll put that amount? Have you factored in your new gym membership? What will you do with it? Will the autodraft payment that comes out each month help you shed those pounds? What churches are in your area? Do they have programs your family will be interested in? Do you know when the services are? You’re overwhelmed. You try to better yourself constantly. Maybe. Let’s say some of you try to better yourselves constantly. Which can be a good thing. But it can also be the reason you fail yourselves time and time again. You say yes when you should say no, sign up when you should wait a few more months, and have a list of ten New Year’s resolutions when you should focus on two.

He convinces her he could write a report about his (false) extensive world \\"travels\\" saying his dream is to become a writer. After suffering writer's block and thinking that Darcy will not want to hang out with a \\"guy from the mailroom\\", he plagiarises a report from other publications on the internet. The next day, Darcy, impressed by his writing, presents Gulliver with a new task – to travel to the Bermuda Triangle and write an article about the legends of ships mysteriously disappearing there. Upon arrival in Bermuda, Gulliver rents a boat and travels into the triangle. After falling asleep at the helm of his ship, he's caught in a freak storm and the boat is overwhelmed by a waterspout. He washes up unconscious on the shore of Lilliput, where he is immediately confirmed as a \\"beast\\" by the town's tiny people. After the citizens claim him to be dangerous because of his huge size, he is captured and imprisoned in a cave. Here, he meets another prisoner named Horatio who was jailed by General Edward because he loves Princess Mary of Lilliput, whereas Edward also wants her. After the island across from Lilliput, Blefuscia, infiltrates commandos to kidnap Princess Mary, Gulliver manages to break free of the plough-machine he is forced to work and then rescues the princess from being kidnapped.

News article: 2016 presidential campaign start to accelerate Bush would then have to take down whoever emerges from Iowa and other early states as the top movement conservative, a group that will include Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal and possibly others. There could be three or more Republicans still standing after Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina given fissures between social conservatives and more libertarian-leaning Republicans like Paul. Bush will look to slam the door on all of them in early March when a pile of states, including the governor's native Florida, vote on Super Tuesday. Read MoreWhat to expect from Washington, or NOT, in 2015 To get there, Bush will have to sell early voters on his policies on immigration and education, which could prove challenging. But he will have more than enough money—Bush is in Greenwich, Connecticut, this week raising cash for his newly launched super PAC—to saturate the early state airwaves and then keep rolling when the race goes national. Bush will also bank on the strong desire at the top of the GOP to avoid a long, bruising primary process that would badly damage the party's standard bearer while Clinton is presumably waltzing to the Democratic nomination. And there is no longer much doubt that Bush is getting in the race. He spent the holiday break winding down all his corporate and nonprofit ties. He is also preparing to exit the multiple investment funds he set up over the last several years. He is preparing to release an e-book that will presumably contain the general themes of his campaign. Bush could still have a major change of heart and decide not to get in, but that seems increasingly unlikely. Read MoreLook for Dems to battle for party's future in 2015 Should he make it through the primaries, Bush would likely face off again Hillary Clinton. Clinton won't necessarily have the coronation many expect, given that Iowa activists are already actively pining for a challenger. But outside of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, there is no obvious candidate on the left who could mount a credible challenge to Clinton. Warren still says she is not running and she probably won't. But if she does, she could compete with and even beat Clinton in Iowa. But chances are she could not roll up further victories. She could, however, force Clinton left on economic policy in ways that could make the general election tougher for the former secretary of state and New York senator. While it is true that Clinton was also viewed as inevitable in 2008, it is also true that there is no Barack Obama waiting in the political wings to take her down. So barring a major surprise, the 2016 race will pit Clinton against whoever emerges from a crowded GOP field. At the beginning of 2015, that looks like it could be John Ellis \\"Jeb\\" Bush. But the road from here to the GOP convention balloon drop in the summer of 2016 is a long and perilous one that promises many surprises that could make early prognostications (such as this one) look foolish in retrospect. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are the following: 1. The 2016 presidential campaign is accelerating with Jeb Bush as a potential frontrunner for the Republican nomination. He will need to take down other prominent conservative contenders such as Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, Mike Huckabee, Bobby Jindal, and others in early primary states like Iowa, New Hampshire, and South Carolina. 2. Jeb Bush will focus on winning key states during the Super Tuesday primaries, including his native Florida. To accomplish this, he will need to sell his policies on immigration and education to early voters, which could be challenging. However, his substantial financial backing will allow him to saturate media advertising in the early states and throughout the national campaign. 3.

Diners and revelers chatted happily on the new sprawling wooden deck, and across the darkened river the lights of Tarrytown twinkled. Mike Setteducati, left, who works at the Tappan Zee Marina, and Audrey Maffei Schneider, whose family owns it. Lindsey Stewart and her fiancÃ© were regarded at the marina as near family. One patron approached the restaurantâs owner, Russell Stern, to introduce himself. His name was Jojo K. John, and he was a friend to Lindsey Stewart and Brian Bond, the young, soon-to-be-wed couple who rented an apartment at the same marina that houses Pier 701. Mr. John was with two friends, Mr. Stern said, and they ordered five drinks among them and left. The night would end in one of the most harrowing water crashes that people here can remember: a powerboat driven by Mr. John slammed into a steel barge northeast of the restaurant by the Tappan Zee Bridge, knocking several people aboard unconscious, seriously wounding Mr. Bond, and sending Mr. Bondâs best man, Mark Lennon, and Ms. Stewart, both 30, hurtling into the river. Their bodies were recovered over the weekend. Mr. John was charged with vehicular manslaughter and vehicular assault; the police suspect that alcohol played a role in the accident and are awaiting toxicology reports on his blood. As the investigation continues, and family members prepare to bury their dead â Ms. Stewartâs funeral is scheduled for Thursday and Mr. Lennonâs is Friday â community members and people who knew the deceased are searching hard for where, or whether, to assign blame. On Wednesday, the families of Ms. Stewart and Mr. Lennon said in a statement that Mr. Bond and other survivors reported that those onboard had consumed very little alcohol, and considered themselves sober. The families also questioned why charges were brought against Mr. John ahead of toxicology results. (The Rockland County sheriffâs office said the charges were based on âofficer observation.â) More pointedly, the families said that no one on the boat had seen the barge, even after it was too late. The Coast Guard has said the barge was adequately lighted in line with federal law, with two lights at opposing ends, bright enough to be visible at one nautical mile; more lights were added after the crash. Feelings of shock continue to radiate through the community, starting with owners and workers of the Tappan Zee Marina, where the couple had come to be regarded as near family. For the past three or so years, Ms. Stewart and Mr. Bond, 35, had rented a 1,500-square-foot ground-floor apartment in the craft-style bungalow by the driveway to the marina, along with their Chihuahua, Jackson. They kept the place tidy and cheerful, nurturing houseplants and stringing patio lanterns across the front porch. Audrey Maffei Schneider, whose family has owned the marina for 40 years, reserved deep affection for the pair, especially Ms. Stewart. When repairs were done to their apartment, Ms. Stewart sent thank-you notes. When electricity was finally fully restored many weeks after Hurricane Sandy, she sent Ms. Schneider a gift, thanking her for working so hard. Mr. Bond, a schoolteacher, had gone to high school with two of her sons, Ms. Schneider said in an interview on Tuesday, tightening the connection. Ms. Schneider had also never allowed her tenants to have dogs, but when she met Jackson, she melted: he was as friendly as his owners. Ms. Schneider sometimes inquired whether the couple might leave, especially with the coming wedding, scheduled for Aug. 10. But Ms. Stewart, she said, always assured her they would not. âÂ âWe love it here,âÂ â Ms. Schneider recalled Ms. Stewart saying. âÂ âWe want to have babies here.âÂ â âShe was the kind of woman that appreciated everything,â Ms. Schneider said tearfully. âI used to say I wished she was my daughter.â Ms. Stewart worked as a human resources manager at an insurance company in nearby Nyack, but had also begun work at Pier 701, to make extra money for the wedding. âShe was lovely,â Mr. Stern, the restaurantâs owner, said. It was not immediately clear how Mr. John, 35, knew the couple, though a friend described him to The Associated Press as Mr. Bondâs âother best friend.â His LinkedIn profile says he works as a ârelationship bankerâ at JPMorgan Chase; he had previously faced two drug charges, one for possession of marijuana, which resulted in community service and probation.

Q: Surgical treatments for dystonia have been available since the early 20th century, but have improved in their efficacy to adversity ratio through a combination of technologic advances and better understanding of the role of the basal ganglia in dystonia. The word \\"dystonia\\" describes a phenotype of involuntary movement that may manifest from a variety of conditions. Dystonia may affect only certain regions of the body or may be generalized. It appears to be critical to determine whether the etiology underlying the dystonia is \\"primary\\" (ie, occurring from a genetic or idiopathic origin) or \\"secondary\\" (ie, occurring as a result of structural, metabolic, or neurodegenerative disorders). Secondary dystonias are far more common than primary dystonias. Primary dystonias respond well to pallidotomy or deep brain stimulation of the internal segment of the globus pallidum, whereas secondary dystonias appear to respond partially at best. Limited historic and current data suggest that the thalamus may be a promising target for the treatment of secondary dystonias, but more careful, prospective, randomized studies are needed. Combinations of bilateral targets are possible with the current technology of DBS, but not widely used due to surgical morbidity and expense. This article reviews the surgical treatment of dystonia from past to present, with a focus on separating the outcomes for primary versus secondary and generalized versus cervical dystonia.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? OPT: a). To achieve a chewy cookie when baking, add more bubble gum to your cookie batter.; b). To achieve a chewy cookie when baking, add more fat to your cookie batter.;...I think the answer is","completion":"b). To achieve a chewy cookie when baking, add more fat to your cookie batter. The answer is b) because adding more fat (like butter or shortening) to the cookie batter helps create a chewier texture due to the higher fat content, which influences the structure and moistness of the final baked product. Fats also prevent gluten development and contribute to the tender and moist texture in cookies. The option a) is incorrect because bubble gum is not a suitable ingredient for making chewy cookies, as it is not an ingredient typically used in cookie recipes, and it might introduce unpleasant textures and flavors. Although the term \\"chewy\\" may bring bubble gum to mind, chewy cookies have a specific combination of moistness, tenderness, and mouthfeel that cannot be achieved by simply adding bubble gum to the batter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

They contributed to the development of symphonic rock, and by extension, progressive rock. Their best-known recording is their 1967 hit single \\"A Whiter Shade of Pale\\", which is considered a classic of popular music and is one of the few singles to have sold over 10 million copies. Although noted for its baroque and classical influence, Procol Harum's music also embraces the blues, R&B, and soul. - A power trio is a rock and roll band format having a lineup of guitar, bass and drums, leaving out the second guitar or keyboard that are used in other rock music quartets and quintets to fill out the sound with chords. While one or more band members typically sing, power trios emphasize instrumental performance and overall impact over vocals and lyrics. History. The rise of the power trio in the 1960s was made possible in part by developments in amplifier technology that greatly enhanced the volume of the electric guitar and bass. Particularly, the popularization of the electric bass guitar defined the bottom end and filled in the gaps. Since the amplified bass could also now be louder, the rest of the band could also play at higher volumes, without fear of being unable to hear the bass. This allowed a three-person band to have the same sonic impact as a large band but left far more room for improvisation and creativity, unencumbered by the need for detailed arrangements. As with the organ trio, a 1960s-era soul jazz group centered on the amplified Hammond organ, a three-piece group could fill a large bar or club with a big sound for a much lower price than a large rock and roll band. A power trio, at least in its blues rock incarnation, is also generally held to have developed out of Chicago-style blues bands such as Muddy Waters' trio. - Robin Leonard Trower (born 9 March 1945) is an English rock guitarist and vocalist who achieved success with Procol Harum during the 1960s, and then again as the bandleader of his own power trio. - 20th Century Blues is the fifteenth studio album by Robin Trower . What is the relationship between '20th century blues ' and 'blues rock'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The relationship between '20th Century Blues' and 'blues rock' lies in the fact that '20th Century Blues' is an album by Robin Trower, an English rock guitarist who is known for his work with Procol Harum and as the bandleader of his own power trio. The album, released in 1994, showcases Trower's blues-rock influenced guitar style and songwriting. Blues rock, as a genre, is a fusion of blues and rock music characterized by the use of blues scales, blues-style guitar and strong vocal performances, often incorporating elements of improvisation and extended guitar solos. Throughout his career, Trower has been known for his blues rock style and his unique guitar technique, which stems from his early influences, including blues legends like Muddy Waters and B.B. King. When examining the relationship between Trower's '20th Century Blues' album and the blues rock genre, it is clear that the album serves as an example of Trower's continued dedication to and exploration of the blues rock sound. The album features a variety of songs that exemplify the characteristics of blues rock, such as the use of bluesy riffs, powerful vocals, and intricate, expressive guitar work. In conclusion, the relationship between '20th Century Blues' and 'blues rock' is that the album is a representation of the blues-rock style and sound popularized by artists like Trower and has its roots in traditional blues. As a result, '20th Century Blues' can be seen as an important contribution to the genre and a testament to Trower's enduring influence as a blues-rock guitarist and musician."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Crane fly is a common name referring to any member of the insect family Tipulidae, of the order Diptera, true flies in the superfamily Tipuloidea. Cylindrotominae, Limoniinae, and Pediciinae have been ranked as subfamilies of Tipulidae by most authors, though occasionally elevated to family rank. In the most recent classifications, only Pediciidae is now ranked as a separate family, due to considerations of paraphyly. In colloquial speech, crane flies are sometimes known as mosquito hawks or daddy longlegs, a term also used to describe opiliones or the family Pholcidae, both of which are arachnids. The larvae of crane flies are known commonly as leatherjackets. See options at the end. Can we conclude that is there such a thing as a mosquito hawk? pick from the following. A). no B). yes","completion":"B). yes Crane flies are sometimes known as mosquito hawks in colloquial speech. This nickname can cause confusion, as it could be mistakenly associated with other species that prey on mosquitoes. However, it's important to note that crane flies (Tipulidae) do not actually prey on mosquitoes. They are called mosquito hawks mainly because of their resemblance to large mosquitoes, but they are harmless insects with a different diet and lifecycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet. People visiting the area always stop in Berg village and feel great, but they feel bad and winded once they get to Steep village. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which village is situated closer to sea lever? The answer is:","completion":"Berg village is situated closer to sea level. According to the information provided, Berg village is located at an altitude of 3000 ft above sea level, whereas Steep village is situated at a higher altitude of 8500 ft above sea level. The difference in altitude between the two villages is significant, with Steep village being 5500 ft higher in elevation than Berg village. It is because of this difference in elevation that people visiting the area often experience relief and comfort while stopping at Berg village, which is at a lower, more manageable altitude. In contrast, upon reaching Steep village, which rests at a considerably higher elevation, visitors tend to feel bad and winded. This phenomenon can be attributed to the change in air pressure and lower oxygen levels at higher altitudes, making it more difficult for individuals to breathe comfortably and acclimate to the new environment. In summary, Berg village, with its altitude of 3000 ft above sea level, is situated closer to sea level as compared to Steep village, which is located at a much higher altitude of 8500 ft above sea level. This difference in elevation is responsible for the varying experiences of visitors to these two villages, with those in Berg village enjoying a more comfortable and pleasant experience due to its lower elevation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is an article: The creature scuttled off as a horrified mum and her son called the RSPCA for help A SCORPION “as fast as Usain Bolt” is on the loose in a block of flats – after disappearing into the night when it was spotted by a horrified mum getting ready for bed. Emma Chadwick says she was stunned when she discovered the Emperor scorpion scuttling around her kitchen in Manchester. It’s believed it may have got into the building undiscovered by hiding inside someone’s holiday luggage. Now the Century Buildings caretaker has been warned residents not to approach the creature – which grows to six inches – but to call for help instead. It was almost snared at around 11.30pm on Monday night when a frantic Emma called the concierge. But as the pair attempted to capture it, the scorpion bolted. It might sting if surprised and feels threatened. Emma said: “My son Cyrus was back from university when he came into tell me at about 11.30pm that he saw a scorpion in the kitchen – that’s not something you expect to hear. “We tried to get it, but it was like the Usain Bolt of scorpions and it ran off under the kitchen cupboards before we could get to it. “We were completely stunned and didn’t know what to do so we ended up calling the RSPCA and the police.” But when an RSPCA officer came out the next morning, the scorpion was nowhere to be found. Emma, 45, told the Manchester Evening News: “The brave lady from the RSPCA came and took the skirting boards away but couldn’t find it. “She said there is no nest so hopefully it’s just the one. “We were told to put flour down so they could track it’s movements if it came back out. A letter from the concierge was quickly sent out to residents living in building – warning them not to handle the creature. It reads: “A scorpion has been seen in an apartment in the building. “The RSPCA have attended and have been unable to find the animal. “It is possible that it has left the flat so the following advice has been given by the RSPCA. “The scorpion is about one and a half inches long. It will scurry away if approached and only might sting if surprised and feels threatened. Emperor scorpions live until they are around eight years old. They are a large breed, growing up to six inches long. They are black (with green or brown hues) and are armed with a set of pedipalps – better known as “claws”. Their sting is similar to a bee sting in that it is painful, but medical attention is not usually necessary. They are known for pinching people with their pedipalps too – and this is also quite painful. Because of this, it is advised not to handle them. In the wild, scorpions eat a variety of invertebrates (insects, other arthropods) and vertebrates including small lizards. In captivity, they usually eat crickets, mixed with other insects including mealworms and moths. When scorpions breed, the young are called Scorplings. The gestation period can last from 7 to 9 months to double that much and there are normally around 12-30 young born at a time. “The RSPCA officer believes it will have entered the building in somebody’s holiday luggage.” Residents are being warned not to handle the scorpion if found but should instead cover it with a tub and contact the RSPCA on 0300 1234 999. Anyone stung by the creature should seek immediate medical advice. We pay for your stories! Do you have a story for The Sun Online news team?

Hey kids! Today, we're going to learn about an amazing event in the world of sports. Who do you think made the longest touchdown in football history? 🏈 Once upon a time, there was a very talented football player named Tony Dorsett. Tony played for the Dallas Cowboys, a popular football team. In a game on January 3, 1983, Tony did something that no one had ever done before! 😮 In this game against the Minnesota Vikings, Tony Dorsett ran the entire length of the football field and scored a touchdown. That's 99 yards! Can you imagine running that far, all while holding a ball and avoiding being tackled by the other team? It must have taken a lot of skill and energy. 💪 If you're wondering how a football field looks like, it's a big rectangle with two big goalposts at each end. The whole field is 120 yards long, including the end zones, which are 10 yards deep. That's around the same length as 30 cars lined up bumper to bumper! 🚗 Tony's record-breaking touchdown is still the longest in NFL history, and he's remembered as one of the best football players ever. Though it happened quite some time ago, people still talk about it today. Tony Dorsett showed us that with hard work and determination, you can accomplish amazing things! 🌟 So kids, next time you play football with your friends or watch a game on TV, remember the story of Tony and his incredible 99-yard touchdown.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I can use this background: The Table above includes the ideal mechanical advantage of each class of lever. The mechanical advantage is the factor by which a machine changes the input force. The ideal mechanical advantage is the increase or decrease in force that would occur if there were no friction to overcome in the use of the machine. Because all machines must overcome some friction, the ideal mechanical advantage is always somewhat greater than the actual mechanical advantage of the machine as it is used in the real world. Now, I have a new situation: John designed a hypothetical lever that would have ideal mechanical advantage. He labeled the lever as lever A. He then wanted to compare this lever with a real world lever, which he labeled as lever B. He intended to use these levers to increase force. Answer this question please: Which lever would produce greater increase in force, lever A or lever B? A:","completion":"In the given situation, lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage, which means that it is a hypothetical lever without any friction to overcome. Lever B is a real-world lever with friction and other factors that contribute to its actual mechanical advantage. In order to answer the question of which lever would produce a greater increase in force, we need to compare their mechanical advantages. Lever A has an ideal mechanical advantage – if there were no friction and other losses, it would increase the input force by its full mechanical advantage. This means that lever A would provide a perfect conversion of its input force into an amplified output force, with no losses due to friction. In an ideal world, with no limitations or imperfections, lever A would be the best possible choice to maximize input force. On the other hand, lever B represents a real-world lever with friction and other imperfections that cause energy losses and reduce its mechanical advantage. In practice, this means that even though lever B might have a high mechanical advantage, it will not be able to increase the input force by the full amount of its theoretical mechanical advantage. The actual mechanical advantage of lever B will always be lower than its ideal mechanical advantage due to these real-world limitations. Considering the properties of both levers, lever A, with its ideal mechanical advantage, would produce a greater increase in force compared to lever B. This is because lever A operates without any losses due to friction, providing a perfect amplification of the input force, while lever B has energy losses that detract from its ability to increase force effectively. In reality, however, it's important to note that an ideal lever like lever A doesn't exist, and we must work with real-world levers that have inherent imperfections and limitations. Nonetheless, in a hypothetical comparison, lever A would indeed produce a greater increase in force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

SEOUL — North Korea’s sudden threat to pull out of the upcoming summit with the U.S. raises new doubts of whether a denuclearization deal is possible. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un agreed to meet with U.S President Donald Trump in Singapore on June 12 to work out an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program in exchange for security guarantees and an end to punishing international sanctions. But on Wednesday North Korea’s Vice Foreign Minister Kim Kye Kwan released a statement through the state-run KCNA news agency that criticized “unbridled remarks” made specifically by the U.S. president’s National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding that Pyongyang completely decommission its entire nuclear arsenal, along with its ballistic missile program and chemical weapons stockpile, before receiving any compensation or concessions. He expressed “indignation” at the U.S uncompromising position and said North Korea might pull out of the Trump-Kim summit, unless the Trump administration acts with “sincerity” to improve relations through dialogue. “If the United States is trying to drive us into a corner to force our unilateral nuclear abandonment, we will no longer be interested in such dialogue and cannot but reconsider our proceeding to the North Korea-U.S. summit,” the statement said. The vice foreign minister also said it was “absolutely absurd” that Bolton would compare Libya’s experience dismantling its relatively rudimentary nuclear program as a model for dealing with the North’s more advanced and expansive capabilities. He also denounced the Trump administration for “miscalculating the magnanimity” of Kim Jong Un’s decision to suspend further nuclear and missile tests, and his willingness to engage in nuclear talks, as “signs of weakness,” that were the result of what the U.S. administration has dubbed its “maximum pressure” campaign that led international efforts to impose punishing sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade.

However, I would require more specific details about the producer(s) you would want me to focus on or provide information about. There are various types of producers across industries, such as music, film, television, and products, and each has a distinct role and responsibilities. To cover various types of producers, I will provide an overview of some of the most common producer roles in different industries: 1. Film and Television Producers: In the film and television industry, a producer's primary responsibility is to oversee and manage the entire production process, from the inception of a project to its distribution and beyond. They are involved in various aspects of production, including script development, budgeting, casting, hiring crew members, managing schedules, and ensuring that the final product meets the expectations of both the creatives and the investors. Some notable film and television producers include Steven Spielberg, J.J. Abrams, and Shonda Rhimes. 2. Music Producers: A music producer's main role is to work with artists, songwriters, and musicians to create a cohesive and high-quality musical product. They are responsible for supervising the recording process, arranging composition, selecting the right instruments and sounds, and sometimes even contributing to the writing and arranging of the music itself. From working in the recording studio to offering guidance on the creative direction of an album or single, a music producer's job can be multifaceted and highly influential in shaping an artist's sound. Some well-known music producers are Quincy Jones, Dr. Dre, and Max Martin. 3. Consumer Goods Producers: In the manufacturing and consumer goods sector, producers are responsible for creating, developing, and manufacturing products that appeal to their target consumers. This can include everything from designing and engineering the product to overseeing its manufacturing, ensuring quality control, and coordinating with marketing teams to promote the final product. Examples of major consumer goods producers include Procter & Gamble, Unilever, and Nestlé. 4. Agriculture Producers: Agriculture producers, also known as farmers, are responsible for growing and managing the crops, livestock, and other commodities that feed and supply the world's population. They must manage and maintain their land, invest in various technologies and equipment, and keep up with the latest trends and advancements in agricultural practices. Agriculture producers can range from small-scale, family-run farms to large multinational corporations involved in different aspects of farming, processing, and distribution. Please remember that in order to provide more detailed, accurate, and relevant information about the producer(s) of your interest, it would be helpful to have more specific details about them or their industries."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It helps chromosomes will be separated from each other Add punctuation","completion":"Chromosomes play a crucial role in cell division, particularly during the process of mitosis and meiosis. They ensure that the genetic information, which is essential for the growth, development, and reproduction of organisms, is accurately passed on to the daughter cells. The proper separation of chromosomes is critical for the successful transmission of genetic material from one generation to the next, as well as for maintaining genetic stability within a population. The cell cycle consists of several stages, including interphase, prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase, and cytokinesis. During interphase, the chromosomes are duplicated, resulting in the formation of sister chromatids. These sister chromatids are identical copies of each other, containing the same genetic information. As the cell prepares for division, it enters the prophase stage. During prophase, the chromosomes begin to condense, becoming visible under a microscope as distinct structures. The nuclear envelope starts to break down, and microtubule spindle fibers begin to form. In the metaphase stage, the chromosomes line up at the equator of the cell, attaching to the spindle fibers at their centromere region. This alignment ensures that the sister chromatids will be properly separated from each other in the next stage, anaphase. Importantly, during metaphase, each sister chromatid will attach to the spindle fibers independently, and the spindle fibers of opposite poles will ensure the equal distribution of chromosomes to each daughter cell. During anaphase, the sister chromatids are pulled apart from each other, moving to the opposite poles of the cell. This movement is facilitated by the spindle fibers shortening and pulling the chromatids towards the poles. Ensuring that all chromosomes are properly separated is essential for avoiding the formation of aneuploid daughter cells, whereby a cell has an abnormal number of chromosomes. Aneuploidy can lead to severe developmental problems and genetic disorders. As the chromosomes reach their respective poles, the cell moves into the telophase stage. In this phase, the nuclear envelope reforms, and the chromosomes decondense, returning to their relaxed state. The spindle fibers disassemble as the cell prepares for the final stage of division. In cytokinesis, the cell divides its cytoplasm and organelles, ultimately creating two daughter cells, which are genetically identical to the original parent cell. Without the proper separation of chromosomes during an earlier stage of cell division, the daughter cells would not receive the correct genetic information, leading to numerous potential issues. Accurate chromosome separation is, therefore, critical for the survival and propagation of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Measured in terms of sales per square foot, it is the highest grossing mall in the United States. Hypothesis: The Forum Shops at Caesars has the highest gross income.","completion":"Given the context, we cannot definitively draw the hypothesis that \\"The Forum Shops at Caesars has the highest gross income.\\" While the context states that it is the highest grossing mall in the United States in terms of sales per square foot, it does not confirm that this translates into having the highest gross income overall. This interpretation involves considering the meaning of \\"grossing\\" and \\"income\\" and how they relate to each other. Grossing could refer to the gross amount of revenue generated before subtracting overheads, operating expenses, depreciation, and taxes. On the other hand, income typically implies net revenue that remains after all expenses and overheads are subtracted. Moreover, sales per sq ft is a productivity metric, not a measure of absolute revenue. Even if The Forum Shops at Caesars makes the most money for its size, a larger mall could still generate higher overall revenue. For these reasons, despite the specified sales per square foot achievement, we cannot conclusively accept the hypothesis that The Forum Shops at Caesars has the highest gross income without more encompassing financial data."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. A friend asked me to answer this question: What territories were not conquered by the Spanish?, using the article: Christopher Columbus discovered the Americas for the Kingdom of Castile and León in 1492. By 1580 this had unified with neighbouring kingdoms to form one Spanish kingdom. Private adventurers thereafter entered into contracts with the Spanish Crown to conquer the newly discovered lands in return for tax revenues and the power to rule. In the first decades after the discovery, the Spanish colonised the Caribbean and established a centre of operations on the island of Cuba. They heard rumours of the rich empire of the Aztecs on the mainland to the west and, in 1519, Hernán Cortés set sail with eleven ships to explore the Mexican coast. By August 1521 the Aztec capital of Tenochtitlan had fallen to the Spanish. Within three years of the fall of Tenochtitlan the Spanish had conquered a large part of Mexico, extending as far south as the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. The newly conquered territory became New Spain, headed by a viceroy who answered to the Spanish Crown via the Council of the Indies. Cortés despatched Pedro de Alvarado with an army to conquer the Mesoamerican kingdoms of the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighbouring Pacific plain; the military phase of the establishment of the Spanish colony of Guatemala lasted from 1524 to 1541. The Captaincy General of Guatemala had its capital at Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala and covered a wide territory that also included the Mexican state of Chiapas as well as El Salvador, Honduras and Costa Rica. The Spanish imposed colonial rule over Yucatán between 1527 and 1546, and over Verapaz from the 16th to the 17th centuries, leaving the area between – essentially Petén and much of Belize – independent long after surrounding peoples had been subjugated., what would be the answer ? A:","completion":"From the information provided in the article, it states that most of the vast territories in the Americas were conquered by the Spanish; this includes the Caribbean, large parts of Mexico extending down to the Isthmian of Tehuantepec, the Mesoamerican kingdoms in the Guatemalan Sierra Madre and neighboring Pacific plain, the Mexican state of Chiapas, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, the Yucatan, and Verapaz. This significant geographical representation indicates a strong influence and control by the Spanish over these areas from the 16th to 17th centuries. However, when exploring the question of territories that were not conquered by the Spanish, information is explicitly mentioned about the area encompassing Petén and much of Belize. These regions had retained their independence significantly after most of their neighboring territories had been subjugated by Spanish rule. Moreover, one must consider that other regions in the Americas were not under Spanish control. The Spanish kingdom did not succeed in conquering the entirety of the Americas. The North of the continent – the areas that are now Canada and much of the United States were not colonized by Spain, but rather primarily by England and France. Another critical region not under Spanish colonization were parts of Brazil, which were colonized by Portugal as per the Treaty of Tordesillas in 1494. Outside the Americas, it's also important to note the many regions on other continents that were not conquered by the Spanish, such as large parts of Africa, most of Asia and the South Pacific, the Middle East, and most of Europe. As such, while the Spanish kingdom in the 16th to 17th centuries was a major global power with a significant reach, the scope of territories it held did not span the entirety of the globe or even the whole of the Americas."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Steven Ellison (born October 7, 1983), known by his stage name Flying Lotus or sometimes FlyLo, is an experimental multi-genre music producer, electronic musician, DJ, filmmaker, and rapper from Los Angeles, California. Flying Lotus has released five studio albums--1983 (2006), Los Angeles (2008), Cosmogramma (2010), Until the Quiet Comes (2012) and You're Dead! (2014)--to critical acclaim. Context: At his mother's house, Ellison saw an advertisement on Adult Swim/Cartoon Network asking for song submissions. He sent some in, under the name Flying Lotus (a moniker inspired by lucid dreaming) and was accepted. Around this time, he was interning at the pioneering hip hop label Stones Throw Records. Days were spent in their offices, and nights were spent at his grandmothers, working on the music that would become his debut album: 1983. The record (released on LA indie label Plug Research) was an early touchstone for Ellison's eclectic creative mission, forging compressed, spacey and Eastern sounding hip-hop beats, that summoned Madlib as much as Dntel, while sampling as far back as 70s Japanese proto-synthpop and 60s jazz harp. It would also feature Laura Darlington, who went on to become a vocal fixture of future albums. In 2006, Ellison participated in that year's annual Red Bull Music Academy, which took place in Melbourne, Australia. In 2007, he announced on CSU-Fullerton's Titan Radio that he signed with Warp Records (home to Prefuse 73, Autechre, Boards of Canada, and Aphex Twin). Following his Warp debut, the six-track Reset EP, he quickly became one of the label's cornerstone artists and released his second studio album, titled Los Angeles, on June 10, 2008. His first release on Warp, Reset EP, gave his new audience a taste of the steady grooves and darker breaks that had earned him the move. As Ellison's profile rose, he decided to commandeer the limelight by launching his own label, Brainfeeder, to house his friends (Samiyam, Ras G, etc.) and unite a large section of the LA beat scene under one label.

Located approximately 3.5 kilometres (2.2 mi) south-west of the city, Yarralumla extends along the south-west bank of Lake Burley Griffin. (The lake was created after the Second World War through the blocking, with a dam, of the Molonglo River.) In 1828, Henry Donnison, a Sydney merchant, was granted a lease on the western side of Stirling Ridge. Donnison's land was named Yarralumla in a survey of the area conducted in 1834, apparently after the indigenous people's term for the area. It was also spelt Yarrolumla in other documents. In 1881, the estate was bought by Frederick Campbell, grandson of Robert Campbell who built nearby \\"Duntroon\\". He completed the construction of a large, gabled, brick house on his property in 1891 that now serves as the site of Government House, the official residence of the Governor-General of Australia. Campbell's house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead, the main portions of which were erected from local stone in the 1830s. Among the old Yarralumla homestead's most notable occupants were Sir Terence Aubrey Murray, who owned Yarralumla sheep station from 1837 to 1859, Augustus Onslow Manby Gibbes, who owned the property from 1859 to 1881, and Augustus' father Colonel John George Nathaniel Gibbes (1787–1873). (Augustus \\"Gussie\\" Gibbes was Murray's brother-in-law; he also advanced money to Frederick Campbell to assist with the construction, in 1890–1891, of Campbell's grand new family house at Yarralumla.) The modern suburb of Yarralumla was gazetted by the government in 1928 and as of 2011 was home to approximately 3,000 people and many diplomatic missions. In recent years, it has become one of Canberra's most desirable and expensive residential suburbs because of its wide leafy streets, attractive lakeside setting and central location. answer the following question: What is the first name of the person whose house replaced an elegant, Georgian-style homestead?

Your task is to classify whether the given answer is correct or not by providing \\"Yes\\" or \\"No\\", based on the article. Input: Article: Growing up in town, I classified myself as a \\"city girl.\\" I had very little knowledge about farming and rural areas, but all of that changed six years ago when my mother and stepfather married and we moved to my stepfather's farm. Surrounded by cows and cornfields, I was unsure of what to do. However, I did enjoy the beauty and peace of the countryside. On the farm, I helped with odd jobs like feeding cows. When I was old enough to get a real summer job, my step-father said I could choose between two options--getting a job at our local Dairy Queen or selling produce that I grew on our farm. While I came up with a short list of pros for working at the fast food restaurant, I found more advantages to selling produce. Yet I realized the numerous disadvantages to selling produce: responsibility for the success or failure of the operation, early mornings, and long days. At last, I decided to start my own farming business. My stepfather and I began planning in March. Together we chose three varieties of seeds, prepared the land, and planted the first batch of sweet corn at the end of April. Throughout the spring, my stepfather continued to plant sweet corn every two weeks as I rode in the tractor with him. The sweet corn needs taking great care while growing. As the corn was putting forth ears, we applied fertilizer and sprayed pesticide to prevent worms. I watched them grow taller and taller, dreaming about the money I would soon make. We planned to harvest and sell the corn at our local farmer's market. It sounded easy and looked good on paper, but it worked out a little differently. Nonstop rain delayed the harvest by a week or so. When my sweet corn was finally ready to pick, I found that a pack of raccoons had visited the field at night, ruining about half of it. We picked what was still good and prepared for market. This was it--my first day at market! I was excited to see my hard work finally pay off. I loaded my materials into the pickup truck and arrived early at the farmer's market to find a good spot. There were many customers and several other tradesmen. Probably because I was young and new, potential customers would look at me and smile, then head straight to my competitor, Mrs Cates, who had been in the market for years and had an established following. At the end of the first day, about half of my corn was left, so I donated it to a local homeless shelter and went home disappointed. Soon I noticed that Mrs Cates and her crew did not arrive at the farmer's market until about 11 am. So I decided to show up an hour earlier. This meant that we had to start picking corn at 6 am, no easy task with teenage workers. But the effort paid off; I was selling half of my corn before Mrs Cates arrived and most of it by the end of the day. Although the farmer's market was only open three days a week, the corn needed to be picked and sold daily because it would not keep. On days the farmer's market was not open, I developed a marketing plan that included sending e-mails to family and friends. I also went to local businesses to sell corn and distribute business cards. Customers began calling, and I took orders over the phone. Before I knew it, I had a loyal following. I stayed busy by making weekly and sometimes daily deliveries to these businesses while maintaining my produce stand at the farmer's market. Then something wonderful happened. I had made more money than any of my friends with typical teenage jobs. I feel a sense of accomplishment when I see people buy produce from me. Question: After the author settled down on the farm .

Title: Fahrenheit 9/11 Movie plot: The movie begins by suggesting that friends and political allies of George W. Bush at Fox News Channel tilted the election of 2000 by prematurely declaring Bush the winner. It then suggests the handling of the voting controversy in Florida constituted election fraud. The film then segues into the September 11 attacks. Moore says Bush was informed of the first plane hitting the World Trade Center on his way to an elementary school. Bush is then shown sitting in a Florida classroom with children. When told that a second plane has hit the World Trade Center and that the nation is \\"under attack\\", Bush allows the students to finish their book reading, and Moore notes that he continued reading for nearly seven minutes. Moore then discusses the complex relationships between the U.S. government and the Bush family; and between the bin Laden family, the Saudi Arabian government, and the Taliban, which span over three decades. Moore alleges that the United States government evacuated 24 members of the bin Laden family on a secret flight shortly after the attacks, without subjecting them to any form of interrogation. Moore moves on to examine George W. Bush's Air National Guard service record. Moore contends that Bush's dry-hole oil well attempts were partially funded by the Saudis and by the bin Laden family through the intermediary of James R. Bath. Moore alleges that these conflicts of interest suggest that the Bush administration does not serve the interests of Americans. The movie continues by suggesting ulterior motives for the War in Afghanistan, including a natural gas pipeline through Afghanistan to the Indian Ocean. Moore alleges that the Bush administration induced a climate of fear among the American population through the mass media. Moore then describes purported anti-terror efforts, including government infiltration of pacifist groups and other events, and the signing of the USA PATRIOT Act.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: 7. Every a llegation is a political fact. Hypothesis: Every allegation is a political fact. Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first understand the concepts involved and the logical structure of the relations between them. Let's begin by defining the terms: 1. Premise: A statement or assumption that forms the basis of an argument or reasoning. 2. Allegation: A claim or assertion that someone has done something illegal or wrong, typically without proof. 3. Political Fact: A fact or piece of information that is directly related to politics or the activities related to the governance of a country or area, especially the debate among individuals or parties having or seeking power. Now, let's examine the premise and the hypothesis: Premise: Every allegation is a political fact. Hypothesis: Every allegation is a political fact. Both the premise and the hypothesis are asserting the same idea: that any claim or assertion of wrongdoing or illegality (an allegation) is directly related to politics or the activities related to governance (a political fact). In other words, the hypothesis is simply a restatement of the premise. Therefore, one could argue that the premise does entail the hypothesis, as they are effectively identical statements. However, it is important to consider the validity and soundness of this premise as well. The premise assumes that every allegation is inherently connected to political matters. It is important to note that this is a generalization that might not hold true in all cases. Allegations of wrongdoing can arise in various contexts that have nothing to do with politics, such as personal disputes or conflicts within a business or organization. In these cases, the allegation would not be a political fact. Thus, while the premise does entail the hypothesis (given that they are the same statement), the assertion that every allegation is a political fact is not universally true. It is a generalization that may hold true in some cases but overlooks the fact that allegations can arise in a wide variety of contexts that are not directly connected to politics or governance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Items are collected - The items are sorted - Trash is removed from everything else - Goes to a landfill - The items go into a baler machine for each kind of material - They come out as bales - The bales are shipped to manufacturers to use to make products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more waste is generated happens, how will it affect fewer items are sorted. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If more waste is generated, it can have several effects on the overall waste management process, including the sorting of items. An increase in waste generation may be attributed to a growing population, consumerism, or a lack of waste reduction initiatives. This perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the process, as outlined below: 1. Increased workload on waste collection and sorting facilities: As more waste is generated, it can lead to a greater workload for waste collection and sorting facilities. This can result in a higher demand for resources such as labor, equipment, and space to accommodate and manage the increased waste volumes efficiently. In such cases, it is possible that fewer items may be sorted appropriately due to time and resource constraints, leading to inefficiencies in the waste management process. 2. Higher likelihood of contamination: An increase in waste generation could also lead to a higher likelihood of contamination during the sorting process. This is because more waste materials may be improperly sorted or accidentally mixed with other items. Such contamination can make it more challenging to separate and process the different materials, leading to more waste being sent to landfills instead of being recycled or repurposed. 3. Strain on landfill capacities: With a higher waste generation rate and potentially fewer items being sorted and recycled, more waste may be directed towards landfills. This could lead to overburdened landfill sites, causing environmental and ecological concerns. Additionally, this could also result in the need to develop new landfills in order to cope with the waste influx, leading to land use conflicts and other environmental issues. 4. Increased costs for waste management: The increase in waste generation, coupled with the potential decrease in the efficiency of sorting processes, can lead to increased costs for waste management. This can impact local governments and waste service providers, who must allocate more resources to effectively manage the waste. Ultimately, these increased costs may be passed on to consumers and taxpayers. 5. Indirect environmental, social, and economic impacts: An increase in waste generation can also have indirect effects on the environment, society, and economy. For instance, more waste in landfills can lead to an increase in harmful greenhouse gas emissions, as well as groundwater and soil contamination. Furthermore, less efficient sorting and recycling processes can result in a higher demand for raw materials and natural resources, putting more strain on the environment and possibly affecting global trade and local economies. In conclusion, the perturbation of increased waste generation can directly and indirectly affect the waste management process, including the sorting of items. Ensuring that waste management facilities and processes are as efficient as possible, along with implementing waste reduction and recycling initiatives, is crucial for mitigating these negative effects and promoting a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Royal assent is sometimes associated with elaborate ceremonies. In the United Kingdom, for instance, the sovereign may appear personally in the House of Lords or may appoint Lords Commissioners, who announce that royal assent has been granted at a ceremony held at the Palace of Westminster. However, royal assent is usually granted less ceremonially by letters patent. In other nations, such as Australia, the governor-general merely signs the bill. In Canada, the governor general may give assent either in person at a ceremony held in the Senate or by a written declaration notifying parliament of his or her agreement to the bill. Royal assent is the method by which a country's constitutional monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament, thus making it a law or letting it be promulgated as law. In the vast majority of contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their ruler to withhold the royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century. 1.

L.A.'s Body Traffic wins 25,000 Joyce Theater Foundation grant In flagrant disregard of its own name, Body Traffic, the Los Angeles contemporary dance company, is racing ahead, as though on a congestion-free commute across the Santa Monica Freeway. The 4-year-old troupe has just been awarded a 25,000 “commissioning grant” from the New York City-based Joyce Theater Foundation. Let’s shift to reverse gear, and back this story up. Last January, Body Traffic’s close collaborator, choreographer Barak Marshall, in tandem with the dancers, garnered first prize in “The A.W.A.R.D. Show,” co-produced by the Joyce and REDCAT. The 10,000 prize got earmarked for a new Marshall-Body Traffic collaboration. The Joyce is now doubling down on the Traffickers, extending an additional 25,000 to underwrite Marshall’s piece. It will premiere June 5-6, during Body Traffic’s two-night stint at the Joyce Theater’s annual Gotham Dance Festival. Body Traffic represents the dance company of the future, according to the Joyce. The theater’s executive director, Linda Shelton, said by phone from New York: “We are a bit concerned by the model of the single artistic director company. In many, many cases it’s absolutely fine, but we see cracks in the model.” “Two years ago, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation invited us to apply for a generous grant. We put a restriction on ourselves that we were only going to work with repertory companies.” What Shelton suggests is a shift in paradigm for American modern dance. The whole ballgame has been boutique dance companies fostering the proprietary vision of a single choreographer. (Hubbard Street Dance of Chicago, Utah's Repertory Dance Theatre and Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater are notable exceptions.) “We’ve been studying how theater is made,” Shelton said. “You have a producer, or a director, putting together a collaborative team; you have many, many opportunities to say it’s not working out. Or, if there is no market interest or demand, you can change gears. In dance, work is usually made in isolation without feedback in the process. “With very limited resources the pressure [on single choreographers] is enormous. It’s unrealistic to assume one choreographer can do that year in and year out.” Body Traffic co-director Tina Berkett, a native New Yorker, is pleased by the Joyce commission. “In a way, wow, we did it, we did what we set out to accomplish [since launching the company in 2007]. We have a thriving dance company so much so that we can go to New York City and perform at this theater.” Co-director Lillian Barbeito, a Juilliard graduate, added: “I am especially thrilled to work with Barak; it’s a culmination of a relationship that has been developed over years. He is one of the most distinctive choreographers working today.” Other works planned for the company’s New York debut include a premiere from a William Forsythe protégé, choreographer Richard Siegal, an American working in Europe who makes highly fluid, musical works. Belgian dance maker Stijn Celis’ “Fragile Dwellings,” inspired by Los Angeles homelessness, which premiered at the Luckman Theatre last spring, will round out the program.

Both women are attracted to Jimmy, a tormented young man who is still in love with his estranged wife Elinor. Back in New York, Bubbles finds work in a burlesque club, while Madame Basilova, the girls' teacher and manager, arranges an audition for Judy with ballet impresario Steve Adams. En route to the audition, Madame Basilova is run over by a car and killed, and Judy, intimidated by the other dancers, flees before she can meet Steve. As she leaves the building, Judy shares an elevator with Steve, who offers her a cab ride, but she is unaware of who he is and rejects his offer. Soon after, Bubbles, now called Tiger Lily the burlesque queen, offers Judy a job as her stooge in the Bailey Brothers burlesque show and, desperate, she accepts. One night, both Jimmy and Steve attend the performance, and Judy leaves with Jimmy and tears up the card that Steve left for her.

Article: Jack Andraka from Maryland won the grand prize at the 2012 Intel International Science and Engineering Fair. It is the largest high school science competition in the world. The Maryland teenager is the youngest winner of the 75,000 prize. He was chosen from among 1,500 students in 70 countries. Jack Andraka invented a test for pancreatic cancer . He started to learn it after losing a close family friend to the disease. \\"I went on the Internet and I found that 85%of all pancreatic cancers are found late, when someone has less than 2% chance of survival , \\" he says, \\"and I was thinking,' That's not right. We should be able to do something.'\\" He found that early discovery is important to increasing the chances of surviving the disease. The Maryland teenager asked to work in a laboratory at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and was allowed. There he developed a simple paper test, which can recognize the disease in a single drop of blood. His test has proved correct 90% of the time. It also is 100 times more sensitive than other tests. \\"It costs 3 cents per test, and then it takes only 5 minutes to run,\\" he said. Jack's success wouldn't have been possible without Anirban Maitra, a professor at Johns Hopkins. He was the only person among the 200 researchers Jack wrote to who showed interest in his project. \\"I was very surprised that this was a 15-year-old who was writing this. I wanted to meet this clever young man and see what he wanted to talk about and so I called him over for an interview . \\" Jack worked in Professor Maitra's laboratory, completing his project in 7 months. The government has given the Maryland teenager patent rights to the pancreatic cancer test. He is now talking with companies about developing the test into a simple product. Whatever happens, the professor believes Jack Andraka's name is one we will be hearing again over the next 10 to 20 years. Question: What's the best title for the text?

Family rang RSPCA because they could not reach the clearly injured bird. They, in turn, called fire crew, but they were unable to get to the seagull. Asked colleagues in Chertsey to come and help with their high-rise ladder. Nearly three hours later bird was brought down and handed to the RSPCA. But vet said it had to be destroyed due to leg injury and suspected botulism. Article:","completion":"Title: Heroic Rescue Efforts: A Community Comes Together to Save an Injured Seagull A heartwarming story of camaraderie and concern for wildlife unfolded in Easher, Surrey when a distressed family discovered an injured seagull trapped on the roof of their three-storey house. Despite everyone's best efforts, the story took a tragic turn when the bird, finally rescued after hours of effort, ultimately had to be euthanized due to the severity of its injuries. The plight of the seagull came to light when the concerned family, unable to reach the bird themselves, decided to contact the RSPCA for assistance. It was clear to all involved that the seagull was in pain, and time was of the essence, so the RSPCA swiftly called upon local fire crew to intervene. Unfortunately, the crew members quickly realized they would not be able to reach the seagull with the equipment and resources they had at their disposal. Undeterred, and determined to help the injured bird, the fire crew contacted their colleagues in Chertsey, urgently requesting assistance from a crew equipped with a high-rise ladder. There was a palpable sense of relief in the air as the Chertsey team made their way to the scene, but it would be several more hours before the seagull could be safely rescued from its perilous perch. The community waited with anticipation and concern as the highly-trained professionals from Chertsey arrived at the scene in Easher. Over the next three hours, onlookers and rescuers worked together, maintaining constant communication and offering encouragement, as the seagull's well-being remained the top priority. Eventually, the firefighters and RSPCA officers were able to celebrate victory together. After the painstaking and intricate three-hours-long operation, the seagull was brought down from the roof and handed over to the RSPCA officers. Sighs of relief and expressions of gratitude were exchanged among the team, as well as the family and bystanders present at the scene. Sadly, the triumphant atmosphere did not last long. Upon close examination of the seagull by a veterinarian, it was discovered that the bird had sustained a severe leg injury, and was also suspected of having botulism. Due to the extent of its injuries and the poor prognosis for recovery, the difficult decision was made to euthanize the seagull. Even though the story ended in heartbreak, the events in Easher, Surrey should not be forgotten. They serve as a reminder of the importance of community, cooperation, and empathy for all living beings. The efforts made by the family, the RSPCA, and the fire crews from Easher and Chertsey showed that, when we come together to help those in need, we can overcome even the most complex challenges. In the end, the rescue efforts for the injured seagull transcended the ultimate outcome and shone a light on the importance of compassion and collaboration. It is a tale that resonates with the indomitable human spirit and the lengths to which we will go in order to make our world, and the lives of those within it, a little bit better."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write an article based on this summary: – In announcing yesterday that it planned to do away with \\"draconian\\" mandatory minimum sentences for low-level drug offenders, the Justice Department is righting an injustice, right? As Eric Holder explained it, \\"Too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long, and for no truly good law enforcement reason.\\" That may be so, writes Brad Plumer for the Washington Post's Wonkblog, but he does the math and comes up with a second reason for the move: the \\"serious strain\\" the prison population is putting on the DOJ's budget. Plumer writes that the housing and care of our more than 218,000 federal inmates led to a 6.9 billion request for the Bureau of Prisons for fiscal 2013. At the current pace of growth, prisons will eat up 30% of the DOJ's budget by just 2020, per an Urban Institute report. This will suck money away from \\"other key Justice Department priorities\\" (think federal investigators), programs that the Urban Institute thinks \\"do far more for public safety than prisons.\\" And the drug change makes sense, writes Plumer, because the report attributes 32% of federal prison population growth to longer drug-related sentences. But there's a caveat in all this, notes Plumber: 86.1% of all prisoners are state-level, not federal, inmates. \\"Really large-scale reform would require new policies from state legislatures around the country.\\" Click for his full piece. Article:","completion":"Once upon a time, the Justice Department announced they wanted to remove some really strict rules about how long people have to stay in jail for small mistakes related to drugs. They said it wasn't fair because many people stayed in jail for too long, and it didn't help the police do their job better. A writer named Brad Plumer agrees, but he also thinks there is another reason: too many people in jail are making things very expensive. You see, taking care of all those people in jail costs a lot of money. In 2013, they needed 6.9 billion! That's a really big number! If things keep going like this, by the year 2020, almost 1/3 of the Justice Department's money will go just to caring for people in jail. That means there won't be enough money for other important jobs the Justice Department needs to do, like helping the police catch bad guys. The new idea to change how long people stay in jail for drug problems makes sense because a lot of people end up staying in jail longer just for that reason. But there is one problem: most people in jail are in state-level jails, not federal ones. So, for this new idea to work even better, we would need all the different states in our country to change their rules too. And that's the story of why the Justice Department wants to change how long people stay in jail for small drug problems. Not only is it about fairness, but it's also about being smart with money and making sure we have enough to keep our communities safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Possible answers: angry, happy, annoyed Answer:","completion":"Carson would likely feel happy after giving a book to his son and watching him read it. While it is not possible to predict human emotions with absolute certainty, this answer is provided based on the context and the potential emotional responses associated with the given actions. In this situation, the action of giving a book to his son is a clear indication that Carson wants to share something with his child, presumably a piece of literature or knowledge that holds significance or value to him. Parents often try to instill in their children the love for reading and learning, attempting to imbue them with an appreciation for literature, an essential life skill or simply a means of bonding. As such, witnessing his son's engagement with the gifted book would likely bring about a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, making Carson feel happy. Moreover, observing his son read the book may also evoke a sense of pride in Carson, as it may reflect his child's intellectual curiosity, discipline, or focus. These qualities are generally perceived as positive, and parents desire to see their offspring grow and develop these attributes. Therefore, Carson would likely derive happiness from the fact that his efforts in providing a conducive environment for his son's growth and development are seemingly paying off. While certainly no human emotion can be predicted with 100% accuracy, we can discern that the other two proposed emotions, angry and annoyed, would seem rather contradictory in this context. Carson has willingly given the book to his son, indicating a desire to share the content, and there is no suggestion of any negative response or outcome from the child's reading. Had there been a conflict or disapproval rooted in the choice of book or a negative reaction from the child, the emotions of anger or annoyance could be reasonable possibilities.

Article: Saturday 28 April, 2001: Dennis Tito was setting off on his holiday. Mr. Tito's journey was certainly unusual! So was the transport he chose, and the price of his trip. The 60-year-old multi-millionaire from New York was sitting on board a Russian spaceship. He was on a journey to the International Space Station. It might have been a routine trip for the two astronauts who were traveling with him, but for him it was certainly no ordinary journey. Dennis Tito was the first tourist ever in space, and he had paid the sum of 20 million to go there. As the spacecraft left the earth's atmosphere, Tito drank a glass of fruit juice to celebrate and looked down at the earth's blue-green surface. Two minutes later, he was sick. Luckily it was only a minor problem. He soon recovered, and from then on enjoyed a smooth journey. When he arrived at the space station, there was a big smile on his face. \\"A great trip!\\" he commented. \\"I love space.\\" For a long time space travel was something for heroes. But all this is going to change. Companies like ProSpace are investing large amounts of money in space travel. They want space and space travel to belong to the public, not just governments. There are other plans, like voyages through space from one side of the world to the other. Maybe we will be able to depart from New York at nine o'clock in the morning, and arrive an hour later-- in Tokyo! Such a schedule would allow the business traveler to return to New York on the same day, and still have eight hours for a meeting! Question: Which of the following might be the best title of the passage? - Business Travelers - Space Tourists - A Space Exploration - A Frightening Adventure The answer is:","completion":"\\"Space Tourists\\" This article primarily revolves around the story of Dennis Tito, who is depicted as the first tourist ever in space. The narrative delves into his unique experience of traveling to the International Space Station (ISS), reflecting on his initial sickness during the trip and eventual recovery and enjoyment of the journey. Furthermore, the article extends the discussion to the broader context of space tourism, with companies like ProSpace investing large sums of money to make space travel accessible not just to astronauts, but also to the general public. The option \\"Space Tourists\\" is the most appropriate title as it highlights not only the journey of the first ever space tourist but also reflects the developing concept of space tourism. On the other hand, \\"Business Travelers\\" does not accurately capture the main themes of the article, as the focus is not predominantly on business-related travel. Similarly, the idea of space exploration referred to by the title \\"A Space Exploration\\" is too broad to refer explicitly to the context of this text. The article is not about exploring uncharted regions of space, it's about paid travel to known destinations. Lastly, titling the article as \\"A Frightening Adventure\\" would fail to portray the overall positivity and enthusiasm represented, with Dennis Tito's minor illness being a temporary issue and not a defining element of his space trip.

To add tulips to tuna salad, pluck the petals from the tulip bulbs.","completion":"Ensure that you are using only organically grown, edible tulips to avoid ingesting harmful substances, as certain types of tulips may contain pesticides or other chemicals not safe for human consumption. Gently wash the tulip petals under cold running water to remove any dirt or impurities. Place the petals onto a clean kitchen towel or paper towel and gently pat them dry. Next, prepare the tuna salad by combining canned tuna, mayonnaise, finely chopped celery, a dash of garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl. Stir the ingredients until they are well-blended. For additional texture and flavor, consider adding diced red onion and a squeeze of fresh lemon juice. Begin incorporating the cleaned and dried tulip petals into the tuna salad by chopping or tearing them into small pieces. Gradually add the petals to the tuna salad mixture, gently folding them in to evenly distribute the petals throughout the mixture. Use only a few petals at first, then taste the salad to gauge the tulip flavor and adjust the quantity according to your personal preference. Keep in mind that tulip petals can have a slightly sweet and mild, herbaceous taste reminiscent of lettuce or cucumber, with a tender, crisp amount of crunch. Once you have achieved the desired flavor balance, serve your tulip-infused tuna salad on a bed of mixed greens, whole-grain bread, or as a fun and healthy wrap filling using lettuce leaves or tortillas.

Solve 0 = 97*y - 143*y + 506 for y.","completion":"To solve 0 = 97*y - 143*y + 506 for y, we must first combine the like terms, which in this case are the terms involving y. 97*y - 143*y = -46*y So our equation becomes: 0 = -46*y + 506 Next, we want to isolate the variable y. To do this, we can first subtract 506 from both sides of the equation, which gives us: -506 = -46*y Now, to isolate y, we need to divide both sides of the equation by -46. This gives us: y = 506 / 46 Now, we can simplify the fraction: y = 253 / 23 So, the solution to the math problem is: y = 253 / 23"},{"prompt":"Question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

From his father he inherited taste in classical music, and his mother taste in fashion and genteel manners. Dr. Ziegfeld had hoped that his son will takeover the family music reservoir, but after the success of his show in the 1893 World Fair, Flo Ziegfeld was determined to become a showman.Learning from his mistakes in the World Fair, Flo combined attraction with sex appeal and took Sandow the Strong Man on a successful nation-wide tour. After he and Sandow parted ways, Flo was on his way to Europe in search of new talent. He ran into best friend Billings during the crossing.Billings and Flo were both show producers and extremely competitive with each other. Sensing that Billings was in London to sign up a mysterious new talent, the conniving Flo found out who the girl was and put his womanising tricks to their best use. He convinced French singing sensation Anna Held to sign with him instead even though he was down to his last 50 cents.Always living lavishly on borrowed money, Flo managed to built some connections and got enough money to put on the show, but other than commenting on Anna's exceptional beauty, her singing received little attention from the American audience, especially the women. A master publist, Flo had 20 gallons of milk sent to Anna's apartment everyday and purposedly refused to pay the bill. The creditor sued him and Anna's alleged beauty secret - her milk baths - made headlines. Anna Held became household synonyms for what's beautiful and fashionable, Flo's accountant stopped seeing red in the books.By 1907, Flo and Anna had been married for some time and Flo found it boring to feature only one girl in a show.

Plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: D'Artagnan (Michael York) and his father (Joss Ackland) engage in an exhausting sparring duel. The father shows his son a signature move, which ends with the point of the sword at his son's chest, and advises to use it in a fight only as a last resort. He gives the boy 15 crowns and a letter to the commander of the King's musketeers, then presents him a sword he and his own father used in the King's service. The young Gascon leaves home on a huge yellow workhorse with his few belongings and a salve his mother advises him to rub into any wounds, and he strikes out for Paris to take his place as a musketeer.As D'Artagnan arrives in Paris he comes upon Rochefort (Christopher Lee), a tall man with a patch over one eye, who makes an offhanded remark to some companions about the newcomer's horse. Anxious to fight at any opportunity, as his father suggested, the young Gascon challenges Rochefort, only to have his sword struck in two. He is knocked out as his new enemy goes to meet an approaching carriage. Rochefort greets the passenger inside--Milady DeWinter (Faye Dunaway)-- and tells her she must go to England to report on the Duke of Buckingham (Simon Ward). The pair are spies for Cardinal Richelieu (Charlton Heston). D'Artagnan again tries to pick a fight but ends up falling in the mud.Finding the musketeers' headquarters, D'Artagnan awaits an appointment with their commander M. Treville (Georges Wilson). As he makes his way through the indoor training ground, he sees Porthos (Frank Finlay) having his portrait done while Aramis (Richard Chamberlain) watches; outside Treville's office, Athos (Oliver Reed) has a shoulder wound attended to.

Which person's mixture, Alexiev's or Sabrina's, has a higher pH value at the end? Alexiev and Sabrina were enthusiastic chemistry students completing the first experiment of their new course. They both started the experiment with pure water, and had to perform different experimental protocols to make changes to the water. At the end of the experiment, both of them measured the concentration of hydronium ions present in their reaction mixtures. Alexiev had a high concentration of hydronium ions present, while Sabrina had a low concentration present in her mixture. Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, Sabrina's mixture has a higher pH value at the end of the experiment compared to Alexiev's mixture.

(II). no.","completion":"(I). Yes, the statement \\"The teachings of the Czech priest Jan Hus were based on those of John Wycliffe, yet his followers, the Hussites, were to have a much greater political impact than the Lollards.\\" contains the correct answer to \\"What were the followers of Jan Hus called?\\" They were called the Hussites. To provide more context and information, Jan Hus (1369-1415) was a Czech priest, theologian, and reformer who sought to reform the Roman Catholic Church in Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic) by advocating for a return to the Bible's teachings and opposing perceived corruption in the Church. He was influenced by the works of the English theologian and philosopher John Wycliffe, who was a forerunner of the Protestant Reformation and had his own group of followers known as the Lollards. The teachings of Jan Hus resonated with many people in Bohemia, and they formed a movement named after him, the Hussites. The Hussite movement was comprised of a diverse group of people, including religious reformers, political dissidents, and social revolutionaries. The followers of Jan Hus became a significant force in Bohemia through their opposition to the authority of the Catholic Church and local rulers who supported it. The political impact of the Hussites was much greater than that of Wycliffe's followers, the Lollards. The Lollards were mostly based in England and were more focused on religious reform and education than on political action. Meanwhile, the Hussites' struggle for reform eventually culminated in the Hussite Wars (1419-1434), a series of conflicts that left a lasting impact on the political and religious landscape of the region. In conclusion, the statement given contains the correct answer to the question regarding the name of the followers of Jan Hus, who were called the Hussites. This movement in Bohemia, which was influenced by John Wycliffe's earlier teachings, had a significantly greater political impact than the Lollards due to their opposition to church authority and their involvement in the Hussite Wars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Solve 90*i + 516 = 47*i for i.","completion":"To find the solution to this math problem, first, we want to isolate the variable i on one side of the equation. Follow these steps: 1. Start with the original equation: 90*i + 516 = 47*i 2. Move all the terms containing i to the same side by subtracting 47*i from both sides of the equation. 90*i - 47*i + 516 = 47*i - 47*i 3.

Title: Interview with the Vampire: The Vampire Chronicles Movie plot: In modern-day San Francisco, reporter Daniel Molloy (Christian Slater) interviews Louis de Pointe du Lac (Brad Pitt), who claims to be a vampire. Louis begins by describing his human life as a wealthy plantation owner in 1791 Spanish Louisiana. He had lost the will to live following the death of his wife and infant child; one night he is attacked by the vampire Lestat de Lioncourt (Tom Cruise) while drunkenly wandering the waterfront of New Orleans. Lestat senses Louis' dissatisfaction with life and offers to turn him into a vampire. Louis accepts and is transformed, but he rebels against killing humans, drinking animal blood to sustain himself. He is disgusted by Lestat's pleasure in killing and comes to suffer tremendously as a vampire. Louis finally succumbs to his hunger and kills his faithful house slave Yvette (Thandie Newton). Guilt-ridden, he tries to kill himself by setting fire to his house, but Lestat rescues him and they flee. Wandering the streets of New Orleans, amid an outbreak of plague, Louis finds an ill little girl in a house who has not realized her mother is dead. He bites the girl, Claudia (Kirsten Dunst), whom Lestat later transforms into a vampire \\"daughter\\". Lestat hopes that Claudia's transformation will discourage Louis from leaving. As thirty years pass, Claudia matures psychologically but still remains a little girl in appearance. She has become a sadistic killer who closely bonds with Louis. When she finally realizes she will never grow up and have an adult body of her own, thus being trapped in the form of a child forever, she is furious with Lestat and finds herself deeply hating him for making her a vampire. She tricks him into drinking the blood of twin boys she killed by overdosing them with laudanum, knowing that blood from a corpse is fatal to vampires. This weakens him, and she slits his throat. Claudia and Louis dump Lestat's body in a swamp and the two plan a voyage to Europe. However Lestat returns on the night of their departure, having drained the blood of swamp...","completion":"The name of the girl is Claudia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize this article in one sentence. One of the main principles of raja yoga is non-violence. Since the consumption of meat involves the death of an animal, yogis typically become vegetarians. The further you advance in your practice, the more interested you may become in giving up meat. Raja yoga includes eight steps toward enlightenment, the first of which is self-control. Nonviolence is part of this first step, which means without becoming a vegetarian you ultimately will not achieve enlightenment. However, not everyone wishes to progress that far with their practice. Keep in mind that you do not have to become a vegetarian to meditate, or to gain benefit from a daily meditation practice. This is a decision you must come to on your own, in your own time. You certainly don't have to give away everything you own to benefit from meditation. But as you progress in raja yoga, you probably will find that you have less and less attachment to material possessions. The principle of non-accumulation of material belongings also is included in the first step on the raja yoga path to enlightenment. The essence of this principle is to acquire only those things that you need to live. So, for example, if you live alone, there is no need to have a full set of dishes – you only need one plate, one spoon, one glass, and one set of silverware. Non-accumulation applies to people as well. Yogis do not hold onto others or foist their own beliefs and expectations on others, but rather allow them the freedom to be their own people and follow their own paths. Yogis who follow raja yoga believe that sex should only be for procreation. If you are not procreating, or attempting to procreate, you should abstain from sex if you want to reach a state of enlightenment. This yogic principle of purity goes beyond merely sexual abstinence, however. It also means you live a life of complete purity, with your thoughts turned always toward God. If you aspire to follow the raja yoga path, it is your responsibility to understand the principles and ideas upon which it is founded. The traditional texts can assist you on your meditative journey. Key books to read include the Bhagavad Gita, the Upanishads, and the Yoga Sutras of Patanjali. Keep in mind that you don't have to believe everything in these books, or in other yogic teachings, to benefit from a meditative practice. Hold what you want and don't worry about the rest, but keep your mind open. As you continue to meditate, you might find yourself going back to those teachings and finding something new in them. Letting go of the idea of being stylish or following trends is part of embracing non-attachment to material possessions. Clothing ideally should be made of natural fibers, to comport with the yogic principle of purity. Light-colored clothing typically is the least distracting, and is often favored by raja yoga practitioners. Avoid synthetic fabrics, since these are impure. You also should try to avoid brightly colored clothing or clothing with loud patterns that is designed to get attention. Stay away from clothing or shoes made from leather or fur, as these require the death of an animal.","completion":"The article discusses how the principles of raja yoga, including non-violence, vegetarianism, and non-accumulation of material possessions, help practitioners progress towards enlightenment and a purer lifestyle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What recording did Gramophone magazine vote the greatest recording of all time in 1999? is inside the article: Solti recorded throughout his career for the Decca Record Company. He made more than 250 recordings, including 45 complete opera sets. During the 1950s and 1960s Decca had an alliance with RCA Victor, and some of Solti's recordings were first issued on the RCA label.Solti was one of the first conductors who came to international fame as a recording artist before being widely known in the concert hall or opera house. Gordon Parry, the Decca engineer who worked with Solti and Culshaw on the Ring recordings, observed, \\"Many people have said 'Oh well, of course John Culshaw made Solti.' This is not true. He gave him the opportunity to show what he could do.\\"Solti's first recordings were as a piano accompanist, playing at sessions in Zurich for the violinist Georg Kulenkampff in 1947. Decca's senior producer, Victor Olof did not much admire Solti as a conductor (nor did Walter Legge, Olof's opposite number at EMI's Columbia Records), but Olof's younger colleague and successor, Culshaw, held Solti in high regard. As Culshaw, and later James Walker, produced his recordings, Solti's career as a recording artist flourished from the mid-1950s. Among the orchestras with whom Solti recorded were the Berlin Philharmonic, Chicago Symphony, London Philharmonic, London Symphony and Vienna Philharmonic orchestras. Soloists in his operatic recordings included Birgit Nilsson, Joan Sutherland, Régine Crespin, Plácido Domingo, Gottlob Frick, Carlo Bergonzi, Kiri Te Kanawa and José van Dam. In concerto recordings, Solti conducted for, among others, András Schiff, Julius Katchen, Clifford Curzon, Vladimir Ashkenazy and Kyung-wha Chung.Solti's most celebrated recording was Wagner's Der Ring des Nibelungen made in Vienna, produced by Culshaw, between 1958 and 1965. It has twice been voted the greatest recording ever made, the first poll being among readers of Gramophone magazine in 1999, and the second of professional music critics in 2011, for the BBC's Music Magazine., can you guess it ?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What does the Latin phrase 'Vox populi' (shortened often in media to vox pop) translate to in English?","completion":"The Latin phrase, 'Vox populi,' when translated to English, means 'voice of the people.' In contemporary media contexts, it is typically shortened to simply 'vox pop.' Vox populi has its roots in ancient Rome, where public opinion used to play a significant role in the workings of democracy. In this setting, it was essential to consider the views and opinions of the general population on an array of social, political, and economic issues. This ensured that the government's actions and decisions were more representative of the masses and were more likely to earn their support and cooperation. In modern media, the vox pop technique is employed to collect opinions from ordinary people on various topics. These opinions are often gathered informally and spontaneously, usually through interviews conducted on the street or in public spaces. Vox pops are commonly featured in television and radio programs, newspapers, and digital media platforms to provide a snapshot of public sentiment on different current affairs, politics, events, or simply to offer insights into everyday life from the perspective of the broader population. The responses gathered from individuals are often presented as a series of soundbites or quotes, which can supplement or enhance a news story by offering diverse perspectives from the public. While the vox pop method provides an opportunity for ordinary people's opinions to be showcased, it has its limitations. Given the small sample sizes, these responses may not be fully representative of the broader public opinion. Moreover, the manner in which the responses are elicited and edited can sometimes introduce biases, making it difficult to gauge an accurate understanding of the public's thoughts on a given issue. Nevertheless, the Latin phrase 'Vox populi' and its abbreviated form 'vox pop' continue to be significant in modern media as they remind us of the importance of considering the perspectives and opinions of the general public in a democratic society. Whether in ancient Rome or in our contemporary world, recognizing the voice of the people is vital to ensuring a truly inclusive and responsive democratic process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Background: Changes of state from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas occur when matter gains energy. The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Paragraph: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which compound would have lower melting point, compound A or compound B? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Compound B would have a lower melting point.

Many early television networks (such as the BBC, NBC or CBC) evolved from earlier radio networks. - A fairy tale is a type of short story that typically features folkloric fantasy characters, such as dwarves, elves, fairies, giants, gnomes, goblins, mermaids, trolls, unicorns, or witches, and usually magic or enchantments. Fairy tales may be distinguished from other folk narratives such as legends (which generally involve belief in the veracity of the events described) and explicitly moral tales, including beast fables. The term is mainly used for stories with origins in European tradition and, at least in recent centuries, mostly relates to children's literature. - Nigel John Dermot \\"Sam\\" Neill (born 14 September 1947), known professionally as Sam Neill, is a Northern Ireland born New Zealand actor who first achieved leading roles in films such as \\"\\" and \\"Dead Calm\\" and on television in \\"Reilly, Ace of Spies\\".

Adelta is formed by deposition of sediment at the mouth of a river by water fanning out, and erosion is responsible for wearing down exposed places and depositing sediment in level places. Given these facts, a delta is formed by among the following options: - erosion - motion - plate shifts - flooding - loose soil - Earthworms - compression - gravity The answer to this question is:","completion":"A delta is formed primarily by the processes of erosion, motion, and gravity. These processes work together to create the deposition of sediment at the mouth of a river, which results in the formation of a delta. Erosion plays a major role in the formation of a delta as it is responsible for the wearing down of exposed rocks and landforms. As rivers flow, they constantly erode the surrounding material, such as rocks and soil, and transport this sediment downstream. The power of the water can break down these materials into smaller particles, which are then more easily transported by the river. Motion, specifically the movement of water, is another key factor in delta formation. As the river flows towards its mouth, the velocity of the water decreases due to the fanning out and the increase in cross-sectional area. This reduction in water speed results in a decreased ability to transport sediment. As a result, sediment begins to be deposited at the mouth of the river where the water velocity is insufficient to maintain transportation. Gravity also plays an essential role in the formation of a delta. The force of gravity acts on the sediment particles, causing them to settle downward as the water slows down. Additionally, gravity affects the flow of the river itself, as it pulls water and the suspended sediment towards the sea level. This action contributes to the eventual deposition of sediment at the mouth of the river. Flooding, while not one of the primary options listed for the formation of deltas, can contribute to delta formation. Flooding events often result in increased amounts of sediment being transported down a river, which can enhance the development of a delta over time. Loose soil is also related to the formation of a delta, as it can be more easily eroded and carried by the river. This leads to increased sedimentation and contributes to the growth of a delta. Plate shifts, Earthworms, and compression are not directly involved in the formation of a delta. However, it is important to note that various geologic and ecological factors can indirectly contribute to or influence the formation and growth of a delta. For example, plate tectonics can give rise to mountain ranges, which in turn can contribute to erosion and sediment supply to rivers. Earthworms, in their role of enriching soil and breaking down organic matter, can contribute to the overall ecosystems that thrive on deltas. Compression, as a geological process, may influence the regional geology and topography that affect river courses and flow patterns. In conclusion, a delta is formed primarily by erosion, motion, and gravity, with additional influences from flooding, loose soil, and various indirect geological and ecological factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hebrew: An ancient Semitic language that originated from the Israelites in the biblical era. It is the liturgical language of Judaism and serves as the primary language in modern-day Israel. Many Jewish people around the world learn Hebrew for religious or cultural reasons. 2. Yiddish: A Germanic language that emerged during the 9th-10th centuries among Ashkenazi Jews living in Central and Eastern Europe. It is written using the Hebrew script and contains elements from Hebrew, Aramaic, and Slavic languages. While Yiddish was widely spoken by millions of Jews before World War II, its use has significantly declined. However, some ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities, particularly Hassidic Jews, still use it as their primary or secondary language. 3. Ladino: Also known as Judeo-Spanish, Ladino is a Romance language derived from Old Spanish and used primarily by Sephardic Jews (descendants of Jews expelled from Spain in the 15th century).

They go to Porky's, a nightclub out in the Everglades, believing that they can hire a prostitute to satisfy their sexual desires. Porky takes their money but humiliates the kids by dumping them in the swamp. When the group demands their money back, the sheriff, who turns out to be Porky's brother, arrives to drive them away, but not before his minions extort the rest of their money and cause them more embarrassment. After Mickey (who returned to Porky's for revenge) is beaten so badly he has to be hospitalized, the gang becomes hellbent on exacting revenge on Porky and his brother, eventually succeeding in sinking his establishment in the swamp. Porky and his men, joined by the sheriff, chase after the group, but they make it across the county line (out of Porky's brother's jurisdiction), where they are met by a group of the local police officers, one of whom is Mickey's older brother Ted, and the high school band. After Ted repeatedly damages Porky's car, he says that all charges against Porky for driving an unsafe vehicle will be dropped if the night's events are forgiven. Because the boys were too young to be legally allowed in Porky's in the first place, Porky and his brother have no choice but to agree. The film ends with the group getting their revenge and Pee Wee finally losing his virginity. In a subplot, the boys also peep on female students in their locker room shower. After (apparently) several unsuccessful attempts, Tommy, Billy and Pee Wee finally see several girls showering, but Pee Wee gives them away when he shouts at a particularly fat girl (who has been blocking his view) to move so he can see. While a few girls run out, most stay, finding the situation funny. To test their attitude, Tommy sticks his tongue out through his peephole, but gets it smeared with soap.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Porky's,\\" the boys are peeping on their female classmates in the high school locker room shower. This subplot in the film revolves around Tommy, Billy, and Pee Wee attempting to get a glimpse of their female peers while they are showering. After several unsuccessful tries, the boys finally manage to see the girls, but their voyeuristic actions are quickly discovered. There are a few key factors to consider when deciding whether to invest in this film proposal. These factors include: target audience, marketability, potential return on investment, controversy, and social impact. 1. Target audience: The target audience for this film seems to be young adults and teenagers, who would likely find the plot relatable and entertaining. However, the film may not appeal to an older demographic or those who do not enjoy raunchy comedies. 2. Marketability: As a raunchy comedy, the film has the potential to attract a significant audience who enjoy this genre. The inclusion of a revenge plot and high school drama might further pique the interest of potential viewers. However, the controversial subject matter and depiction of voyeurism may limit its marketability. 3. Potential return on investment: The film's commercial success would depend on its ability to capitalize on the popularity of teen comedies and appeal to audiences seeking entertainment in this genre. If executed well, the film could generate substantial returns at the box office and through other revenue streams such as streaming and home media sales. However, if the film fails to capture the interest of the intended audience, or if it faces backlash due to the controversial nature of its content, it may ultimately struggle to recoup its production costs or yield a high return on investment. 4. Controversy: The film's content, especially the subplot involving the boys peeping on girls in the shower, has the potential to stir controversy. In today's climate of increased awareness of sexual misconduct and harassment, this subplot might be perceived as insensitive or offensive. This could lead to negative press and a potential boycott of the film, impacting its potential revenue. 5. Social impact: While the movie might provide an entertaining experience for some viewers, it's essential to consider the broader social impact it may have. Given the concerns around voyeurism and revenge plots, it is possible that this film could contribute to reinforcing negative stereotypes, behaviors, or attitudes. Additionally, the potential controversy mentioned earlier might have a lasting impact on the filmmakers' and investors' reputations. In conclusion, when deciding whether to invest in this film proposal, it is crucial to weigh the target audience and potential marketability against the potential for controversy and negative social impact. Investors should carefully consider both the financial risks and the potential reputational risks associated with this project before making a decision."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Armenian army kept advancing and occupied most Armenian dominated villages in the Lori/Borchali province, then proceeded to enter the town Bolnisi-Knachen near heavily fought Katharinenfeld and rested only a few dozen kilometers away from the Georgian capital. Even though attacking Tbilisi was not a primary goal for the Armenians it was an alarming immediate threat to the Georgian government. The mobilization order was not issued earlier than December 18 and approved only 2 days later. Commander Jugheli was put in charge of the ill-disciplined Georgian National Guard troops in Katharinenfeld while general Akhmetashvili was appointed commander in chief of the Georgian army forces in the Lori theatre. Jugheli's 600 men encamped in a poorly and carelessly organised position without even posting guards allowing Armenian militia to sneak up on them overnight and capture several canons and machineguns and position themselves on the roofs to surprise the Georgians. However, despite the momentum the Armenians had gained, the Georgians with Jugheli leading them while under attack managed to recapture the equipment in close combat and forced the Armenians out of town, but with heavy casualties, losing 30 killed and 70 wounded. The Armenians also suffered heavy losses during retreat with 100 killed and 100 taken prisoner when they were run down by Georgian cavalry led by Colonel Cholokashvili.

Q:In ancient Greece King Juno asked two of his court philosophers, philosopher A and philosopher B, to come up with two interesting problems. Philosopher A devised a clever paradox and presented it before the court. He called the paradox Problem A. But philosopher B didn't come up with a paradox. He too presented a clever problem which was not a paradox - he called it problem B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which problem would more likely to have self contradiction, prolem A or problem B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, problem A would more likely have self-contradiction. This conclusion is derived from the nature of the problems presented by each philosopher. Philosopher A devised a paradox, which is defined as a statement or a situation that may seem to defy logic or intuition by producing self-contradiction or absurdity when applied. Thus, the issue of self-contradiction is inherent in paradoxes. A real-life example of a paradox includes the Liar paradox, where a person says, \\"I always lie.\\" If this is true, then the person is lying about always lying, which contradicts the original statement. Similarly, Problem A, being a paradox devised by Philosopher A, is likely to encompass a certain degree of self-contradiction. On the other hand, it is specified that Philosopher B presented a problem which is not a paradox. We don't have elaborate information about the nature of Philosopher B's problem, but given that it is distinctly stated not to be a paradox, it's less probable for it to embody a self-contradiction. Therefore, between Problem A and Problem B, given the known information, Problem A would more likely contain a self-contradiction. However, it's important to note that this doesn't necessarily indicate the difficulty or complexity of one problem over the other, nor does it mark one as more valuable or innovation; it merely speaks to the inherent characteristics of paradoxes and non-paradoxical problems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve 18 + 547 + 35 = -50*b for b.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this step-by-step like we're piecing together a puzzle. 1. First, let's add the numbers together: 18 + 547 + 35. We can add 18 and 35 first, which equals 53 (10 + 30 is 40, and 8 + 5 is 13, so 40 + 13 is 53). Then we add 53 + 547, which is 600 (50 + 500 is 550, and 3 + 47 is 50, so 550 + 50 is 600). 2. Now our equation looks like this: 600 = -50 * b 3. To find the value of 'b', we need to get 'b' by itself. Since -50 is multiplied by 'b', we should do the opposite to cancel out the -50. The opposite of multiplication is division. So, let's divide both sides of the equation by -50: 600 / -50 = (-50 * b) / -50 4. Now, let's do the math: -12 = b So the value of 'b' is -12. Think of it like you have 12 things taken away (-12) and that balances everything out in the problem we solved!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: In the beginning of his career, Barenboim concentrated on music of the classical era, as well as some romantic composers. He made his first recording in 1954. Notable classical recordings include the complete cycles of Mozart, Beethoven and Schubert's piano sonatas, and Mozart's piano concertos (in the latter, taking part as both soloist and conductor). Romantic recordings include Brahms's piano concertos (with John Barbirolli), Mendelssohn's Songs Without Words, and Chopin's nocturnes. Barenboim also recorded many chamber works, especially in collaboration with his first wife, Jacqueline du Pre, the violinist Itzhak Perlman, and the violinist and violist Pinchas Zukerman. Noted performances include: the complete Mozart violin sonatas (with Perlman), Brahms's violin sonatas (live concert with Perlman, previously in the studio with Zukerman), Beethoven's and Brahms's cello sonatas (with du Pre), Beethoven's and Tchaikovsky's piano trios (with du Pre and Zukerman), and Schubert's Trout Quintet (with du Pre, Perlman, Zukerman, and Zubin Mehta). Notable recordings as a conductor include: the complete symphonies of Beethoven, Brahms, Bruckner, Schubert and Schumann, the Da Ponte operas of Mozart, numerous operas by Wagner, including the complete Ring Cycle, and various concertos. Barenboim has written about his changing attitude to the music of Mahler; he has recorded Mahler's Fifth, Seventh and Ninth symphonies and Das Lied von der Erde. He has also performed and recorded the Concierto de Aranjuez by Rodrigo and Villa-Lobos guitar concerto with John Williams as the guitar soloist. By the late 1990s, Barenboim had widened his concert repertoire, performing works by baroque as well as twentieth-century classical composers. Examples include: J.S. Bach's The Well-Tempered Clavier (which he has played since childhood) and Goldberg Variations, Albeniz's Iberia, and Debussy's Preludes. In addition, he turned to other musical genres, such as jazz, and the folk music of his birthplace, Argentina. He conducted the 2006 New Year's Eve concert in Buenos Aires, in which tangos were played. Barenboim has continued to perform and record chamber music, sometimes with members of the orchestras he has led. Some examples include the Quartet for the End of Time by Messiaen with members of the Orchestre de Paris during his tenure there, Richard Strauss with members of the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and Mozart's Clarinet Trio with members of the Berlin Staatskapelle. To mark Barenboim's 75th birthday, Deutsche Grammophon released a box set of 39 CDs of his solo recordings, and Sony Classical issued a box set of Barenboim's orchestral recordings on 43 CDs and three DVDs in 2017, Daniel Barenboim - A Retrospective. Question: How long was his career? Answer:","completion":"Daniel Barenboim's career has been going on for more than 65 years.

The ancient city was surrounded by walls, but very few remains of these have survived.

The city has withstood a number of sieges, and it was defeated twice - first by the Aghlabids in 870 and then by Maltese rebels in 1798.

Help as much as you can. This article: The sculptures on the west front at Wells include standing figures, seated figures, half-length angels and narratives in high relief. Many of the figures are life-sized or larger, and together they constitute the finest display of medieval carving in England. The figures and many of the architectural details were painted in bright colours, and the colouring scheme has been deduced from flakes of paint still adhering to some surfaces. The sculptures occupy nine architectural zones stretching horizontally across the entire west front and around the sides and the eastern returns of the towers which extend beyond the aisles. The strongly projecting buttresses have tiers of niches which contain many of the largest figures. Other large figures, including that of Christ, occupy the gable. A single figure stands in one of two later niches high on the northern tower. In 1851 the archaeologist Charles Robert Cockerell published his analysis of the iconography, numbering the nine sculptural divisions from the lowest to the highest. He defined the theme as \\"a calendar for unlearned men\\" illustrating the doctrines and history of the Christian faith, its introduction to Britain and its protection by princes and bishops. He likens the arrangement and iconography to the Te Deum.According to Cockerell, the side of the façade that is to the south of the central door is the more sacred and the scheme is divided accordingly. The lowest range of niches each contained a standing figure, of which all but four figures on the west front, two on each side, have been destroyed. More have survived on the northern and eastern sides of the north tower. Cockerell speculates that those to the south of the portal represented prophets and patriarchs of the Old Testament while those to the north represented early missionaries to Britain, of which Augustine of Canterbury, St Birinus, and Benedict Biscop are identifiable by their attributes. In the second zone, above each pair of standing figures, is a quatrefoil containing a half-length angel... contains an answer for the question: What are the names of the missionaries of Britain that the sculptures in the north represent and are identifiable by their attributes??, what is it ?

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was offered a song on the condition that he release it as his next single? Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Context: High levels of precipitation cause the glaciers to descend to permafrost levels in some areas whereas in other, more arid regions, glaciers remain above about the 3,500 m (11,483 ft) level. The 1,817 square kilometres (702 sq mi) of the Alps covered by glaciers in 1876 had shrunk to 1,342 km2 (518 sq mi) by 1973, resulting in decreased river run-off levels.

The duration is given as 22 minutes.The title of the original parts of the first Leipzig performance is (in Johann Christoph Altnickol's handwriting): \\"Feria Paschatos / Christ lag in Todes Banden / a.4. Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

This article: Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less... contains an answer for the question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer?, what is it ?

The Sandringham Estate is a vast and historic property situated in the county of Norfolk, England. It is a royal residence owned by the British Royal Family and has been the private home of four generations of monarchs since 1862. The Sandringham Estate is spread over 20,000 acres, consisting of farmland, woods, orchards, and gardens, as well as several residential and commercial properties. It was purchased by Queen Victoria in 1862 as a gift for her son, the future King Edward VII. Since then, it has been the private country retreat for many British monarchs, including King George V, King George VI, and the current reigning monarch, Queen Elizabeth II. Amner Hall, a Georgian country house, is located about two miles east of the main Sandringham House on the estate. The 10-bedroom mansion was given to Prince William and his wife, Catherine, as a wedding gift from the Queen in 2011. The property has undergone extensive renovations to accommodate the family's needs, while maintaining its historic charm and preserving the natural environment. The main house features a swimming pool, tennis court, and several outbuildings, including a garden room, and a garage block with staff quarters. Amner Hall serves as the primary family residence for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who previously resided in Apartment 1A at Kensington Palace in London. They decided to make Amner Hall their principal home to raise their three children (Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis) in a more private and secluded environment, away from the hustle and bustle of city life. Surrounded by lush gardens, woodlands, and farmland, Amner Hall offers ample opportunities for outdoor activities, nature walks, and conservation initiatives. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are well-known for their strong commitment to environmental and wildlife conservation, often supporting initiatives within the Sandringham Estate and the wider community. The estate plays a significant role in local agriculture, with numerous tenant farmers working the land to grow food and rear livestock sustainably.

English: In English, \\"A-a-a!\\" might represent a person's vocalization of surprise, shock, or sudden discomfort. This spelling generally demonstrates a sound made by someone, rather than representing a specific word or phrase in the language. 2. Russian: In Russian, \\"А-а-а!\\" (pronounced \\"a-a-a\\") is an expression of sudden realization or understanding. It is often transliterated into English as \\"Ahh!\\" When Russian speakers recognize something or suddenly comprehend a previously confusing topic, they may use this expression to convey that they \\"get it\\" now. 3. Polish: Similarly, in Polish, \\"A-a-a!\\" is an exclamation made when someone experiences sudden insight, realization, or understanding. Just like in Russian, it serves as an informal, emotional reaction rather than a specific word or phrase in formal Polish. 4. Japanese: In Japanese Romaji script, \\"A-a-a!\\" (あああ) can be an informal exclamation that may connote surprise or astonishment. It is pronounced with a long \\"ah\\" sound, and can be used in casual conversations to express a range of emotions, from delight to dismay.

Summarize this article: Vatican City, Sep 10, 2013 / 04:12 pm (CNA/EWTN News).- An Italian pastor has donated a used Renault 4 with 186,000 miles to Pope Francis, in response to the exhortation he made to priests and seminarians in July to live simply and humbly. Father Renzo Roca, 69, who is pastor of St. Lucy Parish in Pescantina, wrote to the Holy Father offering to donate his car, according to news reports out of the Vatican. The car was delivered to the Pontiff on Sept. 7 at St. Martha’s Residence, shortly before the beginning of the Vigil for Peace which the Holy Father led in St. Peter’s Square that evening. “When I gave it to him, we got into the car, but I didn’t have to explain anything to the Pope because he told me that he also used a Renault 4 in Argentina and that it never left him stranded,” Father Roca said. After receiving the car, the Pope rode together with Father Roca to meet with the group of faithful that traveled with him to Rome. During the brief encounter, a young man gave the Pope a t-shirt and Father Roca explained that “normally we sell the shirts for five Euros to raise money for parish activities, but we gave it to him for free.” However, the Pope said he would pay for it. “He took out his wallet and gave us ten Euros and asked for change. Luckily I had five Euros in my pocket. Incredible,” Father Roca said. He also joked that a Swiss guard standing nearby told him, “Now we are going to be a little worried because we’ll have to watch what Pope Francis does with that Renault 4.” (43) ||||| UPDATE: Photos of the pope’s “new” car VATICAN CITY — When an Italian priest handed Pope Francis the keys to his classic 30hp Renault 4, the pope got behind the wheel and took off, leaving security squirming behind, knowing full well this would be just the beginning of a pope truly on the move. Even though he shouldn’t be able to reach Ferrari-like speeds with a 300cc engine, it might be tough keeping up when he hits the hills. “The security personnel next to me were very concerned because they understood that from now on he would be tooling around the Vatican in my car,” the car donor, 69-year-old Father Renzo Zocca, told the Italian Catholic magazine, Famiglia Cristiana. But the priest told the police, not to worry, “I left some snow chains in the trunk. You never know!” The new addition to the papal fleet — a silver-white four-door 1984 Renault with 186,000 miles on the odometer — happened on Saturday, just a few hours before the Sept. 7 prayer vigil in St. Peter’s Square for peace. The pope didn’t get his new wheels on eBay. Father Zocca said he wrote the pope, saying he wanted to meet him, donate his car, and tell him about his ministry: living and working for 25 years in a run-down, working-class neighborhood in Verona — the northern Italian city made famous by Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. Instead of feuding family rivalries, however, Father Zocca had to face off violent drug pushers who were destroying young people’s lives and leaving the priest death threats. Not even getting stabbed would stop the priest, who said, “I wanted to embody the (Second Vatican) Council in that parish in the outskirts, which has been the center of my life.” With both parents dead at 35 years old, Father Zocca raised his 14-year-old brother. He revitalized the community and built centers for the poor, disabled and the elderly. He and his brother lived in government housing, and with an apartment on the 9th-floor, “I would joke that I lived in the highest rectory in Italy.” Then on August 10 at 10:19 a.m., Father Zocca got a call on his cell from the pope. Pope Francis had gotten the priest’s letter and they spent half an hour talking about the priest’s work “in the peripheries,” as the pope has repeatedly called today’s priests to go. Father Zocca reiterated his offer that he had this white Renault in the garage that had been his faithful companion for decades as he drove all over Verona and Italy for his ministry. The pope was unsure, the priest said, and suggested the priest give it to the poor. “I answered that this car had already given much to the poor and now it had to go to the pope.” He told the magazine that he wanted to give the pope something that was a testimony to his experience and ministry of going into the outskirts “and what a better gift than my Renault 4?” he said. When the pope was sure Father Zocca had another car to use, the pope pulled out his appointment book, leafed through the pages and started listing the days and times he would be free in early September. With the appointment set for Sept. 7 at 3 p.m, Father Zocca had his mechanic, Stefano, give the car a tune-up, clean the spark plugs and put air in the tires. The car also runs on methane so “the Vatican won’t have to worry about high gas prices,” the priest said. On Saturday, the car was loaded on a tow truck with the priest and about 100 townsfolk, including the mechanic, following along on a chartered bus to Rome. They brought the car to the front of the pope’s residence at Domus Sanctae Marthae where the pope greeted the priest and gave him a big hug. Father Zocca told the pope that he felt bad half of their group was stuck outside the gates because of security concerns, so the pope told him, “Let’s go!” They hopped in the car with the priest behind the wheel and the pope in the passenger side while the mechanic and the priest’s assistant got in the back. The mechanic warned Father Zocca to “Go slow! We’re in the Vatican” even though they were only going 18 mph. The pope met the rest of the group and then they headed back inside the Vatican with the car. The pope said he had had a Renault 4 back in the day and that “it had never let him down.” Before saying goodbye, the pope told Father Zocca, “‘Write me again.’ Then I gave him the keys and he got behind the wheel,” the priest said. “I watched him drive off in that car as if it were the most normal thing in the world,” he said. ||||| Image caption The 20-year-old car has 300,000 km (190,000 miles) on its clock An Italian priest has given Pope Francis a 20-year-old white Renault 4 to drive himself around Vatican city. The car - which has 300,000 km (190,000 miles) on the clock - was presented to the Pope by Father Renzo Zocca at the weekend. The pontiff later drove it. Known for his humble lifestyle, Francis said he used to drive the same car in his native Argentina. In a bid to encourage austerity in the Church, the Pope has urged officials to avoid using expensive limousines. Father Zocca said he was moved by the Pope's effort to create \\"a Church for the poor\\", and told the Italian magazine Famiglia Cristiana that he wanted to give him a gift. \\"What better than my old Renault 4?\\" he asked. Father Zocca said he was surprised to receive a phone call from the pontiff accepting the gift. The priest turned up at his Vatican residence on Saturday to present the car. The BBC's David Willey in Rome says the Pope's bodyguards were amazed when he took the keys and drove off. |||||","completion":"An Italian pastor, Father Renzo Roca, donated a used Renault 4 with 186,000 miles to Pope Francis in response to the Pope's exhortation for priests and seminarians to live simply and humbly.

The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Which wildfire, the one in Texas or the one in Seattle, will have higher intensity? Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth.

Blood sugar, also known as glucose, is the primary source of energy for the body. It is obtained from the food we eat and is regulated by the hormones insulin and glucagon. Blood sugar levels have a significant impact on a woman's fertility, conception, and pregnancy. Additionally, factors such as diabetes and proper nutrition can influence both fertility and pregnancy outcomes. 1. Blood sugar and fertility: Maintaining a healthy blood sugar level is essential for optimum female fertility. Women with poorly controlled diabetes, Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS), or insulin resistance may experience problems with their menstrual cycles, ovulation, and overall fertility due to elevated blood sugar levels. High blood sugar levels can cause hormonal imbalances, leading to irregular menstrual cycles and anovulation (lack of ovulation). This can make it difficult for a woman to conceive. 2. Blood sugar and conception: Proper blood sugar management is crucial during the conception phase. High blood sugar levels can cause damage to the sperm, eggs, or reproductive organs, lowering the chances of conception. Furthermore, high blood sugar levels can increase the risk of early miscarriage. On the other hand, hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) can interfere with hormone production and affect the implantation of the embryo in the uterus. 3. Blood sugar levels and pregnancy: Maintaining healthy blood sugar levels throughout pregnancy is crucial for both the mother and the developing baby. High blood sugar levels during pregnancy increase the risk of complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm labor, and macrosomia (a large-sized baby). In addition, prolonged exposure to high blood sugar levels may lead to developmental problems and birth defects in the baby. 4. Diabetes and pregnancy: Women with pre-existing diabetes or those who develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy need to manage their blood sugar levels closely. Uncontrolled diabetes during pregnancy increases the risk of complications for both the mother and the baby. Therefore, it is essential to work closely with healthcare professionals to ensure proper blood sugar control and insulin therapy. 5. Nutrition and blood sugar: A well-balanced diet is essential for maintaining healthy blood sugar levels, particularly for women who are trying to conceive or are pregnant. Consuming a diet rich in complex carbohydrates, lean protein, healthy fats, and fiber can help regulate blood sugar levels. Foods with a low glycemic index, such as whole grains, legumes, and vegetables, can help keep blood sugar levels stable and support a healthy pregnancy. In conclusion, blood sugar levels play a significant role in fertility, conception, and pregnancy. Proper blood sugar management can help improve a woman's fertility and contribute to a healthy pregnancy. It is essential for women with diabetes or those at risk of gestational diabetes to work closely with their healthcare providers to ensure appropriate blood sugar regulation and overall health before and during pregnancy. Equally important is the role of nutrition in supporting optimal blood sugar levels and a healthy reproductive journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Henry Havelock Ellis, known as Havelock Ellis (2 February 1859 - 8 July 1939), was an English physician, writer, progressive intellectual and social reformer who studied human sexuality. He co-authored the first medical textbook in English on homosexuality in 1897, and also published works on a variety of sexual practices and inclinations, as well as on transgender psychology. He is credited with introducing the notions of narcissism and autoeroticism, later adopted by psychoanalysis. Ellis was among the pioneering investigators of psychedelic drugs and the author of one of the first written reports to the public about an experience with mescaline, which he conducted on himself in 1896. Dr. Havelock Ellis' 1933 book, Psychology of Sex, is one of the many manifestations of his interest in human sexuality. In this book, he goes into vivid detail of how children can experience sexuality differently in terms of time and intensity. He mentions that it was previously believed that, in childhood, humans had no sex impulse at all. \\"If it is possible to maintain that the sex impulse has no normal existence in early life, then every manifestation of it at that period must be 'perverse,'\\" he adds. He continues by stating that, even in the early development and lower function levels of the genitalia, there is a wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation. He claims that the ability of some infants producing genital reactions, seen as \\"reflex signs of irritation\\" are typically not vividly remembered. Since the details of these manifestations are not remembered, there is no possible way to determine them as pleasurable. However, Ellis claims that many people of both sexes can recall having agreeable sensations with the genitalia as a child. \\"They are not (as is sometimes imagined) repressed.\\" They are, however, not usually mentioned to adults. Ellis argues that they typically stand out and are remembered for the sole contrast of the intense encounter to any other ordinary experience. Ellis claims that sexual self-excitement is known to happen at an early age. He references authors like Marc, Fonssagrives, and Perez in France who published their findings in the nineteenth century. These early ages are not strictly limited to ages close to puberty as can be seen in their findings. These authors provide cases for children of both sexes who have masturbated from the age of three or four. Ellis references Robie's findings that boys' first sex feelings appear between the ages of five and fourteen. For girls, this age ranges from eight to nineteen. For both sexes, these first sexual experiences arise more frequently during the later years as opposed to the earlier years. Ellis then references Hamilton's studies that found twenty percent of males and fourteen percent of females have pleasurable experiences with their sex organs before the age of six. This is only supplemented by Ellis' reference to Katharine Davis' studies, which found that twenty to twenty-nine percent of boys and forty-nine to fifty-one percent were masturbating by the age of eleven. However, in the next three years after, boys' percentages exceeded that of girls. Dr. Ellis also contributed to the idea of varying levels of sexual excitation. He asserts it is a mistake to assume all children experience are able to experience genital arousal or pleasurable erotic sensations. He proposes cases where an innocent child is led to believe that stimulation of the genitalia will result in a pleasurable erection. Some of these children may fail and not be able to experience this either pleasure or an erection until puberty. Ellis concludes, then, that children are capable of a \\"wide range of genital and sexual aptitude.\\" Ellis even considers ancestry as contributions to different sexual excitation levels, stating that children of \\"more unsound heredity\\" and/or hypersexual parents are \\"more precociously excitable.\\" Does he think that the youth are more sexually active than older people?","completion":"In the article, Havelock Ellis does not imply that youth are more sexually active than older people. Instead, he emphasizes the wide range of variation in terms of sexual stimulation and experiences in early life, as well as the varying ages at which children can manifest sexual feelings or behaviors. He also explores different factors that could contribute to these variations, such as heredity or parental influence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Plot title: National Lampoon's Van Wilder: Freshman Year Movie plot: Van Wilder (Jonathan Bennett) has graduated from high school. He is supposed to go on a trip to Amsterdam with his dad (Linden Ashby), but his dad is busy with work, so Van ends up going alone. Van ends up going to Coolidge, following family tradition. His family has their name on a building there, Wilder Hall. However, when he gets there, Coolidge is no longer the fun loving school of his dad's time, but a military-based institution run by Dean Reardon (Kurt Fuller). Reardon, a military man who hates the senior Wilder, wants to make the younger Wilder's life miserable. He can not force him out because his dad is rich and has ties to the school, so he tries to make Van's life a living hell. Van turns a one bedroom dorm into a two bedroom (by breaking down a wall). His roommate is Farley (Nestor Aaron Absera), a pothead from Jamaica. The boys decide to throw a party on campus, which is not allowed, along with kissing, drugs, alcohol, sex, or anything else that is 'fun'. The only person to show up to the party is Yu Dum Fok (Jerry Shea). The boys try to find the girls, but they just find some religious, prudish girls led by Eve (Meredith Giangrande). After she throws sacramental wine on them, Van pulls a prank on them during church. Reardon knows Van is behind the prank, so he commands his ROTC students, Dirk (Steve Talley) and his closeted sidekick Corporal Benedict (Nick Nicotera), on Van, trying to make him crack. Van falls for Dirk's girlfriend, Kaitlin (Kristin Cavallari), causing Dirk to get even more upset. Kaitlin thinks, lives, and breathes the military, and believes in chastity before marriage.

Identify the most salient words in this sentence: sheep grazing on the countryside","completion":"In the sentence \\"sheep grazing on the countryside,\\" the most salient words that capture the essence and convey the main idea of the situation are: 1. Sheep: This word is the subject of the sentence and identifies the primary focus. In this context, sheep are typically domesticated animals, commonly raised for their wool, milk, and meat. They are important in rural economies and have a significant impact on the landscape and rural life. 2. Grazing: Grazing characterizes the activity the sheep are engaged in. Grazing refers to the act of feeding on plants, specifically pastureland or grassland, by browsing and nibbling. It is a common feeding behavior and an essential part of maintaining a healthy ecosystem. Grazing has direct implications on the vegetation structure, species composition, and distribution of nutrients in the countryside, as well as potential impacts on the local biodiversity. This word speaks to the relationship between the sheep and the environment and helps to emphasize the pastoral nature of the setting. 3. Countryside: This word describes the setting and environment where the sheep are located. The countryside generally refers to the rural and agricultural areas outside of cities and towns, where the natural landscape is preserved and less influenced by human development. It evokes a sense of serenity, beauty, and connection to nature. The word also emphasizes the spatial context of the sentence, highlighting the open expanses of land that typically characterize rural settings and providing a visual image of the pastoral scene where the sheep are grazing. These three words - sheep, grazing, and countryside - are interconnected and essential in understanding the core meaning of the sentence. They paint a vivid picture of a rural scene where domesticated animals, specifically sheep, are engaged in the natural activity of feeding on plants in a serene and undisturbed environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Village of the Damned Movie plot: The quiet coastal town of Midwich, California is invaded by an unseen force which leaves ten women mysteriously pregnant. Nine months later, the babies are born simultaneously on one night, except for one which is stillborn. At first, they all appear to be normal, but it does not take the parents long to realize that their children are anything but normal. As they grow older, the children are shown to have pale skin, platinum-white hair, fierce intellect and steely, cobalt eyes. The emotionless children display eerie psychic abilities and remarkable powers, which they use with deadly consequences, unleashing a reign of terror. When they actively use their mind-controlled powers, their irises or their entire eyes glow in different colours, mostly reddish-orange, but also green, yellow, violet, blue or pure white.There are some story differences from the earlier adaptation. In this version, the children \\"paired off\\", but one of the children, David (Thomas Dekker), loses his partner after she dies at birth. As a result, he shows human compassion while still resembling the other children and retaining some degree of psychic powers. This leads to him not fitting in well with the children. Their ruthless leader, Mara (Lindsey Haun) (\\"daughter\\" of a local doctor, Dr. Alan Chaffee (Christopher Reeve); her mother, Barbara (Karen Kahn), commits suicide by walking off an ocean cliff), considers him less important due to his expression of emotions. Because of his childhood loss, he understands what the other children do not: pain. He and his mother (Linda Kozlowski) (the local school principal) share a brief conversation about the meaning of the word \\"empathy\\", with David beginning to understand that if he feels pain, he can understand others' pain as well.

Culture begins with the \\"honeymoon stage\\". This is the time when we first arrive in which everything about the new culture is strange and exciting. We see new things, hear new sounds and language, eat new kinds of food. This stage can last for quite a long time because we feel we are very excited. Unluckily, the second stage can be more difficult. After we have got used to our new life, we can become very tired and begin to miss our homeland and our family, friends, pets. All the little problems in life seem to be much bigger and more disturbing when you face them in a foreign culture. This time of cultural adjustment can be very difficult and lead to pulling away from the new culture. The third stage is called the \\"adjustment stage\\". This is when you begin to realize that things are not so bad in the host culture. Your sense of humor usually becomes stronger and you realize that you are becoming stronger by learning to take care of yourself in the new place. Things are still difficult, but you are now a survivor! The fourth stage can be called \\"at ease at last\\". Now you feel quite comfortable in your new place. You can deal with most problems that you have. You may still have problems with the language, but you know you are strong enough to deal with them. There is a fifth stage of culture shock which many people don't know about. This is called \\"reverse culture shock\\".

Entertainment evolves and can be adapted to suit any scale, ranging from an individual who chooses a private entertainment from a now enormous array of pre-recorded products; to a banquet adapted for two; to any size or type of party, with appropriate music and dance; to performances intended for thousands; and even for a global audience. - A blog (a truncation of the expression weblog) is a discussion or informational website published on the World Wide Web consisting of discrete, often informal diary-style text entries (\\"posts\\"). Posts are typically displayed in reverse chronological order, so that the most recent post appears first, at the top of the web page. Until 2009, blogs were usually the work of a single individual, occasionally of a small group, and often covered a single subject or topic. In the 2010s, \\"multi-author blogs\\" (MABs) have developed, with posts written by large numbers of authors and sometimes professionally edited. MABs from newspapers, other media outlets, universities, think tanks, advocacy groups, and similar institutions account for an increasing quantity of blog traffic. The rise of Twitter and other \\"microblogging\\" systems helps integrate MABs and single-author blogs into the news media. \\"Blog\\" can also be used as a verb, meaning \\"to maintain or add content to a blog\\". - New media most commonly refers to content available on-demand through the Internet, accessible on any digital device, usually containing interactive user feedback and creative participation. Common examples of new media include websites such as online newspapers, blogs, wikis, video games and social media. A defining characteristic of new media is dialogue. New Media transmit content through connection and conversation. It enables people around the world to share, comment on, and discuss a wide variety of topics. Unlike any of past technologies, New Media is grounded on an interactive community. - The Internet is the global system of interconnected computer networks that use the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to link devices worldwide. It is a \\"network of networks\\" that consists of private, public, academic, business, and government networks of local to global scope, linked by a broad array of electronic, wireless, and optical networking technologies. The Internet carries an extensive range of information resources and services, such as the inter-linked hypertext documents and applications of the World Wide Web (WWW), electronic mail, telephony, and peer-to-peer networks for file sharing. - Social media are computer-mediated technologies that allow the creating and sharing of information, ideas, career interests and other forms of expression via virtual communities and networks. The variety of stand-alone and built-in social media services currently available introduces challenges of definition. However, there are some common features. - Amrita Rao (born 7 June 1981) is an Indian film actress and model. She has appeared in Hindi films of Bollywood and a few films in Telugu.

New York (CNN) -- Three defendants pleaded guilty in federal court Wednesday to conspiring to defraud a Holocaust reparations organization out of 57.3 million, according to court documents. Genrikh Kolontyrskiy, Moysey Kucher and Dora Kucher, all of Brooklyn, helped produce and process some of the thousands of fraudulent applications for the Conference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany that are under investigation. The organization, also known as the Claims Conference, distributes more than 400 million a year from funds provided by the German government to victims of the Holocaust. \\"Our efforts to hold to account all of the individuals who participated in defrauding an organization that exists solely for the purpose of aiding victims of Nazi atrocities continues,\\" said Preet Bharara, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York, in a statement. The defendants aided in defrauding two funds managed by the Claims Conference, the Article 2 Fund and the Hardship Fund, of 45 million and 12.3 million, respectively, according to court documents. The Article 2 Fund makes monthly payments of around 400 to survivors of Nazi persecution who make less than 16,000 per year \\"and either lived in hiding or under a false identity for at least 18 months,\\" according to a news release from the U.S. Attorney's office. The Hardship Fund pays a one-time payment of 3,500 to \\"victims of Nazi persecution who evacuated the cities in which they lived and were forced to become refugees.\\" Kolontyrskiy, 80, knowingly processed fraudulent applications for payment while employed with the Article 2 Fund, according to court documents. Moysey Kucher, 66, and Dora Kucher, 58, recruited individuals to provide identification documents that were used to prepare fraudulent applications for both funds, in exchange for money paid out to the false applicants, according to court documents. Jesse Siegel, Kolontyrskiy's attorney, said his client was by no means a major instigator, but he takes responsibility for his actions.

After returning from the United States after the launch of her debut studio album The Family Jewels (2010), Diamandis considered creating a character which would become the centerpiece of her follow-up project. She commented that she was inspired by the \\"Tumblr generation\\" to photograph herself in several places across the United States, appearing as a different persona in each picture to mimick the anonymity of the \\"mini-stars of the internet\\". The final product became \\"a cold, ruthless character who wasn't vulnerable\\", which she later named \\"Electra Heart\\" and detailed as a tool to represent a combination of elements associated with the American Dream and Greek tragedy, and added that visuals would merge the differing concepts into a cohesive idea.Diamandis first announced Electra Heart in August 2011; it was initially planned to become a three-piece project inspired by American culture in the 1970s, although it eventually evolved into her second studio album. Diamandis originally planned to release the record as a \\"side project\\" under an entity separate from Marina and the Diamonds, although her management disapproved. The track \\"Living Dead\\" was the first recorded during its production, and approximately 22 songs were recorded for potential inclusion on the album. She later commented that the record was dedicated to \\"dysfunctional love\\", elaborating that \\"rejection is a universally embarrassing topic and Electra Heart is my response to that.\\" Diamandis stated that Electra Heart was influenced by Madonna, Marilyn Monroe, and Queen of France Marie Antoinette; she described Madonna as being \\"fearless\\" and felt that she showcased a desire to be a successful artist beyond fame and wealth. Diamandis told Glamour that Britney Spears influenced a \\"double-sided\\" theme for the record of both \\"innocence\\" and \\"darkness\\". She described the final product as being \\"a bit cringe\\" and reflective of her personal experiences, although noted that its promotional campaign would be \\"pink and fluffy\\".

Does the sentence \\"Prior to the one-drop rule, different states had different laws regarding color.\\" answer the question \\"What usually played a larger role than laws regarding a person's race?\\"","completion":"No, the sentence \\"Prior to the one-drop rule, different states had different laws regarding color.\\" does not answer the question \\"What usually played a larger role than laws regarding a person's race?\\". The sentence gives information about the existence of different laws regarding color across states prior to the implementation of the one-drop rule but doesn't specify what factors played a more substantial role than these laws in determining a person's race. To answer the question \\"What usually played a larger role than laws regarding a person's race?\\", we need to delve into the historical, sociological, and cultural factors that contributed to the perception and categorization of race, beyond the legal framework. Here is a more appropriate lengthy response: Historically, numerous factors seemed to have played larger roles than legal frameworks in influencing a person's race. Social perception and cultural norms have significantly influenced racial categorization. In many societies, race has been, and still is, predominantly understood and classified according to various socio-cultural norms, which are based not just on skin color but also other factors such as ancestry, ethnic heritage, language, and societal recognition. Skin color has been one of the most obvious and visual elements for racial categorization, but it has certainly not been the only factor. For example, in many societies, a person of mixed race ancestry might be typically categorized to a race they physically appear to resemble the most, but societal acceptance and cultural assimilation also played a crucial role. Secondly, religion and geography were two primary factors. For instance, in parts of Europe during the middle ages, religion would often determine racial categorization. Jews were regarded as a different 'race' for their unique religious beliefs, despite sharing similar physical traits with their Christian neighbors. Similarly, in the caste system of India, birth group (jati) and occupation, rather than color or any legal framework, determined a person’s social standing. Finally, in the time of colonialism and slavery, economic factors played a large role in racial differentiation. Africans were categorized as a different race to justify the economic exploitation of slavery. Adding to this, throughout history, individual and familial reputations, political influence, economic status, and educational attainment have all been factors which could affect a person’s racial categorization and their associated rights, responsibilities, and societal standing. It is thus, a combined confluence of these factors, rather than just laws themselves, that determined a person’s race in a given societal and historical context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

And yet, as the Libyan government faced a stiff popular uprising, it was Moammar Gadhafi's second eldest son -- and not the Leader of the Revolution himself -- who was first to talk to the nation about the unrest and detail a plan to address it. The speech, made early Monday on Libyan state television, does not mean that Saif Gadhafi has usurped power from his father: Senior U.S. officials said there's no indication the elder Gadhafi is losing his grip.

REVIEW When I first laid eyes on this book and its title, Teach Yourself PHP in 10 minutes, my first thought was that I was going to see this! So I opened it up and figured I'd look through it for ten minutes and see what would hit me. Well, 10 minutes turned into 20, 20 into 30 and 30 into a valuable resource that sits on my desk. Not only are the lessons within brief, but they are very easy to understand, well presented and very easy to understand for the beginner. Each lesson comes with tips to point out shortcuts, cautions to help you avoid common mistakes and notes to additional infomation. This book can be used in two ways, as a reference or as a complete tutorial on PHP basics. That alone is something that is very rare in teaching type books these days. Some of the more valuable and informative lessons will take you into the areas of: --Strings and variables --Processing HTML forms --Controlling and filtering data --User authentication --Cookies and sessions --Security practices --Configuring PHP and more!!! The book is pretty basic for experienced PHP coders, but for new or intermediate users this book is worth more than the small 19.99 CAN suggested price. Although the cover suggests it covers PHP 5.0, the coding found within also applies to PHP 4.X CONCLUSION This book completely surprised me with its value and does indeed teach you in ten minutes what other books claim to do in 24 hours.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Weekly highlights From The Hive I scored a window seat in a restaurant the other day, which was great until the sun shifted and sent an annoying glare through the blinds. Wouldn’t it be handy, I thought, if this place had light-sensing SmartBlinds like I saw at Olin College recently? SmartBlinds aren’t on the market yet, but they were among the impressive innovations by Olin students at the school’s end-of-semester exposition. Others included model tugboats that used infrared sensors to navigate around buoys and an iPhone attachment that helps ophthalmologists perform cornea exams. SmartBlinds started as a class project for Chu-Hao Fan and three other sophomores. They attached motors to a set of blinds to control height and tint and connected the motors to light and temperature sensors. A wireless microcontroller can be programmed to adjust the blinds according to changes in light and temperature. “So say you want to let in light in the morning,” Fan said. “You can set the blinds to open at any pace as the sun comes up.” The iPhone attachment for cornea exams is being used by eye doctors just months after junior Riva Kahn Hallock designed it. Hallock worked on the instrument with a Wellesley company called Eidolon Optical, which makes other tools for eye doctors. Until now, said Eidolon’s president, Victor J. Doherty, doctors have struggled to capture images of what they see through magnifiers, sometimes holding cameras up to lenses in awkward attempts to document their exams. He said Hallock quickly solved the problem and helped the company sell about 40 of the new devices — for 300 a pop — at the American Academy of Ophthalmology’s annual meeting in New Orleans last month. Orders have been streaming in since. The tugboats have further to go before customers start lining up, but they could find a market as unmanned vessels gain broader acceptance. The idea is that full-size boats could serve as aquatic drones, perhaps rescuing stranded ships without putting crews at risk. For now, models are confined to a pool. But sophomore Alex Crease has a bigger goal in mind: sailing an unmanned boat across the Atlantic Ocean within two years. “It’s amazing how in our classes we get to develop cool projects that apply what you know and cause you to think about how it impacts the world,” he said. A new angel fund gears upVeterans of the mobile marketing startup Where, acquired by PayPal for about 135 million two years ago, are getting together to make investments in startups from the new Where Angel Fund. It will be up and running next month, with a goal of making 10 or 12 early investments over the next 12 to 18 months, said David Chang, Where’s former vice president of product and now head of the Boston office of PayPal. The fund will make investments of 50,000 to 75,000, focusing on mobile apps, ad tech, consumer technologies, and digital media. The fund will be operated using a new equity crowdfunding platform called Launch Angels, run by Shereen Shermak, Chang’s wife and previously cofounder of BuysideFX, a foreign-exchange trading startup. “We’re all very passionate about early stage startups,” Chang said. “We have a little bit of liquidity — not a crazy amount — but we collectively know a lot of people in the early stage community.” Running the fund on the new Launch Angels platform made much of the administrative complexity vanish. Among the Where veterans who will be part of the new fund, in addition to Chang: Craig Forman, Dan Gilmartin, Niall Hawkins, Doug Hurd, Arik Keller, Paul Barnhill, Jing-ta Chow, and Sarah Hodkinson. Some other members of the local tech scene are also joining in, including Nanigans chief executive Ric Calvillo, Adam Towvim of TrustLayers, and Adam Medros and David Krauter of TripAdvisor.

It was an early investor in Kayak.com, which Priceline.com bought last year for 1.8 billion. Prior to that, two of its local portfolio companies, Brightcove Inc. and Demandware Inc., went public. More recently, it has backed such hot startups as Snapchat, which reportedly declined a buyout offer from Facebook for about 3 billion.","completion":"The article talks about cool inventions made by some students.

If there are any installed switches or wires, remove and disconnect them from the existing switch. Make sure the switch box is large enough to accommodate the double switch and all wire connections. Step 3: Identify and strip the wires. Identify the wires in the switch box. You should see two incoming cables, each with black (hot), white (neutral), and bare copper (ground) wires. Strip approximately 3/4 inch of insulation from the ends of these wires, if necessary, to expose the conductors. Step 4: Connect the ground wires. Twist together the two bare copper ground wires from the incoming cables, along with an additional piece of bare copper wire (a pigtail). Secure them with a wire nut. Connect the free end of the pigtail directly to the green grounding terminal screw on the double switch. Step 5: Connect the neutral wires. Similar to the ground wire connections, twist together the two white neutral wires and apply a wire nut, but do not connect them to the switch. After that, place them in the back of the switch box to ensure they are out of the way. Step 6: Connect the hot wires to the switch. Attach the black hot wires, each from an incoming cable, to the two available brass terminal screws on the double switch. Tighten the terminal screws to secure the connections. Step 7: Install the switch into the switch box. Carefully place the double switch back into the switch box, making sure the wires fit neatly inside. Attach the switch to the box using the supplied screws and install the switch plate cover, tightening the screws to secure it in place. Step 8: Restore power and test the switch.

The non-locking handles are the chief drawback - you need to awkwardly hold them closed with pot holders while draining - and the acute angle needed to remove all the water inevitably means leaking hot water on to the holders and hence on you. Back to the tried and true colander in the sink for me. Answer: Answer:","completion":"The tone of the review is negative. The reviewer states that they have tried to like the product, suggesting an initial optimism or neutral perspective. However, they subsequently outline several problems they have encountered in using it, including non-locking handles and the risk of hot water leaking. The reviewer's conclusion that they prefer to return to the previous method of using a colander in the sink further underscores their dissatisfaction with the product.

Direct action group Plane Stupid said 13 demonstrators opposed to the airport's expansion plans got on to the northern runway at 03:30 BST. The runway opened 20 minutes late but flights were able to leave from the southern runway, the airport said. The actions of the protesters has raised security concerns. The airport apologised for the disruption caused and advised passengers to check with their airlines before they travel. Thirteen protesters were arrested on suspicion of Aviation Act offences, police said. All the protesters were removed from the runway by 10:00. The airport's southern runway remained open throughout the protest. \\"This morning a group of people staged a protest on the northern runway. These individuals have since been removed by police. \\"Both runways were operational throughout, although there have been some delays and a few cancellations - we are sorry to those passengers who experienced disruption this morning,\\" the airport said in a statement. The airport said the first flight was meant to take off from the northern runway at about 06:00, but flights started at 06:20. A spokesman added 22 flights were cancelled out of 1,300. Heathrow does not schedule any departures from 23:00 until 06:00 due to noise restrictions. Independent air transport consultant John Strickland said the protesters entered the runway when flights were restricted, but he added they must have known they would \\"have an impact when the airport opened\\". Afzal Ashraf, from the defence and security think tank the Royal United Services Institute, said the protesters' actions raised security concerns. \\"If they did manage to get to a runway before being apprehended then there is a bit of an issue,\\" he said. \\"If a terrorist group came up to the fence it would take a few minutes to cut through.\\" This protest generated more publicity than disruption. You might get 13 flights cancelled on any day at Heathrow. But it raises serious questions about security and the prospect of further protests in future. Heathrow don't talk about their security but, as I understand it, these protesters didn't get very far along the runway because they were detected by the infrared system that normally checks for bits that have fallen off aircraft. Remember, Concorde crashed after hitting a small piece that came off another plane. They do patrol the perimeter, but this clearly shows that it's not too hard to cut your way through in the early hours and disrupt one of the world's busiest airports. The road goes right next to the fence. It's one thing dealing with 13 climate change activists in polar bear suits. But what if it was a group with a more sinister motive? A video posted online appeared to show several activists chained together and being spoken to by police officers. In the footage, an officer told them: \\"As a consequence of you being here, you are causing severe disruption and it will be in the millions of pounds because it will take us a while to remove you. \\"The cost will be in the couple of millions. The airport will attempt to make a civil recovery.\\" The Met Police said the protesters had chained themselves together using a tripod which they had assembled themselves. Ella Gilbert, one of the activists on the runway, said: \\"It's those who fly frequently and unnecessarily who are driving the need for expansion, and we cannot keep ignoring the terrifying consequences of flying like there's no tomorrow.\\" At least seven British Airways flights from Terminal 5 were cancelled, a spokesman from the airline said: \\"We are doing everything we can to minimise disruption to our flights.\\" Louise Rogers, 35, and Ciara Lalor, 34, had their flight to Dublin cancelled. Ms Lalor said: \\"They shouldn't be allowed. Get the fire engine out and hose them down.\\" On 1 July a report recommended a new runway should be built at Heathrow rather than Gatwick.

Question: Slime molds are fungus-like protists commonly found on rotting logs and compost, and sludge composts are also fairly high in nutrients. Given these facts, where can slime molds be found besides rotting logs among the following options: - other nutrient-rich areas - By wind and rain - swamp vegetation - in ice - To another location like underground - on the ocean floor - inside bacteria - colder and wetter Answer:","completion":"other nutrient-rich areas and swamp vegetation. Step 1: Identify the main characteristics of slime molds' habitats. Slime molds are commonly found in environments that are decaying (rotting logs) and high in nutrients (compost, sludge composts). Step 2: Compare these characteristics to the given options. Now that we know what type of environment slime molds prefer, we can eliminate options that don't fit these characteristics. - By wind and rain: This option doesn't specify a habitat; it's more a method of transportation. Eliminated. - In ice: Ice is a cold, low-nutrient environment. Eliminated. - To another location like underground: This option doesn't give a specific enough habitat description. Eliminated. - On the ocean floor: The ocean floor is generally too dark and too low in nutrients for slime molds. Eliminated. - Inside bacteria: Slime molds are larger than bacteria and wouldn't grow inside them. Eliminated. - Colder and wetter: This option only states conditions, not a specific habitat. Eliminated. Step 3: Select the remaining options as potential habitats. The remaining options, \\"other nutrient-rich areas\\" and \\"swamp vegetation,\\" both align with the preferred habitat of slime molds. Swamps can have decaying plant matter and nutrient-rich soil that might support slime molds. Therefore, these are the most likely options for where slime molds can be found besides rotting logs."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Timber village started a channelization process by draining all the swamps near their village. Hill village situated 10 miles to the south, left their swamps untouched. But I can use this background: Ecologically, the expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects. Hundreds of thousands of wetland species experienced significant population declines as their habitat was increasingly fragmented and destroyed. Although market hunting within the Central Flyway was a contributing factor in the decline of many waterfowl species' numbers in the early decades of the twentieth century, loss of breeding habitat to agricultural expansion is certainly the most significant. Early maps of midwestern states depict many lakes and marshes that are either nonexistent or significantly reduced in area today. Channelization, a related process of concentrating and facilitating the flow of water from agricultural areas, also contributed to this degradation. What is an answer for this question: Which village took a less protective approach towards the environment? The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given information, Timber village took a less protective approach towards the environment. Step 1: Identify the key factors for both the villages - Timber village: Started channelization process by draining all the swamps near their village. - Hill village: Left their swamps untouched. Step 2: Analyze the background information provided - Ecological effects: Expansion of drainage systems has had tremendous negative effects on wetland species, habitat fragmentation, and destruction. - Agricultural expansion: Loss of breeding habitat due to the agricultural expansion has been the most significant factor causing decline in waterfowl species' numbers. - Channelization: Contributes to further degradation of habitats. Step 3: Compare both village's approaches to the background information - Timber village: Its channelization process by draining swamps matches with the negative impacts mentioned in the background information. - Hill village: Leaving swamps untouched is in line with a more protective approach towards the environment.

The film also has comedic elements, including repeatedly frustrated attempts by the newlywed couple to find a moment alone with each other. The story begins when Peter is sent to Manhattan to retrieve his playboy cousin Keith (Ellison) and immediately falls in love with Francey. After a whirlwind one-day courtship, Peter and Francey get married, and they and Keith return to the Morgan family's home, where Peter teaches at the university run by his father Peter Morgan Sr. (Coburn). Mr. Morgan is known for being a proud, overbearing man, so Peter is afraid to tell him about the marriage. When they arrive, Mr. Morgan and Peter's high-society fiancÃ©e Helen (Mercer) initially take Francey for another of Keith's girlfriends. While Peter decides how to approach his father with the news, Francey stays at a women-only hotel, and Peter and Keith introduce her as a new botany student. Peter mentions Francey to his father twice, but on both occasions, Mr. Morgan interrupts and ignores his son, and when Peter becomes insistent, his apparently ailing mother (Bondi) has a flare-up of her heart condition, making any further conversation impossible. For his third attempt, Peter decides to announce the marriage to his parents at the university's student-faculty prom. Keith brings Francey to the prom as his own guest, and Francey, still posing as a student, develops a friendly rapport with Mrs. Morgan, but gets into a nasty brawl with Helen in which Francey accidentally punches Peter's father. Peter says nothing at the prom, but blurts the news to his father just as Mr. Morgan is about to give an important speech, resulting in another argument and another flare-up of Mrs. Morgan's heart condition.

Debates were covered on front pages of college newspapers and emphasized in yearbooks, and team members even received the equivalent of athletic letters for their jackets. There even were rallies sending off the debating teams to matches. Yet, the debates never attained the broad appeal that athletics enjoyed. One reason may be that debates do not have a clear winner, as is the case in sports, and that scoring is subjective. In addition, with late 19th-century concerns about the impact of modern life on the human body, athletics offered hope that neither the individual nor the society was coming apart.\\"? Answer:","completion":"Question: In the passage, what factors are described as contributing to the difference in popularity between early intercollegiate debates and athletics, and how were debates similar to athletics during this time period?

Rallies were also held to send off debating teams to matches. However, debates never achieved the same widespread appeal as athletics.

The decision came after Lord tweeted the Nazi salute \\"Sieg Heil!\\" during a heated exchange with Media Matters chief Angelo Carusone, according to Politico. While CNN stated that \\"Nazi salutes are indefensible,\\" Lord defended his tweet by explaining to Vox that his intention was to mock Nazis and Carusone's alleged attempts to suppress free speech using authoritarian tactics. Jeffrey Lord has had a long and fraught relationship with CNN. Over the past two years, he has become one of the few consistent pro-Trump commentators on the network, which is known for its critical stance towards the current U.S. administration. Lord's tweet, widely condemned as inappropriate, showcased his fervent support for President Trump, even as it drew outrage from many who viewed it as insensitive and offensive. According to Lord, his tweet was not meant as a genuine endorsement of Nazi ideology, but rather as a jab at Carusone and Media Matters' alleged attempts to suppress free speech. He claimed that his tweet was meant to highlight the organization's \\"fascist\\" and \\"Mussolini-style tactics,\\" drawing parallels between these methods and the historical actions of Nazi and fascist regimes. In a statement given to Vox, Lord emphasized his appreciation for the platform CNN had provided him over the past two years. \\"I want to emphasize that I love CNN,\\" he said, adding that he had \\"a lot of respect for Jeff Zucker and all the people there.\\" Despite his respectful words, Lord expressed his disagreement with the network's decision to let him go, maintaining that his tweet was taken out of context. Over the years, Lord has found himself at the center of multiple controversies on CNN. During the primary season, he infamously clashed with fellow commentator Van Jones, asserting that the Ku Klux Klan was a \\"leftist\\" organization. In other notable appearances, Lord called President Trump the \\"Martin Luther King\\" of healthcare, blamed pop singer Ariana Grande for the Manchester terror attack, and told a black panelist that they should apologize for slavery. Anderson Cooper, a prominent journalist and television host at the network, once told Lord that his unwavering support for Trump might extend to defending him even if he were to \\"take a dump on his desk.\\" Ultimately, the network's decision to cut ties with Jeffrey Lord marks the end of a turbulent chapter in the relationship between CNN and one of its most controversial pro-Trump voices. As the news organization continues to cover the turbulent political landscape of the United States, the absence of Lord's perspective will undoubtedly be a notable change for viewers who have grown accustomed to his often provocative and polarizing viewpoints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. The Good, The Bad and The Ugly is a great film, and often regarded as one of the greatest films of all time. I never much paid attention to how the film was lit, but on examination I don’t know what I think of the lighting. Maybe i’m totally wrong, but the lighting seems quite obvious when you pay attention to it, which makes me thing it could have been done better? Certainly the lighting is masterfully done, in the way it properly exposes the characters faces and splashes off and around certain props and objects, adding a great deal of dimension to many of the shots. But it does look quite obvious, once you pay attention to it, especially when you can see multiple shadows coming from a single character. All that said, the lighting is still pretty masterful and I’m very intrigued to properly analyse it. The first shot of the scene has extremely beautiful (even though it is obvious 😉 ) lighting. As the cowboy stands in the hallway you can tell that there is a strong key light coming from the left of the frame, that will light his face once he steps out of the shadows. It seems like there is another light, maybe coming from high up near the roof, lighting the right hand side of the frame, near the back of the hallway. Most likely facing towards the character to light him from his right hand side, to seperate him from the background. The lighting setup of this shot is extremely beautiful the way it enhances the various pieces of wood and props within the frame, and how they’ve managed to keep the cowboy drenched in shadows as he sneaks around, even though there is quite a lot of light within the frame. It looks like they may have used a cutter to achieve that effect as its a very specific area, essentially just the top half of the cowboy thats drenched ins shadow. Theres also this curious black circular shadow which exists at the very top of the door near the cowboys head which permanently stays extremely dark, much darker than the rest of the shadows in the frame. I wonder how they achieved this effect? Maybe a...

Question: What do the bullies do? Movie plot title: Visitor Q Movie plot: The film's plot is often compared to Pier Paolo Pasolini's Teorema, in which a strange visitor to a wealthy family seduces the maid, the son, the mother, the daughter, and finally the father, before leaving a few days after, subsequently changing their lives.[5] The film starts off with a question: \\"Have you ever done it with your Dad?\\"; the viewer then sees Miki Yamazaki, a young prostitute, trying to persuade her father, Kiyoshi, into having sex with her. Her father is videotaping the scene for a documentary he is preparing on Japanese youths. Once it appears the father is letting himself be persuaded, she tells him the price (50,000 Yen). They have sex, the father ejaculates after a very short time and the disappointed daughter informs him it will be 100,000 Yen now, because of this. The father then realizes the camera has been on all along. In the next scene, called \\"Have you ever been hit on the head?\\", a man (Visitor Q) hits the father over the head with a rock for no apparent reason. The film then moves on to a scene titled \\"Have you ever hit your mom?\\" In this scene, the mother, Keiko is working on a jigsaw puzzle, and her hands are shown to have red marks, showing where she was beaten. Her young son, Takuya, comes in and starts throwing things at the already broken apartment walls because he is unhappy with the toothbrush his mother bought him. He then hits his mother with a rug beating stick. Later, bullies from the son's school come to the front of the house and shoot fireworks through the son's bedroom window. The mother is later seen injecting heroin. It does not seem to have a huge effect on her, though, suggesting she is a regular user. On his way back from work, the father is yet again hit on the head by the same man. They both arrive at the father's home and the mother serves them dinner. The father announces that the man will be staying with the family for a while. The son comes down while they are eating and starts beating the mother again.
