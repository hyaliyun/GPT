Vertex brings together farflung employees at new headquarters on South Boston waterfront A tile mosaic depicting a medicine’s chemical formula greets visitors in the lobby. Upstairs, in office space flooded with natural light, employees sit on brightly covered swivel chairs and lean against pillows decorated with elements from the periodic table. And as Ping-Pong players volley outside the cafeteria on a Friday afternoon, dozens of their colleagues gather for the weekly beer hour. Welcome to the new 800 million headquarters of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. on the South Boston Waterfront, where about 1,200 of the drug maker’s research and commercial employees have been united for the first time, in two glass-faced towers connected by a walkway. The complex formally opens Tuesday at a ribbon-cutting Governor Deval Patrick and Mayor Martin J. Walsh are scheduled to attend. It represents the first move of a major life sciences company from Cambridge to Boston’s growing Innovation District, and many see it as a catalyst to accelerate the biomedical industry expansion outside Kendall Square. “There’s something exciting about being there at the beginning of a new hub,” said chief executive Jeffrey M. Leiden, who plans to work to attract other biotech and high-tech businesses to the waterfront through the Massachusetts Competitiveness Partnership. Despite the buzz over Vertex, however, there is little evidence that many large biotechnology companies are preparing to abandon Cambridge any time soon. Even as Vertex was completing plans for the move across the Charles River last fall, the biotech giant Biogen Idec Inc. was opening two new buildings on its Kendall Square campus and moving its corporate headquarters back from suburban Weston. Biogen Idec has scheduled a grand opening reception at its new executive offices next week. For the 25-year-old Vertex, a company known for developing treatments for hepatitis C and the chronic lung disease cystic fibrosis, the new complex on Boston’s Fan Pier brings together far-flung employees long housed in a warren of former factories and offices stretching along the industrial corridor from Cambridgeport to Kendall Square. Many had never met each other before or had interacted only occasionally at company gatherings. “I had lunch with a chemist today that I’ve hardly seen for five years,” said Jim Hogan, a research fellow who helped design the company’s molecular pharmacology lab. “He sat down next to me at lunch and we started talking about one of the projects we’re working on.” But the headquarters isn’t as full as Vertex once anticipated. While the plan was always to leave room for expansion — the complex is 75 to 80 percent occupied — about 175 Boston-area employees who expected to make the move were laid off last fall as part of a round of cuts that cost 370 Vertex workers worldwide their jobs. The reductions followed disclosure that sales of the company’s hepatitis C drug Incivek were declining faster than projected. Even with the cutback, Vertex has been one of the fastest-growing drug makers, adding more than 800 jobs in Massachusetts since 2004. The largest contingent of Boston-area employees, about 1,000, moved to the waterfront after Christmas. The company deployed 120 moving trucks to haul 12,000 crates loaded with 5,500 pieces of laboratory equipment. Most began work in their new offices Jan. 6. More than 100 other workers who remain in Cambridge or in temporary quarters next door on Fan Pier will move to the headquarters in coming weeks. Vertex has been planning its new headquarters complex for several years, deputizing a 40-employee “engagement team” to make design recommendations. Members of the team visited the campuses of Google Inc., Apple Inc., and Pixar Animation Studios in California. The amenities they proposed ranged from an in-house gym and 205-seat auditorium to ground-floor retailers — such as a bank, dry cleaner, and coffee shop — to an outdoor patio off the cafeteria where employees can congregate in warmer weather. The cafeteria is so stocked with gourmet food options that fitness-conscious employees already are warning of the “Fan Pier 15,” an allusion to the feared weight gain of those not taking advantage of the gym. Executives are hoping the new campus, with its stunning views of Boston Harbor, will help Vertex recruit and retain talented scientists and managers who are bored with Kendall Square. Vertex has also set up a “learning lab,” with 3,000 square feet of classroom and laboratory space, for use by students from two nearby Boston public schools — Excel High School and Boston Green Academy — some of whom will be groomed for work as Vertex interns and, eventually, employees. Vertex has tapped Carl Reid, a former industry scientist and teacher with a PhD in microbiology and molecular biology, to run the lab and work with the students. “The idea is to get them excited about science,” Reid said. “A lot of time the teachers don’t have the supplies or equipment or the space to do the experiments they’d like.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"Vertex Pharmaceuticals has created a new headquarters in South Boston Waterfront.

I’d always been curious to learn more about Chihuly, after being introduced to his incredible sculpture suspended over the V&A Museum information desk, a glowing confection of green and white glass whisps. In 1968, after receiving a Fulbright Fellowship, he went to work at the Venini glass factory in Venice, observing the team approach to blowing glass, which is critical to the way he works today. In 1971, Chihuly cofounded Pilchuck Glass School in Washington State. With this international glass center, Chihuly has led the avant-garde in the development of glass as a fine art. His work is included in more than 200 museum collections worldwide. He has been the recipient of many awards, including twelve honorary doctorates and two fellowships from the National Endowment for the Arts. He has also lost an eye to his passion, and now mostly directs the sculpture design and assembly. It was truly amazing. In 1999, Chihuly started an ambitious exhibition, Chihuly in the Light of Jerusalem; where more than 1 million visitors attended the Tower of David Museum to view his installations. In 2001, the Victoria and Albert Museum in London curated the exhibition Chihuly at the V&A.

The President of the United States is often seen arriving or departing from various events, meetings, or public appearances in a limousine. This is not only a symbol of prestige and authority but also provides a high level of security as well as convenience for the president. The other options, although somewhat related to the president's activities and environment, do not accurately represent something that the president always gets in. A. Building - The president often enters various buildings for meetings, conferences, and other official activities, but it is not the primary location or vehicle associated with the president's role. B. White House - While the president resides in the White House, it cannot be considered something he \\"always gets in\\" because it is not a form of transportation or a situation he continuously enters. C. Board Room - While the president attends meetings and participates in discussions in board rooms or other similar spaces, this is not the most defining activity or place associated with the president's role. E. Trouble - This answer option may seem amusing, but it is not relevant to the question as it is not inevitable for a president to \\"always\\" get into trouble. By nature, presidents have numerous responsibilities and decisions to make, which may lead to controversy or disagreement; however, it does not imply a continuous state of trouble.

And I was wondering Why did Ash do this? A:","completion":"Ash's decision to hide on top of the refrigerator during the game of hide-and-seek can be attributed to several reasons that involve strategy, competition, creativity, and the elements of surprise and challenge. Let's explore these reasons in detail: 1. Strategy: In a game of hide-and-seek, the primary objective is to find the most inconspicuous spot where it is difficult for the seeker to find you. Ash may have chosen the refrigerator as a hiding spot due to its strategic placement within the room, given that it is often overlooked as a potential hiding spot, compared to more standard options like under a table or behind a curtain. 2. Competition: The competitive nature of the game drives participants to outwit each other and find the most elusive hiding spots. Ash's decision to climb on top of the refrigerator can be seen as an attempt to gain an advantage over Sasha by hiding in a location that may be difficult for Sasha to reach or notice. 3. Creativity: Hide-and-seek requires participants to think outside the box and come up with innovative ideas for hiding spots. Ash's choice of hiding place demonstrates a creative approach to the game, by selecting an unconventional location that others might not have considered. 4. Surprise Factor: By choosing a less-obvious hiding spot such as on top of the refrigerator, Ash was able to introduce an element of surprise to the game. This not only made the game more challenging and enjoyable but also increased the likelihood of catching Sasha off-guard, further prolonging the game and adding to the excitement. 5. Challenge: The heightened difficulty of reaching and maintaining a position on top of the refrigerator may have also appealed to Ash. The challenge involved in both climbing and staying on top of the refrigerator without being detected could have added an extra layer of thrill and excitement to the game for Ash. 6. Familiarity with the Environment: If Ash is experienced with the specific room or area and has a good understanding of common hiding spots, they might have felt more comfortable choosing an unconventional location like the refrigerator. In this case, they could have anticipated that Sasha would be less likely to check such a spot, adding to the strategy behind their decision. In conclusion, Ash's decision to hide on top of the refrigerator during the hide-and-seek game with Sasha can be attributed to a mixture of strategic thinking, competitive spirit, creativity, the element of surprise, a desire for a challenge, and familiarity with the environment. This choice resulted in a more engaging and exciting game, as it forced Sasha to think beyond obvious hiding spots and search more thoroughly."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Friday, October 24, 2014 ISTANBUL, TURKEY—A thirteenth-century city founded by Batu Khan, a descendant of Genghis Khan, is being excavated in Russia. Located along the Volga River, this prosperous city, known as Ukek, was part of the Golden Horde kingdom, which controlled many of the Silk Road trade routes connecting China and Europe. Christianity, Islam, and Shamanism were all practiced in Ukek. Archaeologists from the Saratov Regional Museum of Local Lore are currently excavating two temples in the city’s Christian quarter. The earlier temple had a tile roof and was decorated inside and out with murals and stone carvings. “Some items belonging to the local elite were found in the Christian district. Among other things, there is a Chinese glass hair pin, with a head shaped as a split pomegranate, and a fragment of a bone plate with a carved dragon image,” archaeologist Dmitriy Kubankin told Live Science. Goods such as imported fine plates and bottles were found stored in the temple’s basement. When that temple was destroyed, a second was built with stone walls and a tile roof. The city was eventually conquered by Tamerlane in 1395. Kubankin presented his team’s findings at the recent meeting of the European Association of Archaeologists. To read about the excavation of medieval fortifications in Siberia, see ARCHAEOLOGY's \\"Fortress of Solitude.\\" ||||| Archaeologists with the Saratov Regional Museum of Local Lore have uncovered part of the ancient city of Ukek, founded by the descendents of Genghis Khan. Remains of a 750-year-old city, founded by the descendents of Genghis Khan, have been unearthed along the Volga River in Russia. Among the discoveries are two Christian temples one of which has stone carvings and fine ceramics. The city’s name was Ukek and it was founded just a few decades after Genghis Khan died in 1227. After the great conqueror’s death his empire split apart and his grandson Batu Khan, who lived from 1205 to 1255, founded the Golden Horde (also called the Kipchak Khanate).The Golden Horde kingdom stretched from Eastern Europe to Central Asia and controlled many of the Silk Road trade routes that connected China to Medieval Europe. This city of Ukek was built close to the khan's summer residence along the Volga River, something which helped it become prosperous. The name \\"Golden Horde\\" comes from the golden tent from which the khan was said to rule. [See Photos of the Medieval 'Golden Horde' City and Artifacts] Christian quarter Archaeologists with the Saratov Regional Museum of Local Lore have discovered the Christian quarter of Ukek, shedding light on the Christian people who lived under the Khan's rule. Ukek was a multicultural city, where a variety of religious beliefs were practiced including Islam, Christianity and Shamanism. While Christians did not rule the Golden Horde, the discoveries archaeologists made show that not all the Christians were treated as slaves, and people of wealth frequented the Christian quarter of the city. \\"Some items belonging to local elite were found in the Christian district,\\" Dmitriy Kubankin, an archaeologist with the Saratov Regional Museum of Local Lore, told Live Science in an email.\\"Among other things, there is a Chinese glass hair pin, with a head shaped as a split pomegranate, and a fragment of a bone plate with a carved dragon image.\\" Stone temples Among the discoveries are the basements of two Christian temples. In eastern Christianity churches are sometimes called temples. A bas relief showing a lion being clawed by a griffin was found in the remains of a Christian temple at the Ukek city site. Credit: Photo courtesy Dmitriy Kubankin One of the temples was built around 1280 and was destroyed in the early 14th century. \\"It was roofed with tiles and decorated with murals and stone carving[s], both, from the outside and inside,\\" Kubankinsaid. \\"The best-preserved bas relief (a type of stone carving) features a lion being clawed by a griffin,\\" said Kubankin, noting that another carving depicts a cross. Within the basement of the temple, archaeologists found the remains of goods that may have been stored by local merchants, including fine plates and bottles that were imported from the Byzantine Empire, Egypt or Iran. \\"Any church cellar was considered a safe place to store goods in it, therefore, merchants from the nearest neighborhood used to keep (objects) of sale there,\\" Kubankin said. After the first Christian temple was destroyed in the early 14th century, a second temple was built in 1330 and remained in use until about 1350. \\"Most probably, it was stone-walled and had a tile roof. A part of its foundation with the apse has been unearthed,\\" Kubankin said. The fall of Ukek The city of Ukek did not last for long. During the 14th century, the Golden Horde began to decline, and in 1395 Ukek was attacked by a ruler named Tamerlane, a man out to build an empire of his own. He destroyed Ukek and took over much of the territory formerly ruled by the Golden Horde, dealing them a blow from which they would never recover. Today modern-day buildings cover much of Ukek. \\"This hampers any research and prevents complete unearthing of the entire [site], because it extends over several private land plots,\\" Kubankin said. “Nevertheless, digging just in one site may lead to significant discoveries. Archaeological expeditions from the Saratov Regional Museum of Local Lore [have made] yearly excavations since 2005,\\" said Kubankin, adding thatthese discoveries will soon be featured in a museum exhibition. Kubankin presented the team's finds recently at the European Association of Archaeologists' annual meeting in Istanbul. The study is supported by the Saratov Regional Ministry of Culture, Russian Humanitarian Research Foundation grant (project 12-31-01246) and by the RIMKER Company.

Paragraph: Strategies for containing an emerging infectious disease outbreak must be nonpharmaceutical when drugs or vaccines for the pathogen do not yet exist or are unavailable. The success of these non-pharmaceutical strategies will depend not only on the effectiveness of quarantine or other isolation measures but also on the epidemiological characteristics of the infection. However, there is currently no systematic framework to assess the relationship between different containment strategies and the natural history and epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Here, we compare the effectiveness of quarantine and symptom monitoring, implemented via contact tracing, in controlling epidemics using an agent-based branching model. We examine the relationship between epidemic containment and the disease dynamics of symptoms and infectiousness for seven case study diseases with diverse natural histories including Ebola, Influenza A, and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). We show that the comparative effectiveness of symptom monitoring and quarantine depends critically on the natural history of the infectious disease, its inherent transmissibility, and the intervention feasibility in the particular healthcare setting. The benefit of quarantine over symptom monitoring is generally maximized for fast-course diseases, but we show the conditions under which symptom monitoring alone can control certain outbreaks. This quantitative framework can guide policy-makers on how best to use non-pharmaceutical interventions to contain emerging outbreaks and prioritize research during an outbreak of a novel pathogen.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir. Johnston features as head chorister on one of the choir's albums, The Choral Music of F.W Wadely, released in November 2008.

Vespasian began construction of the amphitheatre around AD 70 and it was completed by his son Titus who became emperor following Vespasian's death in AD 79. Titus' reign began with months of disasters – including the eruption of Mount Vesuvius, a fire in Rome, and an outbreak of plague – he inaugurated the completion of the structure with lavish games that lasted for more than one hundred days, perhaps in an attempt to appease the Roman public and the gods. Little literary evidence survives of the activities of the gladiatorial training and fighting (ludi). They appear to have followed the standard format of the Roman games: animal entertainments in the morning session, followed by the executions of criminals around midday, with the afternoon session reserved for gladiatorial combats and recreations of famous battles. The animal entertainments, which featured creatures from throughout the Roman Empire, included extravagant hunts and fights between different species. Animals also played a role in some executions which were staged as recreations of myths and historical events. Naval battles formed part of the spectacles but whether these took place in the amphitheatre or on a lake that had been specially constructed by Augustus is a topic of debate among historians. Only three contemporary or near-contemporary accounts of the games survive. The works of Suetonius and Cassius Dio focus on major events, while Martial provides some fragments of information on individual entertainments and the only detailed record of a gladiatorial combat in the arena known to survive: the fight between Verus and Priscus., can you guess it ?

Twenty Palaeolithic sites have been identified in the Mendips, of which eleven represent faunal remains and lithic artefacts recovered from caves. The remaining eight sites refer to surface lithic discoveries, and the artefacts found include points, scrapers, and handaxes. Twenty-seven Mesolithic finds are represented by flint and chert lithics. Large numbers of artefacts have been found near Neolithic, Iron Age, and Bronze Age features, such as the barrows and forts around Priddy and at Dolebury Warren. The caves of Cheddar Gorge have yielded many archaeological remains, as flood waters have washed artefacts and bones into the caves and preserved them in silt. The Cheddar Man, Britain's oldest complete skeleton, was found in Gough's Cave, part of the Cheddar Complex.Within the Mendip Hills AONB, good evidence exists for 286 definite examples of round barrows, including the Priddy Nine Barrows and Ashen Hill Barrow Cemeteries. The Historic England Archive holds over 1,200 entries for the area, and there are over 600 listed buildings, in addition to over 200 scheduled ancient monuments. These protected monuments range from prehistoric barrows and hillforts to the Black Down bombing decoy from the Second World War.Settlement on the Mendip Hills appears to fall into two types. The first, apparent in the Neolithic and Bronze Age Britain periods, and repeated on a small scale in the Middle Ages and post-medieval era, comprised occupation by self-sufficient groups in small communities or isolated farms. The second was represented in the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods by large sites with specialist functions, existing by virtue of their ability to exert power over lowland producers. From the Iron Age onward the ownership of land took on increasing importance, with large landholdings based on the mines or on stock grazing, denying settlers access to the plateau or forcing them off the hills.There is evidence of mining dating back to the late Bronze Age, when there were technological changes in metal-working... The answer to this question is:","completion":"The culture's invasion of the hills that were occupied by two types of settlements was most likely for silver can be attributed to the Iron Age Britain and Roman periods. These large sites with specialist functions exerted power over lowland producers and had significant control over land, mines, and stock grazing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Formatting and Presentation: A computer allows you to format your essay effectively and consistently. This includes features like font styles, sizes, margins, and line spacing. Moreover, you can add images, graphs, charts, and tables to your essay, which is difficult or impossible to do on paper. 3. Collaboration: Writing and editing your essay using a computer also allows you to collaborate with other people more easily. You can share your document with a peer, teacher, or academic advisor for feedback, suggestions, and even real-time collaboration. This is virtually impossible if you're working with a handwritten document. 4. Spell Check and Grammar Check: A major advantage of using a computer is that it comes with built-in spell check and grammar check tools. These tools help identify and correct spelling, punctuation, and grammar errors, ensuring a more polished final document. 5. Text Search: When editing a lengthy essay, searching for specific words or phrases can be tedious on a physical paper. On a computer, however, the 'Find' function allows you to search for particular keywords or phrases with just a few clicks, making the editing process more efficient. 6. Saving Versions and Revision History: A computer allows you to save multiple versions of your essay file. This can be particularly helpful if you decide to revert to an older version or compare changes made over time. On paper, this would be difficult, as you might need to keep duplicate copies which can become confusing and cumbersome. 7. Cloud Storage: Having your essay saved on a computer means that you can back it up to cloud storage services like Google Drive, OneDrive, or Dropbox. This ensures your work is safe even if something happens to your physical device, like theft, loss, or damage. 8. Environmentally Friendly: Writing and editing an essay on a computer is more eco-friendly compared to using paper.

Paul is a young womanizer living in a small Southern town, where he earns a living fixing cars for his uncle. Paul still lives with his mother, Elvira, who works as a clown cheering up children at the local hospital. He spends most of his time hanging out with his best friend and self-proclaimed partner-in-crime, Tip, and their friends Bo and Bust-Ass. Among his friends, Paul has a reputation as a ladies' man, but he is not at all known for being involved with long-term relationships; most of Paul's romances last only a few weeks, and he's slept with nearly every girl in town. Paul is beginning to reach a point where he would like to lead a different life, and that feeling becomes all the more clear when he meets Noel, Tip's teenage sister who returns home after attending a boarding school. Noel is more thoughtful and mature than the girls Paul is used to. Paul and Noel soon fall in love, but for Paul this is a different sort of relationship than he's accustomed to — Noel is still a virgin, and her contemplative nature gives him a desire to be a better, stronger person, but Tip does not approve of Paul dating his younger sister, which leads to a rift between these longtime friends.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who did not say there was nothing left to Moses of Moses: Qushayri or Sufi?\\" is in \\"Moses, in 7:143, comes the way of those who are in love, he asks for a vision but his desire is denied, he is made to suffer by being commanded to look at other than the Beloved while the mountain is able to see God. The mountain crumbles and Moses faints at the sight of God's manifestation upon the mountain. In Qushayri's words, Moses came like thousands of men who traveled great distances, and there was nothing left to Moses of Moses. In that state of annihilation from himself, Moses was granted the unveiling of the realities. From the Sufi point of view, God is the always the beloved and the wayfarer's longing and suffering lead to realization of the truths.\\". Can you tell me what it is?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who did not say there was nothing left to Moses of Moses: Qushayri or Sufi?\\" is Qushayri. In the context provided, Qushayri, a Persian Sufi, speaks about the spiritual journey of Moses in relation to the Quranic verse 7:143. He highlights how Moses, after undergoing a long and challenging journey, reaches a state of complete self-annihilation, where there is nothing left to him of his own identity. This state is attained through profound love for and longing to be with God, a key concept in Sufism. In this state, Moses is granted the unveiling of the hidden truths and realization of the divine reality. Qushayri's commentary emphasizes the importance of spiritual struggle, self-transformation, and reliance on God's grace for attaining greater proximity to the Divine. This is a central idea in Sufi thought, which focuses on the inner journey of the seeker aiming to overcome the limitations of the self, purify the heart, and attain closeness to the Ultimate Reality through love and devotion. Hence, it is Qushayri who said, \\"there was nothing left to Moses of Moses,\\" illustrating the mystical annihilation of self (fana) that leads to the unveiling of divine truths and realities."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Context: In nature, the red color of blood comes from hemoglobin, the iron-containing protein found in the red blood cells of all vertebrates. The red color of the Grand Canyon and other geological features is caused by hematite or red ochre, both forms of iron oxide. It also causes the red color of the planet Mars. The red sky at sunset and sunrise is caused by an optical effect known as Rayleigh scattering, which, when the sun is low or below the horizon, increases the red-wavelength light that reaches the eye. The color of autumn leaves is caused by pigments called anthocyanins, which are produced towards the end of summer, when the green chlorophyll is no longer produced. One to two percent of the human population has red hair; the color is produced by high levels of the reddish pigment pheomelanin (which also accounts for the red color of the lips) and relatively low levels of the dark pigment eumelanin.

The company, retaining the title \\"Sadler's Wells Opera\\", opened at the Coliseum on 21 August 1968, with a new production of Mozart's Don Giovanni, directed by Sir John Gielgud. Though this production was not well received, the company rapidly established itself with a succession of highly praised productions of other works. Arlen died in January 1972, and was succeeded as managing director by Lord Harewood.The success of the 1968 Mastersingers was followed in the 1970s by the company's first Ring cycle, conducted by Goodall, with a new translation by Andrew Porter and designs by Ralph Koltai. The cast included Norman Bailey, Rita Hunter and Alberto Remedios. In Harewood's view, among the highlights of the first ten years at the Coliseum were the Ring, Prokofiev's War and Peace, and Richard Strauss's Salome and Der Rosenkavalier. The company's musical director from 1970 to 1977 was Charles Mackerras. Harewood praised his exceptional versatility, with a range \\"from The House of the Dead to Patience.\\" Among the operas he conducted for the company were Handel's Julius Caesar starring Janet Baker and Valerie Masterson; five Janáček operas; The Marriage of Figaro with pioneering use of 18th century performing style; Massenet's Werther; Donizetti's Mary Stuart with Baker; and Sullivan's Patience. The company took the production of the last to the Vienna Festival in 1975, along with Britten's Gloriana. Sir Charles Groves succeeded Mackerras as musical director from 1978 to 1979, but Groves was unwell and unhappy during his brief tenure. Starting in 1979, Mark Elder succeeded Groves in the post, and described Groves \\"immensely encouraging and supportive\\".A long-standing concern of Arlen and then Harewood was the need to change the company's name to reflect the fact that it was no longer based at Sadler's Wells theatre.

The equation -7*v - 300 + 286 can be simplified by combining the constant terms (-300 and 286). -7*v - 300 + 286 = -7*v - 14 Now our equation looks like this: -7*v - 14 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable v. To isolate v, we need to eliminate the constant term from the left side of the equation. We'll do this by adding 14 to both sides of the equation. -7*v - 14 + 14 = 0 + 14 This simplifies to: -7*v = 14 Step 3: Solve for v. Now, we need to get v by itself. To do this, we'll divide both sides of the equation by -7.

The genre developed from roots in African musical traditions, African-American work songs and European-American folk music. Blues incorporated spirituals, work songs, field hollers, shouts, chants, and rhymed simple narrative ballads. The blues form, ubiquitous in jazz, rhythm and blues and rock and roll, is characterized by the call-and-response pattern, the blues scale and specific chord progressions, of which the twelve-bar blues is the most common.

Top 40 is also an alternative term for the radio format of such music, also known as Contemporary hit radio. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'genre' with 'pop'. Answer:","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'genre' with 'pop' is Sir Elton Hercules John. Sir Elton John is an acclaimed English singer, pianist, and composer who has enjoyed a successful and enduring career. Although he is known for his expansive portfolio that covers diverse genres, one of the specific genres mentioned in the text is pop. This information is contained in the paragraph about him, where pop music is identified as one of the major genres he has been involved with during his illustrious career. This relation is further confirmed by other details in the provided information. For example, the contemporary hit radio format, commonly known as 'Top 40', often includes Elton John's songs, as is stated in the paragraph explaining the Top 40 concept. The fact that his records regularly appear in this format, predominantly populated by pop musical pieces, further substantiates the tie between him and the genre of pop music. Furthermore, his collaboration with Bernie Taupin, an experienced lyricist, has contributed significantly to his success in pop. Taupin’s talent for writing universally relatable lyrics that resonate with a wide demographic is a characteristic feature of pop music. Finally, the song \\"Candle in the Wind\\" is mentioned as a seminal piece by Elton John, which was re-penned and re-recorded as a tribute to Princess Diana in 1997.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump attempted to reset his relationship with Africa on Monday, as he hosted Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari. Buhari is the first sub-Saharan African leader to have a White House summit with Trump, who has been criticized for reportedly making derogatory comments about Africa. During his public remarks with Buhari, Trump focused mostly on common goals and shared interests, such as fighting terrorism and expanding trade. \\"We love helicopters — he loves them more than I do,\\" joked Trump, referring to his administration's decision to approve a 600 million military sales deal to Nigeria. Buhari thanked Trump for approving the deal, which the administration of former President Barack Obama had suspended over allegations of human rights abuses. \\"I worked it out so that now you can buy the helicopters that you want,\\" Trump said, adding, \\"We make the best military equipment in the world, and our friends can now buy it.\\" Human rights groups have accused the Nigerian military of torture, rape and extrajudicial killing in its almost decade-long campaign against the Boko Haram extremist group. Tens of thousands of people have been killed in the insurgency, and hundreds of schoolgirls kidnapped, as the group gained notoriety and spread to neighboring countries, posing one of the most severe threats to West Africa's Sahel region in recent years. Although Nigeria has been a major partner in the U.S. fight against Islamist extremists in Africa, relations have faced challenges over the past year. In January, Nigeria joined a list of outraged African countries demanding an explanation from the U.S. ambassador after Trump's reported vulgar comments referring to African countries. Asked whether those comments came up during his private meeting with Trump, Buhari declined to comment. \\"I'm very careful with what the press says about other than myself. I'm not sure about, you know, the validity or whether that allegation was true or not. So, the best thing for me is to keep quiet,\\" Buhari said. Question: After President Buhari's meeting with Trump, how does he really feel about President Trump? Options: - He doesn't believe President Trump feels remorse for his comments - He is very cautious, but will use the relationship to his advantage - He believes they both suspended any ill feelings - not enough information","completion":"Answer: not enough information"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Would \\"They are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement for large amounts of aggregate in those materials.\\" be a reasonable answer? Pick your answer from: a). No. b). Yes. The answer is:","completion":"b). Yes. A rock quarry, also known as a stone quarry, is a site where natural rock formations are excavated to extract various types of stone such as granite, limestone, marble, and sandstone. These extracted materials, collectively called aggregates, are widely used in construction, landscaping, and other industries. The process of extracting rocks from a quarry involves cutting, blasting, or breaking the rocks into smaller, manageable pieces. The statement \\"They are often collocated with concrete and asphalt plants due to the requirement for large amounts of aggregate in those materials\\" is indeed a reasonable answer. This is because both concrete and asphalt production require significant quantities of aggregates as primary components in their respective mixtures. Due to the high demand for aggregates in these industries, it is efficient for rock quarries to be situated close to concrete and asphalt plants, which helps minimize transportation costs, reduces carbon emissions, and ensures a steady supply of raw materials. The proximity also enables more effective quality control, ensuring that the aggregates being used are of optimal size and composition. To further elaborate, in concrete production, aggregates (a mix of fine and coarse materials) constitute about 60% to 75% of the concrete's total volume. These aggregates provide strength and stability to the concrete structure. Similarly, in asphalt production, aggregates form the foundation of the pavement, accounting for 90% to 95% of the asphalt mixture, which offers durability and support to the road surface. In conclusion, rock quarries play a vital role in providing essential raw materials for various industries, particularly for concrete and asphalt production. Thus, collocating these facilities near each other offers numerous logistical and operational advantages, making it a reasonable practice in the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The neutral choice is a sentence that neither agrees nor disagrees with the statement. Indicate your answer as '1', '2', or '3', corresponding to the choice number of the selected sentence. If sentence X agrees with sentence Y, one's correctness follows from the other one. If sentence X disagrees with sentence Y, they can not be correct at the same time. Q: Statement: Half of them die within five years of diagnosis. Choices: 1. All of the die within two years of their diagnosis. 2. Some of them live a full life after being diagnosed. 3. Fifty percent of them die within five years after they receive a diagnosis. A:","completion":"The task involves drawing conclusions based on a given statement and comparing it to three other sentences. It's a matter of inference and common sense. The goal is to find the \\"neutral\\" option - one that neither agrees nor contradicts the original statement. Here's a step-by-step guide of how to go about this task: 1. Read the statement: \\"Half of them die within five years of diagnosis.\\" 2. Analyze the three other sentences: Sentence 1: \\"All of the die within two years of their diagnosis.\\" This statement disagrees with the original. It is not neutral because if all dies within two years, then it's not possible that half dies within five years. Sentence 2: \\"Some of them live a full life after being diagnosed.\\" This statement is the neutral one because it does not provide any specific percentage or timeline that might contradict the original claim that half of them die within five years of diagnosis. It merely states that there are some who live a full life following diagnosis, which could also imply that the other half (mentioned in the original statement) might not. Sentence 3: \\"Fifty percent of them die within five years after they receive a diagnosis.\\" This statement agrees with the initial statement as both refer to the same outcome for 50% of the subjects within five years of diagnosis. Thereby, making it not neutral since if one is correct, so is the other. 3. After inferring all the sentences, understand that the goal is to find the neutral one, that neither aligns nor contrasts with the original statement. 4. Hence, your answer should be '2' corresponding with the second sentence which is \\"Some of them live a full life after being diagnosed.\\" This sentence neither contradicts nor validates the original statement, making it the neutral choice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The White House said Monday that President Donald Trump \\"doesn't believe any of these accusations\\" made by adult film actress Stormy Daniels that she had a one-night affair with the future U.S. leader in 2006 and five years later was threatened to keep quiet about their alleged liaison. Trump spokesman Raj Shah rejected any suggestion that Trump had engaged in wrongdoing because his personal attorney, Michael Cohen, paid the porn star 130,000 from his own funds in hush money shortly before the 2016 presidential election. \\"False charges are settled out of court all the time,\\" said Shah, who faced a barrage of questions from reporters after a lengthy Daniels interview aired Sunday night on 60 Minutes, a CBS News show that drew its biggest ratings in a decade for the spectacle. \\"He's consistently denied these accusations,\\" Shah said of Trump. The spokesman said the 39-year-old Daniels, whose real name is Stephanie Clifford, was \\"inconsistent\\" because she has at various times denied she had a sexual encounter with Trump, but now claims she is telling the truth that she met up with him at a celebrity golf tournament in Nevada. Shah also dismissed Daniels' claim that in 2011, when she was on her way to a fitness class in Las Vegas with her infant daughter, she was approached by a stranger who threatened her. \\"A guy walked up on me and said to me, 'Leave Trump alone. Forget the story,' \\" Daniels told journalist Anderson Cooper. \\"And then he leaned around and looked at my daughter and said, 'That's a beautiful little girl. It'd be a shame if something happened to her mom.' And then he was gone.\\" Trump has yet to comment directly on Daniels' story. However, he posted a Twitter comment Monday that seemed to allude to the controversy. Daniels says the Las Vegas incident occurred shortly after she first tried to sell her story about her encounter with Trump to a tabloid magazine. She said the incident made her fearful for years and that she thought she was doing the right thing when she accepted 130,000 from Trump... Who consistently denied the accusations?

Article:","completion":"Title: Brave Footballer Battles Injuries Post Major On-Field Incident In a shocking turn of events, John O'Donoghue, a 26-year-old footballer, encountered a severe injury during a recent game that left spectators and teammates in a state of worry. In the heat of the moment, while defending a corner kick, O'Donoghue collided forcefully with the goalkeeper, the impact of which had ominous consequences. While on-field collisions are not uncommon in the fast-paced, high-energy realm of football, the magnitude of O'Donoghue's injury intensified the situation to a grave level. The exceptional force of the collision was such that it ripped a 2cm hole in his intestine. This kind of injury in a football game is incredibly rare and highlights the potential risks in even the most routine aspects of the game. As soon as the severity of the injury was realized, quick actions were employed leading to O'Donoghue undergoing emergency surgery. Medical professionals battled for four grueling hours, performing intricate procedures to treat the damage and save this promising footballer's life. Following the intense surgery, an outpour of support from the football community has flooded in for O'Donoghue. His teammates, rivals, fans, and even individuals who don't follow the sport have rallied around him, a testament to the human spirit that transcends the boundaries of the game. O'Donoghue's injury underscores the immense dedication and physical risks these athletes take every time they step onto the pitch. It's a stark reminder of the fragility of health and the high stakes that can come even from doing something one loves. As we await further updates on O'Donoghue's condition, the hope is resilient for his full recovery and eventual return to the football pitch, where his heart truly belongs.

The final large reception room on the first floor is the Hondecoeter Room (16), so named because of the three huge oil paintings by Melchior d'Hondecoeter (1636–1695), depicting scenes of birds in courtyards, which are fitted into the neo-Carolean panelling. The panelling was introduced to the room by the 3rd Earl Brownlow in 1876, when it was furnished as the principal dining room of the mansion. The room was initially created as a library in 1808 from the upper part of the earlier kitchen which had originally risen two stories. The West staircase (14) was originally a service stairs, and would have been plainer in decor, but by the late nineteenth century it was in regular use by the family.Either side of the Marble Hall, lie the Great Staircase (2) and the Tapestry Room (11), which contains a collection of early eighteenth century Mortlake tapestries. The Great Staircase to the east of the Marble Hall is unusually placed at Belton, as in a house of this period one would expect to find the staircase in the hall. The stairs rise in three flights around the west, north, and east walls to the former Great Dining Room above the Marble Hall. Thus the staircase served as an important state procession link between the three principal reception rooms of the house. The Great Dining Room, now the Library, has been greatly altered and all traces of Carolean decoration removed, first by James Wyatt in 1778 when it was transformed into a drawing room with a vaulted ceiling, and again in 1876, when its use was again changed, this time to a library. The room contains some 6000 volumes, a superb example of book collecting over 350 years. When Lord Tyrconnel died in 1754 a catalogue of his library identified almost 2,300 books. Almost all of these remain in the Belton library today. Rupert Gunnis attributed the carved marble chimneypiece depicting two Roman goddesses to Sir Richard Westmacott.Leading from the Library is the Queen's Room, the former \\"Best Bed Chamber\\".

Please answer the following question: When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun , that hemisphere receives more direct sunlight, and direct sunlight causes higher temperatures. Given these facts, a hemisphere tilted toward the sun is likely to have what among the following options: - higher taxes - colors of the spectrum - fewer automobiles - wavelengths and photons - higher temperatures - rays or beams - electromagnetic energy - higher mountains Answer:","completion":"A hemisphere tilted toward the sun is likely to have higher temperatures. When a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, it receives more direct sunlight than the opposing hemisphere. Direct sunlight refers to the sun's rays hitting the Earth's surface at a more perpendicular angle, as opposed to oblique or slanted sunlight. As a direct result of this difference in angles, the sunlight becomes more intense and concentrated in a smaller area, leading to an increase in temperatures in that region. The phenomenon of a hemisphere's tilt towards or away from the sun is responsible for the Earth's seasonal changes. During the course of the Earth's orbit around the sun, both hemispheres experience different levels of sunlight exposure due to the Earth's axial tilt of about 23.5 degrees. This tilt causes one hemisphere to lean towards the sun during a particular period, leading to warmer temperatures and longer days as seen in the corresponding summer season. Conversely, during the same period, the other hemisphere leans away from the sun, resulting in colder temperatures and shorter days as experienced during that hemisphere's winter season. Out of the options given, the other choices are not directly related to the tilt of the hemisphere towards the sun. Higher taxes, fewer automobiles, and higher mountains are socio-economic or topographic factors that do not have a causal relationship with direct sunlight exposure. Similarly, colors of the spectrum, wavelengths and photons, rays or beams, and electromagnetic energy are all related to the properties and behavior of light itself but are not outcomes that would result specifically from a hemisphere being tilted toward the sun. In summary, when a hemisphere is tilted towards the sun, that hemisphere experiences more direct sunlight, leading to increased temperatures. This tilt is responsible for creating seasonal changes and variations in weather and climate conditions throughout different regions on Earth. Among the given options, higher temperatures are the most likely outcome of a hemisphere being tilted toward the sun."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it.

Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety.

Dr. Seward's dedication to finding new treatments and groundbreaking therapies have earned him a sterling reputation in the medical community. However, there is one case that continues to elude his understanding – the enigmatic and disturbed patient named R. M. Renfield. Renfield is an incredibly intelligent and captivating individual, but his odd behaviors and obsession with consuming insects and animals have led to his isolation within the institution. Whispers of his connection to the infamous Dracula haunt the air, but Dr. Seward has not quite been able to piece together the truth about his patient's past. As Dr. Seward delves deeper into Renfield's psyche, attempting to unravel the mystery of his condition, he starts facing inexplicable occurrences in his own life. Soon enough, he starts questioning his own sanity and his personal life begins to disintegrate rapidly. This, however, only fuels Dr. Seward's determination to uncover Renfield's secrets and save him from the darkness that appears to be consuming him. His investigations lead him to the darkest corners of the town, where he stumbles upon a secret society that worships a demonic entity known as \\"The Master.\\" As he struggles to reconcile science with the supernatural, the lines between reality and illusion become increasingly blurred. Dr. Seward eventually uncovers a chilling connection between Renfield, the secret society, and The Master. Renfield's condition, it turns out, is the result of a harrowing indoctrination process he was forcibly subjected to by the cult. His obsession with consuming living beings is an attempt to satiate The Master's insatiable hunger for life energy, an aspect Renfield has absorbed through his connection with the demonic entity. With time running out and Renfield's condition worsening, Dr. Seward is forced to confront The Master and his minions, while simultaneously trying to rekindle hope in his patient and facilitate his healing. The psychiatrist's dedication and unyielding spirit eventually weakens The Master's hold on Renfield, leading to an intense confrontation between the weakened deity and Dr. Seward. In a dramatic climax, the secret society is disbanded, and The Master is vanquished, freeing Renfield from his torment. Dr. Seward's bravery and determination save not only Renfield's life but also the entire town of Whitby from the darkness that once threatened its existence. The two men forge an unbreakable bond, and Dr. Seward continues his work at Hillingham Asylum, inspired by the challenges he has overcome and the patients he has yet to save."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given a sentence and a profession that is mentioned in the sentence.

Not only does he want to say it well, but he wants it to be something that has not been said before. He hopes that the public will listen and understand ----he wants to teach them, and he wants them to learn from him. What visional artists like painters want to teach is easy to make out but difficult to explain, because painters translate their experience into shapes and colors, not words. They seem to feel that a certain choice of shapes and colors, out of the countless billions possible, is very interesting for them and worth showing to us. Without their work we should never have noticed these particular shapes and colors, or have felt the delight which they brought to the artists. Most artists take their shapes and colors from the world of nature and from human bodies in movement and at rest; their choices show that these aspects of the world are worth looking at, that they contain beautiful sights. Modern artists might say that they only choose subjects that provide an interesting pattern, that there is nothing more in it.

We show sadness and happiness through our expressions. But exactly how many emotions can our face make?Scientists used to believe we had six basic facial expressions that tell others how we feel: sad, happy, surprised, fearful, angry and disgusted . But a new study shows that our faces can do more than we think. Scientists from Ohio State University found out that humans can actually make 21 different facial expressions after studying how people move their facial muscles. The scientists took pictures of 230 volunteers making faces in response to different cues .These cues included phrases like \\"you just got some great unexpected news\\", which produced a \\"happily surprised\\" reaction from volunteers. Other cues included \\"you smell a bad odor \\", which caused \\"disgusted\\" faces. In total, around 5,000 pictures were taken of the volunteers. The scientists then studied similarities of these pictures using a computer expression database. _ helped them to define a facial expression. \\"That tells us that these 21 emotions are expressed in the same way by nearly everyone,\\" said DrAleix Martinez to The Daily Telegraph. For example, to express surprise, 92 percent of volunteers widened their eyes and opened their mouth. And 99 percent raised their cheeks and smiled to show being happy.

Article: Sales of electric bicycles, or e-bikes, a hot item in consumer green tech, are expected to grow by more than 50% in North America during 2013. Actor William Shatner, who is no stranger to futuristic tech, recently purchased two e-bikes for him and his wife. I've been shopping for an e-bike now for a few weeks, and I've had my eye on the folding electric bike. I've had folding bikes in the past and love the convenience of being able to throw my bike into my car. The e -bike market is ready to go mainstream in the U.S. The price for e-bikes has come down greatly in recent months. At one time, most e-bikes with good components and proper weight were in the 3,000range. Now you can find reasonable quality e-bikes in the 1,000range. With gas prices at all-time highs, e-bikes are an attractive, low-cost option to gas efficient vehicles. E-bike owners are finding that they are great for commuting to work, as traditional bikes can be a problem with office dress and sweat. People who use e-bikes range from commuters to casual cyclers who like a little help with hills and wind,to those who decided to save money on buying a motor bike.These are not for the serious road cycler or professional mountain biker. If you're considering all e--bike, it pays to do some research first.Cheaper e-bikes are going to be heavier and have less battery--power.Higher priced bikes will be made from lighter materials and have better batteries. Another consideration is local motor vehicle laws.For example,according to US federal law,as long as your electric bike is under 750 watts and does not go over 20 MPH then it is a bicycle and not a motor vehicle.Most consumer e--bikes in the 1,000 range don't fit the motorized vehicle description.

Q: Jimbob Blakey wasn't so much given birth to as clambered right out of his mother himself. He weighed in at almost thirteen pounds, came ready-fitted with a shock of fat black hair and a couple of razor teeth. Jimbob's folks loved him like most folks love their little ones, maybe more. They'd been trying so hard for a child, suffered more mid-term miscarriages than the ewes they shuttled off to market most Thursdays. They dressed him in a one-year babygro and took him home to their hill farm. They fought to get up nights and give him his milk. His teeth made breast-feeding impossible. They sat hours gazing down in his cot. They dressed him fine and took him to their church and gave their thanks. Showed him off like the proud parents they were. Others cooed and smiled. But they never asked to hold. They gave thanks the Blakeys were happy, and that the monkey-baby had not been born to them. Jimbob's folks never gave a second thought that their boy might be different. The first Spring he walked, he stomped the moors in his welly-boots helping herd the pregnant ewes down in-by. He copied his father, kicking and cuffing at the stragglers, when the flock was returned to the hills in May. As Jimbob grew, his hair became thicker, his arms longer. His head shrunk down on his shoulders. At check-ups, nurses fixed smiles and pronounced him healthy. Doctors said, 'he'll make you a strapping lad.' His mother smiled, her heart swelled. When he was three, she sent him to nursery. She wanted him to mix with other kids. To taste life off the hard hills. She said, 'it'll do him the world of good.' Jimbob hated leaving the farm. He clung to his mother. She drove away, blinking tears. On the third day, she took a phone call. 'It's Jimbob,' they said. 'He's scaring the other kids.'The truth hit Jimbob's mother like a hammer.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"I will begin by addressing each question separately to ensure a complete understanding of each before trying to identify any connections between them. Question 1: \\"What does '__type__' mean in C macro process?\\" In the C programming language, the operator is called the token-pasting or token-concatenation operator. It is used in macros to combine two tokens into a single token. For example, suppose we have the following macro definition: \`\`\`c #define DECLARE_VARIABLE(type, name) type _ name \`\`\` Now if we use this macro to declare a variable: \`\`\`c int_DECLARE_VARIABLE(int, foo); \`\`\` The macro expansion would result in: \`\`\`c int_int_foo; // This declares an integer variable named int_foo \`\`\` In your question, '__type__', the operator is used in a similar way. The '__' and 'type' tokens are combined with an input 'type' (for example, int, float, etc.) in a macro. The result will be a new token consisting of the tokens '_' (underscore), the actual 'type', and another '_' (underscore). Question 2: Why should I use function-like macros in C? Function-like macros are used in C programming to increase the code's flexibility, readability, and maintainability. They can be a useful alternative to regular functions in certain situations, such as when minimal overhead is desired, and the functionality is simplistic and repetitive. Some reasons to use function-like macros include: 1. Inline code generation: Macros can generate inline code, which can make the code execute faster by avoiding function call overhead. 2. Generic programming: Macros can be used to create generic functions that work with multiple data types, which is not directly supported in C. 3. Shortcuts and syntactic sugar: They can be used to simplify complex expressions, making the code more readable and maintainable. However, using function-like macros must be done with care, as they might lead to unintended side effects and harder debugging due to their textual substitution nature. Question 3: Do those questions have the same meaning? No, the two questions do not have the same meaning. The first question is about the specific usage of the operator in C macro processing, while the second question is related to the motivation behind using function-like macros in C programming in general. While both questions pertain to macros in C, they address different aspects of macros and their utility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Despite substantial scientific evidence that marijuana is not as harmful as alcohol, many law enforcement officials continue to pretend otherwise. Add to that list Loretta Lynch, President Obama’s nominee for attorney general. In response to a question at her confirmation hearing on Wednesday, Ms. Lynch pointedly disagreed with Mr. Obama who once told David Remnick of The New Yorker that he didn’t think ingesting the drug was more dangerous than drinking. She said that Mr. Obama was “speaking from his personal experience and personal opinion.” She also said that she did not support marijuana’s legalization. Ms. Lynch’s statements are not all that surprising considering the fact that she spent much of her career as a federal prosecutor in the heady days of the “war on drugs.” Other officials in law enforcement including the current head of the Drug Enforcement Administration hold similar views. But as my colleague Philip Boffey wrote in an editorial in July, the scientific evidence is not on Ms. Lynch’s side. In 2010, for example, a British scientific committee said that alcohol was the most harmful to users and society of the 20 drugs it studied; marijuana ranked eighth, behind heroin, cocaine and tobacco. Ms. Lynch’s views are important because the Department of Justice, which she will head if confirmed, said in 2013 that it would not interfere with the legalization of cannabis in Colorado and Washington as long as those states met several conditions. Since then Oregon and Alaska have also legalized recreational use and the District of Columbia legalized the possession of small amounts. In her hearing, Ms. Lynch did not say if she would try to reverse the department’s policy toward state legalization. But she emphasized that under the existing policy federal officials could still pursue cases to make sure marijuana was not distributed to children, and crack down on transportation of the drug across state lines to places where the drug was not legal. Ms. Lynch’s statements serve as a reminder that the Obama administration’s policy on marijuana could easily be reversed. It would make much more sense for the administration or Congress to remove marijuana from the Controlled Substances Act’s Schedule I and let states decide whether they want to permit its use. Summary:","completion":"This news article talks about Loretta Lynch, who might become the next Attorney General. She doesn't agree with President Obama about marijuana being less harmful than alcohol. She also doesn't support making marijuana legal. This is important, because she would be in charge of the Department of Justice and could change the laws about marijuana. Right now, some states in the USA have made marijuana legal, but Loretta Lynch might try to change that if she becomes the Attorney General."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before too long, both of them are wrapped up in the druggie lifestyle. What starts off as harmless fun and pleasure ends up as pain and misery. Heath Ledger is the poet, Dan is a pretty good con man and works a nice credit card scheme that keeps the cash coming in at a steady rate- for awhile. Then, of course, their luck runs out and it comes down to lying, stealing and manipulating Candy's family for money. Soon, as Dan and Candy sink further and further into a horrific heroin addiction; it comes down to prostitution, degradation and then withdrawal.

Question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Whose film score dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance? , can you please find it? Waters' lyrics to Wish You Were Here's \\"Have a Cigar\\" deal with a perceived lack of sincerity on the part of music industry representatives. The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making...

I even am starting to like Mary Lynn again , instead of just putting up with her cause she is Dad 's wife . Why is the house a bit awkward ?","completion":"After reading the article, it seems that the house is a bit awkward due to a combination of factors, which I will discuss in detail below. 1. Adjusting to a new family dynamic: The narrator is adjusting to a new family dynamic after the introduction of Mary Lynn as their father's wife. This change can lead to feelings of awkwardness, as everyone tries to find their place within the newly formed family structure and navigate their relationships with each other. Additionally, the presence of a step-parent could be a source of confusion or discomfort for the children, who may feel unsure of how to relate to the new family member. 2. Emotions associated with change: The house may feel awkward due to the various emotions associated with change. Moving into a new home or environment can bring up feelings of loss, uncertainty, and anxiety, which could make the atmosphere in the new house feel tense and uncomfortable. The process of adapting to these changes and learning how to establish a new sense of normalcy in the household can take time and may contribute to the aura of awkwardness. 3. Sharing space with new family members: Living in a new house with unfamiliar family members could be a source of awkwardness in itself. The narrator mentioned now having a little sister, which might require them to share their personal space, adjust to different routines, and work on developing a sibling relationship. Additionally, the introduction of a new family member can create changes in existing relationships (e.g., the relationship between the narrator and their father), potentially leading to feelings of awkwardness as old dynamics are reevaluated and new ones are established. 4. Getting used to the new house: The awkwardness could also be due to the narrator just getting used to their new surroundings and new living arrangement in their father's house. The process of adjusting to a new environment, forming new routines and habits, and building relationships with the new family members can all contribute to the overall sense of awkwardness. 5. The evolving relationship with Mary Lynn: The narrator mentioned that they are starting to like Mary Lynn again, as opposed to merely putting up with her because she is their father's wife. This suggests that the narrator is currently working on building a relationship with Mary Lynn, which might not be entirely smooth or consolidated yet. The time and effort it takes to build trust, understanding, and a sense of connection with a step-parent could add to the overall feeling of awkwardness in the household. In conclusion, the house is a bit awkward due to a range of factors, including the new family dynamics, the emotions associated with change, sharing space with new family members, getting used to the new environment, and the evolving relationship with the step-parent. It's important to remember that adjusting to these changes is a normal and essential part of establishing a harmonious family dynamic and a comfortable atmosphere in the new house. These feelings of awkwardness are likely to decrease over time as everyone becomes more familiar with each other and adapts to their new circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This article: In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \\"fucking sick of the whole thing\\", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \\"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\\"Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage.

Please answer the following question: This article: Public expenditures for education are far below the European Union average as well. Educational standards were once high, but have declined significantly since the early 2000s. Bulgarian students were among the highest-scoring in the world in terms of reading in 2001, performing better than their Canadian and German counterparts; by 2006, scores in reading, math and science had dropped. Although average literacy stands at 98.4% with no significant difference between sexes, functional illiteracy is significant. The PISA study of 2015 found 41.5% of pupils in the 9th grade to be functionally illiterate in reading, maths and science. The Ministry of Education and Science partially funds public schools, colleges and universities, sets criteria for textbooks and oversees the publishing process. Education in primary and secondary public schools is free and compulsory. The process spans through 12 grades, where grades one through eight are primary and nine through twelve are secondary level. Higher education consists of a 4-year bachelor degree and a 1-year master's degree. Bulgaria's highest-ranked higher education institution is Sofia University.Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85% of the population. It belongs to the Slavic group of languages, but it has a number of grammatical peculiarities, shared with its closest relative Macedonian, that set it apart from other Slavic languages: these include a complex verbal morphology (which also codes for distinctions in evidentiality), the absence of noun cases and infinitives, and the use of a suffixed definite article.

This way, you're building a systematic schedule for learning and memorizing new words. Research the meaning, usage, and pronunciation of each word. Use a reliable dictionary, either in print or online, to find the correct definition and pronunciation for each word on your list. Read the examples given to understand how the word is used in context, so you're able to apply it properly in spoken and written language. Additionally, make note of any common synonyms and antonyms for each word to build a more robust understanding of the word's meaning. Create flashcards for effective learning. Using index cards or digital flashcard apps, create flashcards for your list of words. Write the word and its part of speech on one side, and its definition, pronunciation, synonyms, and antonyms on the other side. Flashcards serve as a fantastic study aid you can carry around, reviewing them whenever you have spare time. Practice using the words in sentences. Integrating the new words you learn into your conversations and writing helps solidify your understanding of their meaning and proper usage. Try to use several new words from your list daily by creating sentences or using them in written exercises like journal entries or practice essays. Utilize mnemonic devices. Mnemonics are memory aids that can help you remember new information more effectively. Create mnemonic devices for the words on your list by associating the sound or meaning of the word with a visual image, rhyming word, or story that's easier for you to remember. Engage in consistent review. Regularly revisit the words you've studied to ensure they remain fresh in your memory. Review your flashcards, practice exercises, and mnemonic devices daily, gradually reducing the frequency as you become more comfortable with your expanded vocabulary. Take regular practice tests. Simulate testing conditions by taking vocabulary quizzes or practice tests to gauge your progress and determine which words require more attention. Use online resources, study guides, or test prep books to find quizzes and tests that suit your study goals. Immerse yourself in reading and interaction. Reading various materials, like novels, magazines, and news articles, exposes you to new words and their context. Engage with friends, classmates, or study partners in conversation or group activities to practice using new words and discuss their meanings with others. Remain consistent and patient in your learning. Improving your vocabulary takes time, effort, and consistency. Don't be discouraged if some words are more challenging than others; continue revisiting and practicing them. Stay committed to your study schedule and gradually, your command of the language will expand, and your vocabulary tests scores will improve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Hint: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Based on the information provided, electron shielding is higher in Sampline. Step-by-step justification: 1. Timmy compares two elements (Mardine and Sampline) within the same column of the periodic table. 2. Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. 3. The general trend in electronegativity is that it decreases down a column in the periodic table. 4. The decrease in electronegativity is due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. 5. Since Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine and both elements are in the same column, Sampline must have a higher electron shielding effect compared to Mardine."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Today, we are going to learn about how to protect your furry best friend's ears from those annoying flies. Flies can be really bothersome to our dog friends, and they can even cause infections in their ears. But don't worry! Here are some simple and safe ways to keep those pesky flies away from your dog's ears. 1. Petroleum Jelly Petroleum jelly is a special kind of soft and gooey stuff that you can put on your dog's ears. It will make it hard for the flies to sit on their ears, and they will just slide off. Make sure to ask an adult to help you put a little bit on your dog's ears, but be careful not to get it in their eyes. 2. Make a Fly Repellent A fly repellent is something that you can make at home to keep flies away. You can use vinegar, mineral oil (a special kind of oil that is safe for our skin and our dogs' skin), and some scented essential oils (like lavender or eucalyptus) that flies don't like. Mix them together and ask an adult to help you put the solution on your dog's ears. It will help to keep the flies away! 3. Fly Traps and Plants You can also hang up fly traps around your house, or even buy special plants that catch flies. These will help to keep the flies away from your dog's ears because they will be busy with those things instead. 4. Citronella Candles Citronella candles are a kind of candle that gives off a smell that flies don't like. If you light some of these candles in your home, it will help keep the flies away. Remember to always ask an adult to help you with candles! 5. Pet-Safe Chemical Fly Repellent You can also buy a special fly repellent that is safe for your dog. You can find it at a pet store or online. Make sure it says it's safe for dogs and ask an adult to help you use it. 6. Ask Your Veterinarian If the flies are still bothering your dog, you can ask your veterinarian (that's the special doctor for animals) about special balms or cleaners that can help protect your dog's ears. They might give you something special just for your dog. 7. Dog-Safe Fly Repellents It's essential to only use fly repellents that are safe for dogs. Some things that keep flies away can hurt your dog, so always make sure that any fly repellent you use is made especially for dogs. Now that you know how to protect your dog's ears from flies, you can keep your furry best friend happy and healthy.

Math Problem Solve 10*p + 27 = 87 for p.","completion":"To solve the equation 10*p + 27 = 87 for the variable p, we need to follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the term with the variable (p) on one side of the equation. First, we need to get rid of the constant term (27) from the left side of the equation. To do this, we will subtract 27 from both sides: 10*p + 27 - 27 = 87 - 27 This simplifies to: 10*p = 60 Now, we have isolated the term with the variable (10*p) on one side of the equation. Step 2: Solve for the variable (p). To find the value of p, we need to eliminate the coefficient (which is 10 in this case) before the variable. We can achieve this by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient (10): (10*p) / 10 = 60 / 10 This simplifies to: p = 6 So, the value of p in the equation 10*p + 27 = 87 is 6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The child asked William to hem the shirts instead of Justin because","completion":"William had a remarkable talent when it came to hemming shirts. Ever since William was a young boy, he had displayed a unique flair for sewing, much to the surprise of those who knew him. Growing up in a small village, he was always surrounded by hardworking and skilled people who devoted their lives to preserving the artistic traditions of the community. William's parents, both accomplished tailors, had always encouraged him to follow in their footsteps. Eager to please them, he took to the craft like a fish takes to water. As the years passed, William found himself developing a particular affinity for hemming shirts. His meticulous and precise stitching solely elevated the quality of the finished products. In the beginning, his family and friends took note of his extraordinary gift, but soon, word of his prowess spread beyond the confines of the village, and people traveled from far and wide to seek out his services. Justin, on the other hand, was a dear friend of William's, but he lacked William's steady and practiced hand when it came to sewing and hemming. Though Justin had aspirations to reach the same level of mastery as William, he struggled to find his footing in the world of tailoring. Stitches were often uneven and haphazard, and he could not imbue his work with the same level of artistry that William seemed to effortlessly achieve. Despite his shortcomings, Justin remained resolute, dedicating himself to the craft and hoping that someday his skill would equal that of his friend. In the meantime, the child was all too aware of the disparities that existed between the two friends' abilities. Having been a long-time customer of William's, the child knew that there was no one better to entrust with hemming the shirts they needed for an important event. The child was set to attend a formal gathering with their family, and it was imperative that their attire be impeccable. When the child approached William and handed him the bundle of shirts, William could see the eagerness and anticipation in the child's eyes. He accepted the commission with a warm smile and behind it the pride that came from knowing that he was the one chosen because of his expertise. Sensing the urgency of the task, William set to work immediately, his fingers dancing nimbly across the fabric as he deftly hemmed each shirt. Throughout the process, Justin observed quietly from a distance, initially feeling a pang of disappointment that he hadn't been chosen for the task. But, as he watched William work, Justin felt that disappointment replaced with a newfound determination. With each expertly placed stitch, Justin gleaned a deeper understanding of the art and skill required to perfect the craft. He marveled at his friend's talent, and instead of resenting the child's decision, he vowed to work harder and challenge himself to improve. Time seemed to pass in the blink of an eye, and soon the shirts lay perfectly hemmed and folded, ready for the child to collect. They marveled at the exquisite craftsmanship and knew they had made the right choice in entrusting William with the task. As they walked away, visions of the upcoming event danced in their mind, and they couldn't help but think of the two friends they had left behind. In that small village workshop, William and Justin continued to inspire one another in their pursuits. The child's decision to choose William to hem their shirts solidified a unique bond between the two friends, a bond forged in the fire of friendly competition, mutual admiration, and a shared belief in the transformative power of their passion. And so, as the sun set over the horizon and cast a warm, golden glow over the village, the two friends exchanged a knowing smile, silently reaffirming their lifelong dedication to the art of tailoring. Through the years, they would continue to learn from one another, constantly pushing the boundaries of their skills - all because of a child who had asked William to hem the shirts instead of Justin."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A shop where countries can buy and sell stuff like toys, clothes, and even money. This giant shop is on all day and night, and it never closes. It's like the biggest, most awesome sleepover-forever party for all the countries in the world. So, what's an Oopsie-Daisy or a stumble? Well, this is when the shop has more debts or owes more money than it really should. Like when you eat too much of your tasty Halloween candy on the same night, and then you end up with a bellyache later. Ouchies! Think about this: You want to buy your friend a nice birthday gift, so you borrow money from your mom or dad. But, you must promise that you will clean your room or take out the trash to pay them back. This money that you owe them is your debt. In 2017, this giant shop or global market, ended up owing a lot of money or having a lot of debt. Countries borrowed lots of money, but didn't have enough of their own. It's like they borrowed money for a friend's birthday gift but didn't do their chores to pay it back. What about low-investment? Investment is like putting your extra pennies from your piggy bank into something that will give you more pennies later. For example, building a lemonade stand hoping it will make you extra money for more toys. Low-investment in 2017 means people and countries weren't putting their pennies into things that could give them more pennies later. It's like they decided not to build their lemonade stand, maybe because they were afraid, it would rain and no one would buy their lemonade. So, what happened is, our worldwide shop didn't do very well in 2017. It borrowed way too much and didn't invest in more lemonade stands!

Please answer this question: where is the most gold stored in the world?","completion":"The most gold stored in the world is in the United States Bullion Depository, commonly known as Fort Knox. Fort Knox is a fortified military installation located near the city of Elizabethtown in the state of Kentucky, USA. It is operated by the United States Department of the Treasury and serves as a secure and confidential storage facility for a significant portion of the country's official gold reserves as well as other precious items belonging to the United States government. Fort Knox was constructed in 1936 as a response to the escalating global tensions during the pre-World War II era. The US government required a fortified and secure location to protect its valuable assets, including gold and other essential resources. Upon its completion, the United States Bullion Depository instantly became the primary storage facility for the nation's gold reserves. The vault at Fort Knox is renowned for its robust security features and protection levels. The exterior walls are made of reinforced concrete and lined with solid granite. Additionally, the vault door is a 22-ton blast-proof door designed to withstand explosions, cutting, or other sophisticated methods of attack. Cutting-edge security systems, including alarms and surveillance cameras, constantly monitor the facility. The United States Mint Police and the presence of the nearby Army post further augment the depository's security. As of 2021, Fort Knox holds approximately 4,583 metric tons of gold, which accounts for around 77% of the total gold reserves owned by the United States. This immense stockpile is stored in the form of 368,000 standard 400-ounce gold bars. It is worth noting that while Fort Knox possesses the most significant gold storage, several other facilities around the world also store sizeable quantities of gold. Some of these facilities include: 1. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York, United States: Located in Manhattan, New York City, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York is said to store approximately 6000 metric tons of gold in its underground vault. The gold stored here primarily belongs to foreign countries, central banks, and international organizations. 2. The Bank of England, United Kingdom: The Bank of England, located in London, maintains the third-largest gold storage facility in the world. It holds more than 400,000 gold bars, which weigh approximately 5,134 metric tons. Most of the gold stored here belongs to the central banks of the United Kingdom and other countries, international organizations, and the London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) members. 3. The Swiss National Bank, Switzerland: Switzerland is home to several major gold storage facilities. The Swiss National Bank stores a significant portion of gold reserves in its vaults in Berne and Zurich. Altogether, Switzerland's official gold reserves amount to around 1,040 metric tons. In summary, Fort Knox in the United States is the facility with the most gold storage globally, holding a significant portion of the country's official gold reserves. This highly secure and confidential facility serves as a symbol of the United States' economic strength and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Article: Generally speaking, government regulations normally ban anything from smoking in public places to parking in certain zones. But officials in the Brazilian town of Biritiba Mirim, 70km (45miles) east of Sao Paulo, _ . They plan to prohibit residents from dying early because the local cemetery has reached full capacity. There's no more room to bury the dead, they can't be cremated and laws forbid a new cemetery. So the mayor has proposed a strange solution: outlaw death. Mayor Roberto Pereira says the bill is meant as a protest against federal regulations that prohibit new or expanded cemeteries in preservation areas. \\"They have not taken local demands into consideration\\", he claims. A 2003 decree by Brazil's National Environment Council forbids burial grounds in protected areas. Mr. Pereira wants to build a new cemetery, but the project has been stopped because 98% of Biritiba Mirim is considered as a preservation area. Biritiba Mirim, a town of 28,000 inhabitants, not only wants to prohibit residents from passing away. The bill also calls on people to take care of their health in order to avoid death. \\"I haven't got a job, nor am I healthy. And now they say I can't die. That's ridiculous,\\" Amarido do Prado, an unemployed resident said. The city council is expected to vote on the regulation next week. \\"Of course the bill is laughable, illegal, and will never be approved,\\" said Gilson Soares de Campos, an assistant of the mayor. \\"But can you think of a better resolution to persuade the government to change the environmental decree that is prohibiting us from building a new cemetery?\\" The bill states that \\"offenders will be held responsible for their acts.\\" However, it does not say what the punishment will be. Question: What's the attitude of the mayor of Biritiba Mirim towards the federal regulations? - He remains silent about them. - He gives strong backing to them. - He objects to them. - He asks the residents for advice on them.

The sentence effectively uses a combination of strong language, intense descriptions, and metaphors to convey a mixed sense of both admiration for certain features and disapproval towards other qualities of the subject matter. The choice of words like \\"boldly stroked,\\" \\"luridly colored,\\" and \\"uni-dimensional nonsense machine\\" showcases a critical opinion regarding the subject's superficial nature and lack of depth or intellectual substance. The use of \\"boldly\\" and \\"luridly\\" insinuates that the subject is visually attention-grabbing, but does not offer anything beyond that surface appeal. The metaphor of \\"stroking the eyeballs\\" emphasizes the immediate visceral impact and enchanting visual aspects of the subject, while \\"evaporates like so much crypt mist in the brain\\" alludes to its ephemeral quality and lack of meaningful or lasting content. This phrase portrays the subject as something that might intrigue and captivate one's attention only fleetingly or superficially but dissipates quickly, leaving no significant impact. Overall, the sentiment of this sentence could be interpreted as a condemning evaluation of whatever the subject is, with a begrudging acknowledgment of its potential visual allure.

Created by Terry Nation, who was also responsible for creating the Daleks for the \\"Doctor Who\\" series, \\"Blake's 7\\" features a group of rebels fighting against the totalitarian Terran Federation in a dystopian future. The show's first two seasons primarily focus on the character Roj Blake, played by Gareth Thomas, who leads a group of escaped convicts in their battles against the Terran Federation. After Blake disappears from the series, his second-in-command Kerr Avon, portrayed by Paul Darrow, assumes leadership. The three computers mentioned, Zen, Slave, and Orac, play a significant role throughout the series, serving as integral components for the protagonists' missions and operations. 1. Zen: Zen is an extremely advanced computer system that controls the Liberator, the powerful, mysterious, and nearly indestructible spaceship that the main characters use to evade and confront the Federation. Zen is characterized by its calm and enigmatic demeanor, providing information and assistance to the crew as needed. However, it maintains an air of independence and detachment, refusing to share certain information or take actions without proper authorization. 2. Slave: Slave is a more subservient computer system aboard the Scorpio, another spacecraft utilized by the characters in the fourth and final season of the show. Slave is programmed to be humble and extremely deferential, often referring to the crew members as its \\"masters\\" and \\"mistresses.\\" Despite its obsequious nature, Slave proves to be a valuable asset to the team as it helps them navigate their journey and carry out their missions. 3. Orac: Orac is perhaps the most famous and recognizable computer in the series. It is a portable supercomputer with exceptional computational abilities and the capacity to access other computer systems, even those of the Terran Federation. Orac is utilized mainly by the protagonists for intelligence gathering, hacking, and communication purposes. Despite its immense agility and usefulness, Orac often displays a haughty and condescending attitude, viewing itself as superior to the human characters. \\"Blake's 7\\" enjoys a cult following, and the three computers—Zen, Slave, and Orac—remain iconic elements from the show that fans still cherish. Their distinctive personalities and interactions with the main characters brought a unique dimension to the series, which contributed to its enduring legacy in the realm of science fiction television."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Readers Are Bothered by I.R.S. Coverage, an Amanda Knox Feature, and Too-Thin Models Many readers were critical of how The Times covered misdeeds by the Internal Revenue Service, which admitted targeting conservative groups applying for tax-exempt status with special scrutiny. In essence, these readers believed The Times gave too little prominence to the story initially in Saturday’s paper and placed emphasis on the wrong aspect of the situation – the apology and the politics rather than the problem itself. Separately, some readers were also perturbed by the Book Review’s decision to interview Amanda Knox in its “By the Book” feature. Ms. Knox is accused of killing her roommate in Italy and is the author of a new book, “Waiting to Be Heard.” And still others objected to the photograph of a young woman in a black swimsuit and a leather jacket on the cover of Sunday’s T Magazine. Let’s take them one by one. I.R.S. Coverage. A reader, Jack Liebau, was one of many who questioned The Times’s impartiality in reporting on the revelation that the I.R.S. had targeted conservative groups. The Washington Post has the story as its lead on A1 this morning. The Boston Globe has it on Page A1, below the fold. The New York Times has the story on A11, below the fold. Do you think this placement would be the same if this had occurred in a Bush administration, and the story was the I.R.S. targeting liberal groups? Is the editorial decision regarding placement wrong by the Post or Globe — or was it yours? Is your decision-making process tainted in any way by a March 8, 2012 New York Times editorial, “I.R.S. does its job,” praising the I.R.S. in the way it treats “tea party groups”? Another reader, Richard Crane, noted the emphasis in Monday’s article (which did appear on the front page) on the politics of the situation and asked, “Does New York Times report, or advocate?” On Twitter, the veteran journalist Jeff Greenfield framed the question this way: NYTimes headline on IRS targeting says if “Gives GOP an Issue”. Isn’t the story the agency’s outrageous, indefensible conduct? — Jeff Greenfield (@greenfield64) 13 May 13 I agree that The Times seemed to play down the story originally, placing it inside the paper and emphasizing the second-day angle of the apology rather than the misconduct itself. In Monday’s paper, the headline, as Mr. Greenfield noted, emphasized the Republicans seizing on the issue rather than the widening problem. A Wall Street Journal front-page headline, by contrast, read, “Wider Problems Found at IRS.” Many on the right – as noted last week in my blog posts about Benghazi – do not think they can get a fair shake from The Times. This coverage won’t do anything to dispel that belief. Amanda Knox’s “By the Book” Feature. Jeff Dow of Waterloo, Iowa, was more tactful than many others in his comment on this feature in the Times Book Review on Sunday. He wrote: “I was surprised the Sunday Book Review chose Amanda Knox for the author profile. Not the type of author I expect from The Times.” Faith McLellan, a French reader, wondered, “Is the editor really out of serious options?” It did seem a strange choice to me, as well, reading almost like a parody, with questions like “What was your reading life in prison?” On Twitter, John Kubie had a similar thought: NY Times book review surpasses the Onion. http://t.co/6iqwlh521E — John Kubie (@JohnKubie) 12 May 13 Pamela Paul, the newly appointed editor of the Book Review, responded to my question as follows: The general goal of “By the Book” is to show not only what seasoned writers are reading, but also to show the impact books have on the lives of writers new to the craft, musicians, artists, actors, politicians and other public figures. Ms. Knox, as a person whose life was so often in the public eye even as her private life remained unknown, struck us as an interesting choice. What a person chooses to read in prison is, of course, a perennially fascinating subject, and while other media outlets explored different aspects of Ms. Knox’s life and legal case, we thought readers of the Book Review might be interested in learning about this side of her. The T Magazine Photographs. Some readers found the cover photo and inside display objectionable because of their suggestions of bondage. (A summary read: “Harnessing the dark side with black bikinis and a leather cover-up.”) Others were disturbed by the youth and extreme slenderness of the cover model. Jane Sherman of Westport, Conn., wrote: My reaction to the cover of the Sunday New York Times Style Magazine, which I sent to the editor Deborah Needleman, is: “Where did you get this child for your cover? The photo represents kiddy porn and I object.” Even if the model is over 18 (and I’m sure she is, to be legal) the makeup, stance, clothing and her very youthful appearance make the image one of a child in provocative dress with an adult message. Where is her mother? I’m a long time print subscriber to The New York Times and I don’t want to read a newspaper that’s moving into sleaze for dirty old men. Meredith Wheeler, a reader who lives in France and described herself as a former writer and producer at ABC News, wrote: As a woman, I was infuriated to see the current cover of T Magazine, which featured an anorexic-looking model. The additional photos in the shoot featured in the magazine were of similar super-thin models — and this on Mother’s Day weekend, when we should be celebrating some more realistic picture of womanhood. Haven’t we moved beyond this? Hasn’t the debate in fashion over the promotion of these wretchedly thin models been thoroughly discussed? Do we really have to fight this issue within The New York Times in 2013? Deborah Needleman, T Magazine editor, responded with the following when I shared the reaction with her: I’ve gotten a lot of comments from people loving the images! Julia Nobis, the model, is a 20-year-old undergraduate studying medicine. We chose her because of her strong looks and the personality she is able to project. She is rather thin for my taste, as most models are, and I considered adding some fat to her with Photoshop, but decided that as it is her body, I’d let it be. Fashion photography involves a bit of fantasy, and often some edge, and while the bathing suits are strappy and have buckles, that is a far cry from bondage — either showing it or advocating it. “Fifty Shades of Grey” is racier and more explicit than these images. Although I certainly understand the readers’ objections, I found the photographs arresting but pretty mild, especially by today’s fashion magazine standards. 3:56 p.m. | Updated Ms. Needleman’s reference to Photoshopping has raised some questions about how photographs are treated in The Times, including in its magazines. I’ll be looking into this, so stay tuned.

Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting.

Does \\"It is said that Vladimir Lenin and a young Joseph Stalin met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now known as The Crown Tavern) on Clerkenwell Green when the latter was visiting London in 1903.\\" correctly answer the question of What pub is associated with some of Jack the Ripper's victims?","completion":"No, the statement \\"It is said that Vladimir Lenin and a young Joseph Stalin met in the Crown and Anchor pub (now known as The Crown Tavern) on Clerkenwell Green when the latter was visiting London in 1903.\\" does not correctly answer the question of what pub is associated with some of Jack the Ripper's victims. First, let's understand the two different historical contexts mentioned in the question and statement. 1) Jack the Ripper: Jack the Ripper was an unidentified serial killer who terrorized the Whitechapel district of London in 1888. He is believed to be responsible for the gruesome murders of at least five women, all prostitutes, during this time. His identity remains unknown, making this one of the most infamous cold cases in history. 2) Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin: Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin were influential leaders in the early 20th century who played major roles in shaping the Soviet Union. While Lenin was the leader of the Bolshevik Party and led the October Revolution in 1917, Stalin later on took the reins and transitioned the Soviet Union into an industrialized nation with far-reaching global influence. Now, let's address the statement about the supposed meeting between Lenin and Stalin at the Crown and Anchor pub in 1903. Although the pub mentioned in the statement might be associated with these historical figures, it is not related to Jack the Ripper's victims. To answer the question about the pub associated with some of Jack the Ripper's victims, we'll need to look back to the time of the murders, in 1888. During this time, three pubs in the Whitechapel area were associated with some of the victims: 1) The Ten Bells: This pub, located at 84 Commercial Street, is perhaps the most famous for its connection with Jack the Ripper. It was frequented by some of the victims, most notably Mary Jane Kelly and Annie Chapman. The Ten Bells still exists today and has embraced its connection to the case, drawing tourists and history enthusiasts alike. 2) The Frying Pan: Located at 13 Brick Lane, this pub has since been demolished and replaced with another establishment, but it was another site of interest in the Ripper case. Ripper victim Mary Ann Nichols was seen here drinking on the night of her murder. 3) The Princess Alice: Similarly to The Frying Pan, The Princess Alice, located at 40 Dorset Street, was where another Ripper victim, Elizabeth Stride, was known to frequent. Though Stride wasn't seen at the pub the night of her murder, this is one more place historically connected to the Ripper victims. In conclusion, the statement about Vladimir Lenin and Joseph Stalin meeting in the Crown and Anchor pub is not related to the question of which pub is associated with some of Jack the Ripper's victims. The Ten Bells, The Frying Pan, and The Princess Alice are three pubs with connections to the victims during the time of the murders in 1888."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Now, I have a new situation: High lake had a lot of fresh and salt water mixing, therefore presented layers of stratified water.The water was poor in nutrients.Low lake had no such problems and it was a very abundant and prolific fishing spot.

Answer the following question: Information: - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - A PC booter, or booter, is a type of software for home computer era (early 1980s to early 1990s) personal computers that was loaded and executed in the bootup of the computer, from a bootable floppy disk, rather than as a regular program; a booter thus bypassed any operating system that might be installed on the hard disk of the computer. Video games were the type of application most commonly distributed as booters. - Star Warrior is a 1980 science fiction role - playing video game written and published by Automated Simulations ( later known as Epyx ) for the Apple II , TRS - 80 , and Atari home computers . The game was branded as part of the Starquest series , consisting of Star Warrior and the otherwise unrelated Rescue at Rigel . - Jon Freeman was an influential computer game industry figure of the 1980s and early 1990s. He was a co-founder of Epyx and Free Fall Associates and the spouse of game programmer Anne Westfall. Besides founding these two companies, though he is credited with some programming, Freeman is most noted as a game designer. - A microcomputer is a small, relatively inexpensive computer with a microprocessor as its central processing unit (CPU). It includes a microprocessor, memory, and minimal input/output (I/O) circuitry mounted on a single printed circuit board. Microcomputers became popular in the 1970s and 1980s with the advent of increasingly powerful microprocessors. The predecessors to these computers, mainframes and minicomputers, were comparatively much larger and more expensive (though indeed present-day mainframes such as the IBM System z machines use one or more custom microprocessors as their CPUs). Many microcomputers (when equipped with a keyboard and screen for input and output) are also personal computers (in the generic sense). - The TRS-80 Micro Computer System (TRS-80; later known as the Model I to distinguish it from successors) is a desktop microcomputer launched in 1977 and sold by Tandy Corporation through their Radio Shack stores. The name is an abbreviation of \\"Tandy/Radio Shack, Z-80 microprocessor\\". It was one of the earliest mass-produced personal computers. - Epyx, Inc. was a video game developer and publisher active in the late 1970s and 1980s. The company was founded as Automated Simulations by Jim Connelley and Jon Freeman, originally using Epyx as a brand name for action-oriented games before renaming the company to match in 1983. Epyx published a long series of games through the 1980s, but nevertheless went bankrupt in 1989 before finally disappearing in 1993. - Rescue at Rigel is a 1980 science fiction computer role-playing game written and published by Automated Simulations (later known as Epyx). It is based on a modified version of their \\"Temple of Apshai\\" game engine, which was part of most of their releases in this era. The game was released for the Apple II, IBM PC (PC Booter), TRS-80, VIC-20, and Atari 8-bit family. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. What entity does 'star warrior' has the relation 'designer' with?

Article: Grant Wood's American Gothic caused a stir in 1930 when it was exhibited for the first time at the Art Institute of Chicago and awarded a prize of 300 dollars. Newspapers across the country carried the story, and the painting of a farmer and a younger woman posed before a white house brought the artist instant fame. In 1930, Grant Wood, an American painter with European training, noticed a small white house built in the small southern Iowa town of Eldon. Wood was so fascinated by it that he decided to paint the house along with the kind of people he thought should live in that house. In the painting, the farmer is modeled on his dentist. Dr. Byron McKeeby. His younger sister Nan served as a model for the woman (imagined to be the farmer's wife or daughter). Wood wanted to give a description of the traditional roles of men and women as the man is holding a pitchfork symbolizing hard labor. Each element was painted separately; the models sat separately and never stood in front of the house. The Gothic style of the house inspired the painting's title. American Gothic remains one of the most famous paintings in the history of American art. The painting has become part of American popular culture. Some believe that Wood used it to satirize the narrow-mindedness that has been said to characterize Midwestern culture. The painting may also be read as a praise of the moral virtue or rural America or even as a mixture of praise and satire. American Gothic is one of the few images to reach the status of cultural symbol, along with Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa. Question: From the passage we can infer Iowa is in _ .

A:","completion":"The economic phenomenon that occurred in the 1970s, as described in the given text, is known as \\"stagflation.\\" Stagflation is a situation where an economy experiences both stagnant growth and high inflation rates simultaneously. This typically leads to high unemployment as well. In the 1970s, the U.S. dollar was no longer anchored to gold, making it the responsibility of the Federal Reserve to maintain its value. The Federal Reserve chose to increase the money supply based on the prevailing belief in the Phillips curve, which suggested a link between inflation and real economic growth. This assumption led to the belief that inflation was relatively benign. Unfortunately, this decision resulted in stagflation and a rapidly declining value of the U.S. dollar. From 1965 to 1981, the dollar lost two-thirds of its value due to these economic policies and conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Bowie wrote and recorded the opening title song to the television series The Last Panthers, which aired in November 2015. The theme that was used for The Last Panthers was also the title track for his January 2016 release Blackstar which is said to take cues from his earlier krautrock influenced work. According to The Times: \\"Blackstar may be the oddest work yet from Bowie\\". On 7 December 2015, Bowie's musical Lazarus debuted in New York. His last public appearance was at opening night of the production.Blackstar was released on 8 January 2016, Bowie's 69th birthday, and was met with critical acclaim. Following his death on 10 January, producer Tony Visconti revealed that Bowie had planned the album to be his swan song, and a \\"parting gift\\" for his fans before his death. Several reporters and critics subsequently noted that most of the lyrics on the album seem to revolve around his impending death, with CNN noting that the album \\"reveals a man who appears to be grappling with his own mortality\\". Visconti later said that Bowie had been planning a post-Blackstar album, and had written and recorded demo versions of five songs in his final weeks, suggesting that Bowie believed he had a few months left. The day following his death, online viewing of Bowie's music skyrocketed, breaking the record for Vevo's most viewed artist in a single day. On 15 January, Blackstar debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart; nineteen of his albums were in the UK Top 100 Albums Chart, and thirteen singles were in the UK Top 100 Singles Chart. Blackstar also debuted at number one on album charts around the world, including Australia, France, Germany, Italy, New Zealand, and the US Billboard 200.As of 11 January 2016, more than 1.3 million people had visited the David Bowie Is exhibit, making it the most successful exhibition ever staged by the Victoria and Albert Museum in terms of worldwide..., can you guess it ?

Watching on an old black and white television set, he and a group of his friends witnessed one of the nation's generals being blindfolded and shot to death by a firing squad. Shortly afterward, his family fled the instability of Ghana and returned to his native Switzerland. But Africa stayed with Merz, who told his story at the TED Global conference in Edinburgh, UK, in July. He grew up to become an actor and found that he was increasingly being cast as a violent African or a terrorist. \\"How many terrorists could I possibly play before turning into one myself?\\" \\"I had become ashamed of the other, the African in me.\\" After 28 years, Merz returned to Ghana to film the nation's 2008 presidential election and, as it turned out, to learn more about himself. \\"I realized that, when I'd left the country, free and fair elections in a democratic environment were a dream. And now that I'd returned, that dream had become reality, though a fragile reality.\\" In the first round of voting in Ghana, no candidate attained the 50% of the vote needed to gain the presidency, and an inconclusive runoff was held. People began questioning whether the elections were being manipulated. Merz said there was gunfire and he saw discouraging signs of a possible breakdown in civil order. \\"And my heart sank, because I thought, here we are again. Here is another proof that the African is not capable of governing himself. And not only that, I am documenting it -- documenting my own cultural shortcomings.\\" But rather than erupt in violence, the crowd started chanting \\"We want peace,\\" and eventually, after new voting, a winner was certified and power was transferred peacefully, Merz said. \\"Ghana taught me to look at people differently and to look at myself differently. And yes, we Africans can.\\" In his film, \\"An African Election,\\" Merz told CNN in an interview, \\"The political system, the democratic system, is tested to the utmost.\\" The lesson: \\"You don't have to rebel. You have the freedom to choose, and with that choice comes a responsibility.\\" What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The narrative revolves around Jarreth Merz, who had a deeply formative experience as a child witnessing a military coup in Ghana, watching a national general being executed on television. After this event, his family fled to Switzerland, his native country. Despite the distance, Merz remained emotionally connected to Africa and carried the impact of this traumatic experience into adulthood. As he grew older, Merz pursued a career in acting where he noted a pattern of being typecast in roles which stereotypically portrayed Africans as violent or as terrorists. Perturbed by this persistent negative depiction, he grew depressed about his African roots. After 28 years, Merz decided to confront his heritage and returned to Ghana to document the 2008 Presidential election. His return was punctuated by two vital discoveries; one, witnessing that Ghana was working towards becoming a democratic country, although the reality was fragile, was encouraging. Yet, amid the first-run elections, his heart sank when tensions rose due to no candidate attaining 50% of the vote required to become president, sparking fears of potential violence. However, in a key moment of transformation, instead of descending into chaos, the crowd chanted for peace. An additional round of voting led to a candidate's victory and a peaceful transfer of power. This experience shifted Merz's perspective of 'the African in him' that he had previously been ashamed of. It taught him to see himself and others differently, challenging negative stereotypes about Africa and its people. Merz turned his experiences into a film titled \\"An African Election\\". He pointed out in an interview with CNN that the event was a major test for the democratic system in Ghana. The key lesson he underscored was that rebellion isn't a necessity, people have the freedom to choose, and that freedom carries a significant responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Options: - fingers - dexterity - skill - muscles - strength The answer is \\"dexterity\\" because A:","completion":"Sam went climbing but wasn't good at it. He was nimble and had dexterity. Dexterity is the most fitting term among all the options provided because it directly connects to the characteristics mentioned in the question. Let's break down the other options: - Fingers: This option doesn't offer much in terms of understanding why Sam was nimble or how it affected his climbing abilities. Everyone has fingers, so this choice doesn't provide any unique information about Sam. - Skill: While skill would be a desirable trait to have while climbing, the question states that Sam wasn't good at climbing. Therefore, we can eliminate skill as the correct answer since it contradicts the information given in the question. - Muscles: While muscles can be essential for climbing, there are different types of muscular strength, and having muscles does not necessarily signify that an individual is good at climbing. Additionally, the question states that Sam was \\"nimble,\\" which usually refers to agility and flexibility, not muscular strength. - Strength: Similar to the reasoning for muscles, strength alone does not determine if someone is good at climbing. Strength can play a part in supporting climbing abilities, but it is not enough to conclude that Sam would be a successful climber. Furthermore, the term \\"nimble\\" doesn't necessarily imply physical strength, making this option less likely. In the context of the given question, dexterity is the most appropriate answer because it relates to Sam's ability to move precisely and with ease. Being nimble often signifies that a person can adapt to their surroundings, and dexterity represents a combination of both hand and finger agility, which would be particularly useful for gripping and maneuvering while climbing, even if Sam isn't particularly skilled at it. In conclusion, the answer is \\"dexterity\\" because it directly correlates with the description of Sam being nimble and his lack of established skill in climbing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Investors often determine a required yield, or the minimum return they want to get on a bond, before purchasing. Calculating the yield to maturity can inform you about whether a specific bond purchase will meet an investors expectations. These expectations may vary from investor to investor. However, the calculation gives investors concrete data with which to compare the value of different bonds. Bond issuers may not choose to allow a bond to grow until maturity. These actions decrease the yield on a bond. They may call a bond, which means redeeming it before it matures. Or, they may put it, which means that the issuer repurchases the bond before its maturity date. Yield to call (YTC) calculates the yield rate between the present and the call date of a bond. Yield to put (YTP) calculates the yield rate until the issuer puts the bond. The YTM does not account for taxes or for purchasing or selling costs. These effectively lower the yield on a bond. Also, investors must remember that these calculations are estimates only. Fluctuations in the market can have significant effects on the bond yield.

Abraham Ortelius (; also Ortels, Orthellius, Wortels; 14 April 1527 - 28 June 1598) was a Flemish cartographer and geographer, conventionally recognized as the creator of the first modern atlas, the Theatrum Orbis Terrarum (Theatre of the World). Ortelius is often considered one of the founders of the Netherlandish school of cartography and one of the most notable representatives of the school in its golden age (approximately 1570s-1670s). The publication of his atlas in 1570 is often considered as the official beginning of the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography. On 20 May 1570, Gilles Coppens de Diest at Antwerp issued Ortelius' Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, the \\"first modern atlas\\" (of 53 maps). Three Latin editions of this (besides a Dutch, a French and a German edition) appeared before the end of 1572; twenty-five editions came out before Ortelius' death in 1598; and several others were published subsequently, for the atlas continued to be in demand until about 1612. Most of the maps were admittedly reproductions (a list of 87 authors is given in the first Theatrum by Ortelius himself, growing to 183 names in the 1601 Latin edition), and many discrepancies of delineation or nomenclature occur. Errors, of course, abound, both in general conceptions and in detail; thus South America is initially very faulty in outline, but corrected in the 1587 French edition, and in Scotland the Grampians lie between the Forth and the Clyde; but, taken as a whole, this atlas with its accompanying text was a monument of rare erudition and industry. Its immediate precursor and prototype was a collection of thirty-eight maps of European lands, and of Asia, Africa, Tartary and Egypt, gathered together by the wealth and enterprise, and through the agents, of Ortelius' friend and patron, Gillis Hooftman (1521-1581), lord of Cleydael and Aertselaer: most of these were printed in Rome, eight or nine only in the Southern Netherlands. In 1573 Ortelius published seventeen supplementary maps under the title Additamentum Theatri Orbis Terrarum. Four more Additamenta were to follow, the last one appearing in 1597. He also had a keen interest and formed a fine collection of coins, medals and antiques, and this resulted in the book (also in 1573, published by Philippe Galle of Antwerp) Deorum dearumque capita ... ex Museo Ortelii (reprinted in 1582, 1602, 1612, 1680, 1683 and finally in 1699 by Gronovius, Thesaurus Graecarum Antiquitatum. vol. vii). The Theatrum Orbis Terrarum inspired a six volume work entitled Civitates orbis terrarum edited by Georg Braun and illustrated by Frans Hogenberg with the assistance of Ortelius himself, who visited England to see his friend John Dee in Mortlake in 1577 and Braun tells of Ortelius putting pebbles in cracks in Temple Church, Bristol, being crushed by the vibration of the bells in the description on the back of 'Brightovve' Map 2, Third Edition 1581 Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Please explain Theatrum Orbis Terrarum?","completion":"Theatrum Orbis Terrarum, also known as the Theatre of the World, was the first modern atlas created by the Flemish cartographer and geographer Abraham Ortelius.

While many of the maps in the atlas were reproductions with errors and discrepancies, the overall work was a significant accomplishment and served as the basis for the Golden Age of Netherlandish cartography.

Please answer the following question: Process: - Greenhouse gases are released into the air by human activities - The earth changes energy from the sun into heat - Heat rises from the ground - Greenhouse gas molecules in the atmosphere prevent the heat from going into space - The temperature of the earth increases - The temperature continues to rise and melts the polar ice caps - The temperature rises even faster. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose frequent exposure to people who are sick happens, how will it affect a GREATER greenhouse effect. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you presented involves the concept of frequent exposure to people who are sick and its potential effect on the greenhouse effect. First and foremost, it is essential to comprehend the processes that contribute to the greenhouse effect, especially those related to human activities. Human activities, particularly the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation, are significant contributors to the increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. These gases, such as carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O), trap heat from the sun and prevent it from escaping into space, causing the Earth's temperature to rise. This increase in temperature leads to the melting of polar ice caps, which, in turn, amplifies the warming effect due to the reduced reflection of sunlight and the release of additional greenhouse gases stored in the ice. Now, let's consider the perturbation hypothesis in question: frequent exposure to people who are sick. While illness per se might not have any direct influence on the greenhouse effect, the consequences of widespread illness might affect the process in both direct and indirect ways. Here are a few possible correlations: 1. Overcrowded healthcare systems: When a large number of people are sick and require medical attention, healthcare facilities need to maintain a comfortable temperature to help patients feel at ease and recover. This requirement might put extra pressure on the energy grid, as healthcare systems demand more heating or cooling, resulting in an increased reliance on fossil fuels for electricity generation. 2. Increased consumption of energy and resources: Sicker populations require more medical equipment, supplies, and pharmaceuticals, which may indirectly increase the consumption of power and resources. The manufacturing, transportation, and disposal of these goods significantly contribute to greenhouse gas emissions. 3. Changes in individual behaviors: People who are frequently ill might modify their lifestyle or travel habits. For instance, they may opt for more frequent trips to healthcare providers or stay at home more often, which could influence transportation choices, like driving a personal vehicle more frequently than relying on mass transit, leading to higher greenhouse gas emissions. 4. Population disparities: Densely populated areas tend to have higher rates of infectious diseases, which might be associated with higher greenhouse gas emissions due to urbanization and industrialization. Understandably, both urbanization and industrialization are major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions. 5. Socio-economic factors: In some cases, poor health outcomes may be connected to socio-economic factors. People from low-income communities might be more susceptible to illness due to inadequate access to healthcare, living in crowded conditions, or working in professions with greater exposures to pathogens. These communities often inhabit areas with higher concentrations of pollution, waste disposal sites, and industrial facilities, leading to greater greenhouse gas emissions. In conclusion, while frequent exposure to people who are sick may not have a direct impact on the greenhouse effect, there are potential secondary effects that could influence the process when one looks at the broader implications of widespread illness, including its effects on energy consumption, resource use, individual behavior, population disparities, and socio-economic factors. These indirect effects could contribute to a greater greenhouse effect through heightened greenhouse gas emissions, perpetuating the cycle of climate change and its consequences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Albert Goodwill Spalding (September 2, 1849 - September 9, 1915) was an American pitcher, manager and executive in the early years of professional baseball, and the co-founder of A.G. Spalding sporting goods company. He was born and raised in Byron, Illinois. He played major league baseball between 1871 and 1878. Spalding set a trend when he started wearing a baseball glove, and eventually opened his sporting goods store. In the months after signing for Chicago, Hulbert and Spalding organized the National League by enlisting the 2 major teams in the East and the 4 other top teams in what was then considered to be the West, also known as the jungle. Joining Chicago initially were the leading teams from Cincinnati, Louisville, and St. Louis. The owners of these western clubs accompanied Hulbert and Spalding to New York where they secretly met with owners from New York City, Philadelphia, Hartford, and Boston. Each signed the league's constitution, and the National League was officially born. \\"Spalding was thus involved in the transformation of baseball from a game of gentlemen athletes into a business and a professional sport.\\" Although the National Association held on for a few more seasons, it was no longer recognized as the premier organization for professional baseball. Gradually, it faded out of existence and was replaced by myriad minor leagues and associations around the country. In 1886, with Spalding as President of the franchise, the Chicago White Stockings, (today's Chicago Cubs), began holding spring training in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which subsequently has been called the \\"birthplace\\" of spring training baseball. The location and the training concept was the brainchild of Spalding and his player/manager Cap Anson, who saw that the city and the natural springs created positives for their players. They first played in an area called the Hot Springs Baseball Grounds. Many other teams followed the concept and began training in Hot Springs and other locations. In 1905, after Henry Chadwick wrote an article saying that baseball grew from the British sports of cricket and rounders, Spalding called for a commission to find out the real source of baseball. The commission called for citizens who knew anything about the founding of baseball to send in letters. After three years of searching, on December 30, 1907, Spalding received a letter that (erroneously) declared baseball to be the invention of Abner Doubleday. The commission, though, was biased, as Spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was somewhat related to the English sport of rounders. Just before the commission, in a letter to sportswriter Tim Murnane, Spalding noted, \\"Our good old American game of baseball must have an American Dad.\\" The project, later called the Mills Commission, concluded that \\"Base Ball had its origins in the United States\\" and \\"the first scheme for playing baseball, according to the best evidence available to date, was devised by Abner Doubleday at Cooperstown, N.Y., in 1839.\\" Receiving the archives of Henry Chadwick in 1908, Spalding combined these records with his own memories (and biases) to write \\"America's National Game\\" (published 1911) which, despite its flaws, was probably the first scholarly account of the history of baseball. What did they find?","completion":"The commission organized by Albert Goodwill Spalding, known as the Mills Commission, found that baseball was invented by Abner Doubleday in Cooperstown, New York, in 1839. This information came from a letter received by Spalding on December 30, 1907, and the commission concluded that \\"Base Ball had its origins in the United States.\\" However, it should be noted that the commission was biased, as Spalding would not appoint anyone to the commission if they believed the sport was related to the English sport of rounders. Nevertheless, this conclusion by the Mills Commission aimed to establish baseball as a uniquely American invention."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Alex is full of life and more interested in playing the fool, by dancing around and doing the \\"happy face/angry face\\" gag with his paw. Zuba shows him his paw, which has an Africa-shaped birthmark on it, which Alex also has on his paw. Just then, Makunga (Alec Baldwin), a scheming lion who wants to be Alpha Lion, challenges Zuba. Leaving Alex alone for a while, Zuba kicks the pride out of Makunga. As the fight is going on, Alex notices a piece of rope moving on the ground and follows it. He goes off the reserve and is captured by poachers, who dump him in a crate and put him in the bed of their truck. Zuba notices that his son is missing. He sees the truck moving along the fence of the reserve and hears his son, crying out for help. He runs and jumps on the truck. He manages to free the crate of its binds, when one of the poachers shoots him, causing him to fall off the truck. He doesn't notice that Alex's crate has fallen out of the truck-bed and into a nearby river. Despite the painful hole in his ear, he mourns the loss of his son.Meanwhile, in the box, Alex sits timidly. Finally, he reaches New York City and is fished out and put in the New York City Zoo. When he sees all the people looking at him, he starts to dance around, much to the audience's pleasure.

Earth's lithosphere is divided into several huge tectonic plates that float and move on the semi-fluid asthenosphere beneath them. These plates can move in different directions due to convection currents generated by heat from Earth's interior. As the plates interact with one another, they generate forces at their boundaries, which slowly build up stress in the Earth's crust. When the stress becomes too large, the crust breaks or shifts along faults, releasing the stored energy and initiating an earthquake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the left side of the equation, we have -62*v and 8*v. These two terms can be combined as follows: -62*v + 8*v = (-62 + 8)*v = -54*v So now, our equation becomes: -54*v - 2026 - 4224 = 71*v Step 2: Combine the constants on the left side of the equation. We have -2026 and -4224, which can be added together: -2026 - 4224 = -6250 Now, our equation becomes: -54*v - 6250 = 71*v Step 3: Get all the variable terms on one side of the equation and constants on the other side. In this case, we will add 54*v to both sides of the equation to get all the variable terms on the right-hand side: -54*v + 54*v - 6250 = 71*v + 54*v Simplifying, we get: -6250 = 125*v Step 4: Solve for v. Now that we have the variable term (125*v) isolated on one side of the equation, we will divide both sides of the equation by 125: -6250 / 125 = 125*v / 125 This simplifies to: -50 = v So, the value of v is -50."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: What exactly is a “sky city”? A city in the sky? A city made of vapour? A city coloured like the sky? (In that case, night sky or morning sky, clear sky or cloudy sky?) Or is it just a metaphor for an unreal city — a city that cannot or must not exist, or exist only in talk? Perhaps Calcutta is seeing the birth of a new phrase of such universal application that it will soon be in the Oxford English Dictionary. Sky City — a city that exists only in ministerial whim. The notion of a cosmetic change is taken to unprecedented heights of innovation by the idea, apparently floated by the West Bengal transport minister, that Calcutta’s taxis will be painted blue and white, in keeping with the general blueing of the city, which, in turn, is in keeping with the chief minister’s vision of the city in blue and white — the colour of the sky on a clear day. Everything, from park railings to illumination on important government buildings, is going to be painted or lighted in these key colours. The reason, as with all mystical visions, is beyond reasoning. Presumably, the mystic municipality will be at it in the next few months, and since the task is more mystical than municipal they will be better at it than they have proved to be in matters more directly municipal. Finding the right colour combination is undoubtedly the crucial first step in making a city safer, healthier, cleaner and generally more user-friendly for its inhabitants. It could, with as little doubt, sort out its core problems — chaotic healthcare, inability to implement pollution control norms, arsenic in the water, archaic sewers and garbage disposal, bad roads, killer buses for public transport, an airport falling apart and beyond dismal, priceless paintings rotting away in public art galleries, to name a few. But who said that a city is made of such unimaginatively inventoried tangibles? How much more visionary and ethereal is a city with history and songs and colour and poetry flowing in its veins. Taxis? People? Roads? Blueness conquers all. ||||| Image caption Calcutta landmarks, and the city's distinctive yellow taxis are to be painted blue The eastern Indian city of Calcutta is to be painted blue, a local minister has said. Government buildings, flyovers, roadside railings, and taxis should be painted a shade of light blue, a minister in the ruling Trinamul Congress government said. Owners of private buildings will be also be requested to paint them in the same colour, the minister said. The capital of West Bengal, Calcutta is home to more than 14 million people. \\"Our leader [chief minister of West Bengal] Mamata Banerjee has decided that the theme colour of the city will be sky blue because the motto of the new government is 'the sky is the limit',\\" Urban Development Minister Firhad Hakim told The Indian Express newspaper. \\"From now on, all government buildings, whenever they are re-painted, will be done in sky blue. The owners of private buildings will also be requested to follow the same colour pattern. The necessary government orders will be issued soon.\\" The colour of the city's famous yellow taxis are going to be changed to light blue and white, while a number of famous landmarks are likely to be repainted too, reports say. 'Cosmetic change' The owners of private buildings will have to pay from their own funds to repaint their premises, the minister said. Blue is a beautiful colour and is also soothing for the eyes Sobhan Chatterjee, Calcutta mayor \\"Blue is a beautiful colour and is also soothing for the eyes,\\" Calcutta mayor Sobhan Chatterjee said. The announcement has been criticised by opposition parties and sections of the media. A local Congress party spokesman said the government was \\"preoccupying itself with non-essential issues\\". The city's Telegraph newspaper said the \\"notion of a cosmetic change is taken to unprecedented heights of innovation by the idea\\" of painting Calcutta blue. \\"Finding the right colour combination is undoubtedly the crucial first step in making a city safer, healthier, cleaner and generally more user-friendly for its inhabitants,\\" the newspaper wrote in an editorial. \\"It could, with as little doubt, sort out its core problems - chaotic health care, inability to implement pollution control norms, arsenic in the water, archaic sewers and garbage disposal, bad roads, killer buses for public transport, an airport falling apart and beyond dismal, priceless paintings rotting away in public art galleries, to name a few.\\" Other Indian cities have colour-based themes. The northern Indian city of Jaipur is famously dubbed the Pink City after its terracotta-colour dwellings. In 2006, Aurangabad, a crime-infested city in the state of Bihar, was painted pink in order to uplift, according to authorities, its sagging morale and spirit. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The city of Calcutta in India is going to be painted blue.

Every day he rides to deliver parcels across his hometown of Philadelphia with his six-month-old cat called MJ always sitting on his shoulders. MJ, short for Mary Jane, is different from other cats. She was born in a drawer in Rudy's bedroom on April Fool's day. When she got older, Rudi noticed that her favorite place to rest was his shoulders, so he decided to train her to work with him. \\"The first day we crossed one block. The next day we tried two blocks and now we can ride about 25 miles every day. MJ enjoys moving around on my shoulders,\\" Rudi said. However, Rudy hopes to be able to ride 100 miles with MJ in the coming day. \\"People are always surprised and excited to watch us. I often hear someone shout, 'Oh, my God, he has a cat on his shoulder! How lovely that is!' MJ is so comfortable on my shoulder and she never hurts me with her claws. We always get on well with each other and have a great time during the work.\\" Rudy smiled. MJ loves noisy streets of Philadelphia, the only problem is that she is scared of the siren . However, her owner Rudi is always there for her. One day, if you go to Philadelphia and see a postman with a cat on his shoulder, don't be surprised! Question: Which might the real reason why Rudi always brings MJ while working? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The real reason why Rudi always brings MJ along while working may stem from multiple factors. Firstly, MJ's favorite place to rest is on Rudi's shoulders, as observed by Rudi when she got older. Recognizing this inclination, Rudi decided to train MJ to work with him as he delivers parcels across Philadelphia. Secondly, MJ enjoys moving around on Rudi's shoulders, as mentioned by Rudi, and they can ride about 25 miles every day, which indicates that MJ is comfortable and adapts well to this arrangement. Furthermore, Rudi mentioned that people are often surprised and excited to see them, which brings joy not just to Rudi and MJ but also to those they encounter. They share a strong bond and have a great time working together, as Rudi stated that they always get along well. Thus, the real reason Rudi always brings MJ along while working likely lies in a combination of MJ's preference for being on his shoulders, their strong bond, the enjoyment they both get while working together, and the happiness they bring to others in the community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On 29 April it landed troops on Gotland, which soon surrendered. The Swedish fleet was ordered out on 4 May, but experienced adverse winds and was delayed until 19 May. Juel had by then already left Visby, the principal port of Gotland with a garrison force. He headed for Bornholm to join with a small Danish–Dutch squadron in cruising between Scania and the island of Rügen to prevent any Swedish seaborne reinforcement from reaching Pomerania. On 25–26 May the two fleets met each another in the battle of Bornholm. Despite the considerable Swedish advantage in ships, men and guns, they were unable to inflict any losses on the allied force, and lost a fireship and two minor vessels. The battle revealed the lack of coherence and organization within the Swedish ranks, which soured relations between Creutz and his officers.After the failed action, the Swedish fleet anchored off Trelleborg where King Charles was waiting with new orders to recapture Gotland. The fleet was to avoid combat with the allies at least until they reached the northern tip of Öland, where they could fight in friendly waters. When the Swedish fleet left Trelleborg on 30 May they were soon intercepted by the allied fleet, which then began a pursuit. By this time the allies had been reinforced by another small squadron and totaled 42 vessels, with 25 large and medium ships of the line. The reinforcements brought with them a new commander, the Dutch Admiral General Cornelis Tromp, one of the most renowned naval tacticians of his time. The two fleets sailed north and on 1 June passed the northern tip of Öland in a strong gale. The Swedish ships fared poorly in the rough winds, losing masts and spars. The Swedish officers formed a battle line that held together only with great difficulty.

Here is an article: Salt has been used throughout history to preserve food, but it is also linked to many health problems. Photograph: Alamy Cooking telly is full of frauds. Sit and watch with anyone who's worn chef's whites and they will spot a host of lazy fictions guaranteed to make them snort and pshaw. A popular one is that on TV no one puts their fingers in the food: in a working kitchen, the digits are the most used tool of all. Another is the salt thing. On television you will hardly see a shake of the white powder. But in real kitchens, they lay it on thick: \\"Correct seasoning to a chef is as much salt as you can put in without it tasting too salty,\\" Bocca di Lupo's Jacob Kennedy says. \\"That's why we all die young.\\" In his last book, Cooked, the American eco-food guru Michael Pollan gets busy preparing a piece of meat for grilling. A chef tells him to lay on the salt. \\"Use at least three times as much as you think you should.\\" Shocked, Pollan consulted another pro. He agreed, but \\"upped the factor to five\\". Science explains why: long-chain carbohydrates in cooked food neutralise natural salt by binding in the sodium ions. For taste, it needs replacing. So it's no great shock when survey after survey finds higher levels of salt from high-street restaurants – Domino's, Wetherspoon's, Carluccio's and Jamie's Italian were all putting more salt in single dishes than adults are supposed to eat in a whole day. But what we're supposed to eat is ridiculously, you may even think unfeasibly, little. The NHS recommends just 4g of salt a day for a child (a small teaspoonful) and 6g for an adult (a large teaspoonful). But the NHS also says that up to 90% of the salt we eat comes already present in our food, so we should only be using adding 0.6g or half a pinch. My mother uses half a teaspoon of salt or more every time she sits down to eat, usually before she has tasted the food. (At nearly 80, she admits to being well preserved.) As with so many ingredients, there's good and bad when it comes to salt. It hardens your arteries and drives up blood pressure, leading to heart attacks and strokes. The latest medical charge against it is that it may be acting as a secret agent, \\"driving our immune systems to rebel against us\\". It may also play a leading role in multiple sclerosis. Nonetheless, wicked salt dealers are working to persuade you to eat even more. The Department of Health has said that reducing salt intake by just 1g a day – just a pinch – would save 4,147 preventable deaths and £288m. For 6,000 years it has been preserving fish and meat to keep humans alive in hard times and produce such glories as jamon serrano and brandade of salt cod. Salt is instantly vivid; it puts a shoulder to a shy taste and shoves it on to the stage. Try salting a boiled egg, or a slice of avocado, to watch something bland come alive - try it on everything, actually. Also, get it while you can. With transfats gone and sugar under attack, salt may be the next ingredient to come under the pitiless eye of the law. Legislators in New York have already made one attempt to get salt banned in restaurants. According to Time magazine, federal legislation on salt content in packaged and restaurant food is under consideration. Manufactured food tends to use a lot of salt, especially if it claims to be \\"healthy\\", because salt fills in for taste when fat or sugar is removed to lower calories. But lots of basic foods we use are high in salt: bread, cheese, sun-dried tomatoes, pickles and so on. And – hold on to your seats – crisps and bacon. Not to mention those damnable salty caramel-flavoured sweets. Clearly, avoiding ready meals and processed food is one way to allow yourself more salt in your cooking. Or you could just ignore the advice, and carry on salting. Anthony Bourdain – the chef who first lifted a lid off the seamy truths of the professional kitchen, has no time for the salt police. \\"It's what makes food taste good,\\" he told Time magazine. \\"Traditional, intelligent and skilled used of salt has become confused in the minds of nanny-state nitwits with the sneaking of salt into processed convenience foods. Nothing else encapsulates the mission of the food ideologues better than this latest intrusion: they desire a world without flavor.\\" So, could you cook with half a pinch a day?

The United States had dropped the bombs with the consent of the United Kingdom as outlined in the Quebec Agreement. The two bombings, which killed at least 129,000 people, remain the only use of nuclear weapons for warfare in history. - Hiroshima is perhaps best known as the first city in history to be targeted by a nuclear weapon when the United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) dropped an atomic bomb on the city (and later on Nagasaki) at 8:15 a.m. on August 6, 1945, near the end of World War II. - World War II (often abbreviated to WWII or WW2), also known as the Second World War, was a global war that lasted from 1939 to 1945, although related conflicts began earlier. It involved the vast majority of the world's nationsincluding all of the great powerseventually forming two opposing military alliances: the Allies and the Axis. It was the most widespread war in history, and directly involved more than 100 million people from over 30 countries. In a state of \\"total war\\", the major participants threw their entire economic, industrial, and scientific capabilities behind the war effort, erasing the distinction between civilian and military resources. Marked by mass deaths of civilians, including the Holocaust (in which approximately 11 million people were killed) and the strategic bombing of industrial and population centres (in which approximately one million were killed, and which included the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki), it resulted in an estimated 50 million to 85 million fatalities. These made World War II the deadliest conflict in human history. - Fort Eben-Emael is an inactive Belgian fortress located between Liège and Maastricht, on the Belgian-Dutch border, near the Albert Canal. It was designed to defend Belgium from a German attack across the narrow belt of Dutch territory in the region. Constructed in 19311935, it was reputed to be impregnable and at the time, the largest in the world. The fort was neutralized by glider-borne German troops (85 men) on 10 May 1940 during the Second World War. The action cleared the way for German ground forces to enter Belgium, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. Still the property of the Belgian Army, the fort has been preserved and may be visited. - The Battle of Maastricht was one of the first battles that took place during the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. Maastricht was a key city in order to capture the Belgian Fort Eben - Emael and split the allied armies in half . - The Holocaust (from the Greek ': \\"hólos\\", \\"whole\\" and \\"kaustós\\", \\"burnt\\"), also referred to as the Shoah\\"' (Hebrew: , \\"HaShoah\\", \\"the catastrophe\\"), was a genocide in which Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and its collaborators killed about six million Jews. The victims included 1.5 million children and represented about two-thirds of the nine million Jews who had resided in Europe. Some definitions of the Holocaust include the additional five million non-Jewish victims of Nazi mass murders, bringing the total to about 11 million. Killings took place throughout Nazi Germany, German-occupied territories, and territories held by allies of Nazi Germany. What is the relationship between 'battle of maastricht' and '10 may 1940'? The answer is:","completion":"The relationship between the 'Battle of Maastricht' and '10 May 1940' lies in the fact that the Battle of Maastricht took place on the 10th of May, 1940, during the early stages of the German Campaign on the Western Front during World War II. This battle was significant as it was one of the first battles that occurred in the campaign and played a key role in the overall strategy of the German military. Maastricht, a city in the Netherlands, was strategically important because it allowed access to the Belgian Fort Eben-Emael, which was considered impregnable at the time and was the largest fort in the world. Capturing the city and neutralizing the fort would enable the German forces to split the Allied armies in half and push forward into Belgium and France, unhindered by fire from Eben-Emael. On 10 May 1940, a small contingent of glider-borne German troops (85 men) effectively neutralized Fort Eben-Emael, which cleared the path for the German ground forces to enter Belgium. Meanwhile, the Battle of Maastricht took place on the same day, with German forces successfully capturing the city. This, in turn, facilitated the German assault on Fort Eben-Emael and quickened their advance into the heart of Western Europe. Consequently, the relationship between the Battle of Maastricht and the date of 10 May 1940 highlights a critical turning point in the early stages of World War II. The success of the German forces in capturing Maastricht and neutralizing Fort Eben-Emael on that particular day allowed them to carry out their planned rapid invasion of Belgium and France, which ultimately led to the rapid collapse of the French defenses and the eventual fall of France in June 1940."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bellette and Haefliger returned to Australia just before the outbreak of World War II. Shortly after her arrival, Bellette held an exhibition at Sydney's Macquarie Galleries. The couple became influential members of the Sydney Art Group, a network of \\"fashionable\\" moderns whose membership included William Dobell and Russell Drysdale. Bellette painted and held regular shows – \\"a solo show every second year and a group show every year at the Macquarie Galleries\\". Her husband served as art critic for The Sydney Morning Herald for a decade and a half.In 1942, Bellette won the Sir John Sulman Prize with For Whom the Bell Tolls. She won it again in 1944 with her painting Iphigenia in Tauris, inspired by Euripides' play. The composition is set in a dry, open landscape, with several riders on horses whose appearance suggests \\"the Australian present, rather than Greek antiquity\\". The judge awarding the prize actually preferred another of her entries, Electra, depicting the sister of Iphigenia also prominent in Greek tragedy – but it failed to meet the size requirements. Both Iphigenia in Tauris and Electra were among the many works created by Bellette in the 1940s that were inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles and Homer. Her choice of subject matter and approach placed her at odds with mainstream modernism, while she seemed to shun explicit links between the classical and the Australian. Bellette reasoned that she preferred to choose her palette and the spatial arrangements of her compositions to evoke a place's atmosphere. Critics identified the influence of European modernists Aristide Maillol and Giorgio de Chirico, as well as Italian Quattrocento painters Masaccio and Piero della Francesca, about some of whom Bellette wrote articles in the journal Art in Australia.The most distinctive feature of the artist's work was this choice of classical subjects. In 1946, Bellette's paintings were hung in at least four separate exhibitions. Reviewers commented on her synthesis of \\"the impulsiveness of romanticism... Answer:","completion":"In the article provided, it is mentioned that artist Marguerite Bellette was active during the 1940s, creating various works inspired by the tragedies of Euripides, Sophocles, and Homer. However, there is no mention of a specific textile design created in 1947 by her or any other individual. Bellette held numerous shows and was a part of the influential Sydney Art Group. She won the Sir John Sulman Prize in 1942 and 1944. Her works showcased classical subjects and European modernist influence. While Bellette was a notable artist during that time, the article does not directly provide an answer to the question regarding who created a textile design in 1947.

Please answer the following question: Information: - Alcoholism, also known as alcohol use disorder (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when two or more of the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, has difficulty cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, WernickeKorsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men. Both environmental factors and genetics are associated with alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to four times more likely to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism.

Usually, the artist/head of the vanity label is signed to the parent label, and this artist's own recordings will be released under the vanity label's brand name. Creating a vanity label can be an attractive idea for the parent label primarily as a \\"perk\\" to keep a successful artist on the label's roster happy and a venue to bring fellow artists to the public's attention. - Run Lola Run (literally \\"Lola runs\\") is a 1998 German thriller film written and directed by Tom Tykwer, and starring Franka Potente as Lola and Moritz Bleibtreu as Manni.

Widely differing definitions of drug abuse are used in public health, medical and criminal justice contexts. In some cases criminal or anti-social behavior occurs when the person is under the influence of a drug, and long term personality changes in individuals may occur as well. In addition to possible physical, social, and psychological harm, use of some drugs may also lead to criminal penalties, although these vary widely depending on the local jurisdiction. Drugs most often associated with this term include: alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabis, cocaine, methaqualone, opioids and substituted amphetamines. The exact cause of substance abuse is not clear, with theories including one of two: either a genetic disposition which is learned from others, or a habit which if addiction develops, it manifests itself as a chronic debilitating disease. In 2010 about 5% of people (230 million) used an illicit substance. Of these 27 million have high-risk drug use otherwise known as recurrent drug use causing harm to their health, psychological problems, or social problems or puts them at risk of those dangers. In 2013 drug use disorders resulted in 127,000 deaths up from 53,000 in 1990. The highest number of deaths are from opioid use disorders at 51,000. Cocaine use disorder resulted in 4,300 deaths and amphetamine use disorder resulted in 3,800 deaths.

Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes unconventional sounds within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s. - Atticus Matthew Cowper Ross (born 16 January 1968) is an English musician, songwriter, record producer, and audio engineer.

Background: James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. Context: The Civil War erupted within two months of Buchanan's retirement. He supported the United States, writing to former colleagues that \\"the assault upon Sumter was the commencement of war by the Confederate states, and no alternative was left but to prosecute it with vigor on our part\\". He also wrote a letter to his fellow Pennsylvania Democrats, urging them to \\"join the many thousands of brave & patriotic volunteers who are already in the field\\". Buchanan spent most of his remaining years defending himself from public blame for the Civil War, which was even referred to by some as \\"Buchanan's War\\". He began receiving angry and threatening letters daily, and stores displayed Buchanan's likeness with the eyes inked red, a noose drawn around his neck and the word \\"TRAITOR\\" written across his forehead. The Senate proposed a resolution of condemnation which ultimately failed, and newspapers accused him of colluding with the Confederacy. His former cabinet members, five of whom had been given jobs in the Lincoln administration, refused to defend Buchanan publicly. Initially so disturbed by the attacks that he fell ill and depressed, Buchanan finally began defending himself in October 1862, in an exchange of letters between himself and Winfield Scott that was published in the National Intelligencer newspaper. He soon began writing his fullest public defense, in the form of his memoir Mr. Buchanan's Administration on the Eve of Rebellion, which was published in 1866. Buchanan caught a cold in May 1868, which quickly worsened due to his advanced age. He died on June 1, 1868, from respiratory failure at the age of 77 at his home at Wheatland and was interred in Woodward Hill Cemetery in Lancaster. Question: Was he successful?. Whats the answer?","completion":"James Buchanan was the 15th president of the United States. Some people think he was not very successful because the Civil War started right after he left office. This big war happened between people from the northern states and the southern states, and many people blamed President Buchanan for not stopping it from happening. Even though he tried to defend himself and his actions, many people still thought he was not a good president. So, it depends on how you look at it, but lots of people would say he was not very successful."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Éduqué par le Père Timothy (prêtre britannique) pendant ses huit premières années, il apprend à écrire, compter et surtout parler en anglais. Il connaît toutes les religions de son pays, mais n'appartient à aucune. Le roman commence lorsqu'il est arrêté pour avoir gagné l'émission 'Qui veut gagner un milliard'. Comment un enfant de rue pouvait connaître les réponses des douze questions sans pour autant avoir fait des études ?! Mais l'explication est simple... Dans ses multiples vies antérieures (comme les chats !) se cachaient les réponses à toutes ces questions et d'autres encore. Et puis, il faut se méfier du karma... C'est un lecture extra.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Plot title: The Killing Movie plot: Johnny Clay (Sterling Hayden) is a veteran criminal planning one last heist before settling down and marrying Fay (Coleen Gray). He plans to steal 2 million from the money-counting room of a racetrack during a featured race. He assembles a team consisting of a corrupt cop (Ted de Corsia), a betting window teller (Elisha Cook Jr.) to gain access to the backroom, a sharpshooter (Timothy Carey) to shoot the favorite horse during the race to distract the crowd, a wrestler (Kola Kwariani) to provide another distraction by provoking a fight at the track bar, and a track bartender (Joe Sawyer). George Peatty, the teller, tells his wife Sherry (Marie Windsor) about the impending robbery. Sherry is bitter at George for not delivering on the promises of wealth he once made her, so George hopes telling her about the robbery will placate and impress her. Sherry does not believe him at first but, after learning that the robbery is real, enlists her lover Val Cannon (Vince Edwards) to steal the money from George and his associates. The heist is successful, although the sharpshooter is shot and killed by the police. The conspirators gather at the apartment where they are to meet Johnny and divide the money. Before Johnny arrives, Val appears and holds them up. A shootout ensues and a badly wounded George is the sole survivor. He goes home and shoots Sherry before dying. Johnny, on his way to the apartment, sees George staggering in the street and knows that something is wrong. He buys the biggest suitcase he can find to put the money in (and struggles to lock it properly). At the airport Johnny and Fay aren't allowed to take the suitcase along as hand luggage because of its size, and instead must check it in as regular luggage. Johnny reluctantly complies. While waiting to board their plane they watch as the suitcase falls off a cart onto the runway, breaks open, and the loose banknotes are swept away by the backdraft from the plane's propellers. Fay and Johnny leave the airport but are unable to hail a cab before officers... My question: Who do the police kill? Answer:","completion":"The police kill the sharpshooter (played by Timothy Carey) during the heist at the racetrack.

Thick, voluminous hair depends on a healthy diet filled with vitamins and minerals that cause your hair to grow strong. Get plenty of protein. Protein makes hair thick and shiny. Make sure you're getting enough in your diet by eating a lot of fish, lean meat, nuts, and eggs. Eat omega-3 fatty acids. These healthy fatty acids promote hair growth. Eat sardines, walnuts, avocados, and pumpkin seeds. Eat spinach and other leafy greens to get enough vitamin C. Take vitamins. Prenatal vitamins, especially, contain ingredients that help thicken your hair. Drink plenty of water to stay hydrated. Everyday activities you don't think about may be causing your hair to become brittle and thin. Take the following measures to protect your hair from outside factors: Keep it out of the sun. Direct sunlight can damage your hair just like it can damage your skin. If you're out in the sun a lot, start wearing a hat or a scarf to keep your hair safe. Protect it from pollution. Do you have a morning commute that involves walking near heavy traffic? Pollution from cars, buses and other automobiles can cause your hair to dry out. Consider wearing a hat when you're in areas with traffic. Don't expose it to chlorine or salt water. Chlorine in swimming pools and salt water in the ocean are a common cause of dry, damaged hair. Over time it can cause your hair to become thinner. Wear a swim cap in the pool. Rinse your hair before exposing to chlorine or salt water. When you don't wear a cap, be sure to wash out the chlorine as soon as you get out of the pool. Stress from work, family issues and any number of factors can take a physical toll that manifests as hair loss. Becoming aware of this problem can help you figure out how to eliminate the problem that might be causing your hair to thin. If possible, remove the stress from your life or deal with it using healthy methods like meditation, exercise and getting plenty of sleep. Knowing that your hair is thinning can itself become a source of stress. Ease your worry by employing new strategies to help your hair grow thick, like using natural products, skipping chemical treatments and eating a nutritious diet.","completion":"A diet lacking essential nutrients can negatively affect the volume and texture of one's hair.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Water stratification is when water masses with different properties - salinity (halocline), oxygenation (chemocline), density (pycnocline), temperature (thermocline) - form layers that act as barriers to water mixing which could lead to anoxia or euxinia.[1] These layers are normally arranged according to density, with the least dense water masses sitting above the more dense layers. Water stratification also creates barriers to nutrient mixing between layers. This can affect the primary production in an area by limiting photosynthetic processes. When nutrients from the benthos cannot travel up into the photic zone, phytoplankton may be limited by nutrient availability. Lower primary production also leads to lower net productivity in waters.[2] Now, I have a new situation: The marine biologists studied two areas of the Black Sea. Area A, situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presented high levels of water stratification, because of the fresh water discharged by the river; and area B, situated 35 miles south, where the water was less stratified and more oxygenated. Answer this question please: Which of the two areas was more oxygenated? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Area B was more oxygenated than Area A. In the given situation, Area A is situated at the mouth of the Danube River, which presents high levels of water stratification due to the fresh water discharged by the river. This stratification can lead to the formation of layers with different properties, such as oxygen content, density, and temperature, that act as barriers to water mixing. As a result, oxygen-rich surface water cannot efficiently mix with the deeper, oxygen-poor water, leading to lower overall oxygen levels in Area A. On the other hand, Area B, situated 35 miles south of Area A, has water that is less stratified and more oxygenated. The reduced stratification in this area allows for better mixing of water layers, promoting the exchange of oxygen between the surface and deeper waters. This increased oxygen availability can support a greater diversity of marine life and enhance ecosystem functioning. In summary, Area B is more oxygenated compared to Area A due to the reduced water stratification, which enables better mixing and exchange of oxygen between various water layers. If marine biologists were to study the differences in marine life and primary productivity between these two areas, they might find a higher abundance and diversity of organisms in the more oxygen-rich environment of Area B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They achieved international acclaim with their progressive and psychedelic music. Distinguished by their use of philosophical lyrics, sonic experimentation, extended compositions, and elaborate live shows, they are one of the most commercially successful and influential groups in popular music history. Pink Floyd were founded by students Syd Barrett on guitar and lead vocals, Nick Mason on drums, Roger Waters on bass and vocals, and Richard Wright on keyboards and vocals. In December 1967, the group added guitarist David Gilmour as the fifth member of Pink Floyd. Gilmour already knew Barrett, having studied with him at Cambridge Tech in the early 1960s. The two had performed at lunchtimes together with guitars and harmonicas, and later hitch-hiked and busked their way around the south of France. In 1965, while a member of Joker's Wild, Gilmour had watched the Tea Set. Morrison's assistant, Steve O'Rourke, set Gilmour up in a room at O'Rourke's house with a salary of PS30 per week (equivalent to PS500 in 2016), and in January 1968, Blackhill Enterprises announced Gilmour as the band's newest member; the second guitarist and its fifth member, the band intending to continue with Barrett as a nonperforming songwriter. Jenner commented: \\"The idea was that Dave would ... cover for [Barrett's] eccentricities and when that got to be not workable, Syd was just going to write. Just to try to keep him involved\\". In an expression of his frustration, Barrett, who was expected to write additional hit singles to follow up \\"Arnold Layne\\" and \\"See Emily Play\\", instead introduced \\"Have You Got It Yet?\\" to the band, intentionally changing the structure on each performance so as to make the song impossible to follow and learn. In a January 1968 photo-shoot of the five-man Pink Floyd, the photographs show Barrett looking detached from the others, staring into the distance. Working with Barrett eventually proved too difficult, and matters came to a conclusion in January while en route to a performance in Southampton when a band member asked if they should collect Barrett. According to Gilmour, the answer was \\"Nah, let's not bother\\", signalling the end of Barrett's tenure with Pink Floyd. Waters later admitted, \\"He was our friend, but most of the time we now wanted to strangle him\\". In early March 1968, Pink Floyd met with business partners Jenner and King to discuss the band's future; Barrett agreed to leave. Jenner and King believed Barrett to be the creative genius of the band, and decided to represent him and end their relationship with Pink Floyd. Morrison then sold his business to NEMS Enterprises, and O'Rourke became the band's personal manager. Blackhill announced Barrett's departure on 6 April 1968. After Barrett's departure, the burden of lyrical composition and creative direction fell mostly on Waters. Initially, Gilmour mimed to Barrett's voice on the group's European TV appearances; however, while playing on the university circuit, they avoided Barrett songs in favour of Waters and Wright material such as \\"It Would Be So Nice\\" and \\"Careful with That Axe, Eugene\\".

Movie title: Gangs of New York Movie plot: The film opens with Priest Vallon (Liam Neeson) shaving dry with an old, rusted straight razor. He deliberately cuts his cheek and then hands the blade to his son Amsterdam, who is about to wipe off the blood. Vallon tells him to leave it there, and his son puts away the blade in a black pouch with a sliver cross clasp. Vallon then says a prayer to St. Michael, puts a medallion over Amsterdam's head, grabs a steel cross, and marches out of his cave with Amsterdam. They walk past people making and finishing weapons, including a woman with clawed gloves named Hellcat Maggie. Vallon, his son, and the rest take communion as they continue exiting the caves. They finally reach the top level of an old brewery. They stop and Vallon asks a man named Monk if he will join them. Monk says he'll fight for pay. Vallon promises him ten dollars for every \\"new notch\\" on his club, so Monk agrees, picks up his wooden club, and kicks open the door, revealing a snow-covered intersection known as Paradise Square, the Five Points of Lower Manhattan.Vallon and his crew, the Dead Rabbits, leave the brewery and make their way onto the street. Amsterdam runs to join children on the steps of a nearby building, while the Dead Rabbits await the arrival of the Natives. A few moments later, men dressed in blue, The Natives, led by Bill the Butcher (Daniel Day-Lewis), a ruthless New Yorker with a glass eye, walk onto the street, clearly outnumbering the Rabbits.

Vallon recants that it's a free country, that he and his immigrant crowd have been harassed incessantly by Bill and his men. The Rabbits are then joined by several other gangs that have allied themselves with Vallon, greatly increasing their numbers.Moments later, they begin fighting.

A:","completion":"A: The type of cell that contains a nucleus is called a eukaryotic cell. Eukaryotic cells are complex and organized structures found in multicellular organisms, such as plants, animals, fungi, and some single-celled organisms like algae and protozoa. They are characterized by the presence of a nucleus, which is a membrane-bound organelle that houses the cell's genetic material - the DNA. Eukaryotic cells differentiate themselves from prokaryotic cells primarily due to the presence of various membrane-bound organelles within their cytoplasm. These organelles play specialized roles in carrying out different functions necessary for the proper functioning and survival of the cell. Some of the significant organelles found in eukaryotic cells include: 1. Nucleus: This is the control center of the cell, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA). It is surrounded by a double membrane called the nuclear envelope, which has nuclear pores for the movement of molecules in and out of the nucleus. 2. Mitochondria: These are the cell's energy-producing structures, often referred to as the \\"powerhouses\\" of the cell. They are responsible for generating ATP (adenosine triphosphate), the cell's primary energy currency, through a process known as cellular respiration. 3. Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER): This serves as the cell's transportation network and is involved in the synthesis and folding of proteins as well as lipid metabolism. The ER consists of two types: rough ER (which has ribosomes attached to it) and smooth ER. 4. Golgi Apparatus: This organelle is responsible for modifying, sorting, and packaging proteins and lipids for transport to other parts of the cell or secretion out of the cell. 5. Lysosomes: These are the \\"digestive\\" organelles of the cell and contain enzymes that break down various waste materials and cellular debris. 6. Vacuoles: Found primarily in plant cells but also in some animal cells, vacuoles are storage organelles that contain a variety of substances, including water, ions, and nutrients. 7. Chloroplasts: These are the primary photosynthetic organelles in plant cells and some algae, responsible for converting energy from sunlight into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. Apart from these organelles, eukaryotic cells also possess a cytoskeleton, a complex network of protein filaments that provide structural support, maintain cell shape, and play a crucial role in various cellular processes like cell division, movement, and intracellular transport. Finally, eukaryotic cells are surrounded by a plasma membrane (also known as the cell membrane), which is a lipid bilayer that forms a selective barrier, controlling the passage of ions and molecules into and out of the cell and maintaining the cell's integrity. Overall, eukaryotic cells are distinctly characterized by the presence of a nucleus, a wide range of organelles, and complex, organized structures necessary for carrying out various cellular activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How does the sentence end? Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it.","completion":"The sentence could potentially end in several ways depending on the context you want to emphasize. Here are some possibilities: 1. \\"Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it, showing the different ways in which grief reacts in different people.\\" This ending emphasizes the contrast between the responses of the two brothers to their mother's death. It highlights that grief manifests in various ways and its duration differs from person to person. 2. \\"Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it, indicating a deep emotional bond he'd cherished with their mother.\\" This version insinuates that Neil had a closer or different relationship with their mother compared to Aaron, suggesting his grief is perhaps a reflection of this unique bond. 3. \\"Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it, making him feel isolated in his continuous sorrow.\\" Here, the ending stresses Neil's feelings of isolation and estrangement. Suggesting not only grief over his mother's death but also a sense of solitude due to a lack of shared feelings with his brother, Aaron. 4. \\"Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it, leading him to seek professional help to deal with his grief.\\" This ending focuses more on the aftermath of Neil's chronic depression. It introduces the idea of Neil seeking therapy or professional aid, suggesting a potential turning point in his struggle. 5. \\"Neil was still depressed years after his mother's death, even though his brother, Aaron, had gotten over it, which often led to bitter arguments between the two, tearing apart the remnants of their already strained relationship.\\" The universal theme of conflict is highlighted here, pointing to the subsequent negative impact on the brothers' relationship because of their contrasting emotional states. Each ending alters the narrative's tone and direction, providing different perspectives into the characters' experiences and responses to the event of their mother's death.

Sydney Francis Barnes (19 April 1873 - 26 December 1967) was an English professional cricketer who is generally regarded as one of the greatest ever bowlers. He was right-handed and bowled at a pace that varied from medium to fast-medium with the ability to make the ball both swing and break from off or leg. He is the quickest bowler to achieve 150 Test wickets in history. Barnes was unusual in that, despite a very long career as a top-class player, he spent little more than two seasons in first-class cricket, representing Warwickshire and Lancashire. Barnes' career began in 1888 when he was fifteen and played for a small club which had a ground behind the Galton Hotel in Smethwick. Soon afterwards, he joined Smethwick Cricket Club and played for its third team. He was taught to bowl off spin by Billy Bird, the Smethwick professional who had played for Warwickshire, and then taught himself to bowl leg spin. In due course, he was selected for the second team and had earned a place in the first team, playing in the Birmingham and District Premier League, at the start of the 1893 season. In 1894, when Barnes was a 21-year-old fast bowler, he was asked to join the ground staff of Staffordshire County Cricket Club but he found the terms unattractive. Instead, he joined Rishton Cricket Club in the Lancashire League where the pay was better than in any form of county cricket, largely because of match bonuses and collections. Wilfrid S. White commented that Barnes' career in league cricket \\"stands out unparalleled, unapproached, by any other player\\". Later in the 1894 season, Barnes was invited to play for Warwickshire, who were due to enter the County Championship in 1895. His debut was in a minor match against Cheshire at Edgbaston on 20-21 August. Barnes bowled only 8 overs, taking none for 27, and the match was drawn. On 23 August, Barnes made his first-class debut for Warwickshire against Gloucestershire at Clifton College Close Ground, except that he did not take the field as play was restricted by bad weather to just 72 overs of his team's first innings, in which they reached 102-2.

During the grave robbery, the graverobbers remove the wolfsbane buried with him and he is awakened from death by the full moon shining down on his uncovered body, and kills one of them. Talbot is found by police in Cardiff and taken to hospital where he is treated by Dr. Mannering. During the full moon, Talbot transforms and kills a police constable. Dr. Mannering and Inspector Owen, not believing his story of being a werewolf, travel to the village of Llanwelly to investigate Talbot. While they're away, Talbot escapes from the hospital. Seeking a cure for the curse that causes him to transform into a werewolf with every full moon, Talbot leaves Britain and seeks the gypsy woman Maleva. Together, they travel to the remains of Frankenstein's castle in the village of Vasaria, where Talbot hopes to find the notes of Dr. Ludwig Frankenstein so he might learn how to permanently end his own life through scientific means. By chance, during his transformations into a werewolf, he falls into the castle's frozen catacombs. After wandering around, he discovers Frankenstein's monster (Bela Lugosi) who had been frozen in ice. Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey), hoping she knows their hiding place.

There was an aquarium at the mall and Jason liked visiting it but Brian did not because","completion":"he felt that the underwater creatures were not being treated fairly, and that their living conditions were not spacious enough to truly allow them to thrive. This disagreement often sparked lively debates between Jason and Brian whenever the topic of the mall aquarium came up in conversation. Jason was fascinated by the various species of fish, the vibrant corals, and the mysterious feeling of the underwater world that the aquarium seemed to encapsulate. He felt that it provided a unique insight into marine life that he could not experience anywhere else, and admired the educational aspects of the experience. When he walked through the tunnel-like aquarium, with the water and sea creatures surrounding him, he felt transported – as if he was scuba diving and exploring the depths of the ocean himself. This sense of awe and connection with the underwater world always left Jason eager to return for more; in fact, he often argued that the aquarium was an important resource for inspiring children and adults alike to care more for ocean conservation efforts. Brian, on the other hand, was an avid advocate for the rights and wellbeing of all creatures, marine or terrestrial. He saw the mall aquarium as a commercial exploitation of marine life, and believed that these creatures should be allowed to live freely in their natural habitats rather than being confined to a relatively small space for human entertainment. Brian had read numerous articles condemning the conditions in which many marine animals are kept in captivity, and was concerned about the potentially stressful and damaging effects that such an environment might have on them. He felt that it was essential for people to learn about marine life, but argued that there were alternative ways to educate and inspire without harming the animals. Instead of confining the creatures to a small, artificial environment, he believed that documentaries, books, and lectures from marine biologists could provide valuable information about marine life without causing harm. He also advocated for the idea of sustainable ecotourism, where tourists could see these creatures in their natural habitats, directly supporting conservation efforts and local communities. As the friendship between Jason and Brian continued, they would often engage in lengthy discussions and share ideas on the subject of marine life and conservation. Over time, these conversations helped both of them gain a deeper appreciation for one another's perspectives and find common ground in caring for the well-being of marine creatures. They began to collaborate on various initiatives designed to raise awareness about ocean preservation, such as beach cleanups, fundraising events for marine conservation organizations, and educational outreach programs for schools. Despite their differing opinions, the lively conversations and shared passion for marine life that Jason and Brian had nurtured throughout their friendship ultimately led them to work together for a shared goal: to protect the ocean and its inhabitants, and to inspire others to do the same. Through their combined efforts, they hoped to make a positive impact on the world and ensure a sustainable future for all living creatures – both in and out of the water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make a hollow standing rectangle, 5 blocks high and 4 blocks long (corners are not necessary; you can use any block as a stand-in). Then strike the inside of the rectangle with flint and steel. The empty inner space should turn purple and start to make interesting sounds. Stand in the portal and wait 4 seconds to be transported into the Nether. Make sure you have your flint and steel for relighting the portal in case it breaks from a ghast and plenty of food to keep yourself well-fed. A Nether Fortress is a structure in the Nether that contains Nether Wart and a Blaze spawner. They can be somewhat hard to find, so it could take a while. Blazes drop Blaze rods, which are needed for making potions and getting to the endgame. You will need a lot of Blaze rods. Nether Wart is a key ingredient in potions, and it only grows on Soul Sand, so collect some Soul Sand (it's brown with a face-like pattern) and try farming it in your base. Nether Wart can be found naturally occurring in nether fortresses in two small patches alongside stairs going upwards.

On 12 January 2010, M.I.A. posted a video clip on Twitter, which featured a new song, but revealed no information about it other than the heading \\"Theres space for ol dat I see\\" (sic). The following day her publicist confirmed that the track was entitled \\"Space Odyssey\\" and had been produced in collaboration with Rusko to protest a travel piece about Sri Lanka printed in The New York Times. The track made it onto the final album under the revised title \\"Space\\". The same month, she filmed a short film for the song \\"Born Free\\". At the end of April the track was released as a promotional single, and the short film accompanying the song was released. The film, directed by Romain Gavras, depicts a military unit rounding up red-headed young men who are then shot or forced to run across a minefield. The film, which also features nudity and scenes of drug use, caused widespread controversy and was either removed or labelled with an age restriction on YouTube. In the weeks following the release of the film, M.I.A. was the most blogged about artist on the Internet, according to MP3 blog aggregator The Hype Machine. M.I.A. found the controversy \\"ridiculous\\", saying that videos of real-life executions had not generated as much controversy as her video.

Here is a premise: Thus, by using this evaluation technique, we are able to avoid the need for obtaining productive hourly costs translated into dollars using purchasing power parities. Here is a hypothesis: The money saved by using these techniques can be spent on more important things. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine whether it is possible to conclude that if the given premise is true, the hypothesis is also true, it is crucial to examine the relationships between the variables and the statements of the premise and hypothesis. Premise: By using the evaluation technique, the need for obtaining productive hourly costs translated into dollars using purchasing power parities is avoided. This premise states that when employing the evaluation technique mentioned (though the specifics of this technique are not provided), organizations and individuals can eliminate the need to calculate productive hourly costs by converting them into dollars using purchasing power parities (PPP). Since PPP accounts for differences in the cost of living and price levels between countries, it essentially equalizes the purchasing power of currencies, allowing specific comparisons to be made. Hypothesis: The money saved by using these techniques can be spent on more important things. This hypothesis implies that the use of the evaluation technique will result in cost savings, and the money that would have been spent on calculating productive hourly costs can instead be allocated to other, more essential matters. To determine the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise, it is necessary to establish if there is a causal relationship between the use of the evaluation technique and the generation of cost savings. It is important to clarify that cost savings, as mentioned in the hypothesis, may be interpreted in two primary ways: actual monetary savings or opportunity cost savings. The latter refers to the reduction in time and effort spent on calculating costs using purchasing power parities, which allows the organization to allocate its resources – including staff and funds – more effectively. This clarification is relevant because the premise does not explicitly say that there will be cost savings; it only states that this method prevents the need for cost translations using PPP. Given this context, one can argue that the hypothesis can be true if the premise is true, but the conclusion is not definitive. The premise suggests that the evaluation technique can potentially lead to both monetary and opportunity cost savings, but it does not guarantee such savings. To strengthen the argument and conclusively state that the premise entails the truth of the hypothesis, additional information and assumptions need to be established: 1. The evaluation technique is less expensive or resource-intensive than calculating productive hourly costs using PPP. 2. There are no hidden or additional costs associated with implementing and using the evaluation technique. 3. The saved time and resources are reallocated to more important things, which implies that the organization is capable of identifying and utilizing these priorities effectively. In summary, while it is possible to conclude that the hypothesis could be true if the premise is true, there is no absolute certainty. The relationship between the premise and hypothesis is dependent on additional assumptions that need to be clarified, and whether or not the organization using the evaluation technique can effectively make use of the (potential) savings generated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Firstly, an Investigational New Drug (IND) filing needs to be submitted to the FDA. This filing should include sufficient pre-clinical data to justify proceeding to trials on human subjects. Following approval of the IND, there are three phases of clinical trials that must be conducted on human participants. Phase I of these trials usually involves studying the potential toxicity of the drug using healthy volunteers. In Phase II, the pharmacokinetics of the drug is studied, which means understanding how the drug is absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and excreted in the body. Dosing of the drug is also examined in patients during this phase. Phase III, the final phase of these clinical trials, involves conducting a large-scale study on the efficacy of the drug in the intended patient population. Following the successful completion of all these phases of testing, a New Drug Application (NDA) must be submitted to the FDA for review. The FDA then reviews the data submitted and examines the benefit-risk assessment of the product.

Would you say that these questions are the same?","completion":"While the two questions asked are related to employment, they are not the same as they deal with different industries and geographic locations. The first question pertains to the difficulty of acquiring a job as a fashion buyer, while the second question is about the process for a Turkish chemist to work in London. Below, I provide a detailed response for each question. 1. Is it hard to get a job as a fashion buyer? The fashion buyer profession is competitive and can be challenging to enter, especially for candidates with little to no experience in the field. Factors that can affect the difficulty of securing a job as a fashion buyer include personal skills, qualifications, industry experience, and the overall demand for fashion buyers in the market. To increase your chances of landing a job as a fashion buyer, consider the following tips: a) Gain relevant education: A bachelor's degree in fashion, merchandising, or a related field can serve as a solid foundation. Some universities offer specialized programs in fashion buying and supply chain management, which can provide industry-specific knowledge and skills. b) Gain experience: Build your experience by working in entry-level positions within the retail sector or fashion industry, such as sales associate or visual merchandiser. These positions will help you understand the workings of a retail environment and provide valuable insights into customer buying patterns. c) Develop your skills: Strong negotiation, communication, and analytical skills are crucial for fashion buyers. Familiarize yourself with market trends and consumer behavior, as well as the sourcing and manufacturing processes associated with fashion products. d) Network: Attend fashion events, job fairs, and trade shows to meet industry professionals and potential hiring managers. Building connections within the industry can open up opportunities and improve your chances of securing a job. e) Prepare an outstanding resume and portfolio: Showcase your relevant education, experience, and skills, as well as any internships or volunteer work that demonstrate your knowledge and passion for the fashion industry. 2. How can a Turkish chemist work in London? For a Turkish chemist to work in London, they must go through a series of steps, including obtaining the required qualifications, searching for available job opportunities and applying, securing a job offer, and obtaining the necessary visa or work permit. a) Obtain the necessary qualifications: A chemist typically needs at least a bachelor's degree in chemistry or a related field. Advanced positions may require a master's degree or Ph.D., along with specialized training and experience in the subfield of interest. b) Search for job openings: Utilize various resources, such as job websites, networking events, and social media platforms, to find job opportunities in London. Companies and research institutions may also post positions on their websites. c) Apply for positions: Prepare a strong CV and cover letter that highlight your qualifications, experience, and skills as a chemist. If required, obtain a Credential Evaluation from a recognized UK organization to ensure your qualifications are recognized in the United Kingdom. d) Secure a job offer: Go through the interview process and work on showcasing your qualifications and experiences that make you the ideal candidate for the position. e) Obtain the necessary visa or work permit: As a Turkish national, you will need a visa or work permit to work in London. This often includes the Skilled Worker visa, previously known as the Tier 2 (General) visa, which requires sponsorship from the UK employer. Ensure you and your employer meet all the eligibility requirements for the visa category. In conclusion, although the questions are both related to employment, they are not the same as they involve disparate industries and locations. The first question is about the challenges of pursuing a career as a fashion buyer, while the second question focuses on the process for a Turkish chemist to work in London."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide some basic information about the Czech language, it's one of the Slavic languages family and it's spoken by approximately 10 million people worldwide. In terms of its structure, the Czech language uses the Latin alphabet enhanced with several diacritical marks (accents), namely kroužek, háček, and acute accent. These accent marks can change both the sound and meaning of words. This standard alphabet was introduced in the 14th century by Jan Hus, a Czech theologian and reformer, making Czech one of the oldest written Slavonic languages. Czech features a well-articulated and systematic grammar that makes widespread use of inflections, changing the ends of words to express an array of grammatical relations and allowing for flexible sentence structures. It has seven declension classes for nouns and adjectives and three for pronouns, an aspect we see often in many Slavic languages. Czech vocabulary is mainly derived from Proto-Slavic and Common Slavic roots, but it has also borrowed many words from other languages, especially Latin, German, and English in recent decades. The Czech Republic has a high level of education, and as a result, a significant percentage of the population has fluency or at least a basic level of English, which facilitates communication with non-Czech speakers. Modern Czech literature has produced several esteemed works, and Prague, the capital of the Czech Republic, is known for being a city with a rich historical and cultural heritage. The language continues to evolve and is now influenced significantly by English, the de facto global language of business and internet communication. Given the sentence you've written in Czech, \\"Horko nesnesitelné a domovní kanalizace... ...no,ta se ani nedá popsat\\", the partial translation in English would be \\"Intolerable heat and domestic sewage... ...well, one can't even describe that.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He won the marathon at the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome while running barefoot, setting a world record. At the 1964 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Abebe was the first athlete to successfully defend an Olympic marathon title, breaking his own world record in the process. Abebe returned to his homeland a hero. He was greeted by a large crowd, many dignitaries and the commander of the Imperial Guard, Brigadier-General Mengistu Neway. Abebe was paraded through the streets of Addis Ababa along a procession route lined with thousands of people and presented to Emperor Haile Selassie. The emperor awarded him the Star of Ethiopia and promoted him to the rank of asiraleqa (corporal). He was given the use of a chauffeur-driven Volkswagen Beetle (since he did not yet know how to drive) and a home, both owned by the Guard. On December 13, 1960, while Haile Selassie was on a state visit to Brazil, Imperial Guard forces led by Mengistu began an unsuccessful coup and briefly proclaimed Selassie's eldest son Asfaw Wossen Taffari emperor. Fighting took place in the heart of Addis Ababa, shells detonated in the Jubilee Palace, and many of those closest to the emperor were killed. Although Abebe was not directly involved, he was briefly arrested and questioned. Mengistu was later hanged, and his forces (which included many members of the Imperial Guard) were killed in the fighting, arrested or fled. In the 1961 Athens Classical Marathon, Abebe again won while running barefoot. This was the second and last event in which he competed barefooted. The same year he won the marathons in Osaka and Kosice. While in Japan, he was approached by a Japanese shoe company, Onitsuka Tiger, with the possibility of wearing its shoes; they were informed by Niskanen that Abebe had \\"other commitments.\\" Kihachiro Onitsuka suspected that Abebe had a secret sponsorship deal with Puma, in spite of the now-abandoned rules against such deals. Abebe ran the 1963 Boston Marathon, finishing fifth in 2:24:43, the only time in his competitive career that he completed an international marathon without winning. He and countryman Mamo Wolde, who finished 12th, had run together on record pace for 18 miles, until cold winds and the hills in Newton caused both to fall back. The race was won by Belgium's Aurele Vandendriessche in a course record 2:18:58. Abebe returned to Ethiopia and did not compete in another marathon until 1964 in Addis Ababa.

From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness.

We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Here is a news article: An National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration satellite image taken Nov. 11 shows a strong area of low pressure over the northern Great Lakes. The NOAA confirmed recently that hackers breached its weather system. (AP) Hackers from China breached the federal weather network recently, forcing cybersecurity teams to seal off data vital to disaster planning, aviation, shipping and scores of other crucial uses, officials said. The intrusion occurred in late September but officials gave no indication that they had a problem until Oct. 20, said three people familiar with the hack and the subsequent reaction by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, which includes the National Weather Service. Even then, NOAA did not say its systems were compromised. Officials also said that the agency did not notify the proper authorities when it learned of the attack. NOAA officials declined to discuss the suspected source of the attack, whether it affected classified data and the delay in notification. NOAA said publicly last month that it was doing “unscheduled maintenance” on its network, without saying a computer hack had made that necessary. In a statement released Wednesday, NOAA spokesman Scott Smullen acknowledged the hacks and said “incident response began immediately.” He said all systems were working again and that forecasts were accurately delivered to the public. Smullen declined to answer questions beyond his statement, citing an investigation into the attack. NOAA's satellites provide the bulk of the information for generating weather models, advisories and warnings to the nation and world. Maintaining the operations and data acquisition from these satellites is a 24/7 process. This video was filmed at the NOAA Satellite Operations Facility in Suitland, Md., where command, control and data distribution systems are located. (NOAA/YouTube) Determining the origin of cyber­attacks is difficult, experts said, and Chinese officials have denied repeated accusations that they intrude in U.S. government computer systems for espionage or other purposes. Geng Shuang of the Chinese Embassy said the consulate was not aware of the case and had not been contacted by the U.S. government about the attacks. “Cyberattack is quite common in today’s cyberspace,” he said. “Jumping to conclusions on its origin without hard evidence is not responsible at all.” The embassy also urged “relevant U.S. parties to stop this kind of unfounded accusation.” But NOAA confirmed to Rep. Frank R. Wolf (R-Va.) that China was behind the attack, the congressman said. Wolf has a long-standing interest in cybersecurity and asked NOAA about the incident after an inquiry from The Washington Post. “NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China,” said Wolf, who also scolded the agency for not disclosing the attack “and deliberately misleading the American public in its replies.” “They had an obligation to tell the truth,” Wolf said. “They covered it up.” Commerce Department Inspector General Todd Zinser said his office was not notified of the breach until Nov. 4, well after he believes the hack occurred. He said that is a violation of agency policy requiring any security incident to be reported to his office within two days of discovering the problem. “We’re in the process of looking into the matter, including why NOAA did not comply with the requirements to notify law enforcement about the incident,” Zinser said. Wolf said he did not know if the breach involved classified material or what information was accessed. Confirmation of the NOAA hack followed an admission Monday by the U.S. Postal Service that a suspected Chinese attack — also in September — compromised data on 800,000 employees, including letter carriers on up through the postmaster general. NOAA officials also would not say whether the attack removed material or inserted malicious software in its system, which is used by civilian and military forecasters in the United States and also feeds weather models at the main centers for Europe and Canada. NOAA’s National Ice Center Web site also was down for a week in late October. The center is a partnership with the Navy and Coast Guard to monitor conditions for navigation. The two-day outage skewed the accuracy of National Weather Service long-range forecasts slightly, according to NOAA. The attack in September hit a Web server that connects to many NOAA computers, said one person familiar with the incursion. The server had security protections, but the person compared the security to leaving a house protected by “just a screen door.” Smullen’s statement said that four sites were hit by the breach. Weather satellites orbit hundreds to thousands of miles above Earth and offer continuous views of weather systems, such as hurricanes, thunderstorms and cold fronts, while also measuring temperature and moisture at different altitudes — all crucial bits that feed prediction models. To get that information to the public, NOAA makes satellite data and imagery publicly available through the Web, as well as file-transfer networks for downloads. NOAA has characterized its decision to cut off satellite images as causing minimal disruption. But it has previously touted those same systems as intrinsic to the nation’s “environmental intelligence.” NOAA satellites “provide critical data for forecasts and warnings that are vital to every citizen and to our economy as a whole,” NOAA Administrator Kathryn D. Sullivan said a year ago. Wolf said a hack could steal technical insights or cull isolated information “that may not look significant until they’re put with something else and then they become valuable.” “The Chinese are stealing us blind,” Wolf said. The attack on NOAA joins a spate of cyber-espionage on federal systems revealed recently, including an attack suspected from Russia that breached unclassified White House computer networks. The October satellite data outage meant that the National Weather Service and centers around the world did not receive large amounts of information. “All the operational data sent via NOAA, which is normally an excellent service, was lost,” said Stephen English, head of the satellite section at the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts in Reading, England. The center is renowned for running a highly advanced global weather prediction model that during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, for example, aided evacuations and preparations in the United States when it signaled that the superstorm would hit land rather than hook out to sea. The Rutgers University Global Snow Lab, which provides daily snow cover updates for researchers and forecasters using a data feed from the Ice Center, posted a notice on its Web site that its reports were incomplete throughout the outage. A July report on NOAA by the Inspector General for the Commerce Department — where NOAA sits — criticized an array of “high-risk vulnerabilities” in the security of NOAA’s satellite information and weather service systems. The report echoed the views of a 2009 audit from the IG that said the primary system that processes satellite data from two environmental and meteorological systems had “significant” security weaknesses, and that “a security breach could have severe or catastrophic adverse effects.” The watchdog’s previously unreleased report, obtained by The Post under a Freedom of Information Act request, called for “immediate management attention” and said NOAA’s security planning was so poor that the agency had little idea how vulnerable its system was. ||||| Just a few months after a blistering internal report warned of serious technology security problems in the agency that oversees the National Weather Service, the agency confirmed Wednesday that it was recently the victim of a cyberattack on four of its websites — an attack that one of the agency's congressional overseers said was orchestrated by China. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, or NOAA — which not only provides satellite data for climate researchers and weather forecasters, but also helps manage the network of GPS satellites critical to business and military operations — said that the attack was detected \\"in recent weeks\\" and that \\"unscheduled maintenance\\" addressed the problem. NOAA gave no further details because an investigation is continuing. But \\"NOAA told me it was a hack and it was China,\\" Rep. Frank Wolf, R-Virginia, chairman of the House Appropriations subcommittee that oversees NOAA, told The Washington Post. Wolf accused NOAA of \\"deliberately misleading the American public in its replies.\\" \\"They had an obligation to tell the truth,\\" Wolf told the newspaper. \\"They covered it up.\\" NOAA's own records show that it issued seven technical alerts reporting significant \\"network problems\\" on Oct. 19 and 20, which caused the loss of some weather data and delays in satellite data transmissions affecting email and Internet connectivity. It said the outage was resolved through \\"unscheduled maintenance\\" — the same wording it used in confirming the recent cyberattack. The problems affected four agencies for which NOAA provides or coordinates data, two of them related to the military — the Air Force Weather Agency, the Navy's fleet meteorology center, the SNPP polar-orbiting environmental satellite system and the products division of the National Environmental Satellite Data and Information Service. It's that last office — the environmental satellite data service, or NESDIS — that an inspector general's report sharply took to task in July for \\"significant security deficiencies\\" that threaten a \\"risk in its national critical mission.\\" The report (PDF) from the internal watchdog of the Commerce Department, NOAA's home agency, faulted NESDIS for inadequately applying security measures across workstations and servers, most notably in systems that relay distress signals to search and rescue operations and systems that are connected to other government networks, which it said \\"could provide an attacker with access to these critical assets.\\" Poor security in NESDIS' information systems \\"increase the risk of cyber attacks,\\" the report concluded. NOAA eventually agreed with most of the report's recommendations, but only after a delay so it could review potentially classified material involving the Air Force — one of the services involved in the October outage. An inspector general's report in July said weaknesses in NOAA's security left it open to cyberattacks on critical systems.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: Carson tried to win the game. He always tried hard to win in any situation. Given the context: Why did Carson do this? Possible answers: hide an injury, hide his fears, show off to others The answer is:","completion":"Carson's determination to win the game and his consistent effort to excel in any situation could be attributed to a combination of factors such as concealing an injury, masking his fears, or impressing others. Each of these motives will be examined in detail below. 1. Hiding an injury: In certain situations, athletes or individuals who participate in competitive games may attempt to conceal an injury. The primary reason for doing so is to avoid being seen as weak or vulnerable and to maintain their position or status within the team, community, or social circle. This might mean pushing themselves beyond their physical limits to prove their ability to persevere despite the pain they're experiencing. In Carson's case, this could be the driving force behind his persistent efforts to win. He might believe that hiding his injury and continuing to excel is the key to retaining his standing or avoiding criticism from others. 2. Hiding his fears: Another possible explanation for Carson's unwavering determination to win is that he could be using his performance in the game to mask his insecurities or concerns. For instance, he might worry about how others might perceive him if he doesn't win or if he is seen as a weak link, which would make him feel vulnerable. By constantly striving to be the best and securing victories, Carson could direct attention away from his fears and present a confident, successful image. This might help him feel more in control and maintain the illusion of emotional stability. 3. Showing off to others: Additionally, Carson's actions could stem from a desire to seek approval, validation, or admiration from others. Society often places a strong emphasis on success, and one's achievements or victories can significantly influence their social standing. This might be particularly important in a competitive sports setting, where the ability to win or excel is highly sought-after and respected. In this context, Carson's efforts to consistently win and emerge as a strong competitor might be a way for him to flaunt his skills, abilities, and prowess, thereby winning the admiration and respect of his peers, coaches, or onlookers. In conclusion, there are several potential motives behind Carson's consistent efforts to win the game and excel in any situation. He could be trying to hide an injury to avoid appearing weak or losing his position; he might be masking his fears and presenting a confident, successful image; or he may be seeking approval, validation, or admiration from others by showcasing his talents and securing victories. Each of these factors, or a combination of them, could explain Carson's determined attitude and unwavering commitment to winning."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

That is what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the American Heart Association recommend. They say high schools should provide about four hours of physical activity each week. Yet many schools across the country have reduced their physical education programs. Criticism of the cuts has led in some places to efforts to give students more time for exercise, not less. The future health of Americans may depend on it. A study reports that life expectancy has fallen or is no longer increasing in some parts of the United States. The situation is worst among poor people in the southern states, and especially women. Public health researchers say it is largely the result of increases in obesity,smoking and high blood pressure. They also blame differences in health services around the country. In 2006, a study found that only 4% of elementary schools provided daily physical education all year for all grades. This was true of 8% of middle schools and 2% of high schools. The study also found that 22% of all schools did not require students to take any P. E. One problem for P. E. teachers is that schools are under pressure to put more time into academic subjects. Also, parents may agree that children need exercise in school. Yet many parents today still have bad memories of being chosen last for teams because teachers favored the good athletes in class. But experts say P. E. classes have changed. They say the goal has moved away from competition to personal performance, as a way to build a lifetime of activity. These days, teachers often lead activities like weight training and yoga.

The song illustrates a dysfunctional dynamic between the band and a record label executive who congratulates the group on their current sales success, implying that they are on the same team while revealing that he erroneously believes \\"Pink\\" is the name of one of the band members. According to author David Detmer, the album's lyrics deal with the \\"dehumanising aspects of the world of commerce\\", a situation the artist must endure to reach their audience.Absence as a lyrical theme is common in the music of Pink Floyd. Examples include the absence of Barrett after 1968, and that of Waters' father, who died during the Second World War. Waters' lyrics also explored unrealised political goals and unsuccessful endeavours. Their film score, Obscured by Clouds, dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance that sometimes comes with ageing. Longtime Pink Floyd album cover designer, Storm Thorgerson, described the lyrics of Wish You Were Here: \\"The idea of presence withheld, of the ways that people pretend to be present while their minds are really elsewhere, and the devices and motivations employed psychologically by people to suppress the full force of their presence, eventually boiled down to a single theme, absence: The absence of a person, the absence of a feeling.\\" Waters commented: \\"it's about none of us really being there ... [it] should have been called Wish We Were Here\\".O'Neill Surber explored the lyrics of Pink Floyd and declared the issue of non-being a common theme in their music. Waters invoked non-being or non-existence in The Wall, with the lyrics to \\"Comfortably Numb\\": \\"I caught a fleeting glimpse, out of the corner of my eye. I turned to look, but it was gone, I cannot put my finger on it now, the child is grown, the dream is gone.\\" Barrett referred to non-being in his final contribution to the band's catalogue, \\"Jugband Blues\\": \\"I'm most obliged to you for making... Answer:","completion":"The film score that dealt with the loss of youthful exuberance is Pink Floyd's Obscured by Clouds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write an article with the title: \\"Haunting images show inside of derelict Victorian-era asylum\\"","completion":"Title: \\"Scary Pictures Show Inside an Old, Empty Hospital from Long Ago\\" Have you ever heard about old hospitals called asylums? Well, they are not like the cozy and comfortable hospitals you see today. A long time ago, during the Victorian era, these old hospitals weren't very nice for the people who lived there. Even though they were built to help people who were feeling sick or sad, they weren't that great at making people feel better. People didn't get the care or attention they needed, and many times, they felt lonely and hurt. Well, friends, somebody took pictures of an old asylum from the Victorian times, and these pictures are scary and a little bit sad. They show us how the hospital looks like inside after being empty for a long time. These pictures show empty rooms with broken windows and paint that has cracked and peeled off the walls. There are also spooky remains of broken beds, chairs, and old things that were used a long time ago. Imagine walking in there and hearing old stories of what happened at that place! The floors and walls look dirty and dark, and it's hard to imagine that people once lived there. But these pictures remind us how things used to be and how much better our hospitals are now. Today, we have doctors and nurses who really care about us and make sure we get the care we need when we're feeling sick or sad. Looking at these scary pictures helps us remember that we are lucky to live in a time where we have modern hospitals with kind and helpful people who want to make us feel better. And they also remind us of the importance of being loving and gentle to other people, like the patients who were treated in those old asylums needed when they felt lonely and scared. So, my dear friends, let's remember to be grateful for the good things we have now, and even though these pictures are spooky and sad, we can learn from the past and make sure the future is full of kindness and care."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Please answer the following question: The parking lot for the Center for Addictions Treatment was in the back of the building, as was the front door. The entrance opened on the only addition to the original farmhouse, a smallish room where the receptionist sat at one of two desks. The area was called the secretarial pod. The entrance to Ray's office, both medication and technician area, was right behind the secretary's desk. To the left was another door, kept closed, which led down the hallway to the client sleeping rooms, the dining room and the kitchen. There was a phone right inside the front door (or the back door, depending upon who you asked). When Ray wanted to smoke, he would lean out the front door, propping it open with his back in such a way that he could see down the hallway if he propped that door open as well and answer the phone should it ring. Smoking was prohibited inside the building, a policy which grew increasingly unpopular with both the staff and the clients as the course of the year wore on. By December, Ray would have to do weekly fire drills around three a.m. as a way of politely reminding his anti-social and policy impaired population that any building more than a century old was actually little more than well formed kindling. After enough of those, any problem he had been having with people smoking in the building usually went away. Given the right incentives, even this population could be relatively self-regulating. The telephone rang before Ray was even half-finished with his cigarette. \\"Admit it now, Ray.\\" She sounded petulant. \\"Fine, I admit it.

Frustrated and worried about the safety of the precious gem, he sighed and paused for a moment, his eyes darting around his small, dusty workshop as if to find a solution hidden amongst the tools and trinkets scattered across the workbench. The jeweler, an old and wise man named Ezekiel, had been entrusted with this rare diamond, called the Celestial Sparkle, by a mysterious and influential customer. He knew that there were others who sought the diamond, so he needed to protect it at all costs. Taking a deep breath, Ezekiel decided to get to work and devise a new way to secure the diamond. As he rummaged through his collection of tools, his eyes fell upon a set of intricate blueprints that had been left partially obscured beneath a stack of old books. He had purchased these plans many months ago at an eccentric inventor's workshop. The blueprints detailed a hidden room within a room - a secret chamber that seemed like a perfect place to store the diamond. Ezekiel meticulously examined the plans and started to reformulate the layout in his mind to fit the dimensions of his workshop. Starting at once, the old jeweler began clearing away the clutter from the back corner of the room. He erected a temporary wooden frame, and using a skill saw, meticulously cut out a section of the floor. The secret chamber was designed to be hidden under a false panel, with the opening mechanism hidden within an antique clock that would sit atop the floor panel. The clock had been collecting dust in the corner of the workshop, its intricate mahogany body, and brass gears calling out to be used for a purpose so fitting as this. As he worked on installing the clock mechanism and carefully disguised the secret chamber's entrance, Ezekiel remembered the stories behind the Celestial Sparkle. Legend had it that the diamond had been crafted by an ancient civilization that possessed advanced technology and abilities beyond human understanding. The unique properties of the Celestial Sparkle enabled it to capture the light of the cosmos and project it, creating a celestial map that would guide its bearer to unparalleled knowledge and limitless power. With the hidden chamber now complete, Ezekiel securely placed the Celestial Sparkle inside a velvet-lined box, and carefully lowered it into the secret vault beneath the workshop floor. He slid the false panel into place, obscuring the precious gem from view and adding an extra layer of security by locking the antique clock's gears with a specially designed key. The old jeweler felt a wave of relief as he finished concealing the diamond, confident that it would be safe from any intruders who may come looking for it. Unbeknownst to Ezekiel, however, a nefarious group led by the cunning and ruthless Maximillian Thorne had caught wind of the Celestial Sparkle's location. Thorne, a renowned collector of rare and mystical artifacts, had long sought the diamond for his ultimate goal of unlocking the absolute power it promised. His ragtag team of thieves and mercenaries followed any leads they could find, with Thorne himself orchestrating their every move. Unaware of the looming threat, Ezekiel continued his daily routine, expertly crafting fine jewelry in his workshop, with the antique clock ticking away above the diamond's hidden chamber. He knew the mysterious customer would return within the next few weeks to retrieve the Celestial Sparkle, but for now, he felt secure that he had done everything in his power to keep it safe. As the days went by, Thorne's group closed in on the small, unsuspecting town where Ezekiel and the Celestial Sparkle were hidden away. Complex plans and strategies were conceived as they prepared to steal what they believed was rightfully theirs. Soon, Ezekiel's life would become intertwined with the dark ambitions of Maximillian Thorne, a dangerous cat-and-mouse game fueled by greed, power, and the ancient secrets of the Celestial Sparkle. For now, however, Ezekiel could rest easy, unaware of the storm that lay ahead and the epic confrontation that would determine the fate of the celestial gem and the untold knowledge it held within."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\"\\"?

Question: What is amplified by playback equipment? Context: Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.

Half of Brits would refuse to get in a driverless car and 41 per cent fear AI robots will take over the world The news comes as Tesla announce all of their cars will become self-driving by 2018 THE TECH that scares Brits the most has just been revealed. Just under half of Brits would refuse to use driverless cars and see them as the least trusted tech development. In a study conducted by easyCar Club, 47 per cent of respondents said they would refuse to set foot in a driverless car. It may be easy to dismiss these worries, but as seen in the fatal Tesla crash where Joshua Brown died after ploughing into a lorry, the public’s worries may be warranted. The news comes just as Tesla announces its plan to make all their cars autonomous by 2018. Another 46 per cent of those surveyed said they are worried AI will make them lose touch with the real world. While 29 per cent of those surveyed said they fear artificial intelligence would harm them. This was a sentiment echoed by Professor Stephen Hawking who recently warned that developing AI should be the “last thing we do”. Speaking at Cambridge University, the brainbox said he believed robots could end up becoming more intelligent that humans – and could end up deciding they no longer need to serve us. Hawking expressed worry at the idea that developing AI to such a high level could result in the creation of autonomous weapons. “I believe there is no deep difference between what can be achieved by a biological brain and what can be achieved by a computer.\\" Hawking said at the launch of The Leverhulme Centre for the Future of Intelligence. “It therefore follows that computers can, in theory, emulate human intelligence – and exceed it. “In short, success in creating AI could be the biggest event in the history of our civilisation. “But it could also be the last unless we learn how to avoid the risks. “Alongside the benefits, AI will also bring dangers – like powerful autonomous weapons, or new ways for the few to oppress the many. “It will bring great disruption to our economy.” We pay for your stories!

Like other Spanish liberals, Goya was left in a difficult position after the French invasion. He had supported the initial aims of the French Revolution, and hoped its ideals would help liberate Spain from feudalism to become a secular, democratic political system. There were two conflicts being fought in Spain: the resistance against the French threat, and a domestic struggle between the ideals of liberal modernisation and the pre-political incumbent ruling class. The latter divide became more pronounced—and the differences far more entrenched—following the eventual withdrawal of the French.Several of Goya's friends, including the poets Juan Meléndez Valdés and Leandro Fernández de Moratín, were overt afrancesados: the supporters (or collaborators, in the view of many) of Joseph Bonaparte. He maintained his position as court painter, for which an oath of loyalty to Joseph was necessary. However, Goya had an instinctive dislike of authority, and witnessed first-hand the subjugation of his countrymen by French troops. During these years he painted little aside from portraits of figures from all parties, including an allegorical painting of Joseph Bonaparte in 1810, Wellington from 1812 to 1814, and French and Spanish generals. Meanwhile, Goya was working on drawings that would form the basis for The Disasters of War. He visited many battle sites around Madrid to witness the Spanish resistance. The final plates are testament to what he described as \\"el desmembramiento d'España\\"—the dismemberment of Spain.

Movie plot title: Blade: Trinity Movie plot: Vampire explorers in Syria uncover an ancient tomb, which they believe belongs to Dracula, the first vampire. To keep Blade from interfering, they frame him for the murder of a human familiar. FBI agents subsequently locate Blade's hideout and kill his mentor and friend, Abraham Whistler. Demoralized, Blade surrenders and is arrested. Posing as federal marshals, the vampires persuade the authorities to turn Blade over to them. He is rescued by private investigator Hannibal King and Abigail Whistler, Abraham's daughter, who invite Blade to join their band of vampire hunters, the Nightstalkers. From them, Blade learns that Danica Talos, an old enemy of King's, has revived Dracula, or \\"Drake\\", with the goal of using his powers to cure vampires of their weaknesses. As Drake is too powerful to kill via normal means, the Nightstalkers have created an experimental bioweapon known as Daystar, capable of killing vampires at the genetic level. However, they have failed to make it effective. Eager to test Blade, Drake isolates him from the Nightstalkers, as he considers them unworthy of challenging him. He explains that all humans and vampires are inferior in his eyes and that he intends to wipe them from the Earth. Abigail finds evidence of Drake's true plan: a network of farms where humans are drained of their blood for vampire consumption. In an act of euthanasia, Blade deactivates the farm's life support systems. Returning to the Nightstalkers's hideout, they find all of them dead except for King and a young girl named Zoe, who have been taken captive. A recording left by Daystar's creator reveals that Drake's blood is needed to render it effective, but only at the cost of his life. King is tortured by the vampires for information, but refuses to talk, even when they threaten to feed him Zoe's blood. Blade and Abigail arrive and free the captives. Drake easily bests Blade in single combat and prepares to kill him with an arrow filled with Daystar. At the last second, Blade stabs him with it, triggering a chemical...

He knew that his readers were already familiar with the concept of transmutation of species from Vestiges, and his introduction ridicules that work as failing to provide a viable mechanism.

I asked him about the most vivid memory of his life. One morning, as he was heading towards his office, he realized that the road he regularly takes was unusually bumpy. Upon inspection, he came to the conclusion that a truck carrying stones passed by on that road and unintentionally scattered few stones along the way. He believed that the authority of the truck will take care of this later that day. Next morning, the road situation was unchanged with stones still scattered. He parked his vehicle nearby, put on some music and started kicking the stones off the road. Within a few minutes, a school bus stopped by, students gathered around and started clapping for this true Indian. As he turned around, he said “Helping hands are better than clapping hands”. As a repercussion, the students started helping this man kick the stones off the road. A task that would have taken hours to be done by one person was completed in a couple of minutes. What a great example of team work! It was this man’s discretionary efforts that brought a change in the thought process of the students, India’s next generation. We all point fingers and blame one another for societal problems but never act upon it. If this man, a true Indian, would have just blammed the truck driver and went on his way, would the road still be cleared? The next time we point fingers at someone for a social cause, we must keep in mind that that someone is an Indian just like us. Will a true Indian point fingers at an Indian? Are we pointing fingers at ourselves? In the end, we are all in the same team. Question: What is probably true about the man's actions? Options: A.

To determine why Jan did this, let's analyze the possible answers step by step: 1. Have the money to buy it: It's possible that Jan had the money to buy the book, but that alone wouldn't justify why they put it on their shelf. People usually buy things they can afford, but the key is understanding why they used their money on a particular item. 2. Add to the collection: It is more likely that Jan bought the book and put it on their shelf to add it to their existing collection. People who are interested in reading or collecting books would typically store books on a shelf and expand their collection over time. This action indicates that Jan values books and wants to keep them. 3. Burn the book: This option doesn't make sense in this context, as there is no indication that Jan has any malicious intent. Buying a book just to burn it would be irrational, and adding it to the shelf suggests preservation rather than destruction.

Hypothesis: Edgar Francis Jones was not as good of a football player than the six others voted higher than him for the Heisman Trophy in 1941.","completion":"Based on the given context, it is not possible to accurately draw the hypothesis that Edgar Francis Jones was not as good of a football player as the six others voted higher than him for the Heisman Trophy in 1941. The context provides information about Jones' career and achievements but does not provide enough information to compare his performance with those who were voted above him in the Heisman Trophy race that year. Moreover, using only Heisman Trophy voting as the sole criterion to determine a player's ability and talent may be flawed. There are several factors to consider when comparing football players, such as their individual stats, positions, and the impact they had on their team's overall performance. Additionally, the Heisman Trophy voting process itself is subjective, considering that it involves opinions from sportswriters and former winners. It is essential to gather more information about the individual performances, statistics, and contributions of Edgar Francis Jones and the six players ranked higher than him in 1941 Heisman Trophy to make a more concrete and accurate hypothesis. A more comprehensive analysis that takes into account their college career stats, achievements, and NFL performance would be necessary to determine if Jones was indeed not as good as the other six players. In conclusion, while the context provided gives an overview of Jones' accomplishments, it does not offer sufficient data to draw a reliable hypothesis about his ability compared to the six football players ranked above him in the 1941 Heisman Trophy voting. Further information and analysis would be required to gauge the relative skill level of these players accurately."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Idled Young Americans THE idle young European, stranded without work by the Continent’s dysfunction, is one of the global economy’s stock characters. Yet it might be time to add another, even more common protagonist: the idle young American. For all of Europe’s troubles — a left-right combination of sclerotic labor markets and austerity — the United States has quietly surpassed much of Europe in the percentage of young adults without jobs. It’s not just Europe, either. Over the last 12 years, the United States has gone from having the highest share of employed 25- to 34-year-olds among large, wealthy economies to having among the lowest. The grim shift — “a historic turnaround,” says Robert A. Moffitt, a Johns Hopkins University economist — stems from two underappreciated aspects of our long economic slump. First, it has exacted the harshest toll on the young — even harsher than on people in their 50s and 60s, who have also suffered. And while the American economy has come back more robustly than some of its global rivals in terms of overall production, the recovery has been strangely light on new jobs, even after Friday’s better-than-expected unemployment report. American companies are doing more with less. “This still is a very big puzzle,” said Lawrence F. Katz, a Harvard professor who was chief economist at the Labor Department during the Clinton administration. He called the severe downturn in jobs “the million-dollar question” for the economy. Employers are particularly reluctant to add new workers — and have been for much of the last 12 years. Layoffs have been subdued, with the exception of the worst months of the financial crisis, but so has the creation of jobs, and no one depends on new jobs as much as younger workers do. For them, the Great Recession grinds on. For many people with jobs and nest eggs, the economy is finally moving in the right direction, albeit a long way from booming. Average wages are no longer trailing inflation. Stocks have soared since their 2009 nadir, and home prices are increasing again. But little of that helps younger adults trying to get a foothold in the economy. Many of them are on the outside of the recovery looking in. The net worth of households headed by people 44 and younger has dropped more over the past decade than the net worth of middle-aged and elderly households, according to the Federal Reserve. According to the Labor Department, workers 25 to 34 years old are the only age group with lower average wages in early 2013 than in 2000. The problems start with a lack of jobs. In 2011, the most recent year for which international comparisons exist, 26.2 percent of Americans between ages 25 and 34 were not working. That includes those for whom unemployment is a choice (those in graduate school, for example, or taking care of children) and those for whom it is not (the officially unemployed or those who are out of work and no longer looking). The share was 20.2 percent in Canada, 20.5 percent in Germany, 21 percent in Japan, 21.6 percent in Britain and 22 percent in France. The European economy has deteriorated over the last two years, and the American economy has strengthened modestly. But the job growth here has been fast enough merely to keep pace with population growth, which suggests that this country still lags in the employment of young adults. In 2000, by contrast, the United States led Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Japan — as well as Australia, Russia and Sweden — in such employment rates. The nation now trails them all. Older American workers have also lost relative ground, but not as much. As Mr. Katz, Mr. Moffitt and others note, an explanation of the root causes remains elusive. But there are obvious suspects, and each probably plays a role. The United States, for example, has lost its once-large lead in producing college graduates, and education remains the most successful jobs strategy in a globalized, technology-heavy economy. It is no accident that the most educated places in the country, like Boston, Minneapolis, Washington and Austin, Tex., have high employment rates while the least educated, including many in the South and inland California, have low ones. The official unemployment rate for 25- to 34-year-old college graduates remains just 3.3 percent. Beyond education, the nation has also been less aggressive than some others in using counseling and retraining to help the jobless find work. To take one small example, a recent study in France by the renowned M.I.T. economist Esther Duflo and four colleagues found that placement programs for unemployed workers helped not only the workers but the economy too. The counseled workers were more likely to find work, and they did not simply take jobs from other candidates. Overall employment rose more quickly in the regions with job counseling. Other research notes that the United States has expanded parental leave and part-time work less than other countries — and, perhaps relatedly, employment rates among women here have slipped. Whatever role these trends are playing, they do not appear to fully explain the employment decline. It is too big and too widespread. Existing companies are not adding jobs at the same rate they once did, and new companies are not forming as quickly. What might help? Easing the parts of the regulatory thicket without societal benefits. Providing public financing for the sorts of early-stage scientific research and physical infrastructure that the private sector often finds unprofitable. Long term, nothing is likely to matter more than improving educational attainment, from preschool through college (which may have started already). Many business executives and economists also point to immigration policy. Done right, an overhaul could make a difference, many say, by allowing more highly skilled immigrants to enter the country and by making life easier for those immigrants already here. Historically, immigrants have started more than their share of new companies. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the jobs slump is that the Americans in their 20s and 30s who have been most affected by it remain decidedly upbeat. They are much more hopeful than older generations, polls show, that the country’s future will be better than its past. Based on what younger adults have been through, that resilience is impressive. It’s probably necessary, too. The jobs slump will not end without a large dose of optimism. David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times. What was this article about?","completion":"This article discusses the high rate of unemployment among young Americans aged 25-34 years old, which has surpassed much of Europe.

The article highlights that education likely plays a role in the employment rates, as more educated regions in the US have higher employment rates. Other factors that may play a role include less aggressive use of counseling and retraining to help jobless people find work, and differences in parental leave and part-time work policies compared to other countries.

Sutcliffe was born in Bingley in the West Riding of Yorkshire to a working-class family. He was given a Catholic upbringing by his parents, John William Sutcliffe and his wife Kathleen Frances (nee Coonan). Reportedly a loner, he left school aged fifteen and had a series of menial jobs, including two stints as a gravedigger in the 1960s. Between November 1971 and April 1973, Sutcliffe worked at the Baird Television factory on a packaging line. West Yorkshire Police were criticised for being inadequately prepared for an investigation on this scale. It was one of the largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the information overload of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents. Assistant Chief Constable George Oldfield was criticised for being too focused on a hoax confessional tape that seemed to indicate a perpetrator with a Wearside background, and for ignoring advice from survivors of Sutcliffe's attacks, and several eminent specialists including the FBI, plus dialect analysts such as Stanley Ellis and Jack Windsor Lewis, whom he had also consulted throughout the manhunt, that \\"Wearside Jack\\" was a blatant hoaxer. The investigation used it as a point of elimination rather than a line of enquiry and allowed Sutcliffe to avoid scrutiny, as he did not fit the profile of the sender of the tape or letters. The \\"Wearside Jack\\" hoaxer was given unusual credibility when analysis of saliva on the envelopes he sent showed he had the same blood group as the Yorkshire Ripper had left at crime scenes, a type shared by only 6% of the population. The hoaxer appeared to know details of the murders which had not been released to the press, but which in fact he had acquired from his local newspaper and pub gossip. The official response to the criticisms led to the implementation of the forerunner of the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System, the development of the Major Incident Computer Application (MICA), developed between West Yorkshire Police and ISIS Computer Services. In response to the police reaction to the murders, the Leeds Revolutionary Feminist Group organised a number of 'Reclaim the Night' marches. The group and other feminists had criticised the police for victim-blaming, especially the suggestion that women should remain indoors at night. Eleven marches in various towns across the United Kingdom took place on the night of 12 November 1977. They made the point that women should be able to walk anywhere without restriction and that they should not be blamed for men's violence. In 1988, the mother of Sutcliffe's last victim, Jacqueline Hill, during action for damages on behalf of her daughter's estate, argued in the High Court that the police had failed to use reasonable care in apprehending the murderer of her daughter in Hill v Chief Constable of West Yorkshire. The House of Lords held that the Chief Constable of West Yorkshire did not owe a duty of care to the victim due to the lack of proximity and therefore failing on the second limb of the Caparo test.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What had to happen to the floor","completion":"of the incident room to cope with the weight of the paper?

Today, we are going to talk about some companies that want to help people who lost their jobs and are looking for a break.

Recently, some travel companies and an airline decided to support those who don't have a job right now. When you use these companies for your holiday trip, they give you special benefits if you don't have a job. This makes it easier and more fun for these people to have a good time! One airline called JetBlue is being very kind. If you buy a ticket with JetBlue, they give you your money back if you lost your job after buying the ticket. That way, you don't have to worry about money during your vacation, because you know you're safe with JetBlue. Another company called Intrepid Travel wants to help too. They are giving a 15 percent discount to people who have lost their jobs. They think that everyone should have a chance to go on a trip and have fun, even if they don't have a job.

Because dizygotic twins develop from two eggs fertilized by two sperm, they are no more identical than siblings born at different times. Much less commonly, a zygote can divide into two separate offspring during early development. This results in the birth of monozygotic (or identical) twins. Although the zygote can split as early as the two-cell stage, splitting occurs most commonly during the early blastocyst stage, with roughly 70–100 cells present. These two scenarios are distinct from each other, in that the twin embryos that separated at the two-cell stage will have individual placentas, whereas twin embryos that form from separation at the blastocyst stage will share a placenta and a chorionic cavity.

Ralphie's desire is rejected by his mother, his teacher Miss Shields, and even a department store Santa Claus, all giving him the same warning: \\"You'll shoot your eye out.\\" Christmas morning arrives and Ralphie dives into his presents. Although he does receive some presents he enjoys, Ralphie ultimately is disappointed that he did not receive the one thing he wanted more than anything. After it appears all of the presents have been opened, Ralphie's father, who is referred to throughout the film as \\"The Old Man,\\" directs Ralphie to look at one last present that he had hidden. Ralphie opens it to reveal the Red Ryder gun he wanted. Ralphie takes the gun outside and fires it at a target perched on a metal sign in the backyard. However, the BB ricochets back at Ralphie and knocks his glasses off. While searching for them, thinking he has indeed shot his eye out, Ralphie accidentally steps on his glasses and breaks them. In order to cover for the fact that he accidentally broke his glasses, Ralphie tells his mother that a falling icicle was responsible for the accident. His mother, not having seen what actually happened, believes him. The film ends with Ralphie lying in bed on Christmas night with his gun by his side.

Question: This article: In 1976—first in London, then in the United States—\\"New Wave\\" was introduced as a complementary label for the formative scenes and groups also known as \\"punk\\"; the two terms were essentially interchangeable. NME journalist Roy Carr is credited with proposing the term's use (adopted from the cinematic French New Wave of the 1960s) in this context. Over time, \\"new wave\\" acquired a distinct meaning: bands such as Blondie and Talking Heads from the CBGB scene; the Cars, who emerged from the Rat in Boston; the Go-Go's in Los Angeles; and the Police in London that were broadening their instrumental palette, incorporating dance-oriented rhythms, and working with more polished production were specifically designated \\"new wave\\" and no longer called \\"punk\\". Dave Laing suggests that some punk-identified British acts pursued the new wave label in order to avoid radio censorship and make themselves more palatable to concert bookers.Bringing elements of punk rock music and fashion into more pop-oriented, less \\"dangerous\\" styles, new wave artists became very popular on both sides of the Atlantic. New wave became a catch-all term, encompassing disparate styles such as 2 Tone ska, the mod revival inspired by the Jam, the sophisticated pop-rock of Elvis Costello and XTC, the New Romantic phenomenon typified by Ultravox, synthpop groups like Tubeway Army (which had started out as a straight-ahead punk band) and Human League, and the sui generis subversions of Devo, who had gone \\"beyond punk before punk even properly existed\\". New wave became a pop culture sensation with the debut of the cable television network MTV in 1981, which put many new wave videos into regular rotation.

Fanatic: Gunman Mohammed Merah, who is said to have recorded the footage sent to Al-Jazeera. A disturbing video showing the killings of three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school was sent to a TV network - but not by the gunman who filmed it, police said. The revelation raises the possibility of an accomplice to the crimes. Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera has said it will not air the footage of the Toulouse shootings after the video arrived at its office in Paris. It appears to have been recorded during Mohammed Merah's deadly attacks earlier this month. The decision not to broadcast the video, which was sent on a USB memory stick along with a letter to the station, came after French president Nicolas Sarkozy and family of the victims had asked for it not to be shown. Police believe it was filmed by the gunman himself, who was killed last week after a 32-hour stand-off with police at his apartment. Merah recorded all of his murders, which began on March 11 with the shooting of a French soldier. Before the rampage ended, two more soldiers, three Jewish children and a rabbi were killed. Al-Jazeera's announcement came as it emerged that Merah's convicted criminal father plans to sue the French government for ‘murdering’ his son. In what is likely to be one of the most controversial legal actions in criminal history, Mohammed Benalel Merah wants an apology and compensation. This is despite the fact that he is a convicted drug dealer who had next to nothing to do with his son from the age of six, and now lives in Algeria. Mr Merah, who is in his 60s, said that his son, who murdered seven people in total, stood ‘no chance’ against the police. Meanwhile, it has been claimed that the killer had spied for the French secret service before his ten-day spree. Italian. newspaper Il Foglio alleges that the Muslim fanatic acted as an. informer to the DGSE intelligence agency while travelling to Israel,. Jordan and Afghanistan in 2010. In return for information about Islamic terror cells, the paper said, French agents allowed Merah to travel freely. Il Foglio claims details of this arrangement were leaked by French and Israeli spies. Respect: President Nicolas Sarkozy delivers a speech today before magistrates and policemen who investigated the shootings. Earlier he joined calls for the gunman's footage not to be aired after it was sent to broadcasters. Elsewhere. on the continent, police in Spain arrested a suspected Al Qaeda member. who is thought to have been key to the terror cell's internet. operations, spreading propaganda and working to recruit jihadists. Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz. said the arrest was not connected to the murders in France, adding that. the Jordanian-born Saudi citizen had 'administered one of the world's. most important jihadist forums'. The letter sent to Al-Jazeera said Merah's killings were carried out in the name of Al Qaeda. Zied Tarrouche, the network's Paris bureau chief, said the note was written in poor French with spelling and grammatical errors. The. images it accompanied appear to have been taken from the point of view. of the killer, he said, perhaps from a camera hung around Merah's neck. They were shaky but of a high technical quality. The video had clearly been edited with. religious songs and recitations of Koranic verses laid over the. footage, Mr Tarrouche said. He added: 'You can hear gunshots at. the moment of the killings. You can hear the voice of this person who. has committed these assassinations. You can hear also the cries of the. victims, and the voices were distorted.' Earlier Mr Sarkozy had asked that the images not be broadcast. 'I. ask the managers of all television stations that might have these. images not to broadcast them in any circumstances, out of respect for. the victims - out of respect for the Republic,' he said. Family: Police arrest Abdelkader Merah, the gunman's older brother. The killer's father has now spoken out in public, vowing to sue the French government for shooting his son dead. There has been no indication that other stations received the footage. Mr Tarrouche said: 'We are not a. sensationalist channel. We're not looking to broadcast images without. weighing the risks and the consequences. That's why the management will. decide today after meeting at headquarters in Qatar.' The decision not to broadcast the images came a few hours later. As. France tries to come to terms with the attacks shown in the video, the. gunman's estranged father says French special forces could easily have. ‘taken my son alive’. Mr Merah said: ‘They could have used gas to capture him, but they preferred to kill him. ‘I’m. going to hire the biggest named lawyers and work for the rest of my. life to pay their costs. I will sue France for killing my son.’ Siege: A hooded policeman looks out of a window at the bullet-ridden apartment where Merah made his last stand. The killer's father claims police could have taken him alive. His move was immediately condemned by. Mr Sarkozy’s government, who revealed that Mohammed Benalel Merah spent. four years in prison in Toulouse before returning to his homeland of. Algeria. In 1999 he was arrested for drug. dealing on the Toulouse estate where Mohammed junior grew up, and in. June 2000 he was sentenced to five years in prison. The term was. increased by nine months for witness tampering. Alain. Juppe, France’s foreign secretary, said: ‘If I was the father of a. monster like that, I’d shut up out of shame’, while a spokesman for Mr. Sarkozy said the legal action was ‘abhorrent’. Anti-terrorist prosecutor Francois Molins, meanwhile, said police did ‘everything they could to arrest Merah alive’. The French authorities' activities prior to Merah's killings have also come into question. Security chiefs were today refusing to comment on Il Foglio's claim that they may have been working with the killer before his attacks in south-west France. The Italian newspaper said: 'Merah was considered to fit the profile of the kind of young man who could infiltrate terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan, and provide crucial intelligence to western countries.' Prime Minister Francois Fillon last week defended the state's intelligence agencies and insisted France had had 'no grounds' to detain Merah before he went on his rampage. He told French radio: 'There was no single element to allow for the detention of Mohammed Merah. France mourns: Hundreds of people gather in Toulouse's Capitol square for a minute's silence in memory of Merah's victims. 'Intelligence agents had watched him for long enough to come to the conclusion that there was no indication that this was a dangerous man who would one day pass from words to acts. 'Merah was interrogated, watched and listened to, and appeared to be a man living a normal life.' The self-styled Islamic warrior, who was shot dead by police marksmen, is said to be buried in Algeria, so that his grave will not be desecrated in France. Merah’s brother, 29-year-old Abdelkader Merah, has been charged with aiding and abetting the terrorist. Both brothers are thought to have been members of radical Islamic groups in Toulouse, and Merah was known to security services in both France and America. Spanish police today arrested a suspected member of Al Qaeda who was key to the terror group's internet propaganda and recruiting operations, officials said. The suspect arrested in the eastern city of Valencia 'administered one of the world's most important jihadist forums', dedicated to recruiting and indoctrinating Islamic terrorists, Interior Minister Jorge Fernandez Diaz said. The name of that forum and the suspect's name were not given, only his initials, MHA. He is Jordanian-born with Saudi citizenship. 'He was known within the organisation as Al Qaeda's librarian,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said, without specifying what that term meant in this case. The suspect worked at home for '8 to 15 hours a day' for Al Qaeda and for two offshoots, Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb and Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, the minister said. 'He spread jihadist ideas and worked to recruit and arrange transportation of possible jihadists to Afghanistan and other countries where terrorism is very active,' Mr Fernandez Diaz said. The Interior Ministry said in a statement he was arrested as part of a probe that determined the man used the Web to distribute videos designed to encourage terrorist acts, the ministry said in a statement. The minister said the raid in which he was arrested was not linked to the recent killings in Toulouse, France. However, he added that gunman Mohammed Merah became indoctrinated thanks to the work of people like the Valencia suspect. Spanish authorities said today's arrest stemmed from a probe that began in February 2011. The suspect was arrested at home on orders from an investigating magistrate in Madrid. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"This comprehensive article contains a number of significant points revolving around the 2012 attacks in Toulouse, France, carried out by Mohammed Merah, who filmed his killings and expressed affiliation with Al Qaeda. Here are the main takeaways from this article: 1. Shocking Video Footage: A disturbing video showing the killings of three French soldiers and four people at a Jewish school was recorded by the shooter, Mohammed Merah, and sent to Arabic TV network Al-Jazeera. However, the footage was sent not by the gunman himself, but by an unidentified individual, raising the possibility of an accomplice. 2. Al-Jazeera's Decision: Responding to appeals from French president Nicolas Sarkozy and the victims' families, Al-Jazeera decided not to air the video. 3. Merah's Father's Intent to Sue: Mohammed Benalel Merah, Mohammed Merah's father, who was largely absent from his son's life and is a convicted drug dealer living in Algeria, plans to sue the French government for the death of his son. His reasoning was that they could have captured his son alive instead. 4. Merah's Possible Connection with French Intelligence: Italian newspaper Il Foglio suggested that Merah may have worked as an informant for the DGSE intelligence agency in 2010, providing information on Islamic terror cells while traveling through Israel, Jordan, and Afghanistan. Merah's free travel was supposed to be a result of this arrangement. 5. Merah's Brother Arrested: Mohammed Merah's brother, Abdelkader Merah, was arrested and charged with complicity in the terrorism, raising questions about potential radical Islamic networks operating in Toulouse. 6. Al Qaeda Member Arrested in Spain: Spanish police arrested a key member of Al Qaeda, involved in the terror group's online operations. The arrest in Valencia was unrelated to the Toulouse attacks but sheds light on the larger digital network of extremist recruitment and propaganda. 7. Legal and Sociopolitical Fallout: The act of Merah's father to sue the state sparked significant outrage in France. There were also questions about how the French intelligence agencies handled the situation as it emerged that they might have collaborated with Merah in the past. Overall, the article deals with a number of violent events and their dire repercussions, leaving a lasting impact on multiple nations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Four-Cylinder Engines Are Smaller, Quieter and Gaining New Respect Civilizing the 4-cylinder engine, a popular power source for vehicles in the United States dating back to the Model T, once posed a huge challenge. While in-line 4s can be elegantly simple, the up-and-down motion of their pistons produces an annoying — and unavoidable — imbalance that grows with engine size. Modern 4-cylinders provide relief from the buzzing through the use of technologies that can quell the inherent noise and harshness, including counterbalance shafts, sophisticated combustion controls and improved sound deadening and engine mounts. An alternate plan, used by Subaru today (and Volkswagen in earlier times), is to design engines that don’t generate the jitters in the first place. Boxer engines, whose four cylinders are laid flat in 180-degree opposition, naturally cancel out most vibration, without a need for balance shafts. But while boxer 4s (or even the V-4 engines used in many motorcycles) offer advantages in smoothness, automakers say that their modern in-line 4s are smooth enough to satisfy even the fussiest customers. Still, for consumers like Jennifer and Jarid Lukin of Ardsley, N.Y., saving fuel and money remains the biggest lure. The recently traded their 6-cylinder Acura TL for a new Honda Accord EX-L and its 190-horsepower 4. The Accord is rated at 25 m.p.g. in combined city and highway driving by the E.P.A., compared with 21 for the Acura. “With our lifestyle, we didn’t need a 6-cylinder,” Ms. Lukin said. “The 4-cylinder isn’t a racecar, but I’m not racing to day care.” Hybrids, Ms. Lukin said, might post even better mileage, but also cost thousands of dollars extra upfront. “We’re saving money right now, and in the long term,” she said. Those kind of consumer calculations spurred Hyundai to draw up what seemed a bold strategy only a year ago: to build its 2011 Sonata family sedan with only 4-cylinder engines, no optional V-6. Now that choice seems prescient. The midsize Sonata is selling well with a 2.4-liter, direct-injection 4 that is the strongest and most frugal in its class: 200 horsepower with 35 highway m.p.g. Compare that with 1990, when the Sonata’s 4 produced a puny 116 horsepower and just 25 highway m.p.g. “These are good times,” said John Krafcik, chief executive of Hyundai Motor America. “Americans aren’t counting cylinders any more.” This fall, the Sonata will offer a turbocharged 4 that combines 274 horsepower with a highway rating of 34 m.p.g. A Sonata Hybrid will harness an electric motor, lithium-polymer batteries and, yes, a gas 4-cylinder, to return roughly 38 m.p.g. General Motors’ Buick division has matched Hyundai’s strategy with its 2011 Regal sedan. A version of the stylish Opel Insignia sold in Europe — where even big autobahn sedans rely on smaller gasoline or diesel engines — the midsize Regal offers a choice of a 182-horsepower 4-cylinder or a 220-horsepower turbo version. Smaller engines also trim vehicle weight and development costs, and not simply because they are lighter or have fewer parts. Engineers, Mr. Krafcik said, did not have to spend time designing a stronger chassis for the Sonata to support a V-6 version. “If you have a V-6 in the lineup, it makes the 4-cylinder version heavier than it needs to be,” Mr. Krafcik said. Let’s not overlook the green elephant in the room; this trend is not driven entirely by consumer demand or environmental consciousness on the part of automakers. Around the world, downsized engines are the linchpin of strategies to meet stricter fuel-economy and pollution rules, including limits on carbon-dioxide emissions. In the United States, the regulatory bar calls for new cars and trucks to average at least 34.1 m.p.g. by 2016, a level that would result in emissions of 250 grams of carbon dioxide per mile driven. That carbon cutoff is itself momentous: cars will need to improve mileage to about 37.8 m.p.g., up from the current 27.5 m.p.g., with trucks rising to 28.8 m.p.g. from 23.5 today. Even at companies like Ford, which has ambitious plans for electric vehicles, leaders say that downsizing engines in mainstream products will save vastly more fuel than will hybrids, diesels or electrics — and at much lower cost to consumers. Ford has pledged to put 1.3 million of its EcoBoost engines on the road by 2013 — two-thirds of them 4-cylinder versions — and to offer them in 80 percent of its model lineup. Brett Hinds, Ford’s manager of advanced engine design, called EcoBoost “the cornerstone of our sustainability efforts.” “A hybrid can have a big impact per vehicle, but the numbers sold are relatively small,” Mr. Hinds said. “EcoBoost engines can have a large-scale impact on global carbon dioxide, fuel consumption and oil imports.” Of course, if gasoline stays relatively affordable, Americans may resist the small-engine gospel and backslide into big V-8s. But Mike Omotoso, powertrain forecaster for J. D. Power, said more consumers were resigning themselves to a world of higher-price gas and choosing their cars accordingly. Ford is placing a big industry bet with the redesigned Explorer, looking to restore sales and shine to what was once America’s top-selling S.U.V. The 2011 model will offer an optional turbocharged 2-liter EcoBoost with 4 cylinders, a count that might have seemed laughable in the Explorer’s heyday. Yet that pint-size engine produces a surprising 237 horsepower and 250 pound-feet of torque — just 5 pound-feet less than the 3.5-liter V-6 alternative, with the tradeoff that it makes 53 fewer horses. It’s also expected to deliver about 19/27 m.p.g. in city and highway driving, according to Ford, a 30 percent improvement from the previous Explorer’s V-8. Relying on the architecture of the Ford Taurus, the new Explorer — now a car-based crossover — shaves several hundred pounds from the old pickup-based version, making a small engine more suitable. That engine alone trims nearly 100 pounds, and as with the Sonata, weight savings snowballed through the design. While the pricing isn’t official, Ford has said it will charge more for the EcoBoost model than for the V-6 version. Some customers, Mr. Hinds acknowledges, may resist paying extra for an engine with fewer cylinders. Yet test-driving the EcoBoost Explorer, he said, would bring skeptics into the growing 4-cylinder fold — and have them convincing friends that bigger isn’t always better: “I drove the 2-liter Explorer, and it was great,” is what Mr. Hinds hopes they will be saying.

Texasin sinetti Translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Texasin sinetti\\" is in Finnish, and when translated to English, it means \\"the seal of Texas.\\" The Seal of Texas is the official emblem of the state, representing its sovereignty and historical significance. It is used on official documents, government buildings, and seals of public institutions. The design of the Texas state seal consists of a five-pointed star, the Lone Star, encircled by two concentric circles. The Lone Star represents the independent spirit and unity of Texans. The words \\"The State of Texas\\" are inscribed along the inner circle, signifying its status as a Republic before it became a part of the United States. The outer circle displays a combination of symbols, representing different aspects of Texas history. These include an olive branch and a live oak branch, symbolizing peace and strength, respectively, and the Texas longhorn, representing the cattle industry's role in the state's economic development.

This has been the subject of debate among modern scholars. The most detailed ancient description of the nature and location of the Acra is found in Josephus' Antiquities of the Jews, where it is described as residing in the Lower City, upon a hill overlooking the Temple enclosure: ...and when he had overthrown the city walls, he built a citadel [Greek: Acra] in the lower part of the city, for the place was high, and overlooked the temple; on which account he fortified it with high walls and towers, and put into it a garrison of Macedonians. However, in that citadel dwelt the impious and wicked part of the multitude, from whom it proved that the citizens suffered many and sore calamities. The location of the \\"lower part of the city\\", elsewhere referred to as the \\"Lower City\\", at the time of Josephus (1st century CE) is accepted to be Jerusalem's south-eastern hill, the original urban center traditionally known as the City of David. Lying to the south of the Temple Mount, however, the area exposed today is significantly lower than the Mount itself. The top of the Mount is approximately 30 metres (98 ft) above the ground level at the southern retaining wall of the later Herodian-era expansion of the Temple enclosure. The elevation decreases to the south of this point. Josephus, a native of Jerusalem, would have been well aware of this discrepancy, yet is nevertheless able to explain it away by describing how Simon had razed both the Acra and the hill on which it had stood. Archaeological research south of the Temple Mount, however, has failed to locate any evidence for such large-scale quarrying. On the contrary, excavations in the region have uncovered substantial evidence of habitation from the beginning of the first millennium BCE down to Roman times, casting doubt on the suggestion that during Hellenistic times the area was significantly higher than it was at the..., what would be the answer ?

Article:They quickly subsided to 18-3 and you feel something exceptional will need to happen from the overnight score of 52-3 to prevent a heavy loss, with a victory target of 382 surely entirely academic. South Africa's pace attack exposed some familiar weaknesses but also highlighted that the Centurion pitch is very difficult, especially with the new ball. There was pressure on; the light was not great; England couldn't win the game; they were batting to save the game - all the usual issues. You might think that England should have fared a bit better but the new ball is difficult. It's very awkward as a batsman when the ball lands in the same place on separate occasions and does completely different things. Captain Alastair Cook got one that rolled along the ground and another that nearly took out his armpit, and when you've got about half a second to react and in your mind you're wondering what the pitch is going to do, that creates uncertainty. Top batsmen have to deal with these situations but it is so much easier said than done. Alex Hales got one that kept a bit low but it was another failure. He has had four games and scored 136 runs. My view has not changed: any opening bowler would reckon Hales gives you more chance than he should as an opening batsman. It's possible they will continue with him. They dropped Adam Lyth after seven matches, and they are running out of options as to who to turn to with eight opening batsmen tried since Andrew Strauss retired in 2012. They could put Nick Compton up there but he has hardly set the world on fire, either opening or at number three, and he played a loose shot to be the third England wicket to fall inside the opening 10 overs. They are going to have to think hard about it, but they have got to sort the opening position out. In the early summer conditions when England play three Tests against Sri Lanka, Hales might well score some runs and it might just be that one score that gets his Test career under way. But he just has these technical issues that have been talked about time and again. He has got one score of 60 but the other innings he hasn't got going and it will be the manner of the dismissals that will disappoint him. But pressure makes you do funny things and Hales, Compton and James Taylor all know their places are under the microscope. Discarded players such as Gary Ballance and Ian Bell will be thinking that if they start the domestic season well they could force their way back into the team. All of these players will feature in county cricket and will have a few games early-season. They will have to get out there and battle to earn selection. It is no bad thing in a way; you want competition for places and you want it to be tough but I don't think any of them will be sleeping particularly easily before the selection for the first Test match against the Sri Lankans at Headingley on 19 May. I would be surprised if they went back to Bell, though. It seems as though they have moved on after he was part of the 2-0 defeat against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates late last year. Ballance has made four hundreds and six fifties in his 15 Tests and I think they want to get him back in the side again, but he has got to earn it. Having lost the series, South Africa are ironically now enjoying some players in excellent form, so they have a great deal of hope for the future. Hashim Amla played beautifully again. It was a very brave innings after being hit a few times on the thumb and it was a shame he didn't get his second hundred in the match And the diminutive Temba Bavuma, who made that wonderful hundred in Cape Town, continues to impress everybody. He's got an excellent attitude, he moves his feet really well, technically he looks good and he has been a revelation, as has the young fast bowler Kagiso Rabada. He took two more wickets to tear through the England top order in that short session before the close. They both came with promise but have really shown they can have really successful Test careers. It's a big day for Rabada, who wants one more wicket to become the youngest South African to take 10 in a Test match. I wondered how he would run in having bowled 29 overs, getting his seven wickets in the first innings haul of 7-112, but he certainly seemed to be moving OK. He will do that I am am sure, and he and Morne Morkel will be quite a handful. Clearly South Africa will be very strong favourites to wrap it up on the final day. I was a bit surprised how long they batted on. I thought they would have got to a 270 lead and really push on and play more shots. Had they declared earlier they could have had England batting before the storm arrived and tested them in some very dark conditions. AB de Villiers is a new captain and it is always difficult setting up declarations, but the general view is they could gave declared an hour earlier. However, they've got lots of time left and they have the second new ball, which is perfectly timed after 60 overs on Tuesday to wrap it up if they haven't already done so. Jonathan Agnew was talking to BBC Sport's Jamie Lillywhite.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: Whose opera, The Voyevoda, contained a piece that had been promised to the Russian Music Society? ? In 1867, Rubinstein handed over the directorship of the Conservatory to Zaremba. Later that year he resigned his conductorship of the Russian Music Society orchestra, to be replaced by Balakirev. Tchaikovsky had already promised his Characteristic Dances (then called Dances of the Hay Maidens) from his opera The Voyevoda to the society. In submitting the manuscript (and perhaps mindful of Cui's review of the cantata), Tchaikovsky included a note to Balakirev that ended with a request for a word of encouragement should the Dances not be performed.At this point The Five as a unit was dispersing. Mussorgsky and Rimsky-Korsakov wanted to remove themselves from Balakirev's influence, which they now found stifling, and go in their individual directions as composers. Balakirev might have sensed a potential new disciple in Tchaikovsky. He explained in his reply from Saint Petersburg that while he preferred to give his opinions in person and at length to press his points home, he was couching his reply \\"with complete frankness\\", adding, with a deft touch of flattery, that he felt that Tchaikovsky was \\"a fully fledged artist\\" and that he looked forward to discussing the piece with him on an upcoming trip to Moscow.These letters set the tone for Tchaikovsky's relationship with Balakirev over the next two years. At the end of this period, in 1869, Tchaikovsky was a 28-year-old professor at the Moscow Conservatory. Having written his first symphony and an opera, he next composed a symphonic poem entitled Fatum. Initially pleased with the piece when Nikolai Rubinstein conducted it in Moscow, Tchaikovsky dedicated it to Balakirev and sent it to him to conduct in Saint Petersburg. Fatum received only a lukewarm reception there. Balakirev wrote a detailed letter to Tchaikovsky in which he explained what he felt were defects in Fatum but also gave some encouragement. He added that he considered the dedication of the music to him as \\"precious to me as a sign of your sympathy towards me—and I feel a great weakness for you\\"....

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the perturbation hypothesis The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in sediment formation occurs, potentially leading to more matter to be compressed and heated. Step 2: Evaluate the potential effect of increased sediment formation on the compression and heating of matter If the sediment formation increases in the sea, it can lead to a thicker layer of sediment formed above the dead organisms' matter on the sea floor. Step 3: Consider the potential impact on the compression and heating of the matter With more sediment accumulating, the pressure applied to the dead organisms' matter on the sea floor will increase. This increase in pressure, coupled with the heat from Earth's interior that gets trapped by the overlying sediment, could result in the matter becoming compressed and heated more quickly. Step 4: Assess the potential effect on the overall process of crude oil formation An increase in sediment formation could potentially accelerate the process of crude oil formation by increasing the pressure and heat applied to the dead organisms' matter. However, this acceleration would depend on various factors, such as the rate of sediment accumulation, the composition of the sediment, and other geological and environmental factors. Conclusion: The perturbation hypothesis suggests that an increase in sediment formation could directly affect the process of crude oil formation by potentially leading to faster compression and heating of the dead organisms' matter.

For the theatre adaptation, see Shakespeare in Love (play). Shakespeare in Love is a 1998 American romantic period comedy-drama film directed by John Madden, written by Marc Norman and playwright Tom Stoppard. The film depicts an imaginary love affair involving Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) and playwright William Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) while he was writing Romeo and Juliet. Several characters are based on historical figures, and many of the characters, lines, and plot devices allude to Shakespeare's plays. The original idea for Shakespeare in Love came to screenwriter Marc Norman in the late 1980s after a rudimentary pitch from his son Zachary. Norman wrote a draft screenplay which he presented to director Edward Zwick, which attracted Julia Roberts, who agreed to play Viola. However, Zwick disliked Norman's screenplay and hired the playwright Tom Stoppard to improve it (Stoppard's first major success had been with the Shakespeare-themed play Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead). The film went into production in 1991 at Universal, with Zwick as director, but although sets and costumes were in construction, Shakespeare had not yet been cast, because Roberts insisted that only Daniel Day-Lewis could play the role. Day-Lewis was uninterested, and when Roberts failed to persuade him, she withdrew from the film, six weeks before shooting was due to begin. The production went into turnaround, and Zwick was unable to persuade other studios to take up the screenplay. Eventually, Zwick got Miramax interested in the screenplay, but Miramax chose John Madden as director. Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein acted as producer, and persuaded Ben Affleck to take a small role as Ned Alleyn. The film was considerably reworked after the first test screenings. The scene with Shakespeare and Viola in the punt was re-shot, to make it more emotional, and some lines were re-recorded to clarify the reasons why Viola had to marry Wessex. The ending was re-shot several times, until Stoppard eventually came up with the idea of Viola suggesting to Shakespeare that their parting could inspire his next play. Among the locations used in the production were Hatfield House, Hertfordshire (for the fireworks scene), Broughton Castle, Oxfordshire (which played the role of the de Lesseps home), the beach at Holkham in Norfolk, the chapel at Eton College, Berkshire, and the Great Hall of Middle Temple, London.

Questioned Tuesday about Trump's comments, Ryan said \\"I regret those comments he made.

In a New York Times interview, Graham, also a former presidential candidate, said Trump's remarks were \\"the most un-American thing from a politician since Joe McCarthy,\\" referring to the ultra-conservative senator of the 1950s who fueled fears of widespread communist subversion in the United States. Graham also suggested that Republicans who have endorsed Trump reconsider their choice. \\"If anybody was looking for an off-ramp, this is probably it,\\" he said. The backlash appears to be mounting against the candidate, who has repeatedly said he believes U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case charging Trump with fraud.

News article: Even an adorable Yeti was no match for the comedic team of Tiffany Haddish and Kevin Hart. Universal’s comedy “Night School” topped the domestic box office with 28 million from 3,010 locations. Fellow newcomer “ ,” Warner Bros.’ animated family film, came in close behind with 23 million when it launched in 4,100 venues. The two movies both launched on par with initial projections from industry analysts, helping drive the second-best September of all time in North America, according to comScore. The biggest September still belongs to 2017, bolstered by the massive showing of Warner Bros.’ “It.” “Night School,” which cost 29 million to produce, marks the biggest debut of the year for a broad comedy. The PG-13 film reunites Haddish with “Girls Trip” director Malcolm D. Lee and producer Will Packer. “Night School,” however, didn’t garner the same critical praise as “Girls Trip.” It generated a low 31% average on Rotten Tomatoes, whereas “Girls Trip” boasts a 90% certified fresh rating. With “Night School,” Universal now holds the three biggest original comedic openings of the past two years, along with “Blockers” and “Girls Trip.” The studio’s head of domestic distribution, Jim Orr, attributes the success to the team both in front of and behind the camera. Related ‘First Man’ Tops Studios’ TV Ad Spending Kevin Hart on 'Night School,' the 'Jumanji' Sequel and Why He Wants to Direct “We’re in business with the right people,” Orr said. “I couldn’t begin to give enough love to Kevin Hart, Tiffany Haddish, Malcolm Lee, and Will Packer.” “Night School” looks to be another win for Haddish, who continues to prove her big screen bankability. That’s good news for studios since the comedian has a slew of titles hitting multiplexes in the coming months. The comedic dynamo has “The Oath” with Ike Barinholtz, Tyler Perry’s “Nobody’s Fool,” and a voice role in Warner Bros.’ “The Lego Movie 2” on the horizon. “ ,” which features the ensemble voice cast of Channing Tatum, James Corden, Common, LeBron James, and Zendaya, is another movie aimed at younger audiences to resonate in recent weeks. Karey Kirkpatrick, known for his work on “James and the Giant Peach,” “Charlotte’s Web,” and “Over the Hedge,” co-wrote and directed the animated pic, which carries an 80 million budget. Jack Black and Cate Blanchett’s kid-friendly fantasy film “The House With a Clock in Its Walls” notched third place. It picked up another 12.5 million in its second outing, bringing its North American tally to 44.7 million. Lionsgate’s “A Simple Favor,” starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, scared up 6.5 million in its third frame to nab the No. 4 slot. The neo-noir drama has earned 42.9 million to date. Rounding out the top five is Warner Bros.’ “The Nun,” which summoned another 5.4 million for a domestic total of 109 million. “The Nun” is officially the highest-grossing installment in the “Conjuring” franchise. “There’s just an angle of it that really delivers to horror fans,” Warner Bros.’ head of domestic distribution Jeff Goldstein said. “In the ‘Conjuring’ universe, there’s so much street cred among the fanbase.” The weekend’s other wide release is Lionsgate and CBS Films’ “Hell Fest.” The low-budget horror movie launched with 5 million from 2,297 theaters. “Paranormal Activity: The Ghost Dimension” director Gregory Plotkin, who also worked on “Happy Death Day,” handled filmmaking duties. A slew of indie titles opened at the speciality box office. National Geographic’s “Free Solo,” a documentary about the first free solo rock climb of Yosemite’s El Capitan, earned the best screen average of the year. It launched with 300,804 in four theaters, translating to 75,201 per location. Fox Searchlight’s “The Old Man and the Gun” pocketed 150,000 when it opened in five theaters. Robert Redford stars alongside Casey Affleck in the larcenous comedy based on a New Yorker article about an octogenarian bank robber. Meanwhile Neon’s “Monsters and Men,” with John David Washington and “Hamilton” alum Anthony Ramos, bowed with 130,979 when it played on 18 screens. ||||| New animated pic 'Smallfoot' opens to a solid 23 million, while National Geographic's doc 'Free Solo' soars to record-breaking numbers at the specialty box office ahead of Robert Redford's 'Old Man & the Gun.' Kevin Hart and Tiffany Haddish's raucous comedy Night School laughed its way to the top of the box-office chart, beating the overall comedy curse in opening to 28 million from 3,010 theaters. The film reunites director Malcolm D. Lee, producer Will Packer and Universal, the winning trio behind the 2017 box-office hit Girls Trip, which debuted to 31 million in summer 2017. Thanks to an ethnically diverse audience, Night School scored the best debut for a broad comedy since Girls Trip. Another exception to the comedy slump is Crazy Rich Asians, Jon M. Chu's rom-com that opened to 26.5 million in August on its way to earning nearly 220 million globally. Heading into the weekend, some tracking services suggested Night School — cementing Haddish's star status after her breakout role in Girls Trip — could clear 31 million in its domestic launch. One hitch may have been generally weak reviews; Night School bears a 31 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, compared to 90 percent for Girls Trip. Lee's latest comedy, which earned a far better A- CinemaScore from audiences, follows a group of misfits who are forced to attend night school in order to pass their GED exams (Haddish plays their teacher). Rob Riggle, Taran Killam, Romany Malco and Keith David round out the cast. In addition to starring, Hart is among the producers. Caucasians made up 37 percent of ticket buyers, followed by African-Americans (30 percent), Hispanics (24 percent), Asian (5 percent) and other (4 percent), according to Universal. Overseas, Night School launched to 5.5 million from its first 19 markets for 33.5 million globally. “Working with some of the funniest comedic talent in the business today with Kevin and Tiffany, pairing them with two filmmakers at the top of their game in Malcolm and Will, and you have a movie that checks all of the boxes for which audiences clearly turned out,\\" says Universal domestic distribution chief Jim Orr. Thanks to solid family turnout, Warner Bros.' new animated offering Smallfoot opened in second place with 23 million from 4,131 theaters. The movie, whose voice cast includes Channing Tatum and LeBron James, likewise earned an A- CinemaScore. Nearly half the audience was under the age of 25. Co-written and directed by Karey Kirkpatrick, Smallfoot follows a group of Yeti who encounter a human (neither can believe the other is real). James Corden, Zendaya, Common, Gina Rodriguez, Danny DeVito and Yara Shahidi also lend their voices. Internationally, Smallfoot took in 14 million from 49 markets for a total bow of 37 million. Smallfoot no doubt took a bite out of Amblin and Universal's family offering, The House With a Clock in Its Walls, which declined 53 percent in its sophomore outing to 12.5 million. Still, House is no slouch, finishing Sunday with a domestic total of 44.8 million and 65.8 million worldwide. In its third weekend, Paul Feig and Lionsgate's sleeper hit A Simple Favor, starring Anna Kendrick and Blake Lively, followed at No. 4 domestically with 6.6 million. The black comedy's North American tally stands at 43.1 million through Sunday, and 62.9 million globally. New Line's horror pic The Nun remained a force to be reckoned in its fourth weekend, rounding out the top five with 5.4 million for a domestic cume of 109 million. The pic also topped a quiet weekend overseas with 16.2 million from 80 markets for a foreign sum of 221 million and 330 million worldwide, the best showing of any film in the Conjuring universe. CBS Films and Gregory Plotkin's modestly budgeted slasher film Hell Fest, distributed by Lionsgate, opened in sixth place with 5.1 million from 2,297 theaters, on par with expectations. The pic stars Amy Forsyth, Bex Taylor-Klaus, Reign Edwards and Tony Todd and centers on a group of teens who are pursued by a killer at a horror-themed amusement park on Halloween. Audiences gave the film a C CinemaScore, not unusual for the genre. The fourth new movie opening nationwide, albeit in far fewer locations, was Little Women, the seventh big-screen adaptation of the iconic novel about the March sisters. The indie pic, from distributor Pinnacle Peak and playing in 643 cinemas, tanked with roughly 747,000. Sarah Davenport, Allie Jennings, Lucas Grabeel, Ian Bohen and Lea Thompson star. With awards season getting underway, a flurry of films opened at the specialty box office, including National Geographic's critically acclaimed documentary Free Solo, which scored the best screen average of the year to date, 75,201. If estimates hold, it will boast the best opening average ever for a documentary, topping 2006's An Inconvenient Truth (70,333). Free Solo, launching in four theaters and fueled by a 100 percent Rotten Tomatoes score, follows professional climber Alex Honnold's quest to free-climb Yosemite's El Capitan and is the latest title to participate in the doc boom at the box office. \\"In a year when audiences are recognizing the power of seeing docs on the big screen, it's so gratifying to see Free Solo embraced as the thrilling theatrical experience it is,\\" says National Geographic Global Networks CEO Courtney Monroe. One exception to the doc upswing is Michael Moore's Fahrenheit 11/9, which bowed nationwide last weekend to just 3 million. In its second weekend, Fahrenheit 11/9 tumbled 63 percent to 1.1 million from 1,719 theaters for a domestic total of 5.2 million. Moore's latest film is one of the few docs to ever open wide, a risky move that isn't paying off. Opting to launch nationwide was even more problematic for Dan Fogleman's Life Itself, which plummeted more than 65 percent in its second outing to 770,085 for a 10-day domestic total of 3.8 million, and Assassination Nation, which declined more than 80 percent in its second weekend to 202,827 for a total of 1.7 million. The two films, along with Fahrenheit 11/9, all made stops on the recent fall festival circuit. Elsewhere at the specialty box office, Fox Searchlight's The Old Man & the Gun, the last film Robert Redford says he will star in, posted a respectable screen average of 30,000 as it debuted in five locations. The crime drama, directed by David Lowery and co-starring Sissy Spacek and Casey Affleck, tells the gritty tale of compulsive real-life bank robber Forrest Tucker, who escaped from prison 16 times over the course of a long career that ended when he was in his late 70s. Danny Glover, Tika Sumpter, Isiah Whitlock Jr., John David Washington, Tom Waits and Elisabeth Moss co-star. \\"We opened in a group of theaters that are supported by different demos, so it is very encouraging to see audiences in both the Landmark in West L.A. as well as the Regal Union Square [in Manhattan] coming to see the film,\\" says Searchlight's Frank Rodriguez. Washington pulled double duty this weekend, between Old Man & the Gun and Neon's Monsters and Men, helmed by first-time feature director Reinaldo Marcus Green. The police shooting drama, launching in 18 locations, posted a screen average of 7,277. (MoviePass recently announced it has taken a financial stake in the film.)

The Constitution provided for a \\"Kampuchean People's Representative Assembly\\" to be elected by secret ballot in direct general elections and a State Praesidium to be selected and appointed every five years by the KPRA. The KPRA met only once, a three-day session in April 1976. The members of the KPRA, however, were never elected; the Central Committee of the CPK appointed the chairman and other high officials both to it and to the State Praesidium. Plans for elections of members were discussed, but the 250 members of the KPRA were in fact appointed by the upper echelon of CPK. Democratic Kampuchea was an atheist state, but Buddhist influences still persisted. All religions were banned, and the repression of adherents of Islam, Christianity, and Buddhism was extensive. Nearly 25,000 Buddhist monks were massacred by the regime. In actual fact, all power belonged to the Standing Committee of CPK, the membership of which comprised the Secretary and Prime Minister Pol Pot, his Deputy Secretary Nuon Chea and seven others. It was known also as the \\"Centre\\", the \\"Organisation,\\" or \\"Angkar\\" and its daily work was conducted from Office 870 in Phnom Penh. For almost two years after the takeover, the Khmer Rouge continued to refer to itself as simply \\"Angkar.\\" It was only in a March 1977 speech that Pol Pot revealed the CPK's existence.

The sentence mentions that Kamtchatka declares war on Yakutsk and provides information about Yakutsk's better-equipped and larger army. This context helps us to understand the power dynamics between the two subjects. Step 3: Determine the antecedent of 'they'. The pronoun \\"they\\" is used to indicate a group. In this context, \\"they\\" refers to one of the two parties engaged in the conflict, either Kamtchatka or Yakutsk. Based on the sentence structure, it talks about Yakutsk's army size and equipment comparing to Kamtchatka's. Then, within the same sentence, it provides the outcome of the conflict - which is \\"they were defeated within weeks.\\" Step 4: Analyze the situation and identify the most likely antecedent. Since Yakutsk has a much better-equipped and larger army, it would be more logical to assume that the pronoun \\"they\\" refers to the weaker side - who is \\"Kamtchatka.\\" Though the sentence construction is a bit counterintuitive given the immediate antecedent is Yakutsk, the context implies that it's Kamtchatka who were defeated due to their weaker army. Conclusion: \\"Yakutsk\\" and \\"they\\" do not point to the same thing in the sentence. \\"They\\" in the sentence is more likely referring to \\"Kamtchatka\\" since they were the weaker side based on the context and they were the ones to be defeated."},{"prompt":"Q:Would Aaron Barrett or Axl Rose be better known for working with Guns N' Roses and AC/DC?

Paul Ciancia, 23, was shot in the leg and took a bullet in the mouth that split his tongue and knocked out his teeth, reports the New York Daily News. Officials say he is listed in fair condition and will require surgery and extensive physical therapy. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic has been charged with first-degree murder in the death of TSA agent Gerardo Hernandez and could face the death penalty. Four others, including two TSA agents, were injured. A note made it clear Ciancia hated TSA agents, but his background doesn't provide many clues to his motive. At the Catholic boys' school he attended in Delaware, near his family's home in southern New Jersey, he is remembered as a quiet loner. He was mostly silent in class apart from the occasional sarcastic comment, but \\"I've seen him smile and laugh before,\\" a classmate tells the Philadelphia Inquirer. Ciancia and his younger brother, Taylor, were both badly affected by the death of their mother in 2009, a classmate of Taylor Ciancia's says, describing the pair as awkward. \\"They had some depression issues, and they both got obsessive,\\" she says. CIancia had lived in LA for about a year before the shooting, acquiring at least three weapons, but seemed normal when a former roommate met him for lunch just a week before the shooting. \\"He would always talk about documentaries he would watch about whatever, but there was never any kind of hatred, or any hatred group, or anything like that,\\" the roommate tells ABC 7. \\"He said he was going back to New Jersey, going to work for his dad, making amends with family problems, and spending the holidays with his family. That's all I know.\\" The FBI says it has found no evidence he associated with radical groups and he told police at the scene that he acted alone. At LAX, meanwhile, 100-foot pylons leading to the airport have been lit up in memory of Hernandez, the first TSA agent to be killed in the line of duty, the New York Times reports. The father of two, who would have turned 40 next week, had worked for the TSA since 2010 and \\"was always excited to go to work,\\" his widow says. \\"He was a joyful person who took pride in his duty for the American public.\\" Expand this summary.","completion":"On Friday, at Los Angeles International Airport, a shooting rampage left one TSA agent dead and four others injured. The alleged shooter, 23-year-old Paul Ciancia, sustained injuries to his leg and mouth, and as a result, is still unable to provide any information to the investigators. Ciancia's injuries include a gunshot wound to his leg, a bullet in his mouth that split his tongue, and knocked out teeth, and he is reportedly listed in fair condition. Paul Ciancia will likely need surgery and extensive physical therapy as part of his recovery process. The unemployed motorcycle mechanic has been charged with first-degree murder concerning the death of TSA agent Gerardo Hernandez and may face the death penalty if convicted. The investigation into Ciancia's background has not yet provided a clear motive for his actions, but a note found on his person detailed a strong hatred for TSA agents. Those who knew Ciancia at the Catholic boys' school he attended in Delaware, near his family's home in southern New Jersey, described him as a quiet loner. Known for his silence in class apart from the occasional sarcastic comment, Ciancia had shown signs of laughter and smiling in the past, according to a former classmate. It is reported that both Paul Ciancia and his younger brother, Taylor, were severely affected by the loss of their mother in 2009. A classmate of Taylor Ciancia described the brothers as awkward and mentioned that they suffered from depression and obsessive tendencies. Paul Ciancia had been living in Los Angeles for about a year before the shooting and had acquired at least three weapons during this time. However, a former roommate who met with Ciancia for lunch one week before the shooting incident stated that he appeared normal and displayed no signs of hatred or association with any radical groups. The FBI's investigation has so far not found any evidence connecting Ciancia with any radical groups, and he informed police at the scene that he acted alone during his attack. In honor of the slain TSA agent, Gerardo Hernandez, Los Angeles International Airport's 100-foot pylons have been lit up as a tribute. Hernandez was the first TSA agent killed in the line of duty and had worked for the TSA since 2010.

The after-action review had treated the CIA as the lead agency for any offensive against al Qaeda, and the principals, at their March 10 meeting, had endorsed strengthening the CIA's capability for that role. To the CTC, that meant proceeding with \\"The Plan,\\" which it had put forward half a year earlier-hiring and training more case officers and building up the capabilities of foreign security services that provided intelligence via liaison. On occasion, as in Jordan in December 1999, these liaison services took direct action against al Qaeda cells. In the CTC and higher up, the CIA's managers believed that they desperately needed funds just to continue their current counterterrorism effort, for they reckoned that the millennium alert had already used up all of the Center's funds for the current fiscal year; the Bin Laden unit had spent 140 percent of its allocation. Tenet told us he met with Berger to discuss funding for counterterrorism just two days after the principals' meeting. While Clarke strongly favored giving the CIA more money for counterterrorism, he differed sharply with the CIA's managers about where it should come from. They insisted that the CIA had been shortchanged ever since the end of the Cold War. Their ability to perform any mission, counterterrorism included, they argued, depended on preserving what they had, restoring what they had lost since the beginning of the 1990s, and building from there-with across-the-board recruitment and training of new case officers, and the reopening of closed stations. To finance the counterterrorism effort, Tenet had gone to congressional leaders after the 1998 embassy bombings and persuaded them to give the CIA a special supplemental appropriation. Now, in the aftermath of the millennium alert, Tenet wanted a boost in overall funds for the CIA and another supplemental appropriation specifically for counterterrorism. To Clarke, this seemed evidence that the CIA's leadership did not give sufficient priority to the battle against Bin Laden and al Qaeda. He told us that James Pavitt, the head of the CIA's Directorate of Operations, \\"said if there's going to be money spent on going after Bin Laden, it should be given to him. My view was that he had had a lot of money to do it and a long time to do it, and I didn't want to put more good money after bad.\\" The CIA had a very different attitude: Pavitt told us that while the CIA's Bin Laden unit did\\"extraordinary and commendable work,\\" his chief of station in London \\"was just as much part of the al Qaeda struggle as an officer sitting in [the Bin Laden unit].\\" The dispute had large managerial implications, for Clarke had found Ailies in the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).

Lauren Hughes, pictured, died three days after being admitted to hospital with an asthma attack. Nurses who didn’t know how to give the kiss of life went into a panic when a child was admitted to hospital with a severe asthma attack. Her family described scenes of hysteria as staff who were meant to be helping their daughter desperately tried to call senior medics to ask them what to do. Three days later, 15-year-old Lauren Hughes died having suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen. The appalling case was revealed by her parents today in a damning report by the Patients Association into failings in NHS care. Pat and Dolly Hughes said one nurse became so distraught at the Ross-on-Wye community hospital she had to be calmed down by a colleague. They said they couldn’t understand how a healthy teenager was able to die of an asthma attack while in hospital. The hospital trust later admitted the nurses at its minor injuries unit weren’t trained in cardio-pulmonary resuscitation and should have dialled 999. Lauren had been taken to the unit by her mother when she started to suffer an asthma attack. Initially they couldn’t even get into the hospital as the door had been locked for the evening. Lauren – who was in obvious distress – was also ignored by two paramedics walking out of the hospital who did not stop to help or even let her in. She was eventually transferred to University Hospital North Staffordshire but died three days after the initial attack in May. Dr Peter Wilson, Medical Director at Wye Valley NHS Trust, which runs the community hospital said the trust has carried out a ‘full review’ of the unit where Lauren was treated. Staff have also admitted that nurses are not trained to do CPR as it is ‘above and beyond what is expected of them’. Untrained: Nurses at the Ross-on-Wye Community Hospital didn't know how to carry out the kiss of life. Today’s report on NHS care also found cases of patients being treated ‘worse than animals’ and ridiculed by ‘rude’ nurses. Relatives also say doctors are ignoring their pleas to promise to resuscitate loved ones should they stop breathing. Some families spoke of a lack of compassion among staff who didn’t care if patients ‘lived or died’. In one case, the daughter of a 94-year-old man who was being neglected by nurses told them ‘you wouldn’t treat an animal like that’. Sandra Lamb also revealed how a doctor refused to sign a form agreeing to resuscitate her father should he stop breathing. In another example, an elderly man with dementia was allowed to wander out of hospital and drowned in a river. The family of Ronald Bowman, who was being treated at the Panteg Hospital, Pontypool, South Wales, think he was trying to get home to his wife. Katherine Murphy, chief executive of the Patients Association said: ‘The sad conclusion of this report is that still far too many patients are being shockingly let down by the NHS every day. ‘These appalling and tragic cases serve to highlight the devastating consequences when poor practice is left unchallenged and unchanged. Behind each one are many more unheard voices. ‘Whilst there is a lot to be proud of about the NHS, including the overwhelming majority of staff who are skilled and hard-working, these cases are a tragic wake-up call for those in Westminster as well as on hospital wards.’ Over the past few years a number of reports have drawn attention to examples of poor hospital care, particularly involving the elderly. The Government, along with various NHS organisations, has repeatedly promised to drive up standards and change the culture of the health service. But the Patients Association said that little had changed. It has been producing annual reports of poor care since 2009. Mike Farrah, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health service staff, described the stories in the report as ‘shocking and deeply distressing’. Alzheimer's patient Ronald Bowman, who went missing from a 'dementia friendly' ward, drowned in a river near the hospital. An Alzheimer’s patient who went missing from a 'dementia friendly' ward drowned in a river near the hospital, his son said. Nick Bowman has accused Panteg County Hospital staff of not appropriately caring for his father Ronald, from Langstone in Newport, who died earlier this year. He said that his family had been assured by healthcare professionals that his 74-year-old father was being well looked after. But after escaping the ward, which is especially designed for patients with dementia, Mr Bowman drowned in a river near to the hospital. The family believe that Mr Bowman was trying to cross the river so he could get home to his wife. Mr Bowman was admitted to the Royal Gwent Hospital suffering with meningitis. He was later transferred to the Hafen Deg ward at Panteg County Hospital in Pontypool, South Wales. His family were told that he would be checked on by ward staff every 15 minutes. But Mr Bowman managed to escape from the ward twice, being found once in the hospital car park and in the reception. Mr Bowman went missing for a third and final time in June this year. Police found his shoes at the bank of a river near to the hospital. Three weeks later Mr Bowman’s body was found four miles downstream from the hospital. His son said: 'We believed that as he had left the ward twice before, that the medical staff would be especially diligent when keeping an eye on my father. This was not the case. 'My family and I are incredibly hurt and distressed that after my father was admitted to hospital with meningitis, and seemingly making a recovery, he was left without any of the basic care that he deserved and he needed.' King George's Hospital, in Ilford, Essex. Joan Girdiefski is afraid to be admitted to her local hospital following the treatment of her sister Margaret Allen. She had been admitted to King George’s Hospital, in Ilford, Essex, and was suffering from advanced breast cancer. Mrs Girdiefski told the Patients Association that when her other sister phoned the ward to ask after Margaret, she was told by a nurse: ‘She is screaming away nicely.’ She said: ‘I would rather die on my own settee than be admitted into the local hospital, because I would hate to depend on people that wouldn’t care if I either lived or died.’ Sandra Lamb accused a doctor at Birmingham’s Queen Elizabeth Hospital of acting like God when he refused to promise to resuscitate her father Edward. Mrs Lamb said on one evening she had tried to summon a nurse to help the 94-year-old but there was no one on the ward. She then noticed 18 other patients had pressed their ‘assistance lights’. When a consultant refused to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father, she told him: ‘You are not God. I brought my father here to make him well, not to kill him.’ Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham. Sandra Lamb accused a doctor of acting like God when he refused to promise to resuscitate her 94-year-old father Edward. The elderly man had been admitted to Queen Elizabeth Hospital, Birmingham with bowel problems. Mrs Lamb said that on one evening she had tried to summon a nurse to help her father go to the toilet but there was no-one on the ward. She then noticed that ‘assistance lights’ had been pressed on the beds of 18 other patients on the wards who had not yet been attended by nurses. And when she tried to get the consultant to sign a form promising to resuscitate her father should the need arise he refused. She said: ‘I asked him why he would not resuscitate if necessary and the reason he gave was that he would not be willing to put his signature to.’ Mr Lamb died last September.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the meaning of the word that the Ancient Romans name for Gibraltar was derived from? During ancient times, Gibraltar was regarded by the peoples of the Mediterranean as a place of religious and symbolic importance. The Phoenicians were present for several centuries, apparently using Gorham's Cave as a shrine to the genius loci of the place, as did the Carthaginians and Romans after them. Excavations in the cave have shown that pottery, jewellery and Egyptian scarabs were left as offerings to the gods, probably in the hope of securing safe passage through the dangerous waters of the Strait of Gibraltar.The Rock was revered by the Greeks and Romans as one of the two Pillars of Hercules, created by the demigod during his tenth labour when he smashed through a mountain separating the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. According to a Phocaean Greek traveller who visited in the sixth century BC, there were temples and altars to Hercules on the Rock where passing travellers made sacrifices. The Spanish later symbolised the importance of the Pillars of Hercules with a heraldic device consisting of a pair of columns with a scroll wrapped around them – a symbol that became the sign and the related Portuguese cifrão ().To the Ancient Romans, Gibraltar was known as Mons Calpe, a name perhaps derived from the Phoenician word kalph, \\"hollowed out\\", presumably in reference to the many limestone caves in the Rock. It was well-known to ancient geographers, but there is no known archaeological evidence of permanent settlements from the ancient period. According to the Roman writer Avienus, the ancient Greek traveller Euctemon recorded that thirty stadia separate [the Pillars of Hercules]; [Euctemon] says that they bristle with woods all over and are always unwelcoming to seamen. Indeed he says that on those are both temples and altars to Hercules. He says that strangers sail there by boat to make offerings to the gods and depart hot foot thinking it wrong to linger ...

Please write a short summary for the following article: National Express reveals second takeover approach as FirstGroup drops bid By Louise Armitstead and Ben Harrington Published: 9:32PM BST 22 Jul 2009 In a dramatic skirmish after the markets closed on Wednesday, FirstGroup said it had decided not to make a formal offer, citing \\"uncertainties\\" surrounding its rival's UK rail franchises. An hour later National Express said it had \\"received an approach in connection with a possible offer for the group from another third party whose intentions are not yet known\\". Sources speculated that interested parties could include Stagecoach, the Scottish travel firm; SNCF, the French operator; as well as Deutsche Bahn of Germany. FirstGroup, which runs First Great Western and is also Britain's biggest bus operator, said National Express had sought a \\"put-up-or-shut-up\\" ruling by the Takeover Panel. Sir Moir Lockhead, deputy chairman and chief executive of FirstGroup, said: \\"In making a preliminary approach to the board of National Express, our intention was to enter discussions with a view to seeking a recommended merger that would create a significant British transport group, in a stronger position to compete with state-run companies across Europe. \\"We believe this combination would have offered a highly compelling proposition to both sets of shareholders.\\" On Wednesday's closing prices, a combination of the two transport companies would have created a business worth £2.14bn. The removal of FirstGroup's bid interest adds to the pressure on National Express to embark on a rights issue to relieve the burden of its £1.2bn debt pile. Analysts believe National Express, which had a market value of £400m before the approach, needs to raise about £400m from investors. Three weeks ago FirstGroup made a \\"very preliminary\\" all-share offer for National Express. Days later, National Express was rocked when the Government announced plans to nationalise the company's flagship East Coast Mainline rail franchise. The company said it would run out of money to operate the service by the end of the year. Richard Bowker, the company's chief executive, resigned at the same time. Mr Bowker won the East Coast franchise in 2007. However, by agreeing in the terms of the deal that National Express would pay £1.4bn to the Government for the right to operate the franchise for eight years, he was blamed for putting unmanageable strain on the company's finances. National Express said it had already sounded out shareholders about a possible rights issue before FirstGroup's approach. Although the response was said to be tepid at the time, banking sources believe that without the problematic franchise, National Express may need to raise only £250m, which may be more acceptable to shareholders. FirstGroup is now barred from bidding for National Express for another six months unless a rival bid emerges, the target's board agrees to a deal or if there is a \\"material change\\" in circumstances. National Express shares closed down 1 at 310¼p and FirstGroup closed up 2½ at 344¾p. Summary:","completion":"FirstGroup was interested in joining with National Express, another big company, to create a larger transport group. However, they decided not to make an offer because of some unclear things happening with National Express's train businesses. Later, National Express said that another group was thinking about making an offer to join with them, but we don't know who they are yet. Some people think it could be a company from Scotland, France, or Germany. This whole situation makes it more likely that National Express will need to find ways to deal with its large amount of debt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After she returns home, mysterious assailants enter her home through the back door, kill her house maid, kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan, the gang leader, smashes the only telephone in the attic to prevent her from contacting anyone. She has no idea who the kidnappers are or what they want. She pieces together the broken phone to randomly make a connection. She finally reaches the cell phone of Ryan who has just been dumped by his girlfriend for being too irresponsible. He takes it as a joke, but Jessica persuades him to go to the police. At the police station, Officer Mooney tells him to go to the detectives on the fourth floor. He begins to lose the signal in the stairwell, and must turn back to avoid losing the connection.Meanwhile, Ethan returns to the safehouse and asks Jessica about something she doesn't know. When Jessica tells him that she doesn't know, he tells her that he is going to get her son. Ryan, who overhears them, realizes how serious the kidnapping situation is. After Ethan leaves, she tells Ryan to get to her son's school before they do. Unfortunately, he is too late and her son, Ricky, is kidnapped and he quickly chases them by stealing a car owned by a school security officer. Because his cell phone's battery is dying, he drives to a shop for a charger. After being repeatedly redirected from counter to counter, he uses a gun from the security vehicle to hold up the store at gun-point to obtain the device.Sgt. Mooney, meanwhile, decides to check on the kidnapping claim that he received. He uses the Department of Motor Vehicles records to find the address of Jessica, but when he comes to her house, a woman meets him, telling him that she is Jessica and that everything is fine.

When FBI Special Agent Helen Brody (Moss) and her team see news bulletins looking for Yusuf, they launch an investigation, which is curtailed when they are summoned to a high school, which has been converted into a black site under military command. They are shown Yusuf's complete tape, where he threatens to detonate three nuclear bombs in separate U.S. cities if his demands are not met. A special interrogator, \\"H\\" (Samuel L. Jackson), is brought in to force Yusuf to reveal the locations of the nuclear bombs. H quickly shows his capability and cruelty by chopping off one of Yusuf's fingers with a small hatchet. Horrified, Special Agent Brody attempts to put a stop to the measures. Her superiors make it clear that the potentially disastrous consequences necessitate these extreme measures. As the plot unfolds, H escalates his methods (with Brody as the \\"good cop\\"). Brody realizes that Yusuf anticipated that he would be tortured. Yusuf then makes his demands: he would like the President of the United States to announce a cessation of support for \\"puppet governments\\" and dictatorships in Muslim countries and a withdrawal of American troops from all Muslim countries. The group immediately dismisses the possibility of his demands being met, citing the United States' declared policy of not negotiating with terrorists.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"According to historian Fernand Ouellet, \\"[...] the war has the effect of stimulating French-Canadian nationalism.\\" In this statement, Fernand Ouellet, a well-known Canadian historian, highlights the impact of war on French-Canadian nationalism. He suggests that war events and their consequences can lead to an increase in nationalistic sentiments among French Canadians. This assertion could be related to various historical events and conflicts that have shaped the French-Canadian identity over time. One such example could be World War I, where French-Canadian nationalism was considerably affected by the controversial issue of conscription in 1917 - the mandatory enlistment of citizens into the armed forces. The debate over conscription revealed a deep divide between French Canadians, who opposed it due to their ties to France and a belief in the principle of voluntary service, and English Canadians, who generally supported it due to a sense of loyalty to the British Empire. This conflict exacerbated the feelings of French-Canadian nationalism and led to a deeper understanding of the differences between the two primary cultural groups in Canada. Another instance that demonstrates the link between war and French-Canadian nationalism is World War II. Similar to WWI, conscription became a contentious issue, heightening the sense of French-Canadian nationalism. While the federal government initially committed to a voluntary enlistment system, conscription was implemented in 1944 due to a shortage of military personnel. French Canadians saw this as another attempt to force them to participate in a war they did not support, which further solidified their nationalistic feelings and disillusionment with the Canadian government. Aside from these specific events, war, in general, has a unique tendency to highlight cultural differences and test national unity. Shared experiences during conflicts can lead to increased solidarity within a group, as evident in the French-Canadian population's reaction to the conscription debates. Thus, Fernand Ouellet's statement emphasizes that war can play a crucial role in stimulating and shaping French-Canadian nationalism across different historical periods."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Take care of yourself.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Navigating Mental Health Support: A Comprehensive Guide to Helping Loved Ones and Taking Care of Yourself Introduction Mental health is a significant aspect of overall well-being and has a profound impact on daily functioning, personal relationships, and self-care. In the past few years, awareness about mental health disorders has been on the rise, with people being more open to seeking professional help and support from their friends and family. However, when it comes to helping a loved one through mental health challenges, it can become an overwhelming and daunting task. This article sheds light on essential steps like seeking medical help, finding therapy, and practicing self-care while catering to the needs of someone with mental health issues. Seek Medical Help The first step in helping a loved one facing mental health challenges is to encourage them to seek medical help. As a support person, it's crucial to recognize the signs and symptoms of mental health disorders and guide them towards professional help. Here are some ways to approach this critical step: 1. Educate yourself: Increase your understanding of mental health disorders, their symptoms, and available treatment options. This knowledge will help you identify potential issues and better communicate your concerns. 2. Have an open conversation: Share your observations and express your concerns without judgment or blame. Encourage your loved one to share their feelings and experiences. 3. Research mental healthcare professionals: Look for psychologists, psychiatrists, or therapists experienced in treating the specific mental health issue. Gather information about their qualifications, treatment approaches, and patient reviews. 4. Offer assistance in scheduling an appointment: It might be daunting for your loved one to make that first call. Offer your support, be it by helping them find a suitable professional, making the appointment, or accompanying them on the visit. Help the Person Find Therapy Therapy plays a vital role in managing mental health disorders. It helps individuals understand their condition, build coping strategies, and improve their overall quality of life. Here's how you can help your loved one find suitable therapy: 1. Understand different types of therapy: Psychotherapy comes in various forms like Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT), Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT), and more. Research the methods and identify the most suitable therapy for your loved one. 2. Search for a compatible therapist: Not all therapists are the same, and finding the right fit is critical to the success of therapy. Assist your loved one in finding a therapist that meets their specific needs, preferences, and personality. 3. Encourage consistency and commitment: Therapy requires regular sessions and active participation to derive benefits. Motivate your loved one to attend sessions consistently and engage in the therapeutic process wholeheartedly. 4. Be involved, with permission: If your loved one is comfortable, ask for their permission to communicate with their therapist. This way, you can stay informed about the progress and help your loved one adhere to the therapist's recommendations. Take Care of Yourself It's essential to recognize the emotional toll that caregiving might have on you. While supporting a loved one with mental health issues, it's crucial to practice self-care and maintain your well-being. Here are some tips for taking care of yourself: 1. Set realistic expectations: Understand that recovery from mental health disorders is a gradual process, and it's essential to be patient and supportive. 2. Establish boundaries: Clearly define and communicate your personal boundaries to avoid caregiver burnout. It's okay to acknowledge your limits and seek assistance from others. 3. Engage in self-care activities: Make time for activities that promote self-care such as exercise, meditation, pursuing hobbies, and connecting with friends and family. 4. Seek support for yourself: Don't hesitate to talk about your feelings and experiences with someone you trust. Joining a caregiver support group or seeking professional help, if necessary, can be beneficial in managing your emotional well-being. Conclusion Being a source of support for someone with mental health issues can be a challenging and rewarding experience. By following the steps in this article – seeking medical help, helping find therapy, and taking care of yourself – you can contribute significantly to the recovery and well-being of your loved one.

Les concentrations de ces quatre polluants de l'air ont diminué de 40 à 60 % en vingt ans, le monoxyde de carbone affichant la plus grande amélioration et les oxydes d'azote la plus faible. Translate to English.","completion":"The concentrations of these four air pollutants have decreased by 40 to 60% in twenty years, with carbon monoxide showing the greatest improvement and nitrogen oxides the least. In this statement, the author is discussing the reduction in concentrations of four specific air pollutants over a period of twenty years. These pollutants have experienced a decrease in their concentrations ranging from 40 to 60%, which indicates a significant improvement in air quality. Among the four pollutants mentioned, carbon monoxide has shown the greatest improvement in terms of reduction in its concentration levels. Carbon monoxide is a harmful gas produced primarily by the combustion of fossil fuels, such as in vehicles or industrial processes. The reduction in carbon monoxide levels can be attributed to various factors, including the introduction of more stringent emissions standards for vehicles and industries, increased use of cleaner technologies, and better pollution control measures. On the other hand, nitrogen oxides have exhibited the least improvement among the four pollutants. Nitrogen oxides, which include nitrogen dioxide and nitric oxide, are mainly produced by the combustion of fossil fuels, as well as some industrial activities. These gases can contribute to the formation of smog and acid rain, and can have negative impacts on human health and the environment. The lesser improvement in their concentration levels may be due to several reasons, such as the continued reliance on fossil fuel-based power generation, the growth in vehicle ownership and usage, or a relative lack of focus on reducing these specific emissions in comparison to other pollutants. In conclusion, the reduction of air pollutant concentrations over the past twenty years has led to improvements in air quality for many regions. Carbon monoxide has seen the most significant reduction, while nitrogen oxides have lagged behind. Continued efforts to reduce these four pollutants, as well as other harmful emissions, are essential in order to protect both human health and the environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Answer:","completion":"In Tanzania, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development. This is because the extensive forest cover in Tanzania includes many trees with large and complex root systems. These roots help to improve soil structure, increase the organic matter content, and enhance water retention and nutrient cycling, thereby promoting soil development. Additionally, forests in Tanzania have a high biodiversity of plants, which can lead to a diverse range of root systems that contribute to soil formation and stability.

How to polish concrete Evaluate the concrete. Use a mohs hardness pick to determine the degree of mineral hardness. Determining whether the concrete is soft, medium, or hard will allow you to fine-tune the polishing process. Options: * If the concrete is quite soft, rough, with a woody, leather-like texture, you will need to take an oil or a lime-based polishing compound and sand its surface. Determine the characteristics of the car's paint job. * Average grade stones must be at least. 14-16 psi, heavy if the stone is glass, coarse if the stone is entones or has luster, and powder if the stones are clay or a combination. * Use the tools supplied in the kit to test the hardness of the concrete against the hardness of other minerals. The softest mineral that is capable of scraping the concrete is harder than the concrete, placing the concrete's level of hardness directly below that mineral. * Pastel concrete will require a finer grit mohs or higher. For hard rock concrete, use a smoother mohs.","completion":"The most logical next event after evaluating the concrete and determining its hardness would be to select the appropriate diamond polishing pads and grit sequence based on the hardness of the concrete. 1. Choose the right diamond polishing pads: Based on your assessment of the concrete's hardness, select a set of diamond polishing pads designed for your specific concrete type (soft, medium, or hard). These pads are crucial for the polishing process and are engineered with varying levels of grit to grind and smooth the concrete surface. 2. Determine the grit sequence: Start with a lower grit pad (somewhere in the range of 30-50) to remove any roughness and imperfections from the concrete surface. The lower the grit number, the coarser the pad and the more aggressive the grinding. As you progress, gradually increase the grit (e.g., 80, 150, 300, etc.) to refine and polish the surface to your desired level of smoothness and shine. 3. Prep the concrete surface: Make sure that the concrete surface is clean and free of any debris or contaminants. Sweep or vacuum the area to remove any dust or dirt particles that may interfere with the polishing process. 4. Attach the first diamond polishing pad: Attach the initial, lower-grit diamond pad to a concrete floor grinder or polisher. Ensure that it is securely fastened and in good working condition before you begin. Remember always to wear appropriate safety gear, such as gloves, eye protection, and a dust mask. 5. Begin the polishing process: With the concrete prepped and your chosen diamond pad securely attached, start polishing. Begin by working in small sections at a time, carefully moving the grinder or polisher back and forth across the surface in a consistent pattern. Make sure to overlap your passes slightly to ensure even coverage. 6. Progress through the grit sequence: As you continue polishing, switch to progressively higher grit diamond pads according to the sequence determined earlier. This process will help you achieve a smoother and shinier surface with each pass. Remember to clean the surface and pads between grit changes, as this will help prevent unwanted scratches and maintain the pad's performance. 7. Finalize and protect the polished surface: Once you've achieved the desired level of polish, apply a concrete sealer or densifier to the surface to protect it from any stains and provide added durability. By following these steps, you will be able to effectively polish a concrete surface to your preferred level of smoothness and shine."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

We have: -305 = 30*j + 505 Now, our goal is to find the value of \\"j\\". To do that, we need to get rid of the 505 on the right side.

Summarize: The US billionaire bought the hotel and golf course for an undisclosed sum in 2014 and subsequently added his name. The golf course and most rooms in the hotel have now reopened following a Â£200m refurbishment. The presumptive Republican nominee will attend the official reopening on 24 June - one day after the EU referendum. Mr Trump said: \\"Very exciting that one of the great resorts of the world, Turnberry, will be opening today after a massive Â£200m investment. \\"I own it and I am very proud of it. \\"I look forward to attending the official opening of this great development on 24 June.\\" Mr Trump is likely to be the Republican candidate in the US presidential election in November after seeing off a host of rivals in the primaries. The outspoken billionaire has been a controversial figure during the campaign, most notably calling for a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US following the San Bernardino shootings in California. This prompted a petition advocating a ban on Mr Trump coming to the UK, which attracted hundreds of thousands of signatures. The size of the petition triggered a three-hour debate at a Westminster committee room, which ended without a vote being taken. Home Secretary Theresa May can - and does - sometimes prevent people from entering the UK because of things they have said. However, the Home Office said she does not use these powers lightly; only \\"if she considers their presence in the UK to be non-conducive to the public good\\" or if they are people who \\"seek to harm our society and who do not share our basic values\\". Mr Trump's comments on Muslims were described as \\"divisive, unhelpful and quite simply wrong\\" by Prime Minister David Cameron, who later said he stood by those remarks but would work with whoever was elected president. Mr Trump later moved to defuse any tension between the two by saying that he had been asked to visit Downing Street and expected to \\"do just fine\\" with Mr Cameron. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called Mr Trump's comments on Muslims \\"offensive\\". She said: \\"Mr Trump's views are repugnant, and they clearly do not represent the mainstream views of people across America.\\" His arrival in Scotland later this month is likely to be contentious with the fallout from Mr Trump's comments in the primaries still fresh in many people's memories. Turnberry is on the rota of courses that can stage the Open Championship and Mr Trump previously said that was a factor is his decision to purchase the resort.

Question: What is the name of the album for which the fourth and final single was \\"Passenger\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: The first single from the album was \\"The Day You Come\\", a politically and socially influenced song. The band did not intend for it to be the first single, and released it only when they could not decide on anything else. Haug said it being \\"a pretty inoffensive song musically\\" helped Powderfinger make that decision. \\"The Day You Come\\" spent nine weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #25.The second single was the double a-side, \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out/Good-Day Ray\\", released on 9 November 1998. \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\", a song about a friend of Fanning's who had difficulty in social situations, was one of the roughest Powderfinger songs to date. 'Don't Wanna Be Left Out' could be comfortably ranked with other Powderfinger songs such as 'Lighten My Load' and 'Rise Up'. Drummer Jon Coghill described it as the most difficult Powderfinger song to play live at the time, because it was so \\"fast and offbeat\\". The music video for \\"Don't Wanna Be Left Out\\" was unpopular and drew criticism from band members. \\"Good-Day Ray\\" was dedicated to Australian television presenter Ray Martin and his public disagreements with former Media Watch host Stuart Littlemore. Its lyrics verged on punk, though Coghill denied that Powderfinger were a punk band. He also described the music video for \\"Good-Day Ray\\" as being one of the better videos the band had made.Internationalist's third single was \\"Already Gone\\", released on 12 February 1999. The song was a tribute to the Beatles and their influence on Powderfinger's music. The fourth and final single from the album was \\"Passenger\\", released on 9 August 1999. \\"Passenger\\" was influenced by Elvis Presley, and included a big horn section, as well as backing vocals from folk group Tiddas. \\"Passenger\\" won the ARIA Award for \\"Song Of The Year\\" in 1999. The song's music video was one of Powderfinger's first to feature computer graphics, and was produced by Fifty Fifty Films. \\"Passenger\\" spent 11 weeks on the ARIA Charts, peaking at #30.

Movie plot: Hatari!The film opens before the credits with the members of the Momella Game Ltd. parked on the African plains scanning the landscape for rhino. Sean Mercer (John Wayne) spots one and moves out with his men to capture it. During the chase which ensues, Little Wolf, the Indian (Bruce Cabot), is gored in the leg and the rhino escapes. Kurt (Hardy Krüger), who was driving the herding jeep, blames himself for the mishap, despite what Sean says, as he feels he was herding too close. Pockets (Red Buttons), driver of the catching car, tells Sean a tourniquet isn't doing any good to stop the bleeding, and so they head into town to take the Indian to the hospital while Kurt dives back to the compound to bring Brandy (Michèle Girardon), who technically owns Momella Game Ltd., to town to meet them.The credits play while Sean and the others are driving back.Kurt arrives at the compound in the evening and tells Brandy what happened while she dresses; they depart and join the others at the hospital where they all anxiously await news of the Indians fate. When a young Frenchman with a chip on his shoulder named Charles Maurey (Gérard Blain) comes up to them and asks Sean for the Indian's job, as he was afraid if he waited someone else would get it, the party reacts with indignation and Kurt knocks him down in anger. Sean separates them, and just then Doctor Sanderson (Eduard Franz) enters to tell them about the Indian. He sadly relates to them that the Indian needs a transfusion, but his blood type AB negative is very difficult to match, and the plasma is not doing the job. The Frenchman announces that his blood type is the same as the Indian's, but he will only give it if Kurt asks him. Kurt does, and Sean tells the Frenchman to come out to the compound afterwards, and they'll see about that job. The doctor asks them all to leave the hospital as they're only in the way.The party relocates to a bar where some time and several drinks later the doctor calls to inform them the Indian will be all right and should soon be on...

The library is one of New York's most beautiful and valuable buildings. Even though it is in the busiest part of the city, it has grass and trees around it, and benches for people to sit on. Even more unusual in crowded New York, its rooms are very large. The roof of the Main Reading Room is 51 feet high. Here, a reader can sit and work in comfort. The library has over thirty million books and paintings. It owns one of the first copies of a Shakespeare's play, a Bible printed in the 15th century, and a letter written by Columbus in which he tells of finding the new world. Every New Yorker can visit the library and use its riches -- free. But the cost of running the library has risen sharply in recent years, and the library has not enough money to continue its work.

Here, both \\"Baruch\\" and \\"ben Neriah\\" are proper nouns. \\"Bаruch\\" is the direct translation of the given name \\"Baruch\\", and \\"ben Neriah\\" is typically translated as \\"бен Нерия\\", which implies \\"son of Neriah\\". The translation of these names from English to any language primarily involves transliteration which means the script is changed but the pronunciation tries to remain as close as possible to the original. However, it's important to note that spelling can vary slightly based on regional dialects and languages. Keep in mind that, as with all translations concerning names, it is often most respectful to use a person's original name whenever possible. This is particularly relevant when dealing with names from languages that utilize a different alphabet, such as Cyrillic or Hebrew, because transliterations can often fail to perfectly capture a name's original spelling, pronunciation, or both. In English-speaking countries, for example, the name \\"Baruch ben Neriah\\" is generally used in its original Hebrew form, despite transliterations into the Latin alphabet.

Test sentence: \\"Emily caused Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" Is this test sentence a correct grammatical English sentence? Available choices: (a). unacceptable. (b). acceptable.","completion":"(b). Acceptable. The sentence \\"Emily caused Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" is indeed grammatically correct in English. Let me expound on why the sentence is grammatically accurate. The structure of the sentence follows the standard English sentence structure, which is Subject-Verb-Object (SVO). Here's a breakdown: Subjeсt: The subject of the sentence is \\"Emily.\\" The subject represents what or whom the sentence is about. Its role is to perform or command the action. Verb: The verb is \\"caused.\\" It reveals the action or state being done by the subject. English sentences require at least one main verb to show the action. In this case, \\"caused\\" demonstrates Emily's action upon Benjamin. Object: The object of the sentence is the entire phrase \\"Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" This statement is affected by the action of the subject. In other words, it tells who or what is receiving the action. \\"Benjamin\\" here is the indirect object, whereas \\"to see himself in the mirror\\" is the direct object that expands on the action done onto Benjamin. The sentence also uses the reflexive pronoun \\"himself\\" correctly. Reflexive pronouns refer back to the subject of the clause. They are used when the subject and the object of a sentence refer to the same person or thing. In this case, \\"himself\\" refers back to \\"Benjamin.\\" Furthermore, the verb \\"caused\\" is appropriately employed. It is a factitive verb, or a causative verb which means causing something to happen or making something change. It's followed by an object (in this case, 'Benjamin') and a to-infinitive clause (in this case, 'to see himself in the mirror'). Thus, both grammatically and contextually, the sentence \\"Emily caused Benjamin to see himself in the mirror.\\" is correct in English."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The sentences provided state different information concerning the national affiliation of the team the person was part of.

The change between Swedish and Danish alters the team's identity and hence its meaning, so these sentences are not paraphrases.

Article:Vallop Suwandee, who chairs an advisory board to the governor of Bangkok, was quoted as saying that street vendors would be removed from all 50 districts of the city. It seemed that one of the most popular and distinctive aspects of Bangkok life was to be wiped out, days after CNN had voted Bangkok the best place in the world for street food, and just two months before the city government was planning to hold a street-food festival. Mr Vallop now says he was misquoted: \\"Let me be clear, on behalf of the city of Bangkok. Street food will continue to be part of Bangkok life, on the condition that there will not be obstructions for pedestrians, and that the vendors observe sanitary rules in the interest of public health. \\"We will allow them to be in certain areas, under strict conditions.\\" This is not the first time the Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA), which is responsible for running the city, has tried to impose order and standards on the hundreds of thousands of food vendors operating on the streets. Right after the BMA was first established in 1972 it launched a similar campaign to force the vendors to operate in designated markets instead. Variations of that campaign were revived every few years but implementation has always been weak because the BMA recognised the vital role street vending played in providing a source of income in difficult economic times. Most of the time it has quietly chosen not to push too hard. This time may be different. The number of officially approved locations for street food vendors has been cut dramatically, from a peak of 726 four years ago to 243 by the end of last year. Tens of thousands of vendors have been forced to move already, leaving many downtown areas like Siam Square, Asok and Silom with few or no street-food stalls now visible during the day and night. The most recent area to be cleared is the increasingly wealthy neighbourhood of Thonglor. A small side street, or soi, which for many years had been famous for its street food, is no more, although city officials say the vendors were offered alternative locations in smaller sois further away. The BMA is not being specific about its ultimate plans but it looks as though it aims to have street-food confined to a very few well-known city-centre areas, like the backpacker hangout of Khao San Road and Yaowarat Road, which runs through the historic Chinatown area, and to be more widely permitted in outer city neighbourhoods. With growing numbers of tourists and commuters coming into the downtown area, Mr Vallop says there is not enough space for street vendors. A vendor may occupy a space where land prices run to many thousands of dollars per square metre, he told me - why should one person have that privilege? He said the BMA had received many complaints about blocked pavements. These arguments, though, have been lost in the furore over the perceived threat to the city's much-loved street-cuisine. Chawadee Nulkair is a self-styled street food fanatic who publishes a blog, bangkokglutton.com, cataloguing her culinary discoveries. She opposes the BMA's move against the vendors, even though she acknowledges the inconvenience to pedestrians. \\"As much as we complain about the clutter and the chaos,\\" she told me, \\"this is what defines us. \\"This street food is Thai culture. Motorbikes drive on the pavements here. Even without the vendors the pavements would still be awful.\\" Chawadee took me to Yaowarat Road, sometimes described as the birthplace of street food, and still one of the best places to eat in Bangkok. She explained how the Chinese immigrants, who settled in large numbers in the 19th Century, began cooking food along the roadsides to make a living, using simple stoves and iron woks. That style of cooking, along with classic Chinese ingredients like noodles, significantly changed Thai cooking. Street food has also become an essential service for the growing numbers of commuters, who may have long journeys to and from work, and limited time and space to cook at home. We passed a number of stalls sending out mouth-watering aromas into the night air, before settling on a stall Chawadee knew would cook an excellent prawn noodle hot pot, a classic Thai-Chinese dish. The kitchen was set out on the front steps of a bank, with the chef cooking fried rice and noodle dishes at lightning speed, sheets of flame curling around his blazing wok. The stall has been run by Voracha Rujarawan and her family for three generations. She is worried by the city government's plans. Already she has to make regular payments to local officials and the police. Now they are insisting she needs proper dish-washing facilities, although it is not clear how they can do that without running water. On cue, a uniformed municipal officer arrived and started questioning her at length about how she would meet the tougher new hygiene standards. The city's argument that public demand for better pedestrian access has also been challenged by a survey carried out by the Urban Design and Development Centre, a city planning project started by the architecture faculty at Chulalongkorn University, which is actually campaigning to make walking better in Bangkok. The UDDC Director, Niramon Kulsirisombat, says the survey of more than 1,000 respondents showed that food vendors were not considered the worst problem; in fact Bangkok's typically narrow pavements are such an obstacle course of electricity poles, hydrants, disused phone boxes and road signs that pedestrians usually find themselves walking in the road even without food stalls. She said there were too few channels for Bangkok's residents to have their views heard by the city government; that it took too much of a government-knows-best, top-down approach to development. This criticism has also been applied to the BMA's controversial decision to demolish a historic community in old Bangkok to make way for a tourist park, and its ambitious plan to build a concrete walkway 10m (33ft) wide and 14km (nine miles) long, along the bank of the Chaophraya river. \\"The reasons the BMA gives for moving the street food, blocking the pavements and hygiene, are not enough. Like Singapore 50 years ago, when Lee Kwan Yew began modernising the city, they said we have to move all this street food chaos, that it is a symbol of a third world country. But actually, in Bangkok, you should see street food as a form of life support for so many people.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The Bangkok Metropolitan Authority (BMA) is working to remove street food vendors from all 50 districts of the city. Citing obstruction and public health concerns, the BMA requires vendors to observe strict sanitary rules and allow for clear pedestrian access. Thousands of vendors have already been displaced, but Ben Suebsaeng, a food vendor for over 45 years, says that street food is more than just clustered stalls, claiming they add culture and vibrancy to the city. Other critics of the BMA agree, suggesting the authority's reasons for moving the vendors is insufficient and that street food is an integral part of everyday life for many in Bangkok."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Math Problem Solve -2481*z - 78 = -2442*z for z.","completion":"To solve the equation -2481*z - 78 = -2442*z for the variable z, follow these steps: Step 1: Add 2442*z to both sides of the equation to move all the z terms to one side. This helps to isolate z. -2481*z - 78 + 2442*z = -2442*z + 2442*z Step 2: Simplify both sides of the equation. (2442-2481)*z - 78 = 0 -39*z - 78 = 0 Step 3: Add 78 to both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the other side. -39*z - 78 + 78 = 0 + 78 -39*z = 78 Step 4: To solve for z, divide both sides of the equation by -39. z = 78 / -39 Step 5: Simplify the fraction to get the value of z. z = -2 So the solution to the equation -2481*z - 78 = -2442*z is z = -2."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

With the establishment of the Royal Air Force two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at St Leonards-on-Sea where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot. During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain. He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How might one describe the sentiment of this review? oh, i forgot to mention that they HIRE people to dance on the dance floor. LOL! that's how you know it's bad. :|","completion":"One might describe the sentiment of this review as primarily negative, with aspects of sarcasm and disapproval. The reviewer seems to be expressing disappointment and even mockery towards the establishment, indicating that they believe the quality of the experience is subpar. The first clue to the negative sentiment is the use of \\"LOL\\" (Laughing Out Loud). This acronym, when used in a review, can often signal that the reviewer finds something about the experience laughable or ridiculous. In this case, they are laughing at the fact that the establishment hires people to dance on the dance floor, which the reviewer seems to think is a desperate and perhaps even pathetic attempt to create the illusion of a lively and enjoyable atmosphere. The next clue to the negative sentiment is the use of sarcasm. The phrase \\"Oh, I forgot to mention\\" suggests that the reviewer has intentionally withheld this piece of information until now to heighten the sense of surprise and disbelief. It's as though they are saying \\"You won't believe what I'm about to tell you,\\" which underscores the ridiculousness of the situation in their view. The reviewer also uses a frowny face emoticon \\":|\\" to further illustrate their disapproval and disappointment. This emoticon serves as a visual representation of the negative sentiment, reinforcing the notion that the reviewer is not pleased with their experience at this establishment. Finally, the statement \\"that's how you know it's bad\\" conveys a strong sense of negative judgment. By making this assertion, the reviewer is implying that the mere fact that the venue hires people to dance on the dance floor is a clear and indisputable indication of its overall poor quality. In summary, the sentiment of this review can be described as negative and disapproving, with elements of sarcasm and mockery. The reviewer seems to be expressing their disappointment with the establishment and its apparent need to manufacture a fun atmosphere by hiring dancers, which they view as a clear sign of the venue's inadequacy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You have a few options for the base depending on what office supplies you have lying around. You can use a highlighter, pen, marker, or pencil. The important thing to consider about the base of your capo is that it is long enough to cover the width of the fretboard. If you have a short pencil or another shorter base, test it by comparing its length to the width of the fretboard. You also have a few options with connecting the base of the capo to the guitar. The important part about the tying component is that it has enough pressure to hold the strings. You can either use a strong elastic band like a hair tie or rubber band, or you can use a piece of string. If you use an elastic band, test it to make sure it is strong enough to hold the base against the strings. Test the elastic band by stretching the band. You don’t need to stretch it too far, but make sure it doesn’t break on an initial test. Tune up your guitar before attaching the capo.

He runs over to the second boy with a smile on his face, eager to make a new friend and engage in a fun activity together. As the first boy approaches the second boy, they exchange a greeting and introduce themselves. They quickly find common ground and decide upon an enjoyable game or activity to participate in together. One possibility is that they choose to play a classic game of tag, taking turns pursuing each other across the playground and the grassy field. As the boys play, they laugh and their energy levels rise, encouraging them to explore more of the park and challenge each other in various physical activities. They might engage in a friendly race, compare their climbing abilities on nearby playground equipment, or even take turns pushing each other on the swings. During these activities, their bond grows and a friendship begins to form. The boys learn about each other's interests, hobbies, and backgrounds, discovering the qualities each appreciates in the other. They may even delve into conversations about their families, their favorite sports or pets, and their aspirations for the future. The boys continue their adventures, occasionally taking breaks to hydrate and consume snacks, fostering a sense of camaraderie as they share their food and experiences. They observe other children participating in different activities, and sometimes invite them to join their games or join in on the new friends' fun, creating a sense of community and inclusivity. As the day progresses and the sun begins to set, the boys may start to tire, opting for calmer activities that they can enjoy together such as drawing in the sand with sticks or simply laying in the grass, watching clouds and sharing stories about their lives and experiences. These bonding moments solidify the foundation of their newfound friendship. The most logical next event, then, would be for the boys to gradually finish their day of play, with a mutual agreement to meet again soon and continue their adventures. They exchange contact information or arrange a specific time and place for their next play date.

(2) The ball rolled into the corner pocket., does the word ball mean the same thing?","completion":"In the two sentences provided, the word \\"ball\\" does not mean the same thing. The meaning of the word \\"ball\\" is dependent on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence (1) \\"The ball was already emptying out before the fire alarm sounded\\", the word \\"ball\\" refers to a social gathering or a formal event where guests engage in various activities such as dancing, socializing, and enjoying a meal. The sentence implies that the attendees of this social event started to leave the location even before the fire alarm went off, perhaps due to some other issue or reason. In the second sentence (2) \\"The ball rolled into the corner pocket\\", the word \\"ball\\" refers to a round, spherical object that is used for various games and sports. In this context, the sentence is likely describing a scene from a game of pool (or billiards), where a cue ball is struck by the player, causing it to hit another ball and knock it into the corner pocket of the pool table. The meaning of \\"ball\\" here is entirely different from the meaning in the first sentence as it describes a physical object used in a game rather than a social event. In conclusion, although the word \\"ball\\" is the same in both sentences, its meaning varies significantly depending on the context in which it is used. In the first sentence, it refers to a social gathering or event, whereas in the second sentence, it refers to a spherical object used in games and sports.

In this case, the metaphor of sticking a finger in the mouth and raising it to check the wind direction is used to emphasize the idea that, in some situations, our technological advancements might not provide us with the desired degree of accuracy or predictability. It is essential to recognize that while technology has certainly improved our lives and capabilities to a great extent, there can still be situations where it might not be sufficient or effective enough to provide the answers we seek. As such, it becomes crucial for individuals and organizations to retain traditional knowledge and instincts while incorporating new technologies or methodologies. To sum it up, the translated text essentially conveys the idea that even with the advent of computer simulations and satellite technology for assistance, there are times when we might still have to rely on basic human intuition and traditional methods for certain tasks or problems.

Choices: - stomach - brain - skin - heart A: A:","completion":"Regularly done aerobic activities can help build up endurance and make the heart stronger. Aerobic exercises, also known as cardiovascular exercises, consist of physical activities that raise your heart rate and require the pumping of oxygen-rich blood to your muscles. Examples of aerobic activities include running, swimming, cycling, dancing, and brisk walking. All these activities play a significant role in maintaining and improving your physical fitness, particularly your cardiovascular health. The heart is a vital organ that is primarily responsible for pumping blood throughout your body. It supplies oxygen and essential nutrients to your cells, tissues, and organs, and removes waste products like carbon dioxide and other metabolic byproducts. By engaging in regular aerobic activities, your heart becomes stronger because it has to work harder to pump blood to the muscles during exercise. This increased workload puts a positive stress on the heart, ultimately enhancing its efficiency, strength, and endurance. Some of the key benefits of regularly done aerobic activities on your heart include: 1. Improved cardiovascular fitness: Aerobic activities improve the heart's ability to pump blood more efficiently, allowing it to deliver more oxygen-rich blood to your muscles, organs, and other body parts. 2. Lowered blood pressure: Aerobic exercise helps dilate blood vessels and improves blood circulation throughout the body, reducing the pressure in the arteries and lowering the risk of hypertension or heart disease. 3. Enhanced heart muscle strength: Regular exercise can result in a stronger and more resilient heart muscle. This, in turn, reduces the workload on the heart and lowers the risk of heart-related ailments. 4. Increased lung capacity: Since aerobic activity requires deep and faster breathing to deliver oxygen to your muscles, it helps enhance your lung capacity and improves overall respiratory function. 5. Reduced heart disease risk: Aerobic exercises effectively reduce the risk of coronary artery disease, heart failure, and other heart ailments by improving blood circulation, lowering blood pressure, and reducing the levels of LDL (bad) cholesterol in the bloodstream. 6. Weight management: Aerobic exercises help burn calories, maintain a healthy weight, and reduce the risk of obesity, which is a significant risk factor for heart diseases. 7. Mood elevation and stress reduction: Regular aerobic activity has been proven to release endorphins, improving mood and reducing stress, which can indirectly contribute to a healthier heart by reducing stress-related damage. In conclusion, regular aerobic activities play a critical role in building endurance and promoting a stronger heart. These exercises contribute to improved cardiovascular fitness, reduced risk of heart diseases, and enhanced overall quality of life."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

They included the collapse of the Middle East peace process and, in April, a crisis over a U.S.\\" spy plane\\" brought down in Chinese territory. The new administration also focused heavily on Russia, a new nuclear strategy that allowed missile defenses, Europe, Mexico, and the Persian Gulf. In the spring, reporting on terrorism surged dramatically. In chapter 8, we will explore this reporting and the ways agencies responded. These increasingly alarming reports, briefed to the President and top officials, became part of the context in which the new administration weighed its options for policy on al Qaeda. Except for a few reports that the CSG considered and apparently judged to be unreliable, none of these pointed specifically to possible al Qaeda action inside the United States-although the CSG continued to be concerned about the domestic threat. The mosaic of threat intelligence came from the Counterterrorist Center, which collected only abroad. Its reports were not supplemented by reports from the FBI. Clarke had expressed concern about an al Qaeda presence in the United States, and he worried about an attack on the White House by \\"Hizbollah, Hamas, al Qida and other terrorist organizations.\\" In May, President Bush announced that Vice President Cheney would himself lead an effort looking at preparations for managing a possible attack by weapons of mass destruction and at more general problems of national preparedness. The next few months were mainly spent organizing the effort and bringing an admiral from the Sixth Fleet back to Washington to manage it. The Vice President's task force was just getting under way when the 9/11 attack occurred.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. looking around a room of players with stacks that are twenty times the size of yours is not easy to fathom. This is all lower case. Can you fix that?","completion":"Looking around a room of players with stacks that are twenty times the size of yours is not easy to fathom. Observing a room filled with highly skilled poker players who have managed to accumulate considerable winnings can be an intimidating and humbling experience. It is essential to understand that there are several factors at play, and learning from these players might improve one's own strategy and gameplay. First, experienced poker players understand the importance of position, relative to the dealer, and make decisions based on it. Being in a late position, like the dealer, allows them to gather valuable information from the opponents' actions and adapt their own tactics accordingly. This increased information base allows for better decision-making when it comes to betting, folding, or playing aggressively. Second, successful poker players have spent countless hours honing their skills in reading opponents. They pay attention to every detail, like betting patterns, physical tells, and verbal cues. This ability to deduce an opponent's hand strength and playing style creates a significant advantage and allows for calculated risks that often result in lower loose rates. Another crucial factor that leads to the accumulation of significant stacks is bankroll management. Expert players know when to adjust their bet sizes according to the situation and their opponents. A disciplined approach to managing their resources helps them avoid making costly mistakes due to emotional reactions, impulsive decisions, or simple errors in judgment. Furthermore, skilled players have a deep understanding of poker odds and probabilities, which allows them to make mathematically sound decisions. By comprehending the likelihood of specific outcomes, they can better assess risks, know when to make a call or fold, and optimize their overall game strategy. Lastly, having a solid grasp of various poker strategies and displaying the ability to adapt to different situations is crucial in sustaining and growing a sizeable chip stack. Familiarity with both tight, aggressive play and loose, passive play allows these players to modify their approach based on their opponents and the current game dynamics. While it may be challenging to see yourself surrounded by players with significantly larger stacks, it's vital to approach the situation with a learning mindset. Assess these players' tactics, their strengths, and their weaknesses. By studying and implementing the strategies used by more accomplished players, you can begin to set yourself on a path to success in the world of poker."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're telling a story. 1. First, let's handle the numbers on the left side of the equation. We have \\"-268 - 551\\". To solve this, we're taking away 551 apples from 268 apples, which will give us \\"-819 apples\\". So now, our equation looks like this: -819 = -2515 * m + 2030 - 334 2. Now let's handle the numbers on the right side with addition and subtraction. We have \\"2030 - 334\\". Imagine you have 2030 candies, and you ate 334 of them. You are left with 1696 candies. So our equation becomes: -819 = -2515 * m + 1696 3. Next, we want to isolate \\"m\\" so that we can solve for it. To do this, we need to move \\"1696\\" to the left side. When we do this, it switches from being a positive number to a negative number. So now, our equation looks like this: -819 - 1696 = -2515 * m 4. Let's solve the left side, which now looks like \\"-819 - 1696\\". Think of it like you ate an additional 1696 candies, and you're left with \\"-2515 candies\\" total. Our equation is now: -2515 = -2515 * m 5. Finally, we want to find \\"m\\". We can do this by dividing both sides by \\"-2515\\". It's like saying you have -2515 candies and want to share them equally among your toys (each toy represents \\"-2515\\"). So, when we do this, we get: m = 1 So, the answer to the equation is m = 1."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Bradykinin receptor B is a G-protein encoded receptor for bradykinin , coupled by the BDKRB2 gene in humans .","completion":"Despite some minor differences in phrasing, these two sentences essentially convey the same meaning. Both sentences discuss the relationship between Bradykinin-Receptor B, G-protein, and the BDKRB2 gene in humans. They explain how Bradykinin-Receptor B is a G-protein encoded receptor and that it binds to bradykinin. Furthermore, they indicate that this interaction is regulated by the BDKRB2 gene. However, it is important to expand on the elements in the sentences to truly understand their similarities and meanings. 1. Bradykinin - Receptor B and Bradykinin receptor B: These phrases refer to the same protein receptor, known as the Bradykinin B receptor. This receptor belongs to the family of G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) and is involved in multiple physiological processes in the human body. 2. G-protein encoded receptor and G-protein coupled receptor: Although the first statement refers to the receptor as \\"G-protein encoded,\\" and the second one, as \\"G-protein coupled,\\" both phrases essentially describe the same feature of the receptor. The Bradykinin B receptor is a GPCR. GPCRs are membrane proteins that translate signals from outside the cell to the inside of the cell by collaborating with G-proteins. 3. Coupling to the BDKRB2 gene: Both sentences mention that the Bradykinin B receptor is linked to the BDKRB2 gene in humans. The BDKRB2 gene provides instructions for producing the Bradykinin B receptor. Consequently, the information present in this gene ensures proper signal transduction and receptor function. The primary difference between the two sentences is the wording used for the connection between the receptor and the gene - \\"coupled to\\" versus \\"coupled by.\\" Despite this slight discrepancy, the intended meanings of both statements remain effectively the same. In summary, both sentences convey the same fundamental information about the relationship between the Bradykinin B receptor, G-proteins, and the BDKRB2 gene in humans. Although there are minor differences in the choice of words, the core meaning remains the same."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Process: - Sunlight shines on plants - Cells with chlorophyll in them capture the light energy - Plants absorb carbon dioxide through their stoma - Plants absorb water through their roots and other parts of themselves - Plants absorb minerals through their roots - Plants convert these inputs into sugars - Sugars can be used as energy sources - Oxygen and water are also produced - Excess water and oxygen are released through stoma and other parts of the plant. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less sunlight shines on plants. happens, how will it affect plants convert these inputs into sugar.. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of less sunlight shining on plants does have a direct effect on the process of converting inputs into sugar. 1. When there is less sunlight, the energy available for the chlorophyll cells to capture is reduced. 2.This leads to a lower efficiency in converting light energy into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. 3. As photosynthesis is responsible for combining carbon dioxide, water, and light energy to produce glucose (sugars) and oxygen, a decrease in sunlight would directly impact the production of sugars. 4. Consequently, plants will produce less glucose, which will affect their growth, development, and overall health, as glucose is essential for energy production and other metabolic activities. 5. A decline in sugar production may also have indirect effects on other processes, such as the release of oxygen and water, as well as absorption of carbon dioxide, water, and minerals.

Joe Frazier was the 12th child born to Dolly Alston-Frazier and Rubin in Beaufort, South Carolina. He was raised in a rural community of Beaufort called Laurel Bay. Frazier said he was always close to his father, who carried him when he was a toddler \\"over the 10 acres of farmland\\" the Fraziers worked as sharecroppers \\"to the still where he made his bootleg corn liquor, and into town on Saturdays to buy the necessities that a family of 10 needed.\\" Young Frazier was affectionately called \\"Billie Boy.\\" In 1964 heavyweight representative Buster Mathis qualified but was injured so Frazier was sent as a replacement. At the Heavyweight boxing event, Frazier knocked out George Oywello of Uganda in the first round, then knocked out Athol McQueen of Australia 40 seconds into the third round. He was then into the semi-final, as the only American boxer left, facing the 6 foot 2, 214 lb.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Bruce Willis has vanquished terrorists, basement rapists and the defenses of Cybill Shepherd. But in his three decades in Hollywood he may not have faced as daunting an opponent as Apple. According to an unconfirmed report in a British publication, Willis wants to bequeath his extensive iTunes music collection to his daughters -- something that's not permitted under the current iTunes terms. The Daily Mail says the actor has spent thousands of dollars downloading music on to \\"many, many iPods\\" but, like many iTunes users, was surprised to discover that in Apple's eyes he doesn't actually own the songs. The Mail, without citing any sources, says Willis is considering legal action against Apple to gain control over the music. CNN could not confirm the report Monday, and a request sent to representatives for Willis was not immediately returned. The \\"Die Hard\\" actor's wife, Emma Heming-Willis, cast doubt on the report when she said Monday on Twitter, \\"It's not a true story.\\" But the news reports, exaggerated or not, do raise potentially significant issues about ownership of digital music and whether someone could pass on digital assets to heirs. Apple's terms and conditions for iTunes are an exhaustive, jargon-filled document that users must \\"agree\\" to before downloading content but that many people don't bother to read. In simplified terms, they state that when we buy music from iTunes, we are paying for the license to listen to songs via our iPhone, iPod or other Apple device. But we are not buying the music itself. \\"When you buy a book, you own the copy of that book but not the actual material,\\" Jonathan Handel, a Los Angeles-based entertainment attorney who specializes in digital media and intellectual property, told CNN last year. \\"What you are buying here is right to use music on certain devices.\\" If Willis did take on Apple over ownership of his iTunes collection, he might have an uphill legal battle. The iTunes terms are essentially a contract between the user and Apple, and clicking \\"Agree\\" counts as an electronic signature, digital-media lawyers say. Nothing would stop Willis from leaving music-loaded laptops or phones to his children, although things would get more complicated if his kids tried to transfer the songs to other devices. Apple limits use of digital music to Apple gadgets used by the iTunes account holder. Apple also prohibits users from downloading songs to more than 10 devices, or burning a playlist more than seven times. Willis, 57, has three adult daughters with ex-wife Demi Moore and a young daughter with current wife Heming. Apple did not respond Monday to a request for comment. The company's formidable legal team last month won a 1 billion judgment against rival Samsung in a patent dispute. Other online music retailers, such as Amazon and Google Play, impose similar restrictions on downloads. Willis was trending on Twitter Monday, with some commenters poking fun at the issue. Wrote one Twitter user, \\"I don't know what's more shocking Bruce Willis suing Apple ... or the fact he actually read the Terms and Conditions.\\" Write highlights for this article.","completion":"Bruce Willis, a famous actor, wanted to give his iTunes music collection to his daughters when he passes away. However, Apple's rules say that he can't do that because he doesn't really own the music. He has spent a lot of money on his collection, so he might try to fight Apple's rules in court. This situation makes people think about who truly owns digital music and if it can be passed on to others after someone dies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I moved to the small, busy town of Edison in New Jersey six years ago. It was during the second term of my fifth grade. My parents got new jobs and higher income, so they decided it was time to move from Woodbridge to a better, more educational town. In the US, it is unnecessary to take a test to get into a \\"good\\" middle or high school. You just attend the school close to where you live. So, many parents will think about the quality (,) of the local school when they decide to buy a new house. My parents did the same. We finally chose Edison mainly because of the high quality of its school. In New Jersey, an area with a good school usually means _ Asian people. There are about 300 students in our school. 55% are Asians and just under half of that are Chinese. There are so many Chinese people nearby that we even have our own Chinese school.

How did sent iMessage status change from 'read' to 'delivered'? \\"I sent a message to recipient who is not my friend on Facebook through my computer. I sent another one through Facebook Messenger and it is still marked as 'sent' (but not delivered). Does this mean that the recipient marked my first message as spam?\\" Choices: (1). no; (2). yes;","completion":"Choice (1): No, the questions do not have the same meaning. Although both questions are related to message statuses, they address two different messaging platforms and distinct situations. The first question is about a change in iMessage status on an Apple device. iMessage is an instant messaging service developed by Apple, which allows users to send texts, documents, photos, videos, and other multimedia content over the internet between iOS or macOS devices. In the iMessage context, 'Read' implies that the recipient has opened and viewed the message, while 'Delivered' simply means the message has successfully reached the recipient's device but hasn't necessarily been read. The question is focused on understanding why the status has changed from 'read' to 'delivered.' The second question is inquiring about sending messages on Facebook and its Facebook Messenger platform. While both services are owned by Facebook, the primary difference is that Facebook Messenger is a standalone messaging app, while the Facebook platform comes with its integrated messaging service, accessible via the website or the Facebook mobile app. This question details a situation where the user has sent two messages to a non-friend recipient, one through the Facebook website (computer) and another through Facebook Messenger. The sender's concern is understanding why the message sent through Facebook Messenger is marked as 'Sent' but not 'Delivered.' They are also wondering if the recipient has marked their first message as spam. To summarize, the main difference between the questions is the platforms being discussed (Apple's iMessage and Facebook/Facebook Messenger). Additionally, the scenarios concern different message statuses and user actions, such as possible spam marking in the case of the second question.

Here is a step-by-step justification for my choice: 1. Flaring out the ends of the bottle cap: By flaring out the ends, we're creating a smooth, rounded edge that will be more comfortable for the person wearing the pendant. Flaring the ends out also adds an interesting shape and design element to the pendant. 2. Flattening the bottle cap: This step transforms the cap from a simple bottle cap into a more artistically interesting and appealing pendant base. Flattening the cap makes it easier to attach additional decorations, such as beads or charms. 3. Punching a small hole through the top: By punching a hole through the top, we create a secure and easy way to attach the pendant to the necklace chain. The placement of the hole at the top ensures the pendant hangs evenly and appears visually balanced when worn. In conclusion, option (a) results in a fun and visually appealing pendant for a necklace, while maintaining comfort and functionality for the wearer."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: This article: The territorial call of the Australian raven is a slow, high ah-ah-aaaah with the last note drawn out. It uses this call to communicate with other Australian ravens in the area. When giving this call, the species has a horizontal posture, holding its head forward and body parallel to the ground, while perched on a prominent position. It ruffles its hackles and lowers its tail, and sometimes holds its beak open between calls. In contrast, the little raven and forest raven hold their bodies in an upright posture. This call becomes louder if trespassers encroach upon the Australian raven's territory. The five Australian species are very difficult to tell apart, with the call being the easiest way to do so, although the drawing-out of the final note—long held to be solely recorded for the Australian raven—has been recorded for the other species and is hence not diagnostic.The volume, pitch, tempo and order of notes can be changed depending on the message the Australian raven intends to convey. There is a variety of contact calls: a pair often makes a low murmuring sound when preening each other while roosting, and members of a flock carry on with a quiet chattering while at rest. Birds make a call and answer sequence if temporarily out of sight of one another while foraging. Birds in flocks make a single high-pitched caa while flying over another territory as a transit call to signify they are just passing through.

Options: a ) 15 , b ) 16 , c ) 28 , d ) 42 , e ) 64 Solution:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to determine the total number of games played in the league using the information given. Step 1: Determine the number of matchups Since there are 7 teams in the league and each team plays each other twice, we can use combinatorics to find the total number of matchups. This can be calculated using the formula for the number of combinations: C(n,k) = n! / (k!(n-k)!) where n is the total number of items and k is the number of items in the combination. Step 2: Apply the formula In this case, we have n = 7 (number of teams) and k = 2 (since a game is played by 2 teams). Now we plug these values into the formula: C(7,2) = 7! / (2!(7-2)!) = 7! / (2!5!) = (7*6*5*4*3*2*1) / (2*1*5*4*3*2*1) = (7*6) / (2*1) = 42 / 2 = 21 Step 3: Account for the double matchups Since each team plays each other twice, we need to multiply the number of matchups (21) by 2. So, 21 * 2 = 42. Step 4: Choose the correct answer Now we see that 42 is among our answer choices: a) 15 b) 16 c) 28 d) 42 e) 64 So the correct answer is d) 42.

Never . Most people in that part of the country married their high school sweethearts so at the ripe old age of nineteen , I had passed my prime . Hopes of getting a date were pretty slim ( about as likely as my acceptance to WWF training camp * giggles * ) . Why is the narrator so down on themselves ?","completion":"The narrator appears to be down on themselves due to a combination of factors such as societal expectations, personal experiences, and perceived lack of opportunities. Firstly, the societal expectations, especially in the specific region where the narrator lives, seem to play a significant role in their pessimistic outlook. It is evident that people in this part of the country tend to marry their high school sweethearts, and by the age of nineteen, they are usually expected to have already found their long-term partners. As the narrator is nineteen years old and has not followed this norm, they might feel like an outsider, as if they have missed a crucial milestone in their life. Secondly, the narrator's personal experiences of holding onto failing relationships or dating out of desperation also contribute to their negative self-image. They acknowledge that they might have made poor choices in the past, and this self-awareness has made them more critical of themselves. Due to these experiences, self-doubt might have crept in, leading to a belief that they are somehow not capable of having a successful or fulfilling relationship or that they lack the ability to attract the right person. Moreover, the passage points out that the narrator feels they have \\"passed their prime\\" at nineteen, further indicating a sense of helplessness and lowered self-esteem. This feeling of being past one's prime, particularly when it comes to romantic relationships, can amplify the narrator's lack of confidence and reinforce the belief that they are undeserving or unworthy of a suitable romantic partner. Lastly, the odds of finding a suitable date or partner are perceived by the narrator to be \\"pretty slim,\\" comparable to their chances of getting accepted into the WWF training camp, which they assume to be highly unlikely. This pessimistic outlook could be a result of the limited dating pool in their area or the realization that it could be challenging to find someone who genuinely resonates with them. This perceived lack of opportunities further intensifies the narrator's negativity and self-criticism. In summary, the narrator appears to be down on themselves due to the societal expectations surrounding them, the consequences of their past romantic history, a feeling of already being past their prime, and a perceived lack of potential partners. These factors intertwine and create a substantial impact on their self-esteem and outlook towards relationships and themselves."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:What is the answer for the question: What was the last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery? from the following article ? Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End.

In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\". Sir Geraint Evans commented on how Lancaster's designs helped the performer: \\"[His] design for Falstaff was superb: it gave me clues to understanding the character, and reflected that marvellous, subtle sense of humour which was present in all his work.\\" A:","completion":"The last year Lancaster created costumes and scenery was in 1973, for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fear: Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party. Friends of the embattled Lord Rennard have warned he could expose Liberal Democrat sex scandals if he is expelled from the party. The Liberal Democrat peer - who has denied allegations of sexual harassment - could go ‘nuclear’ if party leader Nick Clegg stops him from re-joining the party. Lord Rennard became active with the Lib Dems as an orphaned teen and has devoted his entire life to the party. Now friends feel he has been treated ‘cruelly’ and could retaliate if he is shut out permanently. He could reveal secrets, such as claims like that of a former MP who was known to be a persistent sex pest, the liaison between a Lib Dem peer and married MP, and details of gay affairs between peers and MPs, according to the Sunday Times. A spokesman for Lord Rennard declined to comment last night. The Lib Dem peer has kept silent in the last few days, as have the women who made allegations against him. According to one source, he has a ‘little black book’ filled with many politician and activists’ darkest secrets. The Lib Dem, who did not wish to be named, said that most of in the party ‘lived in fear’ of the Svengali-like figure because their careers - and family life - depended on him. The source said: ‘He is often offered up as a shoulder to cry on so everyone has off-loaded their skeletons on to him. But he has all their dirty little secrets apparently stored in a little black book.

We eventually had a technician from John Moore come out to fix this problem. He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system. So what started out for changing a light bulb was going to end up costing 10K.

With its 18-carat rose gold casing and a stunning sparkle that comes courtesy of 395 white diamonds, it's safe to say that the Savelli Champagne Diamond phone isn't your average handset.

Other luxury features include an ultra-bombé sapphire crystal screen and high-tech android-powered connectivity. But not every phone in the range is sparkling with diamonds. Among the 11 models available is the sleek Black Sport which has a simple inky leather cover, albeit one crafted from alligator skin. And should you have the cash to spare, the phones have gone on sale in the UK at - where else? - luxury department store, Harrods.

Even more luxurious is the Jewellery Full Diamonds model, which along with white alligator casing, is decked with 211 shimmering white diamonds. Each of the phones in the Meridiist range also comes with a complimentary concierge service, which, according to the brand, can get everything from reservations in the world's most exclusive restaurants to tickets to sold out shows. Precious stones: Tag Heuer's phones come embellished with white diamonds and pink sapphires. Over recent years, pink sapphires have become an increasingly popular part of the jewellers' repertoire. But not everyone is sold on the stones. In her book, Buried Treasure: Travels Through The Jewel Box, author Victoria Finley reveals that the gems aren't quite what they seem. Chemically rubies and sapphires are identical and are both a gemstone variety of the mineral corundum (aluminium oxide). But while sapphires get their colour from trace amounts of other elements such as titanium, copper and magnesium, only rubies contain traces of chromium - the only material to impart a pink or red colour. As a result, writes Finley, while its perfectly possible to get purple, yellow or even green sapphires, there is no such thing as a pink or red one. For jewellers, this creates a problem, as rubies are graded by their colour. Dark 'pigeon's blood' red is considered the most valuable while pale pink is virtually worthless - so much so that unscrupulous dealers will attempt to heat them in a bid to darken the colour, despite a 50 per cent chance that they'll explode instead. So what do you get when you buy a pink 'sapphire'? The answer is a low grade ruby - a classification endorsed by trade bodies such as International Colored Gemstone Association which doesn't recognise pink sapphires. Like brown diamonds, pink sapphires might be pretty, but in reality, they aren't nearly as valuable as you might think. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"The Savelli Champagne Diamond phone is a luxurious handset that retails at £35,000 and features an 18-carat rose gold casing adorned with 395 white diamonds.

Given the question: Earth orbiting the Sun causes seasons to change, and seasons are caused by the tilt of the axis relative to the planet's orbit. Given these facts, what causes earth's seasons among the following options: - principals of aerodynamics - Physical weathering - floods - the tilt of the planet - an external framework - dry conditions - axis rotation - relative location The answer is:","completion":"The answer is the tilt of the planet. Earth's seasons are indeed caused by the tilt of its axis relative to its orbit around the Sun. It is crucial to understand how this affects the distribution of sunlight, temperature variations, and climate changes throughout the year. Although other factors mentioned may directly or indirectly affect regional weather patterns or geological processes, they do not primarily cause the Earth's changing seasons. Let's explore in more detail why the tilt of the planet plays a pivotal role in our seasonal variations. The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees. As it orbits the Sun, the orientation of this tilt does not change relative to distant stars. However, it does change relative to the Sun. This means that during certain parts of the orbit, the Northern Hemisphere receives more direct sunlight, while in others, the Southern Hemisphere receives more. It is key to remember that when one hemisphere is tilted towards the Sun, experiencing summer, the other hemisphere is tilted away, entering winter. The hemisphere receiving direct sunlight experiences warming temperatures and longer days. Consequently, the opposite hemisphere experiences cooling temperatures and shorter days due to the indirect sunlight that it receives during this time. Spring and autumn occur when Earth's axial tilt is roughly parallel to its orbit, leading to equal amounts of daylight and darkness. These transitional periods result in moderate temperatures satisfying a middle ground between the warmth of summer and the cold of winter. Examining the other suggested factors further highlights that the tilt of the Earth is the primary cause of seasonal changes: 1. Principals of aerodynamics: Refers to the study of forces acting on objects in motion through the air and the effects of these forces. These principles are not directly related to the cause of Earth's seasons. 2. Physical weathering: A geological process in which rocks break down into smaller particles due to natural factors, such as temperature fluctuations and freeze-thaw cycles. Although temperature variations are connected to Earth's changing seasons, the weathering process itself does not cause these changes. 3. Floods: A temporary overflow of water that submerges land, which can be caused by weather phenomena, but does not determine the Earth's seasonal changes. 4. An external framework: This term appears to be a vague reference to any external force or structure. It is also not precise or relevant when explaining the cause of Earth's seasons. 5. Dry conditions: Arid weather can be a result or characteristic of certain regional climates during a particular season but is not the underlying cause of seasons. 6. Axis rotation: The Earth's rotation on its axis is responsible for day and night but not seasonal changes, which are directly tied to the tilt of the axis in relation to the orbit. 7. Relative location: Regions on Earth experience distinct seasons due to their latitude, with tropical and polar areas experiencing less extreme variations than temperate locations. However, this localized influence is a result of the axial tilt changing the directness of sunlight received in an area, making tilt the primary cause. In summary, the primary cause behind Earth's changing seasons is the tilt of the planet, which influences the amount of direct sunlight received by each hemisphere throughout the year. While other factors may directly or indirectly influence weather activities or geological processes, they do not hold the key role in causing Earth's seasons."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: \\"What was the \\"stumbling block\\" that Bright mentioned?\\" Context: \\"The interface of Windows 8 has been the subject of mixed reaction.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Indigenous Australians have lived in parts of the Northern Territory for around 40,000 years. Pre-European settlement numbers are not known with any precision, although the Indigenous population of the Northern Territory has been estimated at \\"well over 10,000\\". The area now known as Muckaty Station (often referred to as just \\"Muckaty\\", though the origin of this name and near variants such as \\"Mucketty\\" is unknown) was – and is – the responsibility of seven clans of traditional Indigenous owners: Milwayi, Ngapa, Ngarrka, Wirntiku, Kurrakurraja, Walanypirri and Yapayapa. The country is known by the Indigenous name Warlmanpa, which is also the name of a local language.Although there had been several unsuccessful attempts by British or colonial authorities to settle in the Northern Territory, there was no permanent European presence until surveyor George Goyder in 1869 established what is now known as Darwin. The timing was auspicious: in October 1870 the South Australian government decided to construct an overland telegraph line, from Port Augusta on the continent's south coast, to the new settlement just established in the country's tropical north. The line traversed what is now Muckaty Station, with repeater stations built at Powell's Creek to the north and Tennant's Creek to the south. At the same time as the telegraph line was completed in August 1872, a cattle industry was beginning to develop in central and northern Australia. The first pastoral lease in the Northern Territory was granted in 1872, and by 1911 there were at least 250 such leases covering over 180,000 square miles (470,000 km2) of the jurisdiction. The Muckaty pastoral lease was created in the late 19th century. Currently the property is surrounded by other leases including Powell Creek to the north, Helen Springs Station to the east with Philip Creek and Banka Banka Stations to the south.

Question with options to choose from: Why did the person mentioned end up losing weight ? Available options: a). They had implemented a strict diet .. b). They had a lot of workouts to do it .. c). None of the above choices .. d). They had surgery ..","completion":"The person mentioned in the scenario ended up losing weight due to option d). They had surgery, specifically gastric bypass surgery. Gastric bypass surgery is a medical procedure that promotes weight loss by restricting the amount of food that an individual can consume and altering the digestive process. This procedure consists of two major steps: the creation of a small stomach pouch and the bypassing of a portion of the small intestine. During the first step, the surgeon divides the stomach into a smaller upper section and a larger bottom section using surgical staples. The smaller pouch typically has a capacity of around 1 ounce, which significantly limits the volume of food that a person can eat. Consequently, they feel full quickly and consume fewer calories. The second step entails connecting the newly formed stomach pouch directly to the middle portion of the small intestine, bypassing the initial segment. This change in the digestive path hinders the absorption of calories and nutrients, further contributing to weight loss. It is essential to note that while gastric bypass surgery can lead to significant weight loss without the need for exercise, engaging in physical activities is still highly recommended for overall health improvements. Exercise improves cardiovascular health, muscle strength, flexibility, and mental well-being. Moreover, incorporating exercise into one's daily routine can aid in weight maintenance and prevent potential weight regain following surgery. To summarize, the person mentioned in the scenario lost weight through gastric bypass surgery (option d), which enabled them to experience significant weight loss without exercising. However, it is crucial to keep in mind that exercise remains a vital component of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and, when combined with the surgical intervention, could yield even better long-term results."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's go step-by-step. 1. Combine the g-terms: We have -9g and 40g on the right side of the equation. To combine them, we add the coefficients (-9 and 40). -9g + 40g = 31g So, the equation becomes: -186 = 31g 2. Isolate the variable g: To find the value of g, we need to isolate it by getting it on one side of the equation. To do this, we need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of g, which is 31. -186 ÷ 31 = 31g ÷ 31 This simplifies to: -6 = g So, the solution to the equation -186 = -9g + 40g is g = -6."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is widely agreed that the mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) is the ancestor of all breeds of domestic duck (with the exception of the Muscovy duck (Cairina moschata), which is not closely related to other ducks). Ducks are farmed mainly for their meat, eggs, and down. As is the case with chickens, various breeds have been developed, selected for egg-laying ability, fast growth, and a well-covered carcase. The most common commercial breed in the United Kingdom and the United States is the Pekin duck, which can lay 200 eggs a year and can reach a weight of 3.5 kg (7.7 lb) in 44 days. In the Western world, ducks are not as popular as chickens, because the latter produce larger quantities of white, lean meat and are easier to keep intensively, making the price of chicken meat lower than that of duck meat. While popular in haute cuisine, duck appears less frequently in the mass-market food industry. However, things are different in the East. Ducks are more popular there than chickens and are mostly still herded in the traditional way and selected for their ability to find sufficient food in harvested rice fields and other wet environments. Is there an answer to this question (If it cannot be answered, say \\"unanswerable\\"): Why is the Pekin duck unfavorable in the western world?","completion":"Based on the given information, the Pekin duck is not necessarily unfavorable in the Western world. However, it is less popular than chickens for a few reasons: 1. Chickens produce larger quantities of white, lean meat, which is generally more popular in Western cuisines. 2. Chickens are easier to keep intensively, making them more suitable for large-scale, industrialized farming. This results in a lower price for chicken meat compared to duck meat. While Pekin ducks may be less popular compared to chickens in the Western world, they are still consumed and appreciated by many people, particularly in haute cuisine."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

While there is still a lot of talk about how the Republican Party needs to reinvent itself, Democrats should keep in mind they could use a touch-up themselves. With 20 Senate seats to defend in the midterm election -- compared with just 13 Republican ones -- the truth is Sen. Harry Reid and the gang do not have a lot of time to gloat. The economy may be improving, but it is still limping; millions are looking for work, and the deficit continues to grow. So whatever momentum President Obama and the Democrats received from last week's victories will all be gone come 2016 if they can't agree on a detailed budget plan by 2014. And let's be clear: Taxing the rich and closing some loopholes is not a detailed plan. Granted, Democrats are proposing spending cuts -- but they have to be more bullish about their proposed cuts than they are about taxing the rich. The latter got them elected but the economy is in more need of the former. Allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire for those who make 1 million a year or more, as championed by some, is estimated to generate only 500 billion to 600 billion over 10 years. That dwarfs the number cutting off Big Bird would bring but it does little to solve the debt problem. Opinion: Conservatives, don't despair. So any plan that does not include significant spending cuts is no plan at all. If Democrats want to build on last week, they have to be bold, because they can't depend on Republicans to say stupid things about rape or ignore minorities forever. In fact, confetti was still falling in Chicago when George P. Bush -- the Spanish speaking, half-Mexican nephew of you know who -- filed his papers with the Texas Ethics Commission to run for an as-yet unspecified office. The 36-year-old is the co-founder of the political action committee, Hispanic Republicans of Texas. That alone won't solve all of the party's image problems with Latinos, but as long as he's not on the crazy, inflammatory side of his party, he's got the looks, charisma and name to be the kind of political star they need -- the kind who can draw big crowds and maybe sway Latino voters two years from now, if not for himself, then certainly for another GOP candidate. Face it Democrats -- the celebration is over and it's time to get to work. At least six of the Senate seats the party has to defend are in red states. Lose those, and President Obama could be spending his final two years butting heads with a Republican Congress. So what do the Democrats need to do? Opinion: Election a call for purple politics. Well for starters, identify candidates to go after Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins' seat, because Obama won Maine. Second, be a party white people want to vote for. Lost in all of the hoopla about Republicans needing to adapt to the country's new demographic, is the fact Romney captured the largest percentage of white votes since Ronald Reagan. True, some of that can be attributed to racist backlash to Obama -- but most of it has to do with the message of the Democratic platform. Romney characterized 47% of the country as a bunch of moochers (and coincidentally came away with 47.8% of the popular vote). That means a lot of voters: the numbers suggest 88% of the people who voted for Romney were white. That's a problem. If Democrats don't figure out a way to make their message attractive to white people, they could possibly lose the Senate. And third, and probably most important, they have to be a party worth voting for. One can certainly say Republicans, from the top of the ticket on down, shot themselves in the foot this election, making it easier for Democrats to paint them as a party to vote against. But for the 2014 midterm, Democrats must present a budget plan people want to vote for. In two years voters are going to be asking \\"What else you got?\\" and if Democrats don't have an answer, they risk getting shellacked in 2014, the same way they got their butts handed to them in 2010. Back then, Republicans took back the House. Politics: 2014 battle for the Senate starts now. Another GOP landslide could create a path to the White House.

In total, 3,602 children under 18 were in possession of firearms certificates, of which 327 were 13 or younger. The Home Office figures for 2016/17 are for those who have certificates for firearms and/or shotguns. The police force with the largest number of children having access to guns was Devon and Cornwall, which issued 206 certificates. Overall, 580,658 children and adults were authorised to use guns last year - a reduction of 7,023 compared with 2015/16. Previous Freedom of Information answers from the Home Office have shown children as young as seven to be in possession of a certificate. There is no minimum age for applying for a shotgun certificate, but the law prohibits children from using them without the supervision of an adult aged at least 21, until they are 15. In addition, children aged under 18 are banned from purchasing or hiring any firearm or ammunition. Across all ages, Devon and Cornwall has the highest number of firearms certificates with 11,144, followed by Sussex (6,934) and North Yorkshire (6,734). City of London Police issued only three licences, while Merseyside and Cleveland were the forces with the next lowest number of certificates - 1,029 and 1,125 respectively. Applications for certificates are examined and then granted or refused by local police forces after a number of checks including interviews, visits and references. Certificates can be revoked if a chief officer of the local force is satisfied the holder can no longer be entrusted with firearms or shotguns. The figures showed that 358 firearms certificates and 1,216 shotgun certificates were revoked in 2016/17, with both numbers falling by 10% on the previous year. The UK is seen as having some of the toughest gun control laws in the world. A Home Office spokesman said there are \\"very strict controls on young certificate-holders, including around their tight supervision\\". He added the Policing and Crime Act 2017 had strengthened firearms legislation by closing legal loopholes that had been exploited by criminals. Peter Glenser, chairman of the British Association for Shooting and Conservation, said teaching children to use firearms safely and responsibly \\"removes the myths that surround firearms, and teaches both self-control and responsibility towards others\\".

Answer the following question: Information: - A mountain range (also mountain barrier, belt, or system) is a geographic area containing numerous geologically related mountains. A mountain system or system of mountain ranges, sometimes is used to combine several geological features that are geographically (regionally) related. On Earth, most significant mountain ranges are the result of plate tectonics, though mountain ranges are formed by a range of processes, are found on many planetary mass objects in the Solar System and are likely a feature of most terrestrial planets. - The Brecon Beacons is a mountain range in South Wales. In a narrow sense, the name refers to the range of Old Red Sandstone peaks which lie to the south of Brecon. Sometimes referred to as \\"the central Beacons\\" they include South Wales' highest mountain, Pen y Fan. The range forms the central section of the Brecon Beacons National Park (\\"Parc Cenedlaethol Bannau Brycheiniog\\"), a designation which also encompasses ranges both to the east and the west of \\"the central Beacons\\". This much wider area is also commonly referred to as \\"the Brecon Beacons\\", and it includes the Black Mountains to the east as well as the similarly named but quite distinct Black Mountain to the west. The highest peaks include Fan Brycheiniog to the west and Pen y Fan in the central part. They share the same basic geology as the central range, and so exhibit many similar features, such the north-facing escarpment and glacial features such as lakes and cwms below the escarpment. They all fall within the border of the national park. - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins. - Powys (or ; Welsh: ) is a principal area, local-government county and preserved county in Mid Wales. It is named after the successor Kingdom of Powys, which formed after the Romans withdrew from Britain. - Yr Wyddfa commonly known as Snowdon in English, is the highest mountain in Wales, at an elevation of above sea level, and the highest point in the British Isles south of the Scottish Highlands. It is located in Snowdonia National Park (\\") in Gwynedd, and has been described as \\"probably the busiest mountain in Britain\\". It is designated as a national nature reserve for its rare flora and fauna. - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Mynydd Troed is a hill in the Black Mountains of the Brecon Beacons National Park in Powys, south Wales. Its name literally translates to \\"Foot Mountain,\\" based how it appears when viewed from the Allt Mawr ridge. - FOREST (short for \\"Freedom Organisation for the Right to Enjoy Smoking Tobacco\\") is a United Kingdom political pressure group which campaigns against tobacco control activity. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - A national park is a park in use for conservation purposes. Often it is a reserve of natural, semi-natural, or developed land that a sovereign state declares or owns. Although individual nations designate their own national parks differently, there is a common idea: the conservation of 'wild nature' for posterity and as a symbol of national pride. An international organization, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and its World Commission on Protected Areas, has defined \\"National Park\\" as its \\"Category II\\" type of protected areas. - Brecon, archaically known as Brecknock, is a market town and community in Powys, Mid Wales, with a population in 2001 of 7,901, increasing to 8,250 at the 2011 census. Historically it was the county town of Brecknockshire; although its role as such was eclipsed with the formation of the County of Powys, it remains an important local centre. Brecon is the third-largest town in Powys, after Newtown and Ystradgynlais. It lies north of the Brecon Beacons mountain range, but is just within the Brecon Beacons National Park. - The Bristol Channel is a major inlet in the island of Great Britain, separating South Wales from Devon and Somerset in South West England. It extends from the lower estuary of the River Severn to the North Atlantic Ocean. It takes its name from the English city of Bristol, and is over 30 miles (50 km) across at its widest point. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Black Mixen is a subsidiary summit of Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos in the Radnor Forest. The summit is large peat bog plateau. The summit is marked with a cairn, and is next to a radio transmitter and its building. - Radnor Forest is a rock dome in Mid Wales, and a forest only in the mediaeval sense of an unenclosed area used for hunting. The highest point is Rhos Fawr or Great Rhos, a broad featureless plateau which reaches , and a similar plateau adjoining to the east, Black Mixen is the only Nuttall to have a communications mast (a radio transmitter) on its summit. - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water. - England is a country that is part of the United Kingdom. It shares land borders with Scotland to the north and Wales to the west. The Irish Sea lies northwest of England and the Celtic Sea lies to the southwest. England is separated from continental Europe by the North Sea to the east and the English Channel to the south. The country covers five-eighths of the island of Great Britain (which lies in the North Atlantic) in its centre and south; and includes over 100 smaller islands such as the Isles of Scilly, and the Isle of Wight. - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. - Wales is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and the island of Great Britain. It is bordered by England to the east, the Irish Sea to the north and west, and the Bristol Channel to the south. It had a population in 2011 of 3,063,456 and has a total area of . Wales has over of coastline and is largely mountainous, with its higher peaks in the north and central areas, including Snowdon, its highest summit. The country lies within the north temperate zone and has a changeable, maritime climate. - Corn Du is a mountain immediately to the southwest of Pen y Fan and the second highest peak in South Wales at 873 m (2,864 ft), situated in the Brecon Beacons National Park. The summit itself is marked by a well structured Bronze Age cairn with a central burial cist like that on nearby Pen y Fan.

In fact, it has different connotations in each context. 1. \\"The application of indexes to tables of data.\\" In this sentence, \\"application\\" refers to the act of applying or using a certain concept, technique, methodology, or process in order to achieve a specific goal or improve the outcome. Here, the word conveys the idea of employing indexes, which are data structures that allow efficient access and retrieval of information, to tables of data to enhance their organization and retrieval process. The usage in this context is more abstract and theoretical, as it deals with principles and concepts related to data manipulation and organization. 2. \\"The iPhone application VR+ connects to major social networks.\\" In this sentence, \\"application\\" refers to a software program or app that has been specifically designed and developed to perform certain tasks on a device like a smartphone, tablet, or computer.

Eventually, Amin held the rank of major general in the post-colonial Uganda People's Defense Force and became its commander before seizing power in the military coup of January 1971 that deposed Milton Obote. While he was head of state, he promoted himself to field marshal. - The Ugandan Bush War (also known as the Luwero War, the Ugandan civil war or the Resistance War) refers to the guerrilla war waged between 1981 and 1986 in Uganda by the National Resistance Army (NRA) under the leadership of Yoweri Museveni against the government of Milton Obote, and later that of Tito Okello. - Apollo Milton Obote (28 December 1925 10 October 2005) was a Ugandan political leader who led Uganda to independence in 1962 from British colonial administration. Following the nation's independence, he served as Prime Minister of Uganda from 1962 to 1966 and President of Uganda from 1966 to 1971, then again from 1980 to 1985.

Fiddling opened a door to self-expression, creativity, and community through music. Learning to play the fiddle would introduce Jamie to a whole new set of skills, both physical and mental. She would need to develop her finger dexterity and hand-eye coordination to play the instrument accurately. Additionally, she would have to learn to read sheet music and understand the nuances of rhythm, pitch, and melody. This process is both challenging and rewarding, creating a sense of personal accomplishment and pride in mastering a new skill.

Playing music together fosters a sense of camaraderie, trust, and support among its members. It's not just about the music; it's about the human connections and shared experiences that music creates. Jamie's discovery of fiddling might also have led her to delve deeper into the history and cultural significance of the instrument.

But let me explain it in a simpler way for you. Filter banks are like a group of helpers that work together to separate different sounds in music or voice. But they have a problem, called pre-echo, which makes some sounds appear a bit earlier than they should. This happens because the helpers (filter banks) don't always do their job perfectly. The tree structure means that these helpers work in a team, one after another, to separate the sounds. This structure makes the pre-echo problem worse since they can't work together perfectly to make the sounds separate just right.

In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. and the situation: Drought is major concern in the Midwest.

Due to the darkness of the novel, the themes are often characterized by elements of gothic romance, intrigue, and tragedy. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" made its debut on the West End in London at Her Majesty's Theatre in 1986, featuring music composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber, lyrics by Charles Hart and Richard Stilgoe, and a book by Lloyd Webber and Stilgoe. The musical quickly catapulted itself into popularity, becoming one of the longest-running and most successful musicals in history. The Broadway debut followed in 1988 at the Majestic Theatre in New York, where it is still running today. \\"Music of the Night\\" is one of the most well-known songs from the musical and is performed by the Phantom himself. It is a captivating and emotional ballad that showcases the Phantom's immense musical talent and his yearning for love and connection. In this scene, the Phantom sings to Christine, the young soprano he falls in love with, as he leads her to his secret underground lair beneath the Opera House. The song is an attempt to seduce her with the beauty and power of music, and it demonstrates the Phantom's inner vulnerability and loneliness. On the other hand, \\"All I Ask of You\\" is a romantic duet sung by Christine and Raoul, the dashing young viscount she is in love with. The song takes place on the rooftop of the Paris Opera House, as the two characters confess their love for one another and pledge to protect each other from the Phantom's threats. \\"All I Ask of You\\" is a poignant and tender love song that showcases the deep connection between Christine and Raoul, serving as a sharp contrast to the darker and more complex relationship Christine has with the Phantom. \\"The Phantom of the Opera\\" has had a profound impact on musical theater around the world and has been translated into numerous languages, grossing billions of dollars in ticket sales. Its memorable songs like \\"Music of the Night\\" and \\"All I Ask of You\\" have been recorded and covered by various artists and have become timeless classics.

Spelling lessons should be scrapped because children can correct mistakes on their mobile phone or computer, a university professor has claimed. Sugata Mitra, professor of educational technology at Newcastle University, said that good grammar was necessary 'maybe 100 years ago' but 'not right now'. He said that traditional spelling classes are unnecessary when students have constant access to state-of-the-art technology. Obsolete: A university professor has said that there is no place in schools for spelling and grammar lessons. Professor Mitra said that pupils should be encouraged not to rely on linguistic rules but to try and express themselves in new ways such as using mobile phone text messaging. The professor spoke out as the Government introduces a drive aimed at improving educational standards that will see pupils tested on spelling 200 complex words by the end of primary school. Alternative: Professor Mitra has said that youngsters should be encouraged to communicate in other ways such as via text messaging. A separate test in spelling, punctuation and grammar was introduced in England for 11-year-olds this year. GCSE students have also been told that they will be docked marks in exams if they do not use accurate English. Professor Mitra said in an interview with the Times that emphasising spelling and grammar in the classroom is: 'a bit unnecessary because they are skills that were very essential maybe 100 years ago but they are not right now. 'Firstly, my phone corrects my spelling so I don't really need to think about it and, secondly, because I often skip grammar and write in a cryptic way.' The professor won the 1million TED Prize to create 'cloud schools' where children learn from each other and retired experts.

Warren Clarke's gruff northern accent was familiar to millions who watched him play the taciturn Superintendent Andy Dalziel in the popular BBC drama. The Oldham-born actor played the surly police officer for 61 episodes, providing the yin to the yang provided by Colin Buchanan's Peter Pascoe. But his career spanned several decades on stage, television and film, ranging from Cold War dramas to comedy and even playing Winston Churchill in the West End. The star, who also appeared in films such as Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange, is said to have died after a 'short illness'. Scroll down for video. Actor Warren Clarke, known for his role in TV drama Dalziel And Pascoe, died today at the age of 67. Pictured right with co-star Colin Buchanan. Born into a poor Lancashire family, he worked hard to achieve fame, telling the Daily Mail in 2011 that he was a 'lucky b******', adding: 'Although I've worked nearly 50 years for this, through the tough times as well as the good times.' Clarke was raised by his secretary mother and stained-glass window maker in a council house. They died within a year of one another when Warren was in his 20s, leaving him and his sister Beryl, who is 11 years older, a ‘bunch of photographs and happy memories'. He was conceived when his father returned from the War. He wanted to be a footballer until his passion for acting kicked in. ‘When I told my parents what I was going to do, they said, “Good luck, son.” He told the paper that before one television series, 1989's Nice Work, he had to ask friends for money and his wife Michelle had to sell her engagement ring to buy food. His first big-screen appearance could have led to stardom but was affected by factors out of his control. A twenty-something Clarke appeared alongside Malcolm McDowell as Dim, a half-witted yet violently evil 'droog' in Stanley Kubrick's controversial 1971 dystopian masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, based on Anthony Burgess's novel. After several court cases implicated the film's brutal violence, including the murder of a tramp in an underpass by a gang featuring McDowell and Clarke's characters, Kubrick withdrew the film from cinemas and it remained rarely shown until its re-release following his death in 1999. With appearances in Coronation Street and the Avengers already under his belt Clarke went on to appear in numerous television series and films in a wide variety of roles.

This appearance spawned some of his best-loved lines, flattering his daughter (Richardson) by telling Blackadder: 'I'd no more place her in the hands of an unworthy man than I'd place my John Thomas in the hands of a lunatic with a pair of scissors' and 'I love her more than any pig, and that's saying summat'.

Clarke’s marriage to his first wife and the mother of his son, Rowan, ended a few years after his parents died. He said: ‘Not being there with Rowan (who was 10 at the time) was tough. Nobody has an easy time with divorce. You don’t like what’s happening but you have to get on with it. But I’ve got a happy marriage now.’ Warren met Michelle through friends 30 years ago. They tried for a baby for 20 years and had pretty much given up hope when Michele became pregnant with Georgia. ‘When I thought it would never happen, it did, then I thought, “Oh my God, I’m old enough to be a grandfather\\",' he said.

It is good to get into the habit of using the recycling bin instead of the trash can because using the","completion":"recycling bin not only helps reduce the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and other disposal sites, but also contributes to the conservation of natural resources, supports the circular economy, and aids in the mitigation of climate change. Firstly, utilizing the recycling bin aids in cutting down the volume of waste that ends up in landfills, incinerators, or other disposal sites. A significant percentage of our daily waste consists of recyclable materials such as paper, plastic, glass, and metal. By segregating and recycling these materials, we help reduce the strain on landfills and incinerators, ultimately decreasing land, air, and water pollution as well as the release of harmful greenhouse gases like methane. Secondly, recycling conserves natural resources, such as trees, water, and minerals. When we recycle paper, for instance, fewer trees need to be cut down for pulp production, which in turn helps combat deforestation, maintain ecosystems, and support biodiversity. Additionally, recycling conserves energy as the amount required to produce new products from raw materials is significantly higher than what is needed to process recycled materials. This energy-saving aspect benefits the environment and contributes to the reduction of our carbon footprint. Moreover, by adopting the habit of using the recycling bin, we foster the growth of the circular economy. In a circular economy, resources are continuously reused, reducing the need for new resources extraction. The practice of recycling extends the life cycle of products and materials, creating new job opportunities in industries like waste management, remanufacturing, and recycling. Furthermore, recycling plays a paramount role in mitigating climate change, as it reduces the energy consumption and greenhouse gas emissions associated with resource extraction, refining, and processing. By recycling, we indirectly decrease our dependency on fossil fuels, consequently curbing the emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful pollutants. In conclusion, the habit of using the recycling bin over the trash can is a crucial one to adopt, as it encourages waste reduction, conserves natural resources, supports the circular economy, and helps combat climate change. By making this simple yet impactful lifestyle adjustment, we can all partake in creating a more sustainable and healthier environment for ourselves and future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Investoinnit ovat taloudellisen toiminnan keskeinen osa, ja niillä voi olla laaja-alainen vaikutus koko talouteen ja yhteiskuntaan. Tässä tapauksessa on mainittu, että sijoitukset vähenevät tai keskeytyvät takaisin vuoden 1996 tasolle, mikä tarkoittaa, että investointimäärät laskevat merkittävästi verrattuna nykyisiin tasoihin. Tällainen muutos voi vaikuttaa negatiivisesti talouden kasvuun ja aiheuttaa muita taloudellisia ja yhteiskunnallisia haasteita. Investointien vähentyessä yritykset ja yksityiset sijoittajat voivat olla vähemmän halukkaita laajentamaan liiketoimintaansa tai luomaan uusia työpaikkoja. Tämä voi vaikuttaa työttömyysasteisiin ja saattaa vaarantaa taloudellista hyvinvointia laajemmalti. Myös julkinen sektori voi joutua tarkistamaan investointitarpeitaan julkisten palvelujen rahoittamiseksi. Investointien leikkaukset voivat pakottaa hallituksen ottamaan käyttöön säästötoimenpiteitä, jotka voivat heikentää julkisten palvelujen laatua, kuten koulutusta, terveydenhuoltoa ja infrastruktuuria. Sijoitusten vähenemisen taustalla voi olla monia syitä. Esimerkiksi talouskriisi, poliittinen epävarmuus tai muut haasteet voivat vaikuttaa sijoittajien luottamukseen ja riskinottohalukkuuteen. Mikäli investointien leikkaukset tai keskeytyminen on tilapäistä, talous voi toipua ja palautua ajan myötä. Kuitenkin pitkään jatkuva investointien vähentyminen voi aiheuttaa talouden pysähtymisen ja heikentää yhteiskunnan elintasoa.

Can you tell me the answer to what is the term for the regions of the plant where leaves are attached to the stem??","completion":"The term for the regions of a plant where leaves are attached to the stem is called a \\"node.\\" A node is a specific point on a plant's stem where various structures, primarily leaves, emerge and connect to the stem. Nodes play a significant role in the overall structure, development, and growth of plants. On the plant stem, nodes can be found at different intervals. Between two nodes, there is a section of the stem called an \\"internode,\\" which is devoid of any leaves or buds. The length of the internodes helps dictate the overall growth pattern and appearance of the plant. Some plants have closely spaced nodes with short internodes, resulting in a bushy, dense appearance, while others have widely spaced nodes with long internodes, which give the plant a more spread-out and sparse look. Nodes are essential in transporting essential nutrients and water from the roots through the stem and up to the leaves. They contain vascular tissue, including xylem and phloem, which facilitate the transfer of water, minerals, and sugars throughout the plant. Furthermore, nodes are the primary sites for the initiation of lateral branching in plants. Depending on the species, the angle between the primary stem and the lateral branch (also referred to as the axil) can vary greatly. Axillary buds form in the axil of a leaf and have the potential to develop into lateral branches or specialized structures like flowers. This pattern of alternating nodes and internodes continues along the stem's length, depending on the growth pattern and requirements of the specific plant species. Additionally, nodes are significant in asexual reproduction for certain types of plants. Some plants can grow entirely new plants from sections of stem, called cuttings, containing at least one node. These cuttings are often used by gardeners and horticulture professionals to propagate plants without the need for seeds. In conclusion, nodes are critical structures on a plant's stem, responsible for leaf attachment, nutrient transportation, lateral branching, and potential asexual reproduction. They enable plants to grow, develop, and adapt to their environments, fulfilling various essential functions within their life cycle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Leaders in other cities said they don't want a repeat of that chaos, but it's unclear how they will eventually oust protesters who refuse to leave. Even in Los Angeles, where city leaders have greeted the demonstrators warmly, there are signs of protest fatigue and increasing anxiety about what happens next. , who earlier this month had ponchos distributed to rain-soaked Occupy L.A. protesters, said Wednesday that the encampment next to City Hall \\"cannot continue indefinitely.\\" Villaraigosa has instructed city officials to draft a plan for another location for the demonstration. He decided the camp could not stay after Los Angeles County health inspectors expressed worries about the cleanliness of the camp, and because of concerns about the condition of the lawn and trees. \\"Look, our lawn is dead, our sprinklers aren't working . . . our trees are without water,\\" the mayor said. Los Angeles City Atty. Carmen Trutanich, meanwhile, said police should enforce an existing law that keeps people from camping in city parks after 10:30 p.m. since they enforce it elsewhere. Among City Hall staffers, there is ridicule about the protesters' cleanliness and resentment that a weekly farmers market — usually held on the City Hall lawn — has been forced to move. On the East Coast, where the began in September and have since spread to many cities, the approach of winter could curtail the camp-outs dramatically. Here in the more temperate West, they could theoretically continue year-round. Los Angeles police officials said they have no plans to move the protesters out. \\"We're still working as best we can and trying to be cooperative,\\" said Cmdr. Andrew Smith. He said police have a contingency plan to clear out protesters if they have to, but said if police are forced to evict protesters they would take pains to avoid the tear gas used by police in Oakland. About a dozen protesters showed up at Wednesday's City Council meeting to ask lawmakers to allow them to stay. Protester Alex Everett, 26, said he came because he was alarmed at calls for the demonstrators to move on. Everett, who moved into a tent outside of City Hall two weeks ago, said protesters would not leave without a fight. He said there may be violence if police move in to clear out the protest. would take a less confrontational tack than Oakland police \\"for public relations purposes,\\" especially as the city tries to woo an Protesters are expressing similar resolve at encampments across the country. In Lower Manhattan where the Occupy movement began, protesters show no signs of closing shop even as the weather gets colder. After battling back a city plan to clear out Zuccotti Park earlier this month, protesters have been trying to make the occupation more palatable to neighbors, who have complained about incessant drumming and urination in the streets. The local community board voted this week to support the movement, but to also limit \\"sources of noise\\" to two hours a day and to arrange for the protesters to have access to bathrooms. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text are: 1. Officials are considering moving the Occupy movement protesters from their encampments in parks and public squares, as the activists show no signs of leaving voluntarily. There is concern about a possible repetition of riots and chaos similar to what happened in Oakland, where police arrested 100 protesters, which then prompted backlash in the form of an even larger protest later in the day. The authorities aim to avoid such unrest by finding other means to address the issue. 2. In Los Angeles, even though city leaders initially supported the demonstrators, Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa stated that the encampment near City Hall could not continue indefinitely. He cited health and cleanliness concerns, as well as the damage to the lawn and trees in the area. The mayor instructed city officials to find an alternative location for the protest. 3. Los Angeles City Attorney Carmen Trutanich suggested enforcing an existing law that forbids camping in city parks after 10:30 p.m. 4. While the approach of winter might reduce the number of protesters in the colder cities on the East Coast, the more temperate climate of the West could allow encampments to continue year-round. 5. Protesters resist the idea of being relocated and have expressed their resolve to stay at encampments across the country. In some cases, like in Lower Manhattan, they are trying to improve relations with local communities by addressing noise and sanitation issues. 6. There is concern among some protesters that attempts to remove them from their current locations could result in violence or a standoff with police, similar to the situation in Oakland."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In dieser Hinsicht ist es wichtig, den Hintergrund und die Ziele der LEADER-Initiativen zu verstehen, um die Bedeutung der Kofinanzierung und die Notwendigkeit einer effektiven öffentlichen Finanzverwaltung zu erkennen. LEADER ist ein Akronym für \\"Liaison Entre Actions de Développement de l'Économie Rurale\\" und ist ein Programm der Europäischen Union, das darauf abzielt, die wirtschaftliche Entwicklung in ländlichen Gebieten zu fördern. Der Schwerpunkt liegt dabei auf der lokalen Partizipation und der Zusammenarbeit zwischen verschiedenen Akteuren in einer Region. LEADER-II ist die zweite Phase dieses Programms und wurde in den 1990er Jahren ins Leben gerufen. Diese Initiative zielt darauf ab, die Zusammenarbeit und den Austausch von Erfahrungen, Wissen und bewährten Praktiken zwischen ländlichen Gebieten in verschiedenen Mitgliedstaaten zu fördern. Dazu wurde ein Rahmen für Kofinanzierung geschaffen, der es ermöglicht, Projekte in Zusammenarbeit mit lokalen Partnern und Organisationen zu entwickeln und umzusetzen. In Anbetracht dieser Ziele ist es von entscheidender Bedeutung, dass die finanzielle Verwaltung öffentlicher Mittel in den Mitgliedstaaten effektiv und transparent gestaltet ist, um eine erfolgreiche Kofinanzierung der LEADER-II-Initiativen zu gewährleisten. Die Europäische Kommission will jedoch die Souveränität und die interne Organisation der einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten respektieren und sich daher nicht in die Finanzverwaltung der öffentlichen Mittel einmischen.

Zusammenfassend zeigt sich, dass die Kofinanzierung der LEADER-II-Initiativen eine wichtige Rolle bei der Erreichung der Ziele der ländlichen Entwicklung in den Mitgliedstaaten spielt. Es ist daher unerlässlich, dass die öffentlichen Finanzen effizient verwaltet werden und gleichzeitig die interne Organisation und die Souveränität der Mitgliedstaaten gewahrt bleiben.

Summarize: Team Sky rider Froome - who led by 12 seconds overnight - broke away with 6.4km left of the first summit finish of this year's race to win emphatically in La Pierre-Saint-Martin. Richie Porte was second, 59 seconds back, with Nairo Quintana third. Tejay van Garderen lies second overall, two minutes 52 seconds behind Froome. Colombian Quintana, a highly regarded climber, had been widely expected to launch a major attack in an attempt to claw back time but he was overtaken by Porte in the final metres of a stage that was nigh on perfect for Team Sky. It was the fifth stage win of 2013 champion Froome's Tour de France career and puts the 30-year-old in a commanding position with 11 stages remaining. All of his main rivals lost significant time on a devastating afternoon, with Quintana now three minutes nine seconds behind in the overall standings, Alberto Contador four minutes four seconds back and defending champion Vincenzo Nibali a massive six minutes 57 seconds adrift of the Team Sky rider. \\"I'm lost for words,\\" said Froome, who was in the news overnight after it was revealed Team Sky believe their computers have been hacked by critics convinced he is using performance-enhancing drugs. \\"I could not believe it when I asked the guys to push on a bit and we were hearing on the radio about the big names being dropped. It was textbook from the team and I'm just over the moon to finish it off for them.\\" Froome could not have made a more decisive statement of his intent to claim his second Tour victory. He sat in with his Team Sky team-mates while Quintana's Movistar team made the early pace up the 15km climb towards the finish. A blistering rate soon saw riders disappearing out of the back of the leading groups, while at one point Froome appeared uncomfortable as he hung on at the back of a team-mate's wheel. But that proved to be nothing more than a ruse, and when Froome made his explosive move there was nothing anybody could do to stay with him - although Quintana's efforts were enough to see him take the white jersey worn by the race's best young rider. The only danger to the Briton appeared to come from fans as they closed in around him on some of the steeper sections of the climb up the Cote de Cauterets, but they soon cleared and he powered to a potentially decisive finish in this year's race. Media playback is not supported on this device Froome's Team Sky team-mate Geraint Thomas is now in fifth place overall after finishing sixth on the stage while fellow Briton Adam Yates crossed the line in seventh after a strong ride up the mountain. \\"The plan was to sit behind Movistar and see how many riders we had left,\\" explained Thomas afterwards. \\"We had four and we all felt good. Froomey said on the radio that he felt good so let's smash it. Personally I felt great and for the team it was even better.\\" It was Bastille Day in France and the first true day of racing in the mountains as the Tour resumed after Monday's rest day. There was a lengthy breakaway involving Cofidis's Kenneth Vanbilsen and Bretagne Seche Environment's Pierrick Fedrigo that lasted most of the 167km stage, but which was never going to make it up the final climb. Vanbilsen picked up all available points at the three category four climbs but with 50 points for the stage winner, Froome now tops the King of the Mountains classification, although second-placed Porte will wear the polka dot jersey on Wednesday. There was also a change in the points classification for the Tour's leading sprinter, with Andre Greipel overhauling Peter Sagan to reclaim the green jersey after the in-form German took third at the day's intermediate sprint. More drama could follow on Wednesday when the race continues in the Pyrenees with a 188km stage that includes the infamous Col du Tourmalet climb. BBC Sport's Matt Slater: \\"July 14 is when France celebrates the revolutionary storming of a notorious prison, the Bastille; today it was the moment Chris Froome's revolutions probably locked up the yellow jersey for a second time in three years. \\"This was a devastating win for Froome and Team Sky, with Grand Tour champions and challengers scattered all over the road up to La Pierre-Saint-Martin. We knew he and his comrades were going well but this was something else. \\"What that something is will of course now be the subject of fierce debate. Froome's critics are convinced he is cheating and they claim they have the data to prove it. \\"His supporters, however, say those numbers only prove he is a special athlete who has got even better with hard work, careful eating and great coaching.

Passengers on board an easyJet flight from Gatwick, England, to Verona, Italy, on April 23 became the surprise audience for an inflight performance of Shakespeare's plays. Verona is a principal setting for Shakespeare's \\"Romeo and Juliet.\\" The hour-long performance -- hosted by the airline as part of a campaign to have April 23 officially recognized as National Shakespeare Day -- was put on by actors from the Reduced Shakespeare Company. (Shakespeare fans argue over April 23 or April 26 as his exact birthday.) See a short video of the performance here. The plane had also been emblazoned with a portrait of the playwright. Armed with props and costumes, three actors paraded the aisle while running through abridged versions of every comedy and tragedy penned by the Bard. \\"We hope to set a new Guinness World Record ... for the highest ever theatrical performance,\\" said easyJet communications director Paul Moore in a statement. As a testament to the troupe's entertaining performance, no crotchety complaints seem to have appeared (yet) on social media about lost sleep. \\"Certainly, this was the most entertaining flight I have ever taken. It was a fabulous performance and great for the children,\\" passenger Simon Cureton told Portsmouth News. While the airline has taken its Shakespeare Day campaign seriously, throwing free performances at airports, emblazoning the playwright on plane livery and promoting the best Shakespearean destinations in its inflight magazine, the campaign has a long way to go. The petition had 729 signatures at the time of writing. If it hits 100,000, it will be considered by the House of Commons Backbench Business Committee. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Article:","completion":"Title: Rory McIlroy Chooses Ireland over Great Britain for the 2016 Olympic Games Article: Four-time major champion, Rory McIlroy, has made the decision to represent Ireland instead of Great Britain at the upcoming 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro. The Northern Irish golfer has been caught in a dilemma when it comes to choosing which team to play for, but McIlroy ultimately decided to represent his homeland, not wanting to disappoint his legion of fans from both Northern Ireland and the Republic. The decision made by the 32-year-old golfer has garnered considerable support, with one notable endorsement coming from Team GB's golf coach, Jamie Spence. According to Spence, McIlroy's decision to side with Team Ireland is a commendable one, as it showcases the golfer's loyalty and commitment to his roots. The Northern Irishman, who has spent a significant portion of his professional career on both the European and PGA Tours, had been weighing his options for quite some time. It was a persuasive argument made by his compatriot, Graeme McDowell, that ultimately swayed McIlroy's decision. McDowell highlighted the importance of representing their homeland, stating that it is an honor to don the national colors and showcase the talent that originates from their small island nation on the global stage. With McIlroy committing to Ireland, the current Team GB lineup will feature two of England's finest golfers, Justin Rose and Luke Donald. Rose, a former US Open champion and world number one, will lead the team with an impressive track record, having secured a victory at the 2013 US Open and a gold medal at the 2016 Olympics, marking the first Olympic gold in golf since 1904. Luke Donald, on the other hand, is a five-time PGA Tour winner and former world number one, making him a strong contender to represent Great Britain in the upcoming games. While McIlroy's decision to represent Ireland has garnered support from his peers and golf enthusiasts alike, it also highlights the unique challenges faced by athletes from Northern Ireland when it comes to national representation in global events. With Northern Irish athletes being able to choose between representing Great Britain or Ireland, athletes often find themselves at the center of a delicate balancing act. Nevertheless, Rory McIlroy's choice to play for Ireland at the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro should be seen as an opportunity for the golfer to connect with his roots and represent his homeland in one of the world's most prestigious sporting events. Golf fans across the globe will surely be keeping a close eye on McIlroy's performance, as he seeks to bring glory home to the Emerald Isle with a potential Olympic gold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear.

News article: You can bet left-wing activists are going to call for a boycott Under Armour now. On Tuesday, Under Armour CEO Kevin Plank was effusive in his praise of President Donald Trump in an interview on CNBC. Plank commended the president, saying “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country.” Going further, Plank alluded to Trump’s plan for the wall: “He wants to build things. He wants to make bold decisions and be really decisive.” The CEO liked this action, he said, because he is “a big fan of people that operate in the world of ‘publish and iterate’ versus ‘think, think, think, think, think.” It won’t be long before liberals attempt to shame people into silencing Plank and his business. Since Trump was elected in November, they have gone after brands like New Balance and L.L. Bean for their support of the nation’s leader. We’ll have to see if any lefties post videos of themselves burning their Under Armour clothing, like they did with New Balance. For some reason, it seems unlikely that many of these social media warriors own much sports apparel to begin with. This is a good time for people who don’t oppose our president to show their appreciation of Under Armour’s respect for President Trump.

Plank, in a CNBC interview on Tuesday, lauded Trump’s business acumen. His comments started a #BoycottUnderArmour trend on Twitter and surprised Warriors star Stephen Curry, one of the company’s primary athlete endorsers. Plank and Under Armour clarified Plank’s meaning. “To have such a pro-business president is something that is a real asset for the country,” Plank said. “People can really grab that opportunity.” “At Under Armour, our culture has always been about optimism, teamwork, and unity. We have engaged with both the prior and the current administrations in advocating on business issues that we believe are in the best interests of our consumers, teammates, and shareholders. Kevin Plank was recently invited at the request of the President of the United States, to join the American Manufacturing Council as part of a distinguished group of business leaders. He joined CEOs from companies such as Dow Chemical, Dell, Ford, GE and Tesla, among others to begin an important dialogue around creating jobs in America. We believe it is important for Under Armour to be a part of that discussion. “We have always been committed to developing innovative ways to support and invest in American jobs and manufacturing. For years, Under Armour has had a long-term strategy for domestic manufacturing and we recently launched our first women’s collection made in our hometown of Baltimore, MD. We are incredibly proud of this important first step in the evolution of creating more jobs at home. “We engage in policy, not politics. We believe in advocating for fair trade, an inclusive immigration policy that welcomes the best and the brightest and those seeking opportunity in the great tradition of our country, and tax reform that drives hiring to help create new jobs globally, across America and in Baltimore. “We have teammates from different religions, races, nationalities, genders and sexual orientations; different ages, life experiences and opinions. This is the core of our company. At Under Armour, our diversity is our strength, and we will continue to advocate for policies that Protect Our House, our business, our team, and our community.” ||||| Once again, Stephen Curry has found himself in the middle of a political issue.

Related Articles Under Armour’s full statement after CEO’s praise of Trump causes controversy Q&A with Stephen Curry: Under Armour, Donald Trump, his own political voice In an exclusive interview Wednesday, Curry did what he doesn’t like to do — talk politics — but is clearly getting comfortable doing. His stance was much the same when his vague comments about the controversial North Carolina bill drew the ire of some in the LGBTQ community: where he stands is clear per his track record. He thought he was sure where Plank stood based on his track record. So Curry, one of the most popular endorsers of Under Armour products, said he was surprised to see the CEO praising Trump. “I spent all day yesterday on the phone,” Curry said, “with countless people at Under Armour, countless people in Kevin Plank’s camp, my team, trying to understand what was going on and where everybody stood on the issue. Based off the release that KP sent out this morning, and what he told me last night, that’s the Under Armour that I know. That’s the brand I know he’s built and one that, as of Wednesday afternoon, is something that I’m standing on.” Plank explained his stance to Curry on Tuesday, how his comments were meant exclusively from a business perspective. He distanced himself from Trump’s controversial policies and comments that have enranged women, Muslims, Mexicans, African-Americans and the impoverished across the nation. On Wednesday, Under Armour released a statement that explained Plank was part of a collaboration of private industry powers putting their brains together to effect change.

Curry, who has a contract with Under Armour that runs through 2024, said Plank working with Trump isn’t a deal-breaker for him.. He is more concerned about Under Armour adopting Trump’s values, he said. “It’s a fine line but it’s about how we’re operating,” Curry said, “how inclusive we are, what we stand for. He’s the President. There are going to be people that are tied to them. But are we promoting change? Are we doing things that are going to look out for everybody? And not being so self-serving that it’s only about making money, selling shoes, doing this and that. That’s not the priority. It’s about changing lives. I think we can continue to do that.” But would Curry really leave Under Armour, the company that helped launch his empire, if he didn’t like the direction of the company? “If there is a situation where I can look at myself in the mirror and say they don’t have my best intentions, they don’t have the right attitude about taking care of people,” Curry said. “If I can say the leadership is not in line with my core values, then there is no amount of money, there is no platform I wouldn’t jump off if it wasn’t in line with who I am. So that’s a decision I will make every single day when I wake up. If something is not in line with what I’m about, then, yeah, I definitely need to take a stance in that respect.” Curry said he and Plank don’t talk politics and he doesn’t have interest in doing so. His relationship with Under Armour is a business relationship and his primary concern is carrying out his own mission. However, he made it clear he did not vote for Trump and is against several of Trump’s actions. “I feel like if you know who I am, you know what I stand for, and I can live with that,” Curry said. “I feel when you see my name, when you see people wearing my stuff, when you see anybody attached to me, that they share that same passion for people that I do. And that’s what I’ve been really serious about using this platform to share. I don’t get in people’s faces and out in the streets with a bullhorn doing it that way. But every opportunity I have to show love, to show respect, to show just that positivity, I feel like that’s my job and that’s what I stand for.” ||||| Plank: We are a team that knows how to win 3:22 PM ET Tue, 7 Feb 2017 | 01:09 Wall Street critics should consider Under Armour's track record of success before counting it out, CEO Kevin Plank told CNBC.

Shares of Under Amour have taken a beating after the sportswear company reported lower-than-expected quarterly sales — its second disappointing quarter in a row. It also announced that its chief financial officer, Chip Molloy, will step down. The news initially wiped a quarter off the company's market value. In midday trading Tuesday, Class A shares were little changed, while Class C shares were about 1 percent lower. Both sets of shares have declined more than 30 percent in the past three months. (12-month performance of Under Armour Class A shares; Source: FactSet) The company's sales were hurt by intense competition and slowing growth in North America. Under Armour's net revenue rose about 12 percent to 1.31 billion, its slowest sales growth in eight years. Under Amour also said its CFO is leaving for personal reasons, but did not elaborate. Molloy had joined the company last January. On Tuesday, Plank said even though the company lost one of its key players, he is confident in the progress of his executive team. \\"We've got an executive team that is robust and full and the same people that got us here. One of the lessons that we learned and we know, you ask is this the end? No this is not the end,\\" he said. In order for the company to progress it has to change its narrative, Plank said. \\"We have a growth company. You'll never hear us not say that. Current outlook has double digit growth which is close to industry in the sector leading among the leaders there. Our business is so young, our business is really just getting started,\\" he said. \\"This company throws punches. That's what we do and it's how we continue to expect to be able to run again,\\" he said. \\"But there are tweaks. This is not to say the world is rosy.\\" Plank also mentioned his meeting with President Donald Trump to discuss jobs in U.S. Plank described Trump as \\"highly passionate\\" and a pro-business man who is a \\"real asset\\" for U.S. companies. Last month, Plank said in a speech that \\"We should be bringing jobs back, not just to America, but tightening supply chains all over the world. We have the ability to do it better.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the fifteen-year-old who auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing? is inside the article: In March 1957, John Lennon, then aged sixteen, formed a skiffle group with several friends from Quarry Bank High School in Liverpool. They briefly called themselves the Blackjacks, before changing their name to the Quarrymen after discovering that a respected local group was already using the other name. Fifteen-year-old Paul McCartney joined them as a rhythm guitarist shortly after he and Lennon met that July. In February 1958, McCartney invited his friend George Harrison to watch the band. The fifteen-year-old auditioned for Lennon, impressing him with his playing, but Lennon initially thought Harrison was too young for the band. After a month of Harrison's persistence, during a second meeting (arranged by McCartney), he performed the lead guitar part of the instrumental song \\"Raunchy\\" on the upper deck of a Liverpool bus, and they enlisted him as their lead guitarist.By January 1959, Lennon's Quarry Bank friends had left the group, and he began his studies at the Liverpool College of Art. The three guitarists, billing themselves at least three times as Johnny and the Moondogs, were playing rock and roll whenever they could find a drummer. Lennon's art school friend Stuart Sutcliffe, who had just sold one of his paintings and was persuaded to purchase a bass guitar, joined in January 1960, and it was he who suggested changing the band's name to Beatals, as a tribute to Buddy Holly and the Crickets. They used this name until May, when they became the Silver Beetles, before undertaking a brief tour of Scotland as the backing group for pop singer and fellow Liverpudlian Johnny Gentle. By early July, they had refashioned themselves as the Silver Beatles, and by the middle of August shortened the name to The Beatles.Allan Williams, the Beatles' unofficial manager, arranged a residency for them in Hamburg, but lacking a full-time drummer they auditioned and hired Pete Best in mid-August 1960.

That is one possible reason for a number of encounters in the San Francisco Bay Area recently, where motorists in Stinson Beach and Bolinas have complained about coyotes chasing passing cars, snapping at tires, and even bringing traffic to a halt. Some now believe that the behavior may be caused by the ingestion of the fly amanita mushroom. “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” an anonymous commuter told The Pacific Sun. The fly amanita is a poisonous mushroom with hallucinogenic properties that are commonly consumed by coyotes and dogs. Looking much like the classic toadstool, the fly amanita can cause a wide variety of psychedelic effects when ingested and is taken as a recreational drug in many countries. However, the mushroom must first be parboiled before it can be eaten safely. As a result, most dogs or coyotes that eat the mushroom suffer from the effects of poisoning, such as vomiting and nausea. In worst cases, canines who consume the mushroom will experience seizures, bleeding, liver failure, and ultimately death. The psychedelic effects of the mushroom on canines are not well-documented, but experts say that they can be especially excitable after consumption. That fits with the accounts given by drivers on Highway 1, who say that the coyotes have been acting stranger than normal. Most healthy coyotes, as with any other animal with a keen self-preservation instinct, do not dart in and out of traffic trying to bite cars. The psychedelic mushrooms are just one theory, and not exactly the most plausible. Since the hallucinogenic properties of the mushrooms only last temporarily, it may not explain why the coyote encounters have been reported for weeks. Experts with a local animal shelter said that alternate explanations include rabies, which is also unlikely, or that motorists have simply been feeding the coyotes. Feeding any wild animal, least of all a dangerous predator, is never advised.

The attacks are weird enough that one seemingly outlandish explanation, that the coyotes are eating hallucinogenic mushrooms and vision questing their way into interactions with drivers, is being considered. A report in the Pacific Sun details the late-night encounters had by numerous motorists. \\"A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway,\\" notes the paper, \\"before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle.\\" “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold,” one driver told the Sun. Experts aren't sure what's behind the abnormal behavior, but they are sure of one thing: It's not rabies. It seems that the attacks have been going on for a period of time longer than an animal infected with the virus could be expected to live. Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the Marin Humane Society, told the Sun that \\"[if] this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” The attacks have been reportedly occurring for the past three weeks. “We are trying to figure this out,” Bloch helpfully informs us. The Sun notes that the fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) grows in the area and has hallucinogenic properties, and that Bloch recently warned residents about the possible side effects of their pets eating the wild fungus. Bloch, for her part, suggested a more prosaic possibility: Drivers have been feeding the coyotes from their cars. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand,” she explained. Which, when we consider that this is Bolinas we're talking about, seems in the end the likeliest of explanations.

It’s all the talk at Beth’s Community Kitchen in Bolinas and elsewhere: A coyote has taken to staring down automobile drivers as they drive through this twisting, turning section of highway, before attacking the car and then skulking off back into the wilderness. The coyote runs up to the cars, usually at night, forcing drivers to stop as the beast stares and sniffs around the vehicle. The coyote “attacks” have happened a bunch of times, to enough people, to warrant calls to figure out what’s going on with the animal. Or, animals, as the latest grist out of Bolinas has it that there are now two coyotes acting a little weird, or a lot weird: Drive-by coyote stare-downs have now become part of the normative experience for a Bolinas-based individual who makes numerous nighttime airport runs every week. We are not identifying this individual, who fears retribution at the vengeful paws of these bushy-tailed beasts. He would only say, “It’s a terrifying, yet beautiful thing to behold.” The Marin Humane Society has fielded at least one inquiry from a coyote-concerned citizen and is looking into the case of the aggressive coyote, says Lisa Bloch, director of marketing and communications for the society. “We are trying to figure this out.” There are three possible scenarios to explain the behavior, ranging from least probable, kind of fun to consider and most probable. The least probable problem with the coyote, or coyotes, is rabies. This sort of “Old Yeller” type of aggression usually comes at the end-stage of the disease, the “terror stage” or “zombie stage” of rabies, at which point the animal is going to die, Bloch says. These coyote attacks have been going on for at least three weeks. If it were rabies, Bloch says, the coyote would likely be dead by now. “If this is going on longer than a week or so, then it’s likely not rabies. And we don’t suspect rabies, just because it is pretty rare.” Whew, it’s not rabies. It is possible, but not probable, that the coyote has eaten something—perhaps a fly agaric mushroom (amanita muscaria) which has hallucinogenic properties—and has subsequently been tripping its tail off. The cars would therefore be some sort of coyote vision, a dark vision of human interlopers, who must be stopped before the rents get any higher in West Marin. That would be kind of cool. Bloch could not completely rule out the possibility that coyotes are having psychedelic experiences out on the feral fringes of civilization, and in fact she has been counseling dog owners of late on the dangers of poisonous mushrooms in our midst. Coyotes hold a special, spiritual place for many a West Marin resident and Bloch urges those of a coyote persuasion to keep a safe distance from the beast of lore. The animals were eradicated in these parts through the 1950s because of their deleterious impact on cattle, but now that they’re back in force—yip-yip, you need to give the beasts some space. The state estimates that there are between 250,000 and 750,000 coyotes in California. Bloch notes that while the animals are native to the county, “there were not coyotes in Marin for decades” because of a United States Department of Agriculture program that completely annihilated the Marin-based population. “When you indiscriminately kill predators, you are messing with the ecosystem.” Coyotes’ staple diet is mice, and that can get kind of monotonous, especially in a county of such rich, sustainable culinary pleasures. Which brings us to the likeliest scenario to explain what the heck those coyotes are doing up there on Highway 1 attacking cars. Camilla Fox, who founded the organization Project Coyote (projectcoyote.org) is responsible for signs that pop up around West Marin trailheads that say: “A fed coyote is a dead coyote.” The message is: Don’t feed the freaking coyotes. “If there are bad apples out there who are feeding the coyotes, they need to stop,” says Fox. “They can be cited—there’s a law that was specifically enacted to stop people from feeding wildlife.” “One possibility is that the coyote has been fed, and this is a real problem for us in Marin,” Bloch says. “It’s possible that someone was feeding him and thinking that it’s cool, and magical and mystical to have a coyote eating out of his hand.” Or, some dingbats might simply have thrown some baloney out the window in the direction of a coyote, who dutifully scarfed the meat and now wants more where that came from. Animals start acting super-aggressive, Bloch says, once the food-proffering hand has been introduced. So don’t do that, and instead understand that a fed coyote is a dead coyote. “What this means is that basically we want the animals to be afraid of us naturally,” Bloch says. “If they are not afraid of us, they come close to our cars, get hit, fight with domestic dogs and can possibly become aggressive.” The problem for coyotes is that if they turn aggressive, “the coyote is going to be blamed if a dog or, god forbid, a person is mauled.” The only recourse then is to kill the coyote. Bloch is a Tam Valley resident who says the neighbors can and should do a better job at keeping their property coyote-resistant, to limit such unwelcome outcomes. “It’s very frustrating to me—there are lots of coyotes all around, but people are leaving pet food out, small animals are roaming off leash, the cats are out. It’s an easy meal for a coyote.” The Humane Society is working the coyote-chase-car problem, Bloch says, and is asking for the public’s help—if anyone has seen the stare-down coyote near Slide Ranch, give them a holler. “We encourage people to report it right away if they see any kind of behaviors, any wildlife acting strangely, biting the tires of a car. We would go and check it out.” If the Humane Society locates the coyote or coyotes and discovers that they are injured in any way, its next stop would be at the animal rescue operation WildCare in San Rafael. But the Humane Society prefers any option that helps them save the animal while not trapping it—such as when a deer recently found itself in Bolinas Lagoon, like so many DUI drivers before it. “We pulled it out of the lagoon and once we determined the deer was OK, we led it to a quiet place so it could recover on its own.” That would be the preferred scenario for the coyote now menacing traffic on Highway 1. If the animal winds up at WildCare, “It’s not going back into nature,” Bloch says. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Coyotes in the San Francisco Bay Area have been displaying unusual behavior, such as chasing passing cars and snapping at tires. One theory suggests that the ingestion of fly amanita mushrooms, which have hallucinogenic properties, may be causing these actions. However, this theory is not the most plausible, as the hallucinogenic effects are temporary and the encounters with strange-acting coyotes have been reported for several weeks.

The activated track leave once an application warns acoustically and also provides visual turn by turn What is the correctly punctuated version of this sentence?","completion":"\\"The activated track leaves once an application warns acoustically, and also provides visual, turn-by-turn.\\" Step 1: The sentence seemed confusing at first, so I broke it down into simpler components to comprehend it better. The main subjects here are \\"the activated track,\\" \\"an application,\\" and the actions related with these subjects. Step 2: After breaking down the sentence, I noticed that an important action is that the \\"activated track\\" is doing something (leaves) which happens when the application does two things: warns acoustically and provides visual, turn-by-turn. This breakdown helps us understand the sentence better. Step 3: Now, to represent these actions more clearly, I need to use punctuation. The first logical break in the sentence comes after \\"acoustically,\\" and it needs a comma to separate it from the next part of the sentence. This comma helps to highlight that the application is doing two distinct things. Step 4: Another place where punctuation is needed is after \\"visual.\\" This will create a pause needed before saying \\"turn-by-turn,\\" which in this context is used as an adjective to describe how the application provides visuals. The commas around \\"turn-by-turn\\" treat it as an appositive — additional, non-essential information — while also setting off the list of actions that the application does, which makes the sentence clearer. Step 5: With these commas included, the sentence now reads as: \\"The activated track leaves once an application warns acoustically, and also provides visual, turn-by-turn.\\" The punctuation helps divide the sentence into more manageable segments, thereby making its meaning easier to understand."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What did Moore do instead of using a machine when asked to reproduce The Virgin and Child? After the Great War, Moore received an ex-serviceman's grant to continue his education and in 1919 he became a student at the Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also had access to the modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum. The student sculptures of both Moore and Hepworth followed the standard romantic Victorian style, and included natural forms, landscapes and figurative modelling of animals. Moore later became uncomfortable with classically derived ideals; his later familiarity with primitivism and the influence of sculptors such as Constantin Brâncuși, Jacob Epstein, Henri Gaudier-Brzeska and Frank Dobson led him to the method of direct carving, in which imperfections in the material and marks left by tools became part of the finished sculpture. Having adopted this technique, Moore was in conflict with academic tutors who did not appreciate such a modern approach. During one exercise set by Derwent Wood (the professor of sculpture at the Royal College), Moore was asked to reproduce a marble relief of Domenico Rosselli's The Virgin and Child by first modelling the relief in plaster, then reproducing it in marble using the mechanical aid known as a \\"pointing machine\\", a technique called \\"pointing\\". Instead, he carved the relief directly, even marking the surface to simulate the prick marks that would have been left by the pointing...

Process: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen - The oxygen can then reach the cells within the tissue - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose exercising more heavily happens, how will it affect \\"less oxygen being brought to the bodys cells\\". Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Exercising more heavily does indeed have an effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the body's cells. When the body is engaged in vigorous physical activity, the demand for oxygen increases, as more energy is required to be produced by cells, specifically in the muscles. To meet this increased need for oxygen, several adaptations occur within the body's systems: 1. Breathing rate and depth increase: This ensures that more air rich in oxygen is taken in and more carbon dioxide is expelled from the body. The increased rate of breathing can help transport a larger volume of oxygen to the lungs than during a resting state. 2. Heart rate increases: The cardiovascular system responds to the increased demand for oxygen by increasing the heart rate. With an elevated heart rate, blood flow is accelerated, allowing more oxygen to be supplied to the working muscles and tissues in a shorter period of time. 3. Red blood cell delivery of oxygen is enhanced: When exercising, the red blood cells carrying oxygen are diverted to the working muscles, prioritizing their oxygen needs over less-active tissues. 4. Enhanced capillary density in muscles: Regular exercise can result in an increase in the number of capillaries in the muscles, allowing for more efficient oxygen and nutrient delivery to muscle cells as well as waste removal. This adaptation can better meet the increased oxygen requirements during heavy exercise. 5. Improved oxygen extraction: When exercising, the body can become more efficient at extracting oxygen from the blood, allowing for an increased amount of oxygen to be utilized by the cells. To summarize, when exercising more heavily, the body undergoes several adaptations to ensure that sufficient oxygen is provided to the body's cells, despite the increased demand. These adaptations involve changes in breathing, heart rate, blood flow, capillary density, and oxygen extraction efficiency. As a result, less oxygen being brought to the body's cells is not a direct consequence of heavy exercise — in fact, the body compensates to ensure that sufficient oxygen is supplied to meet increased energy demands."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The actual dimensions of so-called Langstroth frames differ by region or manufacturer. These modern Langstroth hives have little in common with Rev. L. L. Langstroth's bee hive that was originally patented in 1852 and manufactured until approximately 1920. - Clostridium botulinum is a Gram-positive, rod-shaped, anaerobic, spore-forming, motile bacterium with the ability to produce the neurotoxin botulinum. The botulinum toxin can cause a severe flaccid paralytic disease in humans and other animals and is the most potent toxin known to mankind, natural or synthetic, with a lethal dose of 1.32.1 ng/kg in humans. - A honey super is a part of a commercial or other managed ( such as by a hobbyist ) beehive that is used to collect honey . The most common variety is the \`\` Illinois '' or \`\` medium '' super with a depth of 6 inches , in the length and width dimensions of a Langstroth hive . A honey super consists of a box in which 8 -- 10 frames are hung . Western honeybees collect nectar and store the processed nectar in honeycomb , which they build on the frames . When the honeycomb is full , the bees will reduce the moisture content of the honey to 17 - 18 % moisture content before capping the comb with beeswax . Beekeepers will take the full honey supers and extract the honey . Periods when there is an abundant nectar source available and bees are quickly bringing back the nectar , are called a honey flow . During a honey flow , beekeepers may put several honey supers onto a hive so the bees have enough storage space . Honey supers are removed in the fall when the honey is extracted , and before the hive is winterized , but enough honey is left for the bees to consume during Winter . - Nutrition is the science that interprets the interaction of nutrients and other substances in food in relation to maintenance, growth, reproduction, health and disease of an organism. It includes food intake, absorption, assimilation, biosynthesis, catabolism and excretion. - A tablespoon is a large spoon used for eating or serving. In most English-speaking regions, the term now refers to a large spoon used for serving, however, in some regions, including parts of Canada, it is the largest type of spoon used for eating. By extension, the term is used as a measure of volume in cooking. In this capacity, it is most commonly abbreviated \\"tbsp\\" or \\"T,\\" and occasionally referred to as a \\"tablespoonful\\" to distinguish it from the utensil. The unit of measurement varies by region: a United States tablespoon is approximately 14.8 ml, a United Kingdom tablespoon is exactly 15 ml, and an Australian tablespoon is 20 ml. The capacity of the utensil (as opposed to the measurement) is not defined by law or custom and bears no particular relation to the measurement. - A burn is a type of injury to skin, or other tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns are due to heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. Females in many areas of the world have a higher risk related to the more frequent use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people. Burns that affect only the superficial skin layers are known as superficial or first-degree burns. They appear red without blisters and pain typically lasts around three days. When the injury extends into some of the underlying skin layer, it is a partial-thickness or second-degree burn. Blisters are frequently present and they are often very painful. Healing can require up to eight weeks and scarring may occur. In a full-thickness or third-degree burn, the injury extends to all layers of the skin. Often there is no pain and the burn area is stiff. Healing typically does not occur on its own. A fourth-degree burn additionally involves injury to deeper tissues, such as muscle, tendons, or bone. The burn is often black and frequently leads to loss of the burned part. Burns are generally preventable. Treatment depends on the severity of the burn. Superficial burns may be managed with little more than simple pain medication, while major burns may require prolonged treatment in specialized burn centers. Cooling with tap water may help pain and decrease damage; however, prolonged cooling may result in low body temperature. Partial-thickness burns may require cleaning with soap and water, followed by dressings. It is not clear how to manage blisters, but it is probably reasonable to leave them intact if small and drain them if large. Full-thickness burns usually require surgical treatments, such as skin grafting. Extensive burns often require large amounts of intravenous fluid, due to capillary fluid leakage and tissue swelling. The most common complications of burns involve infection.... - Beekeeping is the maintenance of honey bee colonies, commonly in hives, by humans. A beekeeper (or apiarist) keeps bees in order to collect their honey and other products that the hive produces (including beeswax, propolis, pollen, and royal jelly), to pollinate crops, or to produce bees for sale to other beekeepers. A location where bees are kept is called an apiary or \\"bee yard\\". - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Botulism is a rare and potentially fatal illness caused by a toxin, produced by the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\". The disease begins with weakness, trouble seeing, feeling tired, and trouble speaking. This may then be followed by weakness of the arms, chest muscles, and legs. The disease does not usually affect consciousness or cause a fever. Botulism can be spread several different ways. The bacterial spores which cause it are common in both soil and water. They produce the botulinum toxin when exposed to low oxygen levels and certain temperatures. Foodborne botulism happens when food containing the toxin is eaten. Infant botulism happens when the bacteria develops in the intestines and releases the toxin. This typically only occurs in children less than six months old, as protective mechanisms develop after that time. Wound botulism is found most often among those who inject street drugs. In this situation, spores enter a wound, and in the absence of oxygen, release the toxin. It is not passed directly between people. The diagnosis is confirmed by finding the toxin or bacteria in the person in question. Prevention is primarily by proper food preparation. The toxin, though not the organism, is destroyed by heating it to more than for longer than 5 minutes. Honey can contain the organism, and for this reason, honey should not be fed to children under 12 months. Treatment is with an antitoxin. In those who lose their ability to breathe on their own, mechanical ventilation may be necessary for months. Antibiotics may be used for wound botulism. Death occurs in 5 to 10% of people. Botulism can affect many other animals. The word is from Latin, \\"botulus\\", meaning sausage. Early descriptions of botulism date from at least as far back as 1793 in Germany. - Interaction is a kind of action that occurs as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect. A closely related term is interconnectivity, which deals with the interactions of interactions within systems: combinations of many simple interactions can lead to surprising emergent phenomena. \\"Interaction\\" has different tailored meanings in various sciences. Changes can also involve interaction. - In medicine, an adverse effect is an undesired harmful effect resulting from a medication or other intervention such as surgery. - A wound is a type of injury which happens relatively quickly in which skin is torn, cut, or punctured (an \\"open\\" wound), or where blunt force trauma causes a contusion (a \\"closed\\" wound). In pathology, it specifically refers to a sharp injury which damages the dermis of the skin. - Aphids, also known as plant lice and in Britain and the Commonwealth as greenflies, blackflies, or whiteflies (not to be confused with \\"jumping plant lice\\" or true whiteflies), are small sap-sucking insects, and members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Many species are green but other commonly occurring species may be white and wooly, brown, or black. Aphids are among the most destructive insect pests on cultivated plants in temperate regions. They are capable of extremely rapid increase in numbers by asexual reproduction. The damage they do to plants has made them enemies of farmers and gardeners around the world. From a zoological standpoint they are a highly successful group of organisms. - Honey is a sugary food substance produced and stored by certain social hymenopteran insects. It is produced from the sugary secretions of plants or insects, such as floral nectar or aphid honeydew, through regurgitation, enzymatic activity, and water evaporation. The variety of honey produced by honey bees (the genus \\"Apis\\") is the most well-known, due to its worldwide commercial production and human consumption. Honey gets its sweetness from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has about the same relative sweetness as granulated sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor that leads some people to prefer it to sugar and other sweeteners. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years. However, honey sometimes contains dormant endospores of the bacterium \\"Clostridium botulinum\\", which can be dangerous to babies, as it may result in botulism. People who have a weakened immune system should not eat honey because of the risk of bacterial or fungal infection. Although some evidence indicates honey may be effective in treating diseases and other medical conditions, such as wounds and burns, the overall evidence for its use in therapy is not conclusive. Providing 64 calories in a typical serving of one tablespoon (15 ml) equivalent to 1272 kj per 100 g, honey has no significant nutritional value. Honey is generally safe, but may have various, potential adverse effects or interactions with excessive consumption, existing disease conditions, or drugs. Honey use and production have a long and varied history as an ancient activity, depicted in Valencia, Spain by a cave painting of humans foraging for honey at least 8,000 years ago. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Flora is the plant life occurring in a particular region or time, generally the naturally occurring or indigenousnative plant life. The corresponding term for animal life is fauna. \\"Flora\\", \\"fauna\\" and other forms of life such as fungi are collectively referred to as biota. Sometimes bacteria and fungi are also referred to as flora, as in the terms gut flora or skin flora. - A honey bee (or honeybee) is any bee member of the genus Apis, primarily distinguished by the production and storage of honey and the construction of perennial, colonial nests from wax. Currently, only seven species of honey bee are recognized, with a total of 44 subspecies, though historically, from six to eleven species have been recognized. The best known honey bee is the Western honey bee which has been domesticated for honey production and crop pollination. Honey bees represent only a small fraction of the roughly 20,000 known species of bees. Some other types of related bees produce and store honey, including the stingless honey bees, but only members of the genus \\"Apis\\" are true honey bees. The study of bees including honey bees is known as melittology. - Nectar is a sugar-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called nectaries, either within the flowers with which it attracts pollinating animals, or by extrafloral nectaries, which provide a nutrient source to animal mutualists, which in turn provide antiherbivore protection. Common nectar-consuming pollinators include mosquitoes, hoverflies, wasps, bees, butterflies and moths, hummingbirds, and bats. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, \\"A. m. scutellata\\" and the western honey bee. - Fructose, or fruit sugar, is a simple ketonic monosaccharide found in many plants, where it is often bonded to glucose to form the disaccharide sucrose. It is one of the three dietary monosaccharides, along with glucose and galactose, that are absorbed directly into the bloodstream during digestion. Fructose was discovered by French chemist Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1847. The name \\"fructose\\" was coined in 1857 by the English chemist William Miller. Pure, dry fructose is a very sweet, white, odorless, crystalline solid and is the most water-soluble of all the sugars. Fructose is found in honey, tree and vine fruits, flowers, berries, and most root vegetables.

John Wycliffe (d. 1384), an English theologian, was condemned as a heretic in 1415 for teaching that the laity should have access to the text of the Bible as well as for holding views on the Eucharist that were contrary to church doctrine. Wycliffe's teachings influenced two of the major heretical movements of the later Middle Ages: Lollardy in England and Hussitism in Bohemia. The Bohemian movement initiated with the teaching of Jan Hus, who was burned at the stake in 1415 after being condemned as a heretic by the Council of Constance. The Hussite church, although the target of a crusade, survived beyond the Middle Ages. Other heresies were manufactured, such as the accusations against the Knights Templar that resulted in their suppression in 1312 and the division of their great wealth between the French King Philip IV (r. 1285–1314) and the Hospitallers.

Housing issues arise over eviction actions, substandard housing, eligibility for public housing, mobile home purchases, housing discrimination, and mortgage foreclosures. Does it follow that \\" Housing issues arise over eviction actions\\"? OPT: *yes *it is not possible to tell *no","completion":"Yes, housing issues arise over eviction actions as they are a major concern for both tenants and landlords. Eviction actions occur when a landlord seeks to remove a tenant from their rental property, usually due to a breach in the tenant agreement or failure to pay rent. This process can lead to significant housing issues for several reasons. Firstly, eviction actions can cause immense stress and financial strain on tenants who may struggle to find new housing, especially if they have a history of eviction on their records. This can lead to homelessness, overcrowding in temporary accommodations, or tenants being forced to accept substandard living conditions due to a lack of available or affordable options. Secondly, landlords face challenges when carrying out eviction actions. They must adhere to the appropriate legal processes and provide sufficient notice to tenants before eviction can occur. Failure to do so can result in lawsuits, fines, or other penalties. Additionally, landlords may struggle to find new tenants, particularly if the eviction process leads to negative publicity or damaged property. Furthermore, eviction actions can exacerbate systemic housing issues that exist in certain communities. In areas where there is a lack of affordable housing or high rates of poverty, eviction actions may disproportionately impact vulnerable populations. Finally, eviction actions can also give rise to issues relating to housing discrimination. In some cases, landlords may evict tenants based on their race, ethnicity, religion, or other protected status. This not only infringes on the tenant's rights but can also perpetuate housing disparities within communities and limit access to safe, affordable, and stable housing for marginalized groups. In conclusion, housing issues do arise over eviction actions, as they can lead to homelessness, financial instability, legal challenges, and discrimination. It is essential for governments, landlords, and housing advocates to work together to address these issues, promote equitable housing policies, and ensure the protection of tenants' rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To use something other than cat litter for a litter box.","completion":"Step 1: Determine the alternatives To use something other than cat litter for a litter box, start by researching alternative materials that could effectively control odor, absorb moisture, and be safe for the cat. Consider materials such as: - Paper-based litter - Wood-based litter - Corn or wheat-based litter - Coconut coir or other natural fiber-based litters - Sand or soil Justification: By finding alternative materials, you are expanding your options and choosing an eco-friendly and potentially cost-effective solution. Step 2: Assess suitability and safety Investigate each alternative by delving into customer reviews and researching the pros and cons. In particular, make sure that the alternative material is safe for the cat; it should be non-toxic and not pose any health hazards, such as respiratory problems or ingestion dangers. Justification: Evaluating the safety and effectiveness of each alternative ensures you provide the cat with a litter that doesn't compromise its well-being. Step 3: Test one or more alternatives After narrowing down one or more suitable alternatives, purchase a small quantity and test it in the litter box. Introduce the new material gradually by mixing it with the existing cat litter, allowing the cat to adjust to the change. Justification: Testing the alternative litter on a small scale allows you to evaluate its effectiveness and observe the cat's reactions before committing to a full switch. Step 4: Observe the cat's behavior Monitor the cat's response to the new litter material by observing whether it uses the litter box without reluctance and noting any changes in behavior. If the cat seems uncomfortable or refuses to use the litter box, try another alternative material. Justification: The cat's comfort and acceptance of the new material are essential to prevent litter box avoidance or other behavioral issues. Step 5: Make any necessary adjustments If the cat accepts the new litter material, continue to make adjustments to find the optimal amount or mix for best performance (odor control, absorption, etc.). You may experiment with different brands or blends of the alternative material if needed. Justification: Tweaking the litter mix is necessary to achieve the best results when using an alternative to traditional cat litter, ensuring both you and your cat are satisfied. Step 6: Dispose of the used litter responsibly Finally, when scooping or changing the litter box, make sure to dispose of the alternative material according to any specific guidelines outlined by the manufacturer. Some materials may be compostable or biodegradable, while others may not. Justification: Proper disposal contributes to a cleaner environment and ensures compliance with the guidelines provided by the manufacturer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Your right to contest will depend greatly on \\"when\\" the test was given. Depending on your state of residency and the time of the drug test, your rights can vary drastically. For example, random drug testing in California is not considered legally valid because of its discriminatory basis. Pre-employment testing, however, is entirely valid. An employer can terminate your employment, or restrict any promotions for \\"positive\\" results. Depending on your location, the state can deny you unemployment benefits, working compensation, and disability benefits. This is the first step to formally contesting your results. The human resources department will be able to inform you about any re-testing procedures; and will provide you with the paperwork that is required to proceed. Provide them with all of the relevant paperwork, as well as the medical forms you filled out before you took the test.

Practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. Does it follow that \\"There are no interventions for alcohol at the trauma center. \\"?","completion":"No, this statement is incorrect. There are practical guidelines for performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers, indicating that such interventions do exist. Here is a step-by-step approach to performing alcohol interventions in trauma centers. The steps are taken based on medical best practices and common approaches for effective intervention: 1. Identification and assessment: The first step is identifying patients who may have an alcohol problem. Screening tools like the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) or the CAGE questionnaire can help assess and identify individuals with potential alcohol use disorders or risky drinking habits. 2. Physician involvement: Once patients are identified, the involvement of the attending physician or a trained professional like a clinical nurse specialist or a social worker is vital to initiate the intervention process. They can discuss and evaluate the patients' alcohol consumption in the context of their trauma. 3. Motivational interviewing: Practitioners should adapt a non-confrontational and empathetic approach, such as motivational interviewing, to facilitate communication with patients. This helps patients understand the link between their alcohol consumption and trauma, enabling them to recognize the need to change their drinking behavior. 4. Brief intervention: A brief intervention should be provided after the assessment. It may consist of a short conversation about the risks of alcohol use and trauma, as well as discussing possible strategies to reduce or stop drinking. 5. Referral to treatment: If the patient is willing and requires further assistance, a referral to specialized treatment services such as outpatient therapy or addiction treatment programs can be made.
