A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who meets Barney?, using the article: While driving his Dual-Ghia from Las Vegas to Los Angeles, lecherous, heavy-drinking pop singer Dino is forced to detour through Climax, Nevada. There he meets the amateur songwriting team of Barney Millsap, a gas station attendant, and piano teacher Orville J. Spooner, a man easily given to jealousy. Hoping to interest Dino in their songs, Barney disables the \\"Italian\\" sports car and tells Dino he will need to remain in town until new parts arrive from Milan. (Dual-Ghia was actually an American marque, mating a Dodge frame, drivetrain, and engine with Italian coachwork.) Orville invites Dino to stay with him and wife Zelda, but becomes concerned when he learns the singer needs to have sex every night to avoid awakening with a headache. Anxious to accommodate Dino but safeguard his marriage, Orville provokes an argument with his wife that leads to Zelda fleeing in tears. He and Barney then arrange for Polly the Pistol, a waitress and prostitute at a saloon on the edge of town called the Belly Button, to pose as Orville's wife and satisfy Dino. That evening after the three have dinner, Orville plays his tunes for Dino on the piano and Polly requests a particular song. It is one she knows he wrote for his wife when trying to persuade her to marry him. Doing so, Orville gets lost in emotion, as does Polly, who has fallen a little for the dream of a domestic life that she doesn't have. Under the influence of wine and song, Orville starts thinking of Polly as his wife and tosses Dino out.

Q: Question: When was the first Spanish governor of Las Californias born? Passage:During the expedition, Father Crespí observed a location along the river that would be good for a settlement or mission. However, in 1771, Father Serra instead commissioned two missionaries to establish the Mission San Gabriel Arcángel-San Gabriel Mission near the present day Whittier Narrows section of the San Gabriel River. The missionaries encountered resistance from the Tongva to their attempts to resettle the Natives on the mission. The mission encountered further trouble in 1776 when a flood damaged the mission, convincing the missionaries to move and rebuild the mission on a higher and more defensible location: its present site in San Gabriel. The first Spanish governor of Las Californias, Felipe de Neve had, as well, recommended to Viceroy Bucareli Father Crespí's location on the Río Porciúncula (Los Angeles River) for a mission. Instead, in 1781, King Charles III mandated that a pueblo be built on the site instead, which would be the second town in Alta California, after San José de Guadalupe in 1777. The monarch, disregarding the production and trade roles of the missions, saw a greater need for secular pueblos to be established as the centers of agriculture and commerce to supply the crown's ever-growing military presence in \\"Nueva California.\\" The priests at the missions ignored the royal mandate and continued their ranching, trading and production of tallow, soap, hides, and beef, often in competition with new pueblo ventures.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What are the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden? is inside the article: Delius was born in Bradford in Yorkshire. He was baptised as \\"Fritz Theodor Albert Delius\\", and used the forename Fritz until he was about 40. He was the second of four sons (there were also ten daughters) born to Julius Delius (1822–1901) and his wife Elise Pauline, née Krönig (1838–1929). Delius's parents were born in Bielefeld, Westphalia, of Dutch origin; the family had for some generations been settled in German lands near the Rhine. Julius's father, Ernst Friedrich Delius, had served under Blücher in the Napoleonic Wars. Julius moved to England to further his career as a wool merchant, and became a naturalised British subject in 1850. He married Elise in 1856.The Delius household was musical; famous musicians such as Joseph Joachim and Carlo Alfredo Piatti were guests, and played for the family. Despite his German parentage, the young Fritz was drawn to the music of Chopin and Grieg rather than the Austro-German music of Mozart and Beethoven, a preference that endured all his life. The young Delius was first taught the violin by a Mr. Rudolph Bauerkeller of the Hallé Orchestra, and had more advanced studies under Mr. George Haddock of Leeds. Although he achieved enough skill as a violinist to set up as a violin teacher in later years, his chief musical joy was to improvise at the piano, and it was a piano piece, a waltz by Chopin, that gave him his first ecstatic encounter with music. From 1874 to 1878, Delius was educated at Bradford Grammar School, where the singer John Coates was his slightly older contemporary. He then attended the International College at Isleworth (just west of London) between 1878 and 1880. As a pupil he was neither especially quick nor diligent, but the college was conveniently close to the city for Delius to be able to attend concerts and opera.Julius Delius assumed that his son would play a part in the family wool business, and for the next three years he tried hard to persuade him to do so. Delius's first job was as the firm's representative in Stroud in Gloucestershire,..., can you guess it ? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the text, it is not possible to directly identify the full names of the people that influenced Fritz Theodor Albert Delius in Sweden. The passage details Delius's family background, childhood, musical upbringing, and early experiences but does not specifically mention any individuals from Sweden who had an impact on his life or musical development. It's important to note that Delius's influences encompass various musicians from different countries - such as Chopin and Grieg - and throughout different stages of his life. It is likely that he encountered numerous individuals that impacted his artistic growth; however, these names are not explicitly mentioned in this passage.

The powers, functions and duties of prior presidential offices, and their relation with the Prime Minister and cabinets has over time differed with the various Portuguese constitutions. - Prime Minister (Portuguese: \\"Primeiro-Ministro\\") is the current title of the head of government of Portugal. As head of government, the Prime Minister coordinates the actions of ministers, represents the Government of Portugal to the other bodies of state, is accountable to Parliament and keeps the President informed. The Prime Minister can hold the role of head of government with the portfolio of one or more ministries. - The Portuguese legislative election of 1987 took place on 19 July . In the previous election , in 1985 , the Social Democratic Party had won a minority government managing to survive in coalition with the Democratic and Social Center and the Democratic Renewal Party , and after the approval of a no - confidence motion from the left - wing parties , with the aid of the Democratic Renewal Party , the government fell and Mário Soares , the President at the time , called for a new election . The PSD was very popular going into the election , and was elected to a landslide majority government -- the biggest that a Portuguese party had ever won in a free election . The left - wing Democratic Unity Coalition lost some of its MPs to the Socialist Party and the Democratic Renovator Party lost almost all of its influence , mainly due to its responsibility in the fall of the former government . The right - wing Democratic and Social Center lost almost half of its vote share , due to the effect of tactical voting for the also right - wing , Social Democratic Party .

Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'office contested' with 'prime minister of portugal'.","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'office contested' with 'Prime Minister of Portugal' is Mário Alberto Nobre Lopes Soares. According to the information given, Mário Soares served as the Prime Minister of Portugal from 1976 to 1978, and again from 1983 to 1985. This implies that he contested for the office, as in most democratic countries, the office of the Prime Minister is not an appointed position but an elected one. Therefore, by running for this position, Mário Soares contested for the office of the Prime Minister of Portugal. Notably, Mário Soares also served as the 17th President of Portugal from 1986 to 1996. This provides another instance where Soares contested for an executive office, though in this case it was for the presidency, not the prime ministership. In both cases, it is clear that Soares, as a politician, would have contested these offices through political campaigning and participation in elections, as is customary in democratic societies. The specifics of when and how Soares contested these offices aren't provided in the information. However, it is known that in Portugal, individuals contest these offices in a democratic manner, typically representing a specific political party. In the case of Soares, he was a member of the Socialist Party. The specifics of his campaigns can be supplemented from other sources, if desired, but it is clear that Mário Soares is an entity that contested the office of 'Prime Minister of Portugal', satisfying the relation requested in the query."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In his book, Humanism (1997), Tony Davies calls these critics \\"humanist anti-humanists\\". Critics of antihumanism, most notably Jürgen Habermas, counter that while antihumanists may highlight humanism's failure to fulfil its emancipatory ideal, they do not offer an alternative emancipatory project of their own. Others, like the German philosopher Heidegger considered themselves humanists on the model of the ancient Greeks, but thought humanism applied only to the German \\"race\\" and specifically to the Nazis and thus, in Davies' words, were anti-humanist humanists. Such a reading of Heidegger's thought is itself deeply controversial; Heidegger includes his own views and critique of Humanism in Letter On Humanism. Davies acknowledges that after the horrific experiences of the wars of the 20th century \\"it should no longer be possible to formulate phrases like 'the destiny of man' or the 'triumph of human reason' without an instant consciousness of the folly and brutality they drag behind them\\". For \\"it is almost impossible to think of a crime that has not been committed in the name of human reason\\". Yet, he continues, \\"it would be unwise to simply abandon the ground occupied by the historical humanisms. For one thing humanism remains on many occasions the only available alternative to bigotry and persecution. The freedom to speak and write, to organise and campaign in defence of individual or collective interests, to protest and disobey: all these can only be articulated in humanist terms.\\" Answer:","completion":"Tony Davies published a book in 1997 called \\"Humanism.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Identify the subject and the action: In the original sentence, the subject is Drew and the action is tightening the cinch. 2. Determine the purpose or reason for the action: The purpose or reason behind Drew tightening the cinch is not explicitly mentioned in the sentence. 3. Examine any additional context or information provided: The additional information provided in the sentence is \\"Most people have.\\" This phrase does not clarify the purpose or reason for Drew tightening the cinch. Given the analysis of the sentence, it does not necessarily follow that \\"Drew tightened the cinch on the box so it couldn't be opened without a tool.\\" This conclusion is a reasonable deduction, but it is not explicitly stated in the original sentence. There might be other reasons for tightening the cinch, such as securing the content of the box or preventing it from accidentally opening."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: The answer is:","completion":"The term for the gas in smog that can damage plants is 'ozone.' Ozone (O3) is a highly reactive gas molecule and a major component of smog that can have harmful effects on both human health and the environment, including damaging plants and reducing crop yields. When present at ground level (tropospheric ozone), it is a common air pollutant that forms through complex photochemical reactions involving nitrogen oxides (NOx) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), which are emitted from various sources, such as vehicles, factories, and wildfires."},{"prompt":"Background: Shown in the Figure below is a cylinder of gas on the left that is at room temperature (300 K). On the right, the cylinder has been heated until the Kelvin temperature has doubled to 600 K. The kinetic energy of the gas molecules increases, so collisions with the walls of the container are now more forceful than they were before. As a result, the pressure of the gas doubles. Decreasing the temperature would have the opposite effect, and the pressure of an enclosed gas would decrease. Paragraph: Rob is testing the properties of gas. To that end, he experimented with a cylinder of gas in three stages, stage A, stage B, and stage C. In stage A he kept the gas in room temperature. In stage B he heated the gas up.

However, not all scientists support this view, since there is uncertainty as to how strongly the fossil record is biased by the greater availability and preservation of recent geologic sections. Some scientists believe that corrected for sampling artifacts, modern biodiversity may not be much different from biodiversity 300 million years ago., whereas others consider the fossil record reasonably reflective of the diversification of life.

It did not include Ireland, which remained a separate realm. The unitary state was governed by a single parliament and government that was based in Westminster. The former kingdoms had been in personal union since James VI, King of Scots, became King of England and King of Ireland in 1603 following the death of Queen Elizabeth I, bringing about a \\"Union of the Crowns\\".

Purpose of the Review-To discuss recent insights into the relationships between viral respiratory infections and asthma inception in the context of a long-term goal of moving towards prevention strategies for childhood asthma. Recent Findings-There is strong evidence for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and human rhinovirus (RV) wheezing illnesses as important risk factors for asthma inception. The mechanisms underlying these relationships have been an intense area of study. Novel approaches for the prevention of virus infections and/or lessening the severity of associated illnesses are at various stages of development, and are important potential tools in efforts aimed at primary and secondary prevention of asthma. Summary-Viral respiratory infections in early life are a major source of morbidity and critical in the development of asthma. Mechanisms by which these infections lead to asthma inception in susceptible individuals are emerging. Further, there are promising potential interventions currently available that should be tested in clinical trials. The goal of prevention of disease inception is clearly on the horizon.","completion":"Title: \\"Viral Respiratory Infections and Asthma Inception: Mechanisms, Risk Factors, and Prevention Strategies in Childhood\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"If Jim decides to use less electricity in his day-to-day activities, he can expect the amount of pollution he is responsible for creating will decrease. This is because a significant portion of electricity production comes from burning fossil fuels such as coal, natural gas, and oil. These fossil fuels, when burned, emit greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the atmosphere, contributing to climate change and air pollution. By reducing his electricity consumption, Jim will effectively reduce the demand for electricity from the grid, which in turn reduces the need to burn more fossil fuels to generate that power. As a result, fewer pollutants and greenhouse gases will be emitted into the atmosphere, and Jim's overall environmental footprint will be minimized. Additionally, Jim's efforts to save electricity may also contribute to conserving natural resources and reducing the overall environmental impact associated with electricity production, including water pollution and habitat degradation from mining, drilling, and extracting fossil fuels.

The Partido Africano da Independência da Guiné e Cabo Verde (PAIGC) is a political party that fought for the independence of Guinea-Bissau and Cape Verde from Portuguese colonial rule. After achieving independence, the PAIGC became the ruling party in Guinea-Bissau. During the initial years of independence, Guinea-Bissau faced internal conflicts and power struggles. A large number of people were executed, including both ordinary citizens and military personnel. These executions were part of a wider wave of political violence and repression in the country. For a long time, the PAIGC did not acknowledge its role in the executions and the resulting human rights abuses. However, on 29 November 1980, the PAIGC published an article in its official newspaper, Nó Pintcha, admitting to the executions. In the article, the party confirmed that many Guinean soldiers had been killed and buried in unmarked mass graves located in the woods of Cumerá, Portogole, and Mansabá. This public acknowledgment marked a pivotal moment in the history of Guinea-Bissau, as the ruling party admitted and took responsibility for its actions, which had previously been kept under wraps. The admission also opened the door to a broader discussion about human rights abuses during this period, leading to some degree of accountability for the atrocities committed. In summary, based on the provided statement, the PAIGC acknowledged the executions on 29th November 1980 when they published an article in their newspaper, Nó Pintcha, admitting to the events and human rights violations."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation 317g - 3960 = 15g - 58g, first simplify both sides of the equation. Step 1: Simplify both sides On the left side of the equation, there are no changes to be made. On the right side of the equation, we should combine the two terms containing the variable g. We have 15g - 58g: 15g - 58g = -43g So, the simplified equation is: 317g - 3960 = -43g Step 2: Move the variable g terms to one side and the constant terms to the other side To do this, we'll add 43g to both sides of the equation to isolate the g terms on the left side: 317g + 43g - 3960 = -43g + 43g This simplifies to: 360g - 3960 = 0 Next, we'll move the constant term to the right side of the equation by adding 3960 to both sides: 360g - 3960 + 3960 = 0 + 3960 This simplifies to: 360g = 3960 Step 3: Solve for g Now, we only need to isolate g by dividing both sides of the equation by 360: 360g / 360 = 3960 / 360 This simplifies to: g = 11 Hence, the solution to the equation 317g - 3960 = 15g - 58g is g = 11."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"The last step of the process is the activation of the immune system and recovery or progression to a more severe condition. Once the bacteria have entered the body, gained access to the bloodstream, attacked and killed cells in the body, the immune system will be alerted to the presence of these foreign invaders. The immune response consists of two components: the innate (non-specific) and adaptive (specific) immune systems. The innate immune system is the body's first line of defense and includes physical barriers such as the skin and mucous membranes, as well as immune cells like neutrophils and macrophages. When these cells encounter bacteria, they can produce chemicals called cytokines, which help to recruit more immune cells to the site of infection. Neutrophils and macrophages can also engulf and destroy bacteria through a process called phagocytosis, helping to reduce their numbers and prevent further damage to cells. The adaptive immune system consists of T cells and B cells, which have the ability to recognize specific antigens present on the surface of bacteria. Once activated, T cells can either directly attack and kill cells infected with bacteria or help stimulate B cells to produce antibodies. These antibodies can bind to the bacteria, neutralizing them, and making it easier for other immune cells to destroy them. In some cases, the immune system may be successful in eliminating the bacteria and preventing further damage to the body. This results in recovery and a return to normal health. The body may also gain immunity to future infections from the same bacteria, as the adaptive immune system can \\"remember\\" the specific antigens and respond more quickly and effectively if they are encountered again. However, in other cases, the immune response may be insufficient to completely eliminate the bacterial infection. This can lead to a more severe condition, as the bacteria continue to multiply and damage cells and tissues in the body. This could result in the development of localized infections (such as abscesses) or systemic complications (such as sepsis or toxic shock syndrome), depending on the type and virulence of the bacteria responsible for the infection. Additionally, the immune response itself can sometimes cause damage to healthy tissues, as immune cells release cytokines and other inflammatory chemicals that can cause collateral damage to nearby cells. This inflammation can be harmful and may contribute to the progression of the infection and the severity of the resulting illness. In these cases, medical intervention, including antibiotic therapy, may be necessary to supplement the body's immune response and help eliminate the bacteria from the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the sentence \\"The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles, including Robert Guiscard and his army, who is regarded as a hero by the natives.\\" answer the question \\"Who is considered a hero by natives for ending Muslim control of Palermo?\\"","completion":"Yes, the sentence \\"The family who returned the city to Christianity were called the Hautevilles, including Robert Guiscard and his army, who is regarded as a hero by the natives\\" does provide an answer to the question \\"Who is considered a hero by natives for ending Muslim control of Palermo?\\". Based on this sentence, the hero regarded by the natives for ending Muslim control of Palermo is Robert Guiscard, a member of the Hauteville family, along with his army. To provide a more detailed response, it's essential to first understand the historical context surrounding these events. Palermo, a city in modern-day Sicily, Italy, was under Muslim control between 831 and 1072. At that time, Sicily was a part of the Emirate of Sicily, which was a Muslim state ruled by the Fatimids and later the Kalbids. The Muslim control led to Arabization and Islamization of the population. However, the Normans, a group of Scandinavians who settled in modern-day France, played a significant role in changing the religious landscape of the region. The Hauteville family, originating from Normandy, were a key part of the Norman forces that launched a series of military campaigns in Southern Italy and Sicily. The Hautevilles aimed to extend their influence and consolidate their rule in the region by liberating it from Muslim control and restoring Christian dominance. Robert Guiscard, born in 1015 and also known as Robert the Crafty or the Resourceful, was a prominent member of the Hauteville family. He took part in several military campaigns alongside his brothers, contributing to the successful Norman conquest of the region. After becoming the Duke of Apulia and Calabria in 1059, Guiscard focused his efforts on expanding his territories. In 1060, under the leadership of Robert Guiscard and his brother Roger Bosso, the Normans started their campaign against the Muslims in Sicily. The major turning point occurred in 1071 when they successfully besieged Palermo, the capital of the Emirate of Sicily. The following year, the city officially fell under Norman rule, effectively ending the Muslim control of Palermo. This led to a gradual re-Christianization of the population, with churches being restored and built, and Greek Christianity flourishing alongside the Latin church. As the sentence suggests, Robert Guiscard and his army hold an essential place in the local history of Palermo. They are regarded as heroes by the natives for their role in ending Muslim control of the city and restoring it to the Christian world. Their legacy is marked by the establishment of the County, and later the Kingdom, of Sicily, which experienced a rich cultural and artistic period characterized by the coexistence of Latin, Greek, and Arab elements and is still remembered today."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the band that started a tour in West Germany? ? By 1966, the Beatles had grown weary of live performance. In John Lennon's opinion, they could \\"send out four waxworks ... and that would satisfy the crowds. Beatles concerts are nothing to do with music anymore. They're just bloody tribal rites.\\" In June that year, two days after finishing the album Revolver, the group set off for a tour that started in West Germany. While in Hamburg they received an anonymous telegram stating: \\"Do not go to Tokyo. Your life is in danger.\\" The threat was taken seriously in light of the controversy surrounding the tour among Japan's religious and conservative groups, with particular opposition to the Beatles' planned performances at the sacred Nippon Budokan arena. As an added precaution, 35,000 police were mobilised and tasked with protecting the group, who were transported from hotels to concert venues in armoured vehicles. The Beatles then performed in the Philippines, where they were threatened and manhandled by its citizens for not visiting First Lady Imelda Marcos. The group were angry with their manager, Brian Epstein, for insisting on what they regarded as an exhausting and demoralising itinerary. The publication in the US of Lennon's remarks about the Beatles being \\"more popular than Jesus\\" then embroiled the band in controversy and protest in America's Bible Belt. A public apology eased tensions, but a US tour in August that was marked by reduced ticket sales, relative to the group's record attendances in 1965, and subpar performances proved to be their last. The author Nicholas Schaffner writes: To the Beatles, playing such concerts had become a charade so remote from the new directions they were pursuing that not a single tune was attempted from the just-released Revolver LP, whose arrangements were for the most part impossible to reproduce with the limitations imposed by their two-guitars-bass-and-drums stage lineup.

What is the final step of the following process: - The butterfly starts as an egg - The egg hatches to form a larva, also called a caterpillar - The carterpillar molts (loses its skin) many times as it grows - The caterpillar then forms itself into a pupa, or chrysalis - The caterpillar in the chrysalis begins change, a process called mmetaphorphosis - The caterpillar completes its metamorphosis and has turned into a butterfly","completion":"The final step of the process is when the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis as a fully-formed and adult butterfly, ready to begin its life outside the chrysalis. This final stage is known as \\"eclosion.\\" During the eclosion process, the butterfly uses its specialized muscles and enzymes to break open the chrysalis and carefully release its tightly folded wings. It then starts pumping blood into the wings, enabling them to expand to their full size and shape. At first, the butterfly's wings may appear soft and weak, but they gradually strengthen as they are exposed to the air and the butterfly starts fluttering them. After emerging from the chrysalis, a butterfly typically spends some time resting on the chrysalis shell or a nearby plant to allow its body and wings to dry and harden. During this time, it also begins to prepare for its adult life. Butterflies have an essential mouthpart called a proboscis, which is a long, curled tube they use to drink nectar from flowers. Upon emergence from the chrysalis, the butterfly starts to uncurl and assemble its proboscis, which will be used for feeding. Once the wings are dry and strong, the butterfly begins its new life as an adult. It will learn to fly and find food, searching for flowers that provide the nectar needed to fuel its flight and reproduction. Adult butterflies also play a vital role in pollination, transferring pollen from one flower to another as they feed, helping plants to reproduce and create future habitats for other butterflies and insects. Mating and reproduction become significant aspects of the adult butterfly's life, as it searches for a mate to ensure the continuation of the species. Once a male and female butterfly mate, the female lays her eggs on specific host plants, beginning the life cycle once again. The host plants provide the hatched larvae with the necessary nutrients for growth and development. Eventually, the adult butterflies will reach the end of their life span, which can vary from just a few weeks to several months, depending on the species. In summary, the final step of the butterfly life cycle, known as eclosion, involves the butterfly emerging from its chrysalis as a fully-formed adult, ready to commence its life outside the chrysalis. This stage marks the completion of the metamorphosis process and the beginning of the butterfly's life as a mature, reproducing individual, capable of flight, feeding, and contributing to the ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

So one day, I was showing this cool trick I learned on an anatomy program on the TV to a couple of classmates who used to sit around me. The thing was that you can't flex your ring finger upwards if you put your middle finger under the palm (try that) We were all kids, and soon everyone in the class started staring at us weirdos looking laughing at out hands. The bully noticed it too, and came near to inquire about this hand stuff. I described the trick and he was impressed.

Today I want to take it a step further and focus on how to start clean eating on a budget. It is very similar with just a couple of extra steps. Clean eating focuses on fresh ingredients, no processed foods, and eating good foods as close to nature as possible such as: fruits, vegetables, whole grains, cage-free eggs, grass-fed beef and grain-fed poultry, and raw milk (if possible) to your diet. Some of these may seem like a burden when you are on a small food budget, but with the tips below, you can eat clean and stay within your budget. I am sure you will recognize some from the previous post; but read through there is extra information that applies specifically to clean eating. A major component of clean eating is buying fresh produce rather than canned fruits and vegetables. Frozen produce is OK; but, if in-season fruit is available, it is always better to choose that. Buy in bulk, and freeze it yourself. Use Google to help you search for seasonal produce in your area. When you can buy it from a Farmer’s Market, or even directly from the farmers, it will be less expensive. My next choice is SPOUTS Farmer’s Marker, if there is one near you. Those sources will probably be the least expensive. For example: you may be able to buy strawberries, peaches, and nectarines very inexpensively in the summer and find that squash is a better buy in the fall. Always buy extra when the price is right and freeze the leftovers. When you first start reading about clean eating, you may find “experts” expounding the importance of certain superfoods that you should start eating. The reality is – they are nutritious and excellent additions to your diet; but, you don’t have to eat them just start a clean eating. If you cannot afford to add chia seeds of flax seeds to every smoothie or eat a pomegranate each morning, don’t worry about it. Buy the clean foods you can afford and eat those – you will be doing just fine. According to the above context, answer the following question.

From the very beginning, there were slightly different literary Serbian and Croatian standards, although both were based on the same Shtokavian subdialect, Eastern Herzegovinian. In the 20th century, Serbo-Croatian served as the official language of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia (when it was called \\"Serbo-Croato-Slovenian\\"), and later as one of the official languages of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. The breakup of Yugoslavia affected language attitudes, so that social conceptions of the language separated on ethnic and political lines. Since the breakup of Yugoslavia, Bosnian has likewise been established as an official standard in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and there is an ongoing movement to codify a separate Montenegrin standard.

(CNN) -- Britain's Chris Froome won the 17th stage of the Tour de France on Wednesday to strengthen his grip on the yellow jersey. Froome completed Wednesday's 32-kilometer time trial in 51 minutes 33 seconds, nine seconds ahead of Spain's Alberto Contador with his compatriot Joaquim Rodriguez Oliver finishing a further second behind in third. \\"I couldn't believe it when I got over the line and saw I had the fastest time,\\" Froome said after his third stage win of this year's tour. \\"I went into today thinking I was going to try and limit my losses, thinking about the days to come now. So to go through the finish line with the fastest time, I really didn't see that coming.\\" On mountainous terrain along a frequently twisting route most of the riders opted for their traditional road bikes over the more aerodynamic machines used in time trials. But Froome opted to use both on the stage, switching to a time trial model for the final 12-kilometer descent. The swap proved decisive as the Briton clawed back a 20-second advantage Contador had built up earlier in the stage. The Spaniard now moves up to second overall, four minutes 34 seconds behind Froome with just four stages remaining. Contador's Saxo-Tinkoff teammate Roman Kreuziger is now third and trails Froome by four minutes and 51 seconds. Thursday sees the riders tackle the gruelling 172.5-kilometer 18th stage which concludes with a double ascent of Alpe d'Huez over the last 60 kilometers.

Question: Process: - The body&#x27;s temperature increases over 98.6 degrees F - The hypothalamus in the brain sends a message to the body - Sweat glands in the skin receive the message - The sweat glands start combining water and chemicals to make sweat - The sweat leaves the skin through pores. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose during Winter happens, how will it affect less hydration. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"In the given process, the body's temperature increases over 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, leading to the hypothalamus in the brain sending a message to the sweat glands in the skin. The sweat glands then produce sweat by combining water and chemicals. This sweat is released through pores in the skin, helping to cool down the body. Now, regarding the perturbation hypothesis: during winter, cold temperatures often lead to lower humidity in the air. This can result in the body becoming dehydrated more easily, as the air holds less moisture. Cold weather can also cause the body to produce less sweat, as the hypothalamus may not need to send signals to the sweat glands for cooling the body down due to already low external temperatures. So, in winter, the direct effect on the process might be reduced activation of the hypothalamus and subsequently reduced sweat production. The indirect effect on the process would be the potential for dehydration due to cold weather causing decreased humidity, leading to lower hydration levels. The decreased hydration may affect the sweat production process, as the body might prioritize conserving water for other vital bodily functions. In summary, during winter, the perturbation can have both direct and indirect effects on the body's sweat production process. The direct effect is a potentially reduced need for the hypothalamus to activate sweat glands due to cold temperatures, while the indirect effect is that reduced hydration caused by lower humidity might influence the sweat glands' ability to produce sweat effectively."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Ask the seller questions about the equipment. Test out all the elements of the equipment before you buy it. Inspect the outside and inside of all equipment.","completion":"Title: The Importance of Thorough Inspection and Testing Before Purchasing Equipment Introduction: In today's fast-paced and highly competitive business world, investing in the right equipment is crucial for long-term success. However, when acquiring new or used equipment, taking the necessary steps to ensure its quality, functionality, and performance is vital. In this article, we will discuss the importance of asking the seller pertinent questions, testing out the equipment, and performing a thorough inspection of both the exterior and interior components before making a purchasing decision. 1. Asking the Right Questions When considering purchasing equipment, having an open and transparent conversation with the seller is essential. Asking the right questions can help you gain valuable insights into the equipment's history, condition, and performance capabilities. Some essential questions to ask the seller include: - What is the age and history of the equipment? - Are there any known issues or defects? - What is the equipment's maintenance and service schedule? - Has the equipment undergone any modifications or upgrades? - Are there any warranties or guarantees available? By seeking comprehensive information, you can make an informed decision and avoid potential pitfalls down the line. 2. Testing All Elements of the Equipment Before purchasing equipment, it is crucial to test its functionality thoroughly. Regardless of the equipment type—whether it's a piece of machinery, a software program, or an electronic device—testing out all its features can help identify any potential issues or shortcomings.

Taking the time to test out all the equipment's elements will help you confidently decide whether it meets your needs and expectations. 3. Performing a Thorough Inspection A detailed inspection of the equipment's exterior and interior components is crucial before purchasing. On the outside, look for any visible signs of damage or wear that may indicate compromised performance or potential future issues. On the inside, consider the following: - Check for signs of corrosion, rust, or excessive wear. - Inspect electrical components and wiring for damage or improper connections. - If applicable, examine the equipment's engine, transmission, and other crucial components. - Check for any signs of leaks, such as oil or coolant. A thorough inspection helps uncover hidden issues and informs you of any necessary repairs or upgrades before committing to the purchase. Conclusion: Acquiring new or used equipment is a significant investment that can directly impact your business's growth and success. By asking the seller the right questions, testing all elements of the equipment, and performing a thorough inspection, you can minimize risk, identify potential issues, and ensure that your investment meets your specific needs and requirements. In doing so, you maximize the equipment's potential to contribute to the success of your operation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

She was my second-grade teacher, and I was going to marry her when I grew up. I would sit in my seat for the entire morning. I wouldn't miss one moment for her presence by leaving the room. My hand was always the first to be raised when Miss Benson called for volunteers to clean the blackboards or gather papers. I would arrange and rearrange the papers. They had to be in perfect order before I went back to my seat unwillingly. Early in the term, I started asking my mother to put an extra apple or peach in my lunch, but I never quite worked up the courage to hand my gift to her directly. Each day the delicacy found its way unobserved to the corner of her desk. And each day the response was the same. ''Why, how nice! '' She would pick up the offering and asked: ''What thoughtful little boy or girl brought me this? '' No one claimed the honor, least of all me. I kept my head down, looking at my desk. ''Can it be that I have a secret admirer? '' she added. I would feel the red rising in my face. I was certain that everyone was looking at me, and I would sigh with relief when Miss Benson put the fruit away and started the lesson. Friday was Miss Benson's birthday. Everyone wanted to get her a present. I would give her something, openly. That afternoon was spent combing the fields for wild flowers. Not many were in bloom at that time of year, but finally I managed a patch of beautiful flowers... In the morning I went to the desk and gave the beautiful flowers to Miss Benson. She accepted them happily and held them to her cheek for a moment. My reward was a smile and a pat on the head. The next Monday, Miss Benson was not in class.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Limit Your Options, Limit Your Horizons: A Lesson from Borders’ Bankruptcy Been to a Borders bookstore lately? If not, you better hurry. As part of its Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing this week, the book and magazine retailer announced that it will close more than 200 superstores nationwide by mid-April. On second thought, you probably don’t have to rush just yet. Unless you live in Wyoming, chances are there will still be a Borders store near you come May—possibly more than one. This is the byproduct of the organization’s ill-advised decision a few years ago to open hundreds of new stores, many within walking distance of one another. Instead of strengthening Borders, the strategy left the company burdened with excessive retail space and inventory. In San Francisco, for example, there are two Borders superstores in and around historic Union Square. In less time than it takes to consume a coffee purchased in one store you could walk to the other to buy a magazine. Convenient? Perhaps. Strategically competitive? Not exactly. Borders, like Blockbuster and other struggling retailers, seems optimized for a bygone era. But its nemesis in bricks-and-mortar book sales, Barnes & Noble, is competitively positioned. Given that both sell the same books from the same publishers in similar retail environments, you might wonder why Borders is bleeding cash while Barnes & Noble is holding its own. The answer has everything to do with Borders’ failure to react appropriately to two market transitions—first the shift to online book selling, then the embrace of electronic readers. In each case, Borders failed to develop a new business model while trying to perfect its traditional one. Doing both helped Barnes & Noble hold its ground against Amazon.com, WalMart and others who compete effectively in book selling. Doing only one doomed Borders. Here’s why. As long ago as 2002, when Amazon.com posted its first profit, it was clear that retail book selling was a business under siege. Since then, thousands of independent booksellers across the nation have closed, many of which were longstanding fixtures in their communities. Think Kroch’s and Brentano’s of Chicago and Coliseum Books of New York. Most booksellers simply could not compete with the price and convenience of Amazon.com or the bigger, national chains. Now all brick-and-mortar book sellers are challenged, especially as the market transitions once more. Last June marked a significant milestone in the book business. Then, Amazon.com, the world’s largest book seller, announced that sales of books for its Kindle e-reader outnumbered those for hardcover books for the first time. It wasn’t an unexpected achievement, but a noteworthy one nonetheless. It confirmed what prognosticators have predicted for a decade: sooner or later, the majority of all titles—from textbooks to cook books, fictional classics to political biographies—will be distributed in electronic format. For Borders, this was a crushing blow. Unlike Barnes & Noble, which made steep investments in online books sales and digital technology, Borders did not plan adequately for the future. Take online book sales. More than a decade ago, Borders wasn’t sure how to play in the online world. After toying with an e-commerce site, it outsourced online sales to Amazon. Talk about collaborating with the enemy. Not until 2008 did Borders recognize that online book-selling had to become a core competency of the company. Since then, Borders has struggled to catch-up. Today, online hardcopy sales generate less than 3 percent of revenue for the company—less than one-third of what Barnes & Noble derives from online sales. When it comes to e-readers, Borders is even further behind. While it spun cycles mulling what to sell in its in-store canteens, Barnes & Noble made important strides developing a competitive e-reader. As of January 2011, Barnes & Noble has shipped more than 2 million Nooks, which represent one of fastest growing parts of Barnes & Nobles’ business. As for Borders, it fumbled on its e-reader strategy. It decided against creating a me-too device, choosing instead to offer the Kobo, Velocity Micro Cruz and Franklin AnyBook devices from other companies. Unfortunately for it, none of these have become big sellers. If you order a cup of coffee at a Borders canteen today, chances are you’ll see more customers with iPads or Nooks than Kobos. In that moment, you can appreciate the wisdom of developing a new business model that will carry you in the future while simultaneously optimizing the existing business model that keeps your business aloft today.

They decided to invest in opening many stores at close proximity, which proved unprofitable. Borders also failed to invest adequately in online book sales and digital technology. As competitors like Barnes & Noble proactively adapted their business models to these changes in the book market, Borders fell behind and struggled to catch up, ultimately leading to their decline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They both indicate that the highest plasma concentrations are reached after two hours when taking the substances with fatty food, and that the area under the curve (AUC) is increased by 40% due to this interaction. In the first sentence, the information is presented in a more straightforward manner. It directly states that the highest plasma concentrations are reached after two hours when taking them with fatty food, and then mentions that the area under the curve is increased by 40%. The structure of this sentence makes it easier to understand the relationship between taking the substances with fatty food and the resulting increase in plasma concentrations and area under the curve. The second sentence begins by mentioning that the highest plasma concentrations are reached when taken with fatty food, which requires the reader to infer the relationship between the two variables (fatty food and plasma concentrations). It then specifies that this occurs after two hours and results in a 40% increase in the area under the curve. The meaning is essentially the same as the first sentence, but the structure requires the reader to make connections between the different pieces of information.

PUBLISHED:. 04:40 EST, 9 September 2012. |. UPDATED:. 03:34 EST, 10 September 2012. Victim: The body of Colin Dodds was found early this morning in a pool of water. A couple were in mourning yesterday after their teenage son was found dead in a river – the third of their five children they have lost. Sixteen-year-old Colin Dodds got into difficulties while swimming with two friends on Saturday evening and disappeared under the surface before he could make it to the river bank. His body was found by police divers early yesterday. The tragedy comes three years after parents Colin, 38, and Wendy, 40, lost another son, Ryan, who died suddenly at the age of 14 from multiple organ failure. He had been diagnosed at birth with Hirschsprung’s disease, a rare condition that affects the bowels, and was on lifelong medication. The couple’s first child, Kenneth, died in 1992 at six weeks from complications associated with his premature birth. They also have two daughters, Rebecca, 19, and 13-year-old Nikkita. The family live on a close-knit estate in Bishop Auckland, County Durham, but their home appeared empty yesterday. It is thought family members had spent the night on the banks of the Wear in the town, waiting for news, until divers located Colin’s body at 4.20am. A neighbour, who didn’t want to be named, said: ‘Your heart just goes out to the family. They’ve lost three boys now, and it’s just heart-breaking. No one deserves to lose one child let alone three.’ Colin and his friends, also 16, are said to have entered the river at Batts Pool, a deep but slow-moving section of water which is a popular spot for fishing. Tragedy: Colin with his mother Wendy, centre, and sisters Nikkita, left and Rebecca. He was swimming with friends when he got into difficulties. All-night hunt: Search and rescue teams on the River Wear were called out after the alarm was raised. After his friends raised the alarm a. major search was launched, including an RAF jet which conducted an. infrared scan of the river in an attempt to locate the teenager. Chief Inspector Sukhsham Sahani of. Durham Constabulary said yesterday: ‘There’s some suggestion that Colin. was a weak swimmer. It’s too early to tell exactly why he went under. though. ‘It was a very pleasant, sunny day, but it’s not commonplace for people to actually go diving in at that particular area. ‘The Wear is well known as being unpredictable, you can never estimate the current. ‘I accept that there is a temptation. on a sunny day to paddle and play around the banks but I want to. reinforce the message to teenagers that they should be particularly. mindful of the dangers of playing by a river. ‘The family are distraught, it’s been a tragic end.’ Searching: An emergency service crew in a dinghy on the River Wear in Bishop Auckland during the hunt for missing teenager Colin Dodds. Rescue operation: A helicopter hovers over the River Wear after the teenager got into difficulties while swimming with friends. Another of the couple’s neighbours. said: ‘People don’t often go swimming there, but there’s no way I’ll let. my kids play down there any more. It’s too dangerous. The family must. be in bits about Colin.’ The teenager is the second child to die in the Wear this year. On April 27, the river was the scene. of a major search and rescue operation when eight-year-old Ian Bell was. swept to his death as he played with friends at a stretch near the Brown. Trout pub at Sunnybrow, near Willington, County Durham. The river was swollen with rainfall at the time. Ian’s body was recovered nine days later. A teenage boy has told how he desperately tried to save his best friend from a river after he began struggling in the water. A major search and rescue operation was launched after Colin Dodds, 16, got into difficulties in the River Wear at Bishop Auckland at 5.15pm. Colin and his friends Ryan Howard and Marwan Barq, both 16, had gone to cool off at an area known as Batts Pool near to the Market Square in the town when Colin disappeared. After an extensive search involving three helicopters, fire and rescue teams, police, and a Hazardous Area Response Team, Colin’s body was recovered in the early hours of Saturday morning from near the bottom of the deep section of the river, close to where his friends last saw him. Ryan, who had known Colin for around five years and described him as his best friend, told how he attempted to reach Colin before he went under the water. 'I tried to grab him and I tried to swim towards him, but I couldn’t get to him,' he said. 'I stretched my arm out, but I couldn’t reach him, he was too far away. 'He shouted he couldn’t swim, I just started panicking. I told him to kick his legs and arms as much as he could, but then I just saw his head go under and it didn’t come back up. 'I just got out and ran up to the bank to get help. A man rang for an ambulance. I was in so much shock. I was crying and shaking.' Colin and his friends had been to Darlington before they returned home to Bishop Auckland. Ryan said: 'We just went in the river to cool off because it was too hot. 'We’ve never been up this part of the river before, but we just went in. My mum woke me up on Sunday morning to tell me they had found the body at around 4am. 'As soon as I heard I just went and got some flowers and came back up the river to lay them.' Colin had just started a painting and decorating course at Bishop Auckland college with his friend. It is the second tragedy to have occurred on the river this year. In April, eight-year-old Ian Bell of Sunnybrow, County Durham, died after falling into the River Wear as he played with friends by the water near the Brown Trout pub in the village.

Write a summary based on this article: Was Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa actually not another Lisa Gherardini? That is the question which has divided the art world this week after French scientist Pascal Cotte revealed the findings of a decade's worth of work: that there is a painting underneath the surface of the Mona Lisa of a totally different woman. Leonardo's famous portrait has long been thought to be of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. It is thought the Renaissance master painted it between 1503 and 1517 while he worked in Florence, and then later in France. However, Cotte has used Layer Amplification Method (LAM), a process of projecting a series of intense lights on to the painting and measuring their reflections to see how it was created. Cotte, a LAM pioneer, explained in the BBC Two documentary The Secrets of the Mona Lisa: \\"We can now analyse exactly what is happening inside the layers of the paint and we can peel like an onion all the layers of the painting. We can reconstruct all the chronology of the creation of the painting.\\" Is this the real Mona Lisa?

This is not the same woman.\\" Instead of the front-on gaze of the Mona Lisa, this hidden portrait shows a woman looking off to the side. Cotte also claims the secret sitter has a larger head and nose, bigger hands and, importantly, smaller lips than those used for the famous Mona Lisa smile. The change in sitter could be the key to a totally different history behind the portrait. Andrew Graham Dixon, the art historian presenting the documentary, claims that \\"if this computer image represents the original portrait of Mona Lisa, it was a portrait her husband never received. Instead, Leonardo went on to paint the world's most famous picture over the top.\\" Art historians have theorised that there were two different Mona Lisa paintings for decades, including a painting dubbed the Isleworth Mona Lisa, discovered before World War I. But this discovery suggests that both portraits were painted on the same piece of wood. Graham Dixon said that the painting may have to undergo a name change, although The Louvre, where the Mona Lisa is displayed, is yet to comment. \\"There will probably be some reluctance on the part of the authorities at the Louvre in changing the title of the painting because that's what we're talking about – it's goodbye Mona Lisa, she is somebody else,\\" he said. Some historians, however, are reluctant to believe the hidden portrait is of another woman.

He told the BBC: \\"[Cottes images] are ingenious in showing what Leonardo may have been thinking about. But the idea that there is that picture as it were hiding underneath the surface is untenable. \\"I do not think there are these discreet stages which represent different portraits. I see it as more or less a continuous process of evolution. I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa.\\" The history of the world's most famous painting has been riddled with identity crises, however. Within decades of the Mona Lisa being painted, speculation began that there were a pair of similar portraits. In 1584, an artist named Giovanni Paolo Lomazzo wrote that “the two most beautiful and important portraits by Leonardo are the ‘Mona Lisa’ and the ‘Gioconda.’” ||||| Pascal Cotte, a French scientist, claims to have found another portrait beneath that of the world-famous Mona Lisa. Using reflective light technology, Cotte has spent more than 10 years analysing Leonardo Da Vinci’s masterpiece. He claims to have found an underlying image of a model looking off to the side. The Louvre Museum in Paris, which houses the work, has not commented on Cotte’s alleged discovery. The scientist is the co-founder of the Paris-based company Lumiere Technology, which works closely with galleries and museums to digitize their fine-art pieces. Its website claims to have digitized works by Marc Chagall, Claude Renoir, Pablo Picasso and Vincent Van Gogh. The Louvre granted Cotte access to the Mona Lisa in 2004, the BBC , which is airing a documentary about the discovery, reports. The hidden image lacks both the Mona Lisa’s famed direct gaze and her smile. Cotte claims he found it by projecting intense light onto the portrait. A camera then measured the lights’ reflections, which allowed Cotte to reconstruct what was created with each layer of paint. This technique is known as Layer Amplification Method. Cotte’s theory is controversial and not without its critics. He is claiming the hidden portrait represents the original “Lisa” and who we see—believed to be Lisa Gherardini, wife of a Florentine merchant—is a different person altogether. But Martin Kemp, emeritus professor of History of Art at the University of Oxford, who is quoted by the BBC, said though Cotte’s images show Da Vinci’s artistic process, they represent an evolution in the creation of the Mona Lisa rather than separate paintings. ||||| Was Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa actually not another Lisa Gherardini?

Pascal Cotte said he has spent more than 10 years using the technology to analyse the painting. He claims the earlier portrait lies hidden underneath the surface of Leonardo's most celebrated artwork. A reconstruction shows another image of a sitter looking off to the side. The Louvre Museum has declined to comment on his claims because it \\"was not part of the scientific team\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Could there be an earlier portrait underneath the world famous Mona Lisa? Instead of the famous, direct gaze of the painting which hangs in the Louvre Museum in Paris, the image of the sitter also shows no trace of her enigmatic smile, which has intrigued art lovers for more than 500 years. But Mr Cotte's claims are controversial and have divided opinion among Leonardo experts. Will Gompertz, Arts Editor I'm sceptical. It's perfectly common for an artist to overpaint an image as it is for a client who's commissioned that artist to ask for changes. So it's not surprising that there are those underpaintings on the Mona Lisa. The data that the technology generates is open to interpretation, which needs to be analysed and corroborated by the academic and curatorial community, and not just an individual. I think the Louvre's decision not to make a comment is telling. This is the world's most famous painting which, like a celebrity, always makes for a good story. But in this case I think caution is required. The scientist, who is the co-founder of Lumiere Technology in Paris, was given access to the painting in 2004 by the Louvre. He has pioneered a technique called Layer Amplification Method (LAM), which he used to analyse the Mona Lisa. Image copyright Courtesy Brinkworth Films Image caption Light technology was used on the famous painting It works by \\"projecting a series of intense lights\\" on to the painting, Mr Cotte said. A camera then takes measurements of the lights' reflections and from those measurements, Mr Cotte said he is able to reconstruct what has happened between the layers of the paint. The Mona Lisa has been the subject of several scientific examinations over more than half a century. More recent techniques include infrared inspections and multi-spectral scanning. But Mr Cotte has claimed his technique is able to penetrate more deeply into the painting. He said: \\"We can now analyse exactly what is happening inside the layers of the paint and we can peel like an onion all the layers of the painting. We can reconstruct all the chronology of the creation of the painting.\\" 'Shatter many myths' Leonardo is believed to have worked on the painting between 1503 and 1517 while working in Florence and later in France. There has long been debate about the Mona Lisa's identity. But for centuries, it has been widely believed that she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. But Mr Cotte has claimed his discoveries challenge that theory. He believes the image he has reconstructed underneath the surface of the painting is Leonardo's original Lisa, and that the portrait named Mona Lisa for more than 500 years is, in fact, a different woman. He said: \\"The results shatter many myths and alter our vision of Leonardo's masterpiece forever. \\"When I finished the reconstruction of Lisa Gherardini, I was in front of the portrait and she is totally different to Mona Lisa today. This is not the same woman.\\" He also claims to have found two more images under the surface of the painting - a shadowy outline of a portrait with a larger head and nose, bigger hands but smaller lips. And he says he has found another Madonna-style image with Leonardo's etchings of a pearl headdress. 'Mona Lisa is Lisa' But Martin Kemp, Emeritus Professor of the History of Art at the University of Oxford, is not convinced. Professor Kemp said: \\"They [Cotte's images] are ingenious in showing what Leonardo may have been thinking about. But the idea that there is that picture as it were hiding underneath the surface is untenable. \\"I do not think there are these discrete stages which represent different portraits. I see it as more or less a continuous process of evolution. I am absolutely convinced that the Mona Lisa is Lisa. \\" Art historian Andrew Graham-Dixon has made a new BBC documentary called The Secrets of the Mona Lisa, studying historical documents linked to the painting alongside Mr Cotte's scientific findings. Mr Graham-Dixon said: \\"I have no doubt that this is definitely one of the stories of the century. \\"There will probably be some reluctance on the part of the authorities at the Louvre in changing the title of the painting because that's what we're talking about - it's goodbye Mona Lisa, she is somebody else.\\" Mr Cotte announced the findings of his latest research at a press conference in Shanghai on Tuesday. They will be included in an exhibition, Da Vinci - The Genius, which features displays of his research on the Mona Lisa over the last 11 years. The show has travelled around the world and opens in Shanghai this week. The Secrets of the Mona Lisa is on BBC Two at 21:00 GMT on 9 December. ||||| Summary:","completion":"The identity of the subject of Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa has long been debated, with many art historians believing she is Lisa Gherardini, the wife of a Florentine silk merchant. However, a recent discovery by French scientist Pascal Cotte has reignited the debate. Cotte revealed that underneath the surface of the Mona Lisa is a painting of a completely different woman. Using Layer Amplification Method (LAM), Cotte studied the famous portrait and reconstructed the hidden layers he found beneath its surface, leading him to his conclusion that the hidden portrait is not the same woman as the Mona Lisa. This has led to disagreements among art historians and experts, with some stating that Cotte's claims are \\"untenable\\" and that the hidden portrait does not change the identity of the famous painting's subject. The Louvre Museum, where the Mona Lisa is displayed, has not yet commented on the discovery."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: A \\"skybike\\", a one-man, open-cockpit flying machine, attacks Dogen. Dogen shoots it down and finds one of Syn's crystals on the pilot's body. Carved into the crystal is a symbol of a dead tree. Dogen finds a murdered prospector, whose young daughter Dhyana saw him killed by Baal, Jared Syn's half-cyborg son. Baal sprayed the man with a green liquid that caused a nightmare dream-state, in which Syn appeared and executed him with a crystal. Dogen convinces Dhyana to help him find Syn. Dhyana takes Dogen to Zax, who identifies the crystal as a lifeforce storage device. Dhyana tells them about the ancient Cyclopians who once used such devices and says the only power against it is a magic mask located in their lost city. Zax affirms this and directs Dogen to find a prospector named Rhodes in the nearby mining town of Zhor. Dogen and Dhyana are blocked by vehicles driven by nomads commanded by Baal, who sprays Dogen with the green liquid, paralyzing him. Dhyana drives them off and cares for Dogen, who in the dream world finds Syn and Baal looming over him. Syn fails to pull Dogen away from Dhyana: their will is too strong. Dogen awakes, but Dhyana is suddenly teleported away. A summoned monster appears in her place and fires electric bolts at him. Dhyana simultaneously faces Syn in his lair. Dogen shorts-out the creature, and it vanishes. Dogen arrives in Zhor and finds Rhodes, a washed-up soldier, in a bar. Rhodes denies the lost city's existence and refuses to get involved. Dogen leaves and comes upon a group of miners beating a captured nomad soldier. Dogen assists him, and the miners turn hostile.

Therefore, the more suitable ending for this sentence would be: Justin demonstrated to Craig the proper way to blow a Shofar. (B) Craig was impressed. To better understand the situation, let's analyze the context. The Shofar is an ancient musical instrument, traditionally made from a ram's horn, and it has a significant role in Jewish religious rituals and ceremonies. Blowing the Shofar is considered a skill that requires proper technique and practice. In this case, Justin is the one with the knowledge and ability to blow the Shofar correctly. He takes the time to share this skill with Craig, who may not have prior experience or may be struggling to produce the appropriate sounds. By demonstrating the proper technique, Justin is likely trying to help Craig improve his own Shofar-blowing abilities or to simply familiarize Craig with the unique traditions surrounding the instrument. As Justin demonstrates his expertise in blowing the Shofar, it makes more sense that Craig, the one learning from Justin, would be the one to be impressed. This displays the effectiveness of Justin's demonstration, as well as Craig's appreciation for the newfound knowledge. In this context, ending the sentence with \\"Craig was impressed\\" acknowledges the successful sharing of a skill between two individuals and highlights the value of learning from others' experiences and expertise."},{"prompt":"Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: The film depicts the life of Bodhidharma (Suriya), a master of martial arts and medical remedies, who is depicted in the film as the son of a great Tamil king of the Pallava Dynasty.

(His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \\"child\\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work.

It shows that for a tax rate above a certain critical rate, government revenue starts decreasing as the tax rate rises, as a consequence of a decline in labour supply. This theory supports that, if the tax rate is above that critical point, a decrease in the tax rate should imply a rise in labour supply that in turn would lead to an increase in government revenue. Paragraph: After the second world war Germany and France took two different policies in respect to taxation. After the war Germany, then West Germany, has mostly elected pro-capitalist governments. As a consequence, Germany implemented tax rate below the critical rate. But France took the other way. Their mostly pro-socialist governments implemented tax rate above the critical rate. As a result, businesses had to make informed decisions while doing business in these countries. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country would have higher labor supply in response to their taxation? A:","completion":"Given the paragraph above, Germany would have a higher labor supply in response to their taxation. This is because Germany implemented tax rates below the critical rate, which according to the Laffer curve encourages an increase in labor supply.

He was known for transitioning from the traditional national or feudal levies to employing paid troops of domestic retinues and foreign mercenaries, which became a more common practice across Europe during that period. This approach allowed him to have a more effective and reliable military force, which played a significant role in the Hundred Years' War between England and France. European military forces, such as the Swiss soldiers, were in particularly high demand due to their reputation as skilled fighters. Concurrently, this period also marked the emergence of the first permanent armies, with Valois France playing a key role in the development of permanent armed forces in response to the challenges brought about by the Hundred Years' War."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the question based on the following text. Question: A rocket would only be able to fly low if its mass were higher or lower? Text: By using multiple stages, empty fuel containers could drop away. This reduced the mass of the rocket so that it could fly higher. The answer to this question is:","completion":"A rocket would only be able to fly low if its mass were higher. The given text mentions that using multiple stages allows empty fuel containers to drop away, which in turn reduces the mass of the rocket, enabling it to fly higher. The principle behind this is based on the fundamental physics of rocket propulsion, where the rocket's mass plays a crucial role in determining its ability to reach higher altitudes. As a rocket consumes fuel during its flight, its mass decreases, making it easier for the remaining fuel to push the rocket to greater heights. According to Newton's second law of motion, the force experienced by an object is directly proportional to its mass and acceleration (F = m*a). In the case of a rocket, the force generated by the combustion of fuel must counteract both the downward force of gravity and provide sufficient acceleration to propel the rocket upwards. If the rocket has a high mass due to extra fuel or additional payload, the force required to lift it into higher altitudes increases accordingly. This increased force requirement may result in the rocket not being able to generate enough thrust to overcome the gravitational force acting on it, and consequently, the rocket would only be able to fly low. Conversely, by reducing its mass, as in the multiple-stage rocket example shared in the text, the force requirement decreases, allowing the rocket to ascend to a higher altitude."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Q: Q: If no unbalanced force acts on an object the object remains at constant velocity or what? A: A:","completion":"If no unbalanced force acts on an object, the object remains at constant velocity. This statement can be justified using Newton's first law of motion, also known as the law of inertia. Step 1: Understand Newton's first law of motion. Newton's first law states that an object at rest will stay at rest, and an object in motion will stay in motion with a constant velocity, unless acted upon by an unbalanced force. Step 2: Define constant velocity. Constant velocity means that an object is moving with a steady speed in a straight line and not changing direction. Step 3: Apply Newton's first law to the given situation. If no unbalanced force is acting on an object, then there is no external influence causing it to change its current state of motion. Therefore, the object will maintain its current velocity. If it was initially at rest, it will remain at rest. If it was initially in motion, it will continue to move with a constant velocity. Conclusion: If no unbalanced force acts on an object, the object remains at constant velocity or, if the object was initially at rest, it will remain at rest.

Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua? Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas. They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. Hint: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and the hint, the ecosystem functions would likely be less stable in England than in Nicaragua. Nicaragua is one of the most biodiverse countries in the Americas, with a vast array of species in various ecological communities. This high level of biodiversity contributes to the efficiency of resource capture, biomass production, decomposition, and recycling of essential nutrients within its ecosystems. Biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions over time, as diverse communities are more productive due to the presence of key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms that increase total resource capture. On the other hand, centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have significantly reduced the biodiversity in England, making it one of the least biodiverse places on Earth. As a result, the ecosystem functions in England would likely be less stable compared to those in biodiversity-rich Nicaragua. This is because the diminished biodiversity in England hampers the efficiency of resource capture, biomass production, decomposition, and recycling of essential nutrients, leading to less stable ecosystems. Furthermore, the impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change. Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than just a single process at a single place and time. Therefore, the lower levels of biodiversity in England compared to Nicaragua would lead to less stability in ecosystem functions across the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Which farm didn't provide extended time for AM fungi growth into the autumn? Two farms used AM fungi for the plants. Brown farm also decided to grow cover crops on those parcels of land to help mycorrhizal growth. Orange farm didn't grow cover crops. Hint: Since AM fungi are biotrophic, they are dependent on plants for the growth of their hyphal networks. Growing a cover crop extends the time for AM growth into the autumn, winter, and spring. Promotion of hyphal growth creates a more extensive hyphal network. The mycorrhizal colonization increase found in cover crops systems may be largely attributed to an increase in the extraradical hyphal network that can colonize the roots of the new crop (Boswell et al. 1998). The extraradical mycelia are able to survive the winter, providing rapid spring colonization and early season symbiosis (McGonigle and Miller 1999). This early symbiosis allows plants to tap into the well-established hyphal network and be supplied with adequate phosphorus nutrition during early growth, which greatly improves the crop yield.

Movie title: The Driller Killer Movie plot: Artist Reno Miller (Abel Ferrara) and his girlfriend Carol enter a Catholic church, where he approaches an elderly bearded man (revealed as a derelict) kneeling at the pulpit. The derelict seizes Reno's hand, causing him and Carol to flee from the church, unknown to him that the derelict contained a paper with Reno's information and requested a meeting with him. Later, at his apartment, Reno receives a large phone bill and cannot pay his rent. He shares with Carol and her lover Pamela, in a derelict-filled neighbourhood in Union Square. Reno visits Dalton, a gallery owner, and tells him that he is currently painting a masterpiece. Reno asks for a weekâs extension and a loan of 500 to cover the rent, however Dalton refuses, saying that he already lent enough money to Reno. However, if he finishes a satisfactory painting in one week Dalton will buy it for the necessary amount. The following day, a No Wave band entitled the Roosters begin practising their music in a nearby apartment, in which the music makes Reno unnerved and frustrated. At 2:00 in the morning, Reno becomes more agitated from the Roosters' music while painting. After seeing his own image saturated in blood, Reno walks in the dark. He sees an elderly derelict sleeping in a garbage-strewn alley, where he takes him down an alley where gang members are seen chasing another bum. Reno drops the bum and vows that he will not end up like a derelict. The next day, Reno complains about the Roosters to their landlord. However, the landlord refuses to act because the music does not bother him. He gives Reno a skinned rabbit for dinner, but instead demands the rent money. Reno takes the rabbit home and repeatedly stabs it while preparing it. During a brief reprieve from the music, Reno mentally hears voices calling his name and sees an image of an eyeless Carol.

Sahara: People lived on the edge of the desert thousands of years ago since the last ice age. The Sahara was then a much wetter place than it is today. Over 30,000 petroglyphs of river animals such as crocodiles survive, with half found in the Tassili n'Ajjer in southeast Algeria. Fossils of dinosaurs, including Afrovenator, Jobaria and Ouranosaurus, have also been found here. The modern Sahara, though, is not lush in vegetation, except in the Nile Valley, at a few oases, and in the northern highlands, where Mediterranean plants such as the olive tree are found to grow. It was long believed that the region had been this way since about 1600 BCE, after shifts in the Earth's axis increased temperatures and decreased precipitation.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Adam and his older brother Chris were born almost 15 years apart from each other. Adam is 27 now which means Chris is 41. Lately Chris has started noticing grey hairs come in. When Adam and him play games together Chris also seems to lose more often now even though historically he has always been better. But I can use this background: Middle adulthood lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this stage of life, many people raise a family and strive to attain career goals. They start showing physical signs of aging, such as wrinkles and gray hair. Typically, vision, strength and reaction time start declining. Diseases such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer are often diagnosed during this stage of life. These diseases are also the chief causes of death in middle adulthood. What is an answer for this question: Which brother is likely experiencing a decline in strength, Adam or Chris? The answer is:","completion":"Chris is the brother who is likely experiencing a decline in strength. This conclusion can be drawn based on the information provided about middle adulthood and the background of Adam and Chris. Middle adulthood is a stage of life that typically lasts from the mid-30s to the mid-60s. During this time, many individuals experience various physical and health-related changes as they age. Some of these changes may include the development of wrinkles, the growth of grey hair, and a decline in vision, strength, and reaction time. Unfortunately, it is also during this stage of life that people are often diagnosed with serious health concerns, such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular or heart disease, and cancer. Given that Adam is currently 27 years old, he has not yet reached the stage of middle adulthood. On the other hand, Chris is 41 years old, placing him firmly within the middle adulthood age range. As a result, it is more likely that Chris would be experiencing age-related changes and declines in physical abilities, such as a decrease in strength. Furthermore, the information provided suggests that Chris is noticing grey hairs coming in, and he is losing more often when playing games with Adam, even though historically he has always been better. This could be an indication that Chris is experiencing some of the common declines associated with middle adulthood, such as a decreased reaction time and potentially reduced strength. This further supports the conclusion that Chris is the brother experiencing a decline in strength. In summary, based on the information provided about middle adulthood and the ages and experiences of both brothers, it is most likely that Chris, the older brother, is experiencing a decline in strength as he is within the age range for middle adulthood and has shown signs of age-related changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a goal: How should you hold your hands on the keyboard when playing piano so as to prevent injury and strain? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of holding hands correctly on the keyboard while playing the piano so as to prevent injury and strain, I would follow these steps: 1. Sit in a proper position: To avoid strain and promote better hand posture, sit in a comfortable position with your feet flat on the ground and your back straight. The height of the piano stool should be adjusted so that your elbows are level with the keys. 2. Align wrists and forearms: Keep your wrists and forearms aligned in a straight line. Avoid flexing your wrists too far up or down, which can cause strain over time. Your wrists should be relaxed and slightly curved. 3. Curve your fingers: Position your fingers in a natural curve over the keys. This means that your knuckles should be slightly rounded and not flat. Avoid overly stretching your fingers or keeping them too straight, as this can lead to tension. 4. Use fingertip contact: Make contact with the keys using the pads of your fingertips, not the very tips. This allows for better control and can help prevent strain. 5. Maintain proper thumb position: Your thumb should be slightly bent and rest on the side of the key or just below it, rather than resting flat on top of the key. 6. Avoid excessive force: When playing the piano, avoid using excessive force or tension when pressing the keys. This can cause muscle strain and lead to injury. Instead, aim for a gentle touch that still produces a clear tone. 7. Regular breaks and stretches: To prevent strain and injury, take regular breaks while practicing. Stretch your fingers, hands, and arms during these breaks to help maintain flexibility and alleviate any tension. 8. Practice good posture: Good posture is essential for overall well-being and also for preventing strain in your hands and wrists. Make sure that your shoulders are relaxed and not hunched up, and that your neck and spine are in a neutral position. By following these steps, I would ensure proper hand positioning and technique when playing the piano, which can help prevent injury and strain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Francis Piol Bol Bok (born February 1979), a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan, was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States. On May 15, 1986, he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of Nyamlel in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War. Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in Kurdufan, Sudan, followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo, Egypt. Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom. Seven-year-old Bok was captured by Giemma, a member of the slave hunting militia, who forced him to join a caravan of slaves, stolen produce, livestock and wares that the militia had captured in their raid of the Dinka settlement. When the members of the militia split up to return to their homes, Bok was taken by Giemma. Upon arriving at Giemma's residence, Francis was beaten by his captor's children with sticks and was called abeed. The word literally means \\"slave\\" and the stereotype is that of an inferior, demeaned, Negroid race. Francis was given quarters in a hovel near the pens of Giemma's livestock. Bok began a ten-year period of slavery at the hands of Giemma and his son Hamid. He was forced to tend the family's herds of livestock. He had to take them to pastures in the area and to local watering holes, where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock. He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was not going to be able to save him. His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile, as they were speaking Arabic, which he could not understand; they also seemed afraid to speak to him. According to Bok, as he grew older, Giemma and Hamid began to place more trust in his abilities as a herdsman. Care of the cattle, horses and camels was passed to Bok and he was able to spend more time alone with the animals. Previously he had been under the careful supervision of Hamid and sometimes Giemma. In addition to having him serve as his slave, Giemma forced Francis to convert to Islam and to take the Arabic name of Abdul Rahman, meaning \\"servant of the compassionate one.\\" In his autobiography, Francis states that although he was forced to convert to Islam, that he never stopped praying to God for strength to get him through his ordeal. Bok tried twice to flee from slavery at the age of 14. The first instance happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle. Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma's fellow militia members. Giemma's peer returned Francis to the Giemma's compound, where he was beaten with a bullwhip. Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later, when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape. He once again fled for several miles, this time keeping to the forest. He stopped for water at a local stream crossing, where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well. Giemma forced Francis back to his home, this time promising to kill him. Francis was beaten again, but Giemma chose not to kill him, as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave.

Stanley Kirk Burrell (born March 30, 1962), better known by his stage name MC Hammer (or simply Hammer), is an American hip hop recording artist, dancer, record producer and entrepreneur. He had his greatest commercial success and popularity from the late 1980s, until the early 1990s. Remembered for his rapid rise to fame, Hammer is known for hit records (such as \\"U Can't Touch This\\" and \\"2 Legit 2 Quit\\"), flashy dance movements, choreography and eponymous Hammer pants. A multi-award winner, M.C. Hammer is considered a \\"forefather/pioneer\\" and innovator of pop rap (incorporating elements of freestyle music), and is the first hip hop artist to achieve diamond status for an album. In the mid-1980s while rapping in small venues and after a record deal went sour, Hammer borrowed US20,000 each from former Oakland A's players Mike Davis and Dwayne Murphy to start a record label business called Bust It Productions. He kept the company going by selling records from his basement and car. Bust It spawned Bustin' Records, the independent label of which Hammer was CEO. Together, the companies had more than 100 employees. Recording singles and selling them out of the trunk of his car, he marketed himself relentlessly. Coupled with his dance abilities, Hammer's style was unique at the time. Now billing himself as \\"M.C. Hammer\\", he recorded his debut album, Feel My Power, which was produced between 1986 and 1987 and released independently in 1987 on his Oaktown Records label (Bustin'). It was produced by Felton Pilate (of Con Funk Shun), and sold over 60,000 copies and was being distributed by City Hall Records. In the spring of 1988, a 107.7 KSOL Radio DJ Tony Valera played the track \\"Let's Get It Started\\" in his mix-shows--a song in which he declared he was \\"second to none, from Doug E. Fresh, LL Cool J, or DJ Run\\"--after which the track began to gain popularity in clubs. (He would continue to call out other East Coast rappers in future projects as well.) Hammer also released a single called \\"Ring 'Em\\", and largely on the strength of tireless street marketing by Hammer and his wife, plus continued radio mix-show play, it achieved considerable popularity at dance clubs in the San Francisco Bay Area. Heartened by his rising prospects, Hammer launched into seven-day-a-week rehearsals with the growing troupe of dancers, musicians, and backup vocalists he had hired. It was Hammer's stage show, and his infectious stage presence, that led to his big break in 1988 while performing in an Oakland club. There he impressed a record executive who \\"didn't know who he was, but knew he was somebody\\", according to the New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock & Roll. M.C.Hammer had received several offers from major record labels before (which he initially declined due to his personal success), but after the successful release of this independent album and elaborate live dance show amazed the Capitol Records executive, Hammer agreed to sign a record deal soon after. Hammer took home a US1,750,000 advance and a multi-album contract. It didn't take long for Capitol to recoup its investment.","completion":"This text is about Stanley Kirk Burrell, better known by his stage name MC Hammer (or simply Hammer), an American hip hop recording artist, dancer, record producer, and entrepreneur."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(Interscope Records via Associated Press) Gradually we are losing all our special skills as a species. I can barely hunt. I could not gather if you told me my life depended on it. And now we can’t read, either. Over the portal to the ancient world was written “Know Thyself.” Over the portal to ours will be written “TL; DR.” We used to think that reading was like jogging or quitting drinking: We could do it at any time if we really wanted to. But it turns out to really be like jogging or quitting drinking: We actually cannot do unless we put our mind to it right now. Reading apparently is a habit that can be unlearned, like politeness and having an attention span of more than 15 seconds. “Skimming and scanning have altered our brains,” according to the headline of an article that I skimmed and scanned quickly. Reading is something we have taught ourselves to do, as a species, painstakingly over time. But spend enough time reading tiny pieces of material, and you won’t be able to enjoy Herman Hesse any more, even if you were the sort of person who would have enjoyed Hesse in the first place.

It is not your brain’s fault, the researchers say. It only wants to please you. It assumes that this is what you are looking for. We are making it harder for our brains to read books, so that when we do read books we don’t enjoy them so we don’t read as often, so it just gets harder and harder and less and less pleasant until eventually we stop altogether and everyone just agrees to write for television.

Moscow (CNN) -- Divers have completed their search of a Russian cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives, the Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN Friday. The official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women, 28 children and 20 men, the ministry said. The bodies of 15 people are still missing. There were 208 people on the \\"Bulgaria\\" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. \\"We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,\\" Levitin said. Specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts. Four people face criminal charges over the sinking of the ship, which Russian media have called the most devastating river accident in the country's history.

Given the question: Given the following context: In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally (\\"Just You Wait\\"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally \\"gets it\\" (\\"The Rain in Spain\\"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable upper class accent (\\"I Could Have Danced All Night\\"). answer the following question: What's the last name of the man that will pay for Eliza's lessons, if successful?

It was a made-for-TV moment that all presidents would relish, but it seemed especially significant for the man who turned a reality TV career into a successful bid for the presidency. Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is likely true about President Trump? The answer is:","completion":"It is likely true that President Trump relishes in made-for-TV moments and is skillful at leveraging them to his advantage, as demonstrated by his triumphant greeting of the three Americans released by North Korea.

Trump's presidency has been marked by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama, including the ongoing Russia investigation, legal issues involving his personal lawyer Michael Cohen, and the Stormy Daniels scandal. Despite the numerous distractions, Trump continues to garner support, especially regarding his North Korea policy, with a new CNN poll revealing that 77% of those surveyed support his meeting with Kim Jong Un, and 53% approve of his handling of the North Korea issue in general.

What is it like to be a refugee? pick from the following. (i) no. (ii) yes. The answer is:","completion":"(i) no. Although the two questions may seem similar, they are not the same. There are several reasons behind this difference: 1. Specificity: The first question specifically refers to the experience of Syrian refugees, while the second question is more general and can encompass the experiences of refugees from various countries and regions. The challenges, experiences, and circumstances a Syrian refugee may face can differ from those of other refugees, depending on the country they are from, the reasons they had to flee, and the host country where they seek asylum or resettlement. 2. Context: The Syrian refugee crisis, which began in 2011, has resulted from a long-lasting, brutal civil war that has led millions of people to leave the country in search of safety. In contrast, the term \\"refugee\\" could refer to any individual who has fled their country due to persecution, war, violence, or natural disaster. As different conflicts or situations force people to become refugees, the experiences of these individuals could diverge significantly based on the specificities of their personal backgrounds and the crises they escaped. 3. Cultural Background: Each refugee comes from a unique cultural background that influences their experiences after displacement. Syrian refugees, for example, have their own language, customs, and traditions, while refugees from other parts of the world will have distinct cultural attributes. This can have a substantial impact on their integration process in host countries and their overall experience as refugees. 4. Host Country Reception: The host countries' response to refugees can be different, depending on the origin and cultural background of the refugee population. Syrian refugees have faced varying acceptance and integration experiences in different host countries. Comparatively, refugees from other parts of the world might encounter distinct challenges or opportunities based on the host countries' policies, social attitudes, and systems of support. 5. Access to Resettlement and Assistance: The level of international aid and assistance provided to refugees can vary depending on the crisis' scale and the specific situation they face. The global response to the Syrian refugee crisis has been significant but inadequate in many aspects, with numerous refugees living in camps or struggling to integrate into host countries. Refugees from different regions or crises may receive different levels of support or attention, which can shape the refugee experience. In summary, while both questions seek to understand the experiences of individuals displaced from their homes, the first question explicitly delves into the challenges and context faced by Syrian refugees. Comparatively, the second question broadly refers to the refugee experience, with an array of potential answers that cover the diverse situations faced by refugees worldwide.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Kenneth William Kavanaugh (November 23, 1916 - January 25, 2007) was an American football player, coach, and scout. He played professionally in the National Football League (NFL) for the Chicago Bears as an end from 1940 to 1950, except for three seasons during which he served in World War II. He led the league in receiving touchdowns twice, and is a member of the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team. He is the Bears' all-time leader in receiving touchdowns, with 50. After the war, he continued his career with the Bears. In 1945 he had 543 yards and six touchdowns, and in 1946 had 337 yards and five touchdowns. Three of his touchdowns in 1946 came in a 27-21 win over the Los Angeles Rams in week seven. The Bears defeated the New York Giants 24-14 in the 1946 NFL Championship Game, which gave Kavanaugh his third league championship with the team. The first touchdown of the game was a 21-yard pass from Luckman to Kavanaugh. After the season, he was named to the United Press All-NFL first team. Kavanaugh had his most productive season statistically in 1947. He had career highs with 32 receptions, 881 yards, and 13 touchdowns. He set a Bears record by recording a receiving touchdown in seven straight games, a streak that began with a three-touchdown game against the Boston Yanks in week six. His 13 receiving touchdowns led the league, and he earned his second straight first-team All-NFL selection from the United Press. Kavanaugh was named to his third straight All-NFL first team in 1948, and he again led the league in receiving touchdowns in 1949, with nine. His most productive single-game yardage performance came in his final season, in 1950 against the Yanks, as he caught eight passes for 177 yards and a touchdown. Kavanaugh spent a total of eight seasons in Chicago. He spent the majority of his career catching passes from quarterbacks Sid Luckman and Johnny Lujack. He remains the Bears' career leader in touchdown receptions, with 50. He also holds franchise records for highest career and single season yards-per-reception. His 13 touchdown receptions in 1947 is a single season Bears record he shares with Dick Gordon, who tied it in 1970. In 1969, Kavanaugh was voted by sportswriters to the NFL 1940s All-Decade Team.

The first thing was an Afghan blanket at a church raffle when he was 25 years old. But this was much bigger: it was 120,000! He had won the Big Cube, a state lottery game. To win, a contestant must first guess which number a spinning cube will stop on. The cube has six numbers on it: 1X, 10X, 50X, 100X, 500X, and 1000X. If he is correct, the contestant must then guess which of two selected variables is going to be greater. So, just guessing which number appears on the cube does not guarantee that you will win any money. Sam correctly guessed 1000X, but he still had to choose between two variables. One variable was the number of cars that would run the stop sign at Hill Street and Lake Avenue in six hours. The other variable was the number of times that a teenage boy would change TV channels in a three-hour period. This was a tough decision. Finally, Sam flipped a coin. It came up heads, so Sam picked the teenager. He picked right. The stop sign was run only 76 times, but the teen clicked 120 times. Sixty-year-old Sam jumped for joy, for he had just won 1000 times 120, or 120,000. Sam dreamily left the lottery studio. Talking excitedly on his cell phone while crossing the street, he got hit by a little sports car. Sam is slowly getting better. He was in the hospital for a month. His hospital bill was 110,000.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) Question: What is most likely the author's occupation?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In a way this is the disaster Fellini has been working towards all his life. The line between absurd masterpiece and free association bullshit is very small, and what category a film will ultimately fit in will often just depend on personal feelings. That said, \\"Casanova\\" left me in cold admiration for its sets and little more that cannot be summed up more adequately by Bukowski: \\"Casanova died too, just an old guy with a big cock and a long tongue and no guts at all. to say that he lived well is true; to say I could spit on his grave without feeling is also true. the ladies usually go for the biggest fool they can find; that is why the human race stands where it does today: we have bred the clever and lasting Casanovas, all hollow inside, like the Easter bunnies we foster upon our poor children.\\" As far as I could make it out, this is the position Fellini takes regarding his subject; granted, with more empathy, but disgusted nonetheless. Casanova's environment is made from decay and incestuous behavior, themes Fellini dealt with more pointedly in \\"Satyricon\\". The succession of plot is characteristic of soft porn, just without the coherence; and Donald Sutherland is ugly and slimy to the point of distraction.

Write highlights for this article: Winning everything suits Paul Pogba. While France now look unrecognisable from the disgraced 2010 World Cup 'team', and regardless of what happens in Friday's quarter-final, will return home to an appreciative welcome, the Juventus ace will probably feel short-changed. That is simply his nature. The 21-year old fears no-one and backs himself, permanently and unreservedly. His single-mindedness has raised eyebrows, yet, given his spectacular rise and success, does not appear to have harmed him. The only way is up: Pogba points to the heavens after scoring in France's win against Nigeria. Eyes on the prize: Pogba follows the flight of the ball before looping a header to make it 1-0. His headed goal against Nigeria last night is another step toward tightening his grip on his place in France's midfield, within a squad bursting with positivity. In many ways, the most exciting element now, for quarter-finalists France, is what the next tournament holds. A future under Didier Deschamps is tantalising with promise, punctuated by the younger and hugely motivated players. Moreover, this World Cup has proven those who are bursting onto the scene are capable of carving out victories, not just making individual impressions. Full flow: Pogba powers past Ogenyi Onazi during France's last-16 victory at Estadio Nacional. Technique: The midfielder forced Vincent Enyeama into making a fine stop from this well-struck volley. Mentor: World Cup winner and current France boss Didier Deschamps congratulates Pogba at full-time. There was room for both Pogba and benched Real Sociedad winger, Antoine Griezmann, to start. It wouldn't have been placing all unhatched eggs into one basket. Yet the eternally inconsistent, always either brilliant or thoroughly pedestrian, Olivier Giroud, started and not until the substitution could Karim Benzema rifle through the middle in his preferred position. Pogba may feel as if he were slightly isolated in the first half, but trebled his effort after the break and certainly didn't look at risk of receiving a second back-heel nutmeg from John Obi Mikel. The dynamic among individuals in France is curious. Giroud smiles, while aware of his dips in form. Benzema is rebuilding his own pride, slowly, the ache of having his dedication, and even ability, questioned during a goalless period for France which lasted 1,224 minutes, finally ending - after 58 shots – against Australia in October last year. Graceful: Pogba controls the ball brilliantly during Juventus' Europa League clash against Benfica. Formidable: At Juventus, Arturo Vidal and Pogba have formed an exceptional central-midfield partnership. Pogba is a talisman, buoyed by a solid two years – and two Scudetti – at Juve, adorned with a £60million price tag and reported keen interest from Chelsea. In a similar manner to how the phrase 'complete midfielder' has been bestowed on Monaco's Columbian James Rodriguez, it has been afforded to Pogba. Forward runs, technical ability and the well-handled assurance which comes from being both young and having played at the top level. Of course, the Under-20 World Cup winner is also a complete joy to watch. Curled free kicks into top netting are one thing, following that curve which, with Pogba, starts from a skip onto a moving ball and shifts into a volley is poetic. Let go: Pogba in action for United's youth team in an FA Youth Cup semi-final versus Chelsea. Stalled: But the Frenchman was given few first-team opportunities at Old Trafford by Sir Alex Ferguson. Then there's the love lost in England. While Manchester United fans will be looking in healthy anticipation to the fabulous Dutch master, Louis Van Gaal, channel-hopping through highlights of Pogba's artistry will perhaps grate. Having completed his transfer to Old Trafford in October 2009, Pogba went on to score seven goals in 21 appearances for the under-18 team, prompting Sir Alex Ferguson to promote him, alongside three other academy players, to the first team. Fergie saw his remarkable ability early on, tactically observing if Pogba were to have been held back, he would leave for another club. What he may not have accounted for, however, is how 'special treatment' is exactly why Pogba looked elsewhere. He signed for Juventus in summer 2012, complaining of how United had forced him to train alone, and somehow disrespected his status as 'an athlete, not a footballer'. Specimen: Pogba is tall, muscular and quick on the ball, making him a nightmare for his opponents. Powerful: Pogba has emerged as one of the most complete midfielders in Europe during his time in Serie A. Cynics, or perhaps just most of us, who fail to make this professional distinction, predicted another 'Le Sulk' in the making. Pogba's attitude was frequently a point of discussion, the prodigious talent criticised for what many saw as petulance and arrogance, but for Juventus boss Antonio Conte, demonstrated an iron-cast ambition. Conte praised Pogba for his response to picking up the Golden Boy award in December last year, Tuttosport's annual award for recognising the best Under-21 footballer in Europe. The player said he wanted to win 'everything', and some interpreted this as if the award were a tick in a box rather than an achievement to savour. What could have been: United let Pogba leave and now he has become a star for club and country. Conte, in a far more measured way than those who scrutinise each of Pogba's actions to deride, said it showed hunger and was certainly not disrespectful. What is seldom open for debate, is Pogba's pronounced domestic form. Few managers are in a position to guarantee first-team football during academy graduates' contract negotiations, therefore United fans shrugged him off. Maybe now, they wonder what could have been.","completion":"Paul Pogba's exceptional performance as part of the French football team is garnering attention and appreciation from fans and experts alike. The 21-year-old midfielder has played a crucial role in his team's success and the recent victory against Nigeria saw Pogba scoring the winning goal. Pogba's determination and single-minded focus have been the driving forces behind his rise in the football world. Under the guidance of World Cup winner and current France boss Didier Deschamps, Pogba's future looks promising. The French team's dynamic is backed by younger, highly motivated players coalescing around Pogba as a talisman. Pogba's time at Juventus, winning two Scudetti and attracting a £60 million price tag, has significantly boosted his confidence and abilities. His skills and stature on the field have earned him the title of 'complete midfielder,' similar to Monaco's James Rodriguez. Pogba's journey from a youth team player to a rising star of the football world has not been without challenges. Sir Alex Ferguson's decision to hold Pogba back in the first team at Manchester United led to Pogba seeking opportunities elsewhere, signing with Juventus in 2012. While some saw his move and attitude as evidence of arrogance or petulance, others, notably Juventus boss Antonio Conte, credited Pogba's ambition. Pogba's domestic form and continued success on the international stage have led many fans and commentators to wonder what could have been if Manchester United had given him more opportunities. Regardless, Pogba's upward trajectory shows no signs of slowing down as he continues to win accolades for his club and country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His wife Jessie (Fawcett) has begun an adulterous relationship with a youth minister named Horace. She refuses Sonny's desire to reconcile, although she assures him that she will not interfere with his right to see his children. She has also conspired to use their church's bylaws to have him removed from power. Sonny asks God what to do but receives no answer. Much of the congregation sides with Jessie in this dispute. Sonny, however, refuses to start a new church, insisting that the one which forced him out was \\"his\\" church. At his child's Little League game, Sonny, in an emotional and drunken fit, attacks Horace with a bat and puts him into a coma; Horace later dies. A fleeing Sonny ditches his car in a river and gets rid of all identifying information. After destroying all evidence of his past, Sonny rebaptizes himself and anoints himself as \\"The Apostle E. F.\\" He leaves Texas and ends up in the bayous of Louisiana, where he convinces a retired minister named Blackwell (Beasley) to help him start a new church. He works various odd jobs and uses the money to build the church, and to buy time to preach on a local radio station. Sonny also begins a dating relationship with the station's receptionist (Richardson). With Sonny's energy and charisma, the church soon has a faithful and racially integrated flock. Sonny even succeeds in converting a racist construction worker (Thornton) who shows up at a church picnic intent on destruction. While at work in a local diner, Sonny sees his new girlfriend out in public with her husband and children, apparently reconciled. Sonny walks out, vowing never to return there. Jessie hears a radio broadcast of the Apostle E. F. and calls the police on Sonny. The police show up in the middle of an evening service but allow Sonny to finish it while they wait outside. In the poignant finale, Sonny delivers an impassioned sermon before telling his flock that he has to go. In the final scene, Sonny, now part of a chain gang,...

Okay so whats the big deal? Because its so easy to accidently hit a button because the buttons are so sensitive. Everytime I sit on the couch, or clean the living room, I somehow end up hitting the remote and turning the PS3 system on. So then someone, not paying attention, turns the PS3 on by hitting the remote, they leave the room and then the PS3 is left on ALL DAY! NOT GOOD! I hate the feature, just give me one red button playstation, I think we can all be smart enough to find it. The remote is down right annoying. A:","completion":"Based on the customer's review, it can be concluded that he is dissatisfied with the product. The title of the review \\"Any button turns PS3 on, ANNOYING!!!!\\" clearly highlights the customer's frustration regarding a particular feature of the remote. Furthermore, the customer uses strong negative language throughout the review, such as \\"absolutely frustrating,\\" \\"stupid remote,\\" \\"so sensitive,\\" \\"NOT GOOD!,\\" and \\"downright annoying.\\" The primary reason for the customer's dissatisfaction has to do with the design of the remote, which has highly sensitive buttons. The customer finds it problematic because it causes the PS3 system to turn on accidentally when one of the buttons is pressed inadvertently. The occurrence of this issue seems frequent, as it happens when the customer sits on the couch or cleans the living room, which further escalates his frustration. The customer also points out the inconvenience caused by this issue. When someone unconsciously presses a button on the remote and leaves the room, the PS3 system remains on throughout the day, potentially affecting the device's lifespan and consuming power unnecessarily. In conclusion, the customer is clearly dissatisfied with the product due to the sensitive buttons on the remote and the inconvenience that results from the PS3 system being accidentally turned on. The customer would prefer having a designated power button to control the system, avoiding these issues altogether."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: This article: The Smashing Pumpkins (or Smashing Pumpkins) are an American alternative rock band from Chicago, Illinois. Formed in 1988 by frontman Billy Corgan (lead vocals, guitar), D'arcy Wretzky (bass), James Iha (guitar), and Jimmy Chamberlin (drums), the band has undergone many line-up changes. The current lineup features Corgan, Chamberlin, Iha and guitarist Jeff Schroeder. Disavowing the punk rock roots of many of their alt-rock contemporaries, they have a diverse, densely layered, and guitar-heavy sound, containing elements of gothic rock, heavy metal, dream pop, psychedelic rock, progressive rock, shoegazing, and electronica in later recordings. Corgan is the group's primary songwriter; his musical ambitions and cathartic lyrics have shaped the band's albums and songs, which have been described as \\"anguished, bruised reports from Billy Corgan's nightmare-land\\".The Smashing Pumpkins broke into the musical mainstream with their second album, 1993's Siamese Dream. The group built its audience with extensive touring and their 1995 follow-up, the double album Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart. With 30 million albums sold worldwide, the Smashing Pumpkins were one of the most commercially successful and critically acclaimed bands of the 1990s. However, internal fighting, drug use, and diminishing record sales led to a 2000 break-up. In 2006, Corgan and Chamberlin reconvened to record a new Smashing Pumpkins album, Zeitgeist. After touring throughout 2007 and 2008 with a lineup including new guitarist Jeff Schroeder, Chamberlin left the band in early 2009. Later that year, Corgan began a new recording series with a rotating lineup of musicians entitled Teargarden by Kaleidyscope, which encompassed the release of stand-alone singles, compilation EP releases, and two full albums that also fell under the project's scope—Oceania in 2012 and Monuments to an Elegy in 2014.

Captured Moments by Will Shetterly I remember Papa's stopbox, a teal blue Tiempo Capturado that Mama brought home for his birthday. It was huge and inefficient, and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy, but Papa would not let her return it. He used it to preserve baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for spring-time meals in the middle of winter. Mama kept her mink jacket, a family hand-me-down, safe from time in a stopbox, and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection. Sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release, usually a few hours after enclosing it. When my father died, a year after my mother, my sisters and I cleaned out their apartment. We found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes. I took mine home, where they sat above my computer while I worked on my first play. One night when I did not believe love had ever existed for anyone, I used my own capturador, a sleek titanium Sanyo Tardar Ahora, to undo the stopbox. Bringing my face close to the shoes, I breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me. The instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased. But as soon as I coughed, I laughed, and I did not try to kill myself that night. Question: \\"What did Papa use his birthday present for?\\" Answer: \\"\\" Is this answer correct? Available options: (A). no; (B). yes;...I think the answer is","completion":"(A). No The detailed and long answer: Papa received a Tiempo Capturado, a teal blue stopbox, as a birthday present from Mama. The stopbox was a unique and fascinating device used to preserve items by stopping time around them. Papa used this birthday present primarily for preserving fruits and vegetables, such as baby tomatoes, cucumbers, and strawberries. By enclosing these items in translucent cubes within the stopbox, Papa maintained their freshness and added a delightful touch to their family's spring-time meals, even when these fruits were consumed in the middle of winter. The stopbox had versatile uses beyond just food preservation. Other family members would borrow the captivating device and use it to protect their own prized possessions. For instance, Mama kept her heirloom mink jacket safe from the ravages of time in a stopbox, and an uncle used the capturador to safeguard his precious stamp collection. Occasionally, the parents would indulge their children by allowing them to preserve their cherished toys or delicious treats in the stopbox for a short period, until they couldn't wait any longer and requested to release them. When the narrator's father passed away, followed by the mother a year later, the siblings discovered items including their baby shoes lovingly preserved within the stopboxes. The presence of these objects, preserving the love and care of their parents, brought comfort and reminiscence to the narrator in a dark moment. In summary, Papa used his birthday present, the teal blue stopbox, primarily for preserving fruits and vegetables, but the device also served a wider purpose in the family, keeping treasured items safe and protected from the passage of time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Can we draw the following hypothesis from the context? Context: Hannah Kate Whelan (born 1 July 1992) is a retired British artistic gymnast who competed at the 2008 Summer Olympics and the 2012 Summer Olympics. Whelan won three European Championships medals and four British senior national titles, and was the bronze medallist in the all-around at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. Hypothesis: Hannah is British.","completion":"Based on the given context, we can indeed draw the hypothesis that Hannah Kate Whelan is British. There is sufficient information provided to support this hypothesis, and we can assess it using multiple pieces of evidence found within the context: 1. The context clearly states that Whelan is a \\"retired British artistic gymnast.\\" This statement directly indicates her British nationality, establishing a strong foundation for the hypothesis. 2. Whelan competed at both the 2008 and 2012 Summer Olympics, representing Great Britain. While the context doesn't explicitly mention her representing Great Britain, we can infer this, as Olympic athletes typically compete on behalf of their home country. Furthermore, being a British gymnast advances the likelihood that she competed for Great Britain in the Olympics. 3. Whelan won four British senior national titles. The fact that she has earned national titles in the UK adds greater weight to the hypothesis. Winning British senior national titles implies significant recognition and success within the United Kingdom, suggesting a strong connection to the country. 4. Lastly, she also won the bronze medal in the all-around at the 2014 Commonwealth Games. The Commonwealth Games are an international event involving athletes from the Commonwealth nations, which include the United Kingdom. Her participation and success in the Commonwealth Games further strengthen the hypothesis of her being British. In conclusion, the context provides ample evidence that supports the hypothesis that Hannah Kate Whelan is British. Direct statements of her nationality, her participation in significant international sporting events representing Great Britain, and her success within the United Kingdom all contribute to validating this hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The court heard the two women later planned to sell the story in a series of BBM (Blackberry Messenger) messages. In one Twitter posting an unidentified. user sent a tweet to Miss Cochran about Dappy, including the message:. 'Send the c*** down.' Miss Cochran replied: 'Hahaha in the process.' In a BBM message, sent on Monday evening, Miss Burton said to Miss Cochran: 'hahaha oh my f***. Someone's dad works in media. 'He told her that apparently we can get like a grand for that kind of story from The Sun or something.' She added: 'Let's ring them tomorrow when we leave court to be fair.' In another message read to the court, Miss Burton said: 'Didn't they say we can do what we want when the trial is over? 'Let's literally ring Heat and stuff and get rich and sell our story.' Asked at at the hearing yesterday at Guildford Crown Court why she had said that, Miss Cochran replied: 'I think we are. both 19-year-old girls. Any attention is good attention.' Witnesses: It is alleged that Dappy spat at Grace Cochran, right, and Serena Burton, left, after they rejected his advances.

Miss Cochran replied: 'No, we didn't know who they were. 'We told them to leave us alone.' At this point, Miss Cochran claimed Dappy described them as 'sluts'. Mr Stork then asked: 'Did you say anything back to that?' Miss Cochran said: 'I said \\"You're boring\\".' When asked if that prompted a reaction, Miss Cochran said: 'Yes, he then spat at me - on to the floor, it didn't land on me.' Miss Cochran said her friend Miss Burton then told the rapper: 'That's disgusting.' Describing the events which then unfolded, she added: 'One of the boys who we were talking to previously at the cash point came to stand in and stuck up for us. 'He said \\"Just leave them\\" or something along those lines. 'I remember they were head to head, they had their heads against each other. Accused: Dappy and three other men are charged with affray after an attack on a man at a petrol station in February 2012. 'People came out from cars which were parked up on the forecourt. 'Serena ran inside. She was calling my name but I just stayed sitting down. 'I can't really remember seeing much of the fight. 'I remember looking at my feet and seeing someone laying on the floor and they were being kicked as they were laying there.' In the aftermath Miss Cochran said she saw the group of three men she and her friend had been chatting to before the fight erupted. 'One of them had a lot of chipped teeth on his bottom jaw. 'One had a broken nose or a bleeding nose and one had a swollen-up eye.' Violent: Dappy is alleged to have sparked a mass brawl at this Shell Garage, in Guildford Surrey. Vassell and Stewart all deny a charge of affray. Co-accused Alfred James Miller pleaded guilty to a single charge of affray at Guildford Crown Court ahead of the start of the trial of the remaining three defendants. The tattooed performer was sporting a. pair of dark glasses and carrying a bottle of Lucozade as he arrived at. court. He removed the sunglasses before entering the dock, where he wore. a white shirt and dark blue tie as he listened to the evidence. Under cross-examination from Paul Greaney QC, representing Dappy, Miss Cochran denied using the case to gain fame. Mr Greaney asked about the messages posted on Twitter by Miss Cochran and Miss Burton this week. In one, on Monday evening, Serena wrote: 'Ha ha ha love life now we're famous', to which Miss Cochran replied: 'Buzzing to be papped'. Mr Greaney asked: 'Did that message mean you were excited to be photographed coming in to court?' Miss Cochran answered: 'Yes, I suppose, in a way.' Assaulted: David Jenkins says he lost or broke teeth after being hit in the mouth during the fight. As he listened to the answers from the dock, Dappy was seen to shake his head and also place his head in his hands. Mr Greaney then asked whether Miss Cochran intended to sell her story following the conclusion of the trial, to which she replied: 'Me and Serena have discussed it, yes.' Police seized both Miss Cochran and Miss Burton's BlackBerry smartphones this week following the Twitter postings. The court heard that Dappy had previously pleaded guilty at Chelmsford Magistrates' Court to two offences of battery in an earlier and unconnected incident. These charges related to an incident on November 18, 2008, where he spat at a woman and the spittle hit her in the face as well as another woman, the court heard. Detective Constable Alex Boxall, of. Surrey Police, said that when he arrested Dappy at his recording studio. after the Guildford incident, the singer said to him: 'I was the one who. was assaulted.' When interviewed by police, Dappy denied spitting at anyone and said he had only spoken to the girls about his new single. Old times: Dino 'Dappy' Contostavlos with his N-Dubz bandmates, cousin Tulisa and Richard 'Fazer' Rawson. He said he has been 'victimised' and was the 'happiest man on earth' on the night of the incident as he was out to celebrate the release of his impending album. He said: 'I walked over to the girls and said my new single Rockstar with Brian May is out on Monday, go and buy it.' He added: 'They were just being rude to me, I just said hello, promoting my single, I said 'Hi, my single (with) Brian May is coming out. 'Two guys coming out, being put in a headlock, bam, that's all I remember.' He continued: 'Someone put me on the ground, in a headlock straight away. 'One of my security tried to get him off me, we all fell on the ground and I get put in a car after that.' Speaking to Mr Boxall in the interview, Dappy denied starting the violence or hitting anyone and said: 'Come on officer-man, who attacked who?' Dappy said during the interview that he was drunk on that night having had six or seven shots of Jack Daniel's and sambuca in a local nightclub called Casino. He said: 'We just went there to celebrate because my second single had just been released.' Denying spitting at the two women and the man, he said: 'No way would I spit, I don't spit. I have two kids, my mum didn't bring me up that way.' The trial, before a jury of eight men and four women, continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.

The premise states the significance of reviewing existing information, carrying out testing of critical data, and gathering information about data reliability issues within a short time frame to address a research question. In this context, asking knowledgeable agency staff about data reliability serves as a valuable resource to obtain relevant and reliable information. There are several reasons supporting the truthfulness of the hypothesis: 1. Agency staff expertise: Knowledgeable agency staff possess an understanding of the organization's data, processes, and systems. Their expertise and experience can provide valuable insights and information which may not be readily available in reports or other documented resources. 2. Time-saving: Consultation with agency staff allows for the efficient gathering of information within tight time constraints. Through their knowledge and understanding of the data, agency staff can point the researcher in the right direction, saving time in reviewing background materials and assessing data reliability. 3. Reliability assessment: Assessing the reliability of data is a critical aspect of any research project. Agency staff with a strong understanding of the data's limitations and methodological issues can provide the researcher with important information to assist them in making decisions about data selection and usage. 4. Access to non-public information: Some information sources or data may not be publicly available. In such cases, agency staff can facilitate access to these valuable sources of information, further enhancing the researcher's understanding of the research subject. 5. Interpretation of data and results: Experienced agency staff can provide guidance on the interpretation of data and results, identifying possible reasons for specific outcomes and trends. This added context may prove extremely useful in shaping the research findings and conclusions. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"To get information you can ask agency staff for help\\" is true, based on the premise provided. Utilizing knowledgeable agency staff as a resource for gathering information, assessing data reliability, and interpreting results can significantly support a researcher's efforts in addressing a research question within a short time frame. However, it is crucial to remember that agency staff input should be complemented by a researcher's independent investigation, critical thinking, and verification to ensure a comprehensive and unbiased approach."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Premise: A man is singing and the girl is playing an instrument. Hypothesis: A woman is writing a book. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The premise and the hypothesis describe two different scenarios, and the truth of one does not necessarily imply the truth of the other. The connection between the two statements is not directly related or established, meaning that they are independent of each other. The premise describes a man singing and a girl playing an instrument, which indicates a musical situation. In this scenario, the focus is on the performance and the roles of these individuals within that context. On the other hand, the hypothesis presents a separate situation that involves a woman writing a book. This statement highlights an entirely different activity (writing) and a different subject (a woman). The presence of a creative or artistic theme may be a similarity between the premise and hypothesis, but that alone isn't enough to indicate a causal relationship or a logical correlation. To conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true, there must be a clear and logical connection or relationship between the two statements that would dictate that the truth of one implies the truth of the other. In the given example, no such connection exists. In summary, while the premise and hypothesis may focus on artistic or creative activities, the lack of direct connection or relationship between them means we cannot conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true. The statements are independent and unrelated, so it's important to evaluate their truth separately and based on their own contexts and supporting evidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Richard: Thanks Janine, at least one person here likes me ;-) Janine: Haha, I did not say I liked you, you're just the only person I talk to :-) What was going on in that conversation?","completion":"The conversation is happening between two office colleagues, Richard and Janine, with a mixture of professional and personal undertones. It seems like they are discussing another office colleague, Christopher. At the beginning of the conversation, Richard expresses frustration with Christopher, calling him a \\"pretentious bastard.\\" Richard's aggravation isn't specified, but it seems to largely revolve around Christopher's attire and his habitual tardiness. He mentions Christopher's particular outfit of a pink sweater and yellow socks that stands out, indicating a sort of flamboyant, unconventional style that Richard apparently finds irksome or ridiculous. Richard also seems resentful of Christopher's consistent tardiness, which wouldn't typically be a cause for annoyance unless it's perceived as a disregard for other team members' time or it disrupts the workflow. The expression \\"swooshes in\\" suggests that Christopher enters in a noticeable, probably disruptive, self-centered manner. The conversation then pivots to John, who can be assumed as someone in a position of authority, perhaps a manager or supervisor. Janine mentions that John had talked to Christopher about his behavior, but she believes this had no effect. Richard thinks that John overlooks Christopher's flaws due to his \\"great results,\\" which could mean Christopher is delivering high-quality work or outperforming others. Richard laments the fact that he isn't John's favorite, insinuating a form of favoritism in the office dynamics where Christopher is given certain leeway because of his performances. This sparks a somewhat light-hearted banter between Richard and Janine about yellow socks and being the \\"favorite pet.\\" Janine uses expressions like \\"LMAO\\" and \\"XD,\\" typical in casual and humorous conversations, showing they maintain a friendly and humorous rapport, navigating office politics through shared humor. Towards the end of the conversation, Richard appreciates Janine, saying, \\"at least one person here likes me.\\" And Janine playfully responds that she didn't say she liked him, she just talks to him because she doesn't have anyone else, pointing towards a camaraderie where they use humor and wit to relieve their frustrations about their office situations. In sum, this conversation revolves around office dynamics, interpersonal relationships, and disagreements amidst humor between two colleagues, who discuss a third colleague's demeanor and behavior, as well as perceived favoritism from the management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The party operates in Armenia, Nagorno-Karabakh and in countries where the Armenian diaspora is present, notably in Lebanon, where the party is represented in the parliament as part of the March 8 alliance. - The Armenian diaspora refers to the communities of Armenians outside the Republic of Armenia including the \\"de facto\\" independent Nagorno-Karabakh Republic. Since antiquity, Armenians have established communities in many regions throughout the world. However, the modern Armenian diaspora was largely formed as a result of the Armenian Genocide of 1915, when the Armenians living in their ancestral homeland in eastern Turkey, known as Western Armenia to Armenians, were systematically exterminated by the Ottoman government. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.

The rise of the Russian Empire happened in association with the decline of neighboring rival powers: the Swedish Empire, the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth, Persia and the Ottoman Empire. It played a major role in 181214 in defeating Napoleon's ambitions to control Europe, and expanded to the west and south. - Lebanon , officially known as the Lebanese Republic, is a sovereign state in Western Asia. It is bordered by Syria to the north and east and Israel to the south, while Cyprus is west across the Mediterranean Sea.

Answer this question: what part of the pavlovian model does the food represent??","completion":"The Pavlovian Model, also known as Classical Conditioning, is a learning process in which an innate response to a potent stimulus comes to be elicited in response to a previously neutral stimulus. This model is named after Ivan Pavlov, a Russian physiologist, who first observed and described it after conducting experiments with dogs. The model comprises four key components: Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS), Unconditioned Response (UCR), Conditioned Stimulus (CS), and Conditioned Response (CR). In the Pavlovian Model, the food represents the Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS), a naturally occurring event or object that triggers an innate response. The Unconditioned Stimulus (UCS) holds the capacity to elicit a reflexive or involuntary response due to its biological significance, without any prior learning. It is an essential aspect of the model, as it sets the foundation for the subsequent formation of the association between the stimuli and the response. In Pavlov's famous experiment, he used food (meat powder) as the Unconditioned Stimulus. When the dogs were presented with the food, they exhibited an involuntary response of salivation, which is considered an Unconditioned Response (UCR). The Unconditioned Response is the natural, reflexive reaction elicited by the Unconditioned Stimulus without any prior training, and in this case, it was the salivation of the dogs. Pavlov then introduced a neutral stimulus, a sound (such as a bell or metronome), which had no effect on the dogs initially. By consistently pairing the neutral stimulus (soon to become the Conditioned Stimulus) with the Unconditioned Stimulus (food), the dogs eventually began to associate the sound with the presentation of food. Over time, the neutral stimulus became the Conditioned Stimulus (CS), capable of eliciting the same response as the UCS. The final component of the Pavlovian Model is the Conditioned Response (CR), which is the learned reaction that occurs in response to the Conditioned Stimulus. In Pavlov's experiment, after the association between the sound and food had been formed, the dogs would start salivating in response to the sound alone, even in the absence of food. This salivation in anticipation of the food, caused by the sound, is the Conditioned Response. In summary, within the Pavlovian Model, the food represents the Unconditioned Stimulus, a naturally occurring event or object that elicits an innate, involuntary response without any previous learning or conditioning. This component serves as the foundation for the learning process and the formation of the association between stimuli and responses, ultimately leading to the development of conditioned responses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: + no; + yes;","completion":"Yes, we can conclude that \\"Adam was known to speak it fluently\\" if the statement \\"Sam took French classes from Adam, because he was known to speak it fluently\\" is true. The given sentence helps us establish a cause and effect relationship between the two parts of the statement. Sam took French classes from Adam due to a specific reason, which was Adam's fluency in the language. This causal relationship means that Adam's fluency in French is a condition that needs to be in the place in order to support Sam's decision to learn from Adam. Additionally, the use of the word \\"because\\" in the statement helps us to determine the cause behind Sam's decision to take French classes. The fact that Adam was known to be fluent in the language clarifies why Adam was chosen to give French lessons. Therefore, this statement provides sufficient evidence that supports Adam's fluency in French. Furthermore, the term \\"known to speak it fluently\\" implies that Adam's fluency in French was already acknowledged among others. This establishes the fact that Adam's fluency in French precedes Sam's decision to take classes from him.

Vomiting after swallowing a foreign object could cause you to aspirate (inhale) the tooth into your lungs. If given the OK by a doctor, vomiting can remove the tooth from the stomach. In order to retrieve the tooth, you’ll want to use a container or a sink with the drain closed. As unpleasant as it may sound, try to throw up into a colander that will catch the tooth and allow the watery content to run through, so you can avoid having to search through vomit for a tooth- which may just cause you to throw up more. The most common way to induce vomiting is to stick one or two fingers into the back of your throat. Tickle the far back of your throat until your gag reflex causes you to vomit. Ipecac syrup is an emetic remedy designed to induce vomiting. Use as directed, and mix a small amount with water. Drink it down quickly, and it should make you feel some nausea, followed by stomach contractions which will cause you to vomit.

Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir ( or ; French pronunciation: [simon d@ bovwaR] ( listen); 9 January 1908 - 14 April 1986) was a French writer, intellectual, existentialist philosopher, political activist, feminist and social theorist. Though she did not consider herself a philosopher, she had a significant influence on both feminist existentialism and feminist theory. De Beauvoir wrote novels, essays, biographies, autobiography and monographs on philosophy, politics and social issues. She was known for her 1949 treatise The Second Sex, a detailed analysis of women's oppression and a foundational tract of contemporary feminism; and for her novels, including She Came to Stay and The Mandarins. De Beauvoir was intellectually precocious, fuelled by her father's encouragement; he reportedly would boast, \\"Simone thinks like a man!\\" Because of her family's straitened circumstances, de Beauvoir could no longer rely on her dowry, and like other middle-class girls of her age, her marriage opportunities were put at risk. De Beauvoir took this opportunity to do what she always wanted to do while also taking steps to earn a living for herself. After passing baccalaureate exams in mathematics and philosophy in 1925, she studied mathematics at the Institut Catholique de Paris and literature/languages at the Institut Sainte-Marie. She then studied philosophy at the Sorbonne and after completing her degree in 1928, she wrote her diplome d'etudes superieures (roughly equivalent to an MA thesis) on Leibniz for Leon Brunschvicg (the topic was \\"Le concept chez Leibniz\\" [\\"The Concept in Leibniz\\"]). De Beauvoir was only the ninth woman to have received a degree from the Sorbonne at the time, due to the fact that French women had only recently been allowed to join higher education. De Beauvoir first worked with Maurice Merleau-Ponty and Claude Levi-Strauss, when all three completed their practice teaching requirements at the same secondary school. Although not officially enrolled, she sat in on courses at the Ecole Normale Superieure in preparation for the agregation in philosophy, a highly competitive postgraduate examination which serves as a national ranking of students. It was while studying for the agregation that she met Ecole Normale students Jean-Paul Sartre, Paul Nizan, and Rene Maheu (who gave her the lasting nickname \\"Castor\\", or beaver). The jury for the agregation narrowly awarded Sartre first place instead of de Beauvoir, who placed second and, at age 21, was the youngest person ever to pass the exam. Writing of her youth in Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter she said: \\"...my father's individualism and pagan ethical standards were in complete contrast to the rigidly moral conventionalism of my mother's teaching. This disequilibrium, which made my life a kind of endless disputation, is the main reason why I became an intellectual.\\" Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did she ever become a teacher with Merleau-Ponty and Levi- Strauss?","completion":"Yes, she did.

Help as much as you can. I read this background article the other day: White blood cells also make chemicals that cause a fever. A fever is a higher-than-normal body temperature. Normal human body temperature is 98.6°F (37°C). Most bacteria and viruses that infect people reproduce fastest at this temperature. When the temperature is higher, the pathogens cannot reproduce as fast, so the body raises the temperature to kill them. A fever also causes the immune system to make more white blood cells. In these ways, a fever helps the body fight infection. I am facing a new situation today: Stephanie is a nurse at the local high school. Recently, the flu has been going around and she has had many students come into her office feeling ill. When a student comes in, the first thing she does is check their temperature to test for a fever.

A fever, which is a higher-than-normal body temperature, usually triggers the immune system to produce extra white blood cells to help fight off infection. Since 98.6°F is considered a normal body temperature, it is less likely that the student's body is producing extra white blood cells. However, it is essential to consider other signs and symptoms of infection to determine if the student may still be experiencing an immune response."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This article: Doménikos Theotokópoulos (Greek: Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος [ðoˈminikos θeotoˈkopulos]; October 1541 – 7 April 1614), most widely known as El Greco (\\"The Greek\\"), was a Greek painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. \\"El Greco\\" was a nickname, a reference to his Greek origin, and the artist normally signed his paintings with his full birth name in Greek letters, Δομήνικος Θεοτοκόπουλος, Doménikos Theotokópoulos, often adding the word Κρής Krēs, Cretan. El Greco was born in the Kingdom of Candia, which was at that time part of the Republic of Venice, and the center of Post-Byzantine art. He trained and became a master within that tradition before traveling at age 26 to Venice, as other Greek artists had done. In 1570 he moved to Rome, where he opened a workshop and executed a series of works. During his stay in Italy, El Greco enriched his style with elements of Mannerism and of the Venetian Renaissance taken from a number of great artists of the time, notably Tintoretto. In 1577, he moved to Toledo, Spain, where he lived and worked until his death. In Toledo, El Greco received several major commissions and produced his best-known paintings. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism, while his personality and works were a source of inspiration for poets and writers such as Rainer Maria Rilke and Nikos Kazantzakis. El Greco has been characterized by modern scholars as an artist so individual that he belongs to no conventional school. He is best known for tortuously elongated figures and often fantastic or phantasmagorical pigmentation, marrying Byzantine traditions with those of Western painting. contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who died in Toledo, Spain?, what is it ?

Possible A: container, supermarket, pantry, sandwich, jar Why is \\"pantry\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"The answer \\"pantry\\" is aligned with human common sense because it considers the context and purpose of the question. A pantry is a space in a house or kitchen where food supplies are typically stored, which makes it a logical place to store peanut butter. Here's how this conclusion is reached step-by-step: Step 1: Understand the question's context. The question's context is about the storage of peanut butter, a common household food item. Step 2: Analyze the possible answers. - Container: While peanut butter is commonly found in a container (usually a jar), the word itself refers to a general concept of something that holds or preserves other things, which doesn't necessarily imply the location of storage. - Supermarket: This is a place where peanut butter is sold but not where it is stored in a household context. - Pantry: This is a dedicated area or space where food items are typically stored at home, making it a relevant answer. - Sandwich: A sandwich is an application or a use of peanut butter, not a place where it is stored. - Jar: This refers to the physical container that holds the peanut butter, but, like \\"container,\\" it doesn't imply the location of storage. Step 3: Assess the relevance of each answer. Of the possible answers, only \\"pantry\\" stands out as the most logical choice due to its direct relation to the storage of food in a home setting. Step 4: Determine the most human common-sense answer.

Write a summary based on this article: Earlier today, The Wire actress Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson was arrested as part of a large-scale drug raid in Baltimore and surrounding counties. Slate asked David Simon, creator and executive producer of The Wire (and currently in production on Treme), for comment. He offered this statement, provided to Slate through an HBO spokesperson. First of all, Felicia's entitled to the presumption of innocence. And I would note that a previous, but recent drug arrest that targeted her was later found to be unwarranted and the charges were dropped. Nonetheless, I'm certainly sad at the news today. This young lady has, from her earliest moments, had one of the hardest lives imaginable. And whatever good fortune came from her role in The Wire seems, in retrospect, limited to that project. She worked hard as an actor and was entirely professional, but the entertainment industry as a whole does not offer a great many roles for those who can portray people from the other America. There are, in fact, relatively few stories told about the other America. Beyond that, I am waiting to see whether the charges against Felicia relate to heroin or marijuana. Obviously, the former would be, to my mind, a far more serious matter. And further, I am waiting to see if the charges or statement of facts offered by the government reflect any involvement with acts of violence, which would of course be of much greater concern. In an essay published two years ago in Time magazine, the writers of The Wire made the argument that we believe the war on drugs has devolved into a war on the underclass, that in places like West and East Baltimore, where the drug economy is now the only factory still hiring and where the educational system is so crippled that the vast majority of children are trained only for the corners, a legal campaign to imprison our most vulnerable and damaged citizens is little more than amoral. And we said then that if asked to serve on any jury considering a non-violent drug offense, we would move to nullify that jury's verdict and vote to acquit. Regardless of the defendant, I still believe such a course of action would be just in any case in which drug offenses—absent proof of violent acts—are alleged. Both our Constitution and our common law guarantee that we will be judged by our peers. But in truth, there are now two Americas, politically and economically distinct. I, for one, do not qualify as a peer to Felicia Pearson. The opportunities and experiences of her life do not correspond in any way with my own, and her America is different from my own. I am therefore ill-equipped to be her judge in this matter. Photograph of Felicia Pearson courtesy of Bryan Bedder/Getty Images. Follow Brow Beat on Twitter.

On the day before Thanksgiving in 1971, a man calling himself Dan Cooper boarded a plane in Portland, Ore., and after a drink and a cigarette, slipped a note to the flight attendant saying he had a bomb and was hijacking the plane. Within a few hours, he parachuted out of a Boeing 727 with 200,000 of ransom money and was never heard from again. Even after 40 years, the FBI hasn't been able to pinpoint his real identity -- until, possibly, this week. The FBI claims to have a new lead in the case: A retired police officer suggesting the real D.B. Cooper died in a car crash in the Pacific Northwest 10 years ago. (So far an attempt to match the man's fingerprints, obtained from an old guitar strap, to Cooper's has proved unsuccessful.) It's no small feat to hijack a plane and elude capture for decades, but what's more astounding is the iconic status D.B. Cooper has gained ever since. Perhaps it's because, as a nation of rugged individualists (or so we like to think), Americans are drawn to stories of rebels who stick it to the man. Or perhaps we just like a good mystery. In the wake of this week's news, Salon spoke to journalist Geoffrey Gray, whose new book, \\"Skyjack: The Hunt for D.B. Cooper,\\" is out on Aug. 9. How do you think people will react if this latest news is true? The news doesn't give a lot in the way of proof. All they have is a secondhand story, a guitar strap and a hunch. The Cooper case is littered with those. There are literally many feet of files full of those kinds of claims. So, before they release any information, I think the FBI needs to be sure they can prove the identity of the hijacker conclusively. I'm not sure a partial fingerprint or a partial strand of DNA is enough to get rid of the doubt that exists. So either the hijacker got away with it for 30 years or he's still out there getting away with it. Regardless, the myth continues. For this case, these kinds of leads have happened so often. What is different this time is that the FBI appeared to take it seriously by passing it along for testing and telling the public about it. One of the theories out there is that most of what the FBI has done has only taken them farther away from finding the hijacker. Five days after the hijacking, they released the Cooper sketch because they were desperate for clues in the case. But what happened next was that they were bombarded with information from all over the country because everybody saw somebody they knew in that sketch. So, they couldn't do any investigative work because there were too many leads to follow. As it turns out, there were a tremendous number of hijackings in the early '70s. What was going on? The story of a hijacking never starts in the plane. It actually starts on the ground. The United States in 1971 was a country at war with itself, and it was a time of tremendous upheaval. There was a recession happening in 1971 that coupled with a lot of counterculture stuff. The number of bomb threats and explosions in government buildings was at an all-time high. Inner cities were becoming ghettos. We were losing the Vietnam War and soldiers were coming home addicted to heroin. The overwhelming idea was that there was no control. The country was unhinged and there was a state of national paranoia. What about this particular hijacking? Why were people so quick to get behind D.B. Cooper? Seattle was a company town, and Boeing had laid off a lot of its workforce. Some of the best aeronautic engineers in the country had to mow lawns because there were just no jobs available. The Pacific Northwest is a unique part of the country that has a real outlaw, flannel, corned-beef-and-hash spirit. Because of the recession, the government started collecting back taxes, which forced a lot of people to sell their homes. Then the government bungled giving out emergency food rations to unemployed people by making it so bureaucratic that the food spoiled before they could get it out the door. At the same time, these jumbo jets were coming off the line, and all these big planes were freaking people out. There was already resentment and fear against the government and the big and complex technology. The early 1970s is when big machines were coming into vogue, and anyone who was working with their hands or had a concept of what it meant to put in an honest day's work were disenchanted by the efficiency of the modern corporation. Then along comes Dan Cooper, a man who paid 20 in cash that day to buy a ticket from Portland to Seattle on a Boeing 727. Was he immediately seen as a hero? Almost immediately. I call him a transcendental hero because, through one tremendous act of courage, he was able to convince the good guys to root for the bad guy. He changed the moral compass of the moment. He had the FBI agents and law enforcement officials who were trudging through the woods in search of him -- but actually did not want to find him and hoped he would escape. They wanted him to get away with the jump because he executed all the romantic elements of the perfect crime: no harm done, no victims, skillful execution. It was hard not to be in awe of this one act. Why does this myth captivate the American imagination? In the cult of Cooper, people see who they want to see. At the time, people wanted to see this man as a hero who could do something that defied the government. It was a way to rid themselves of their own feelings of helplessness. D.B. Cooper was able to seize control and become the director of a great drama. After their houses had been taken from them because of money they owed to the government, followers of Cooper wished they could do that. Who's going to miss 200,000, especially when insurance is paying for it? It's not like these people were slackers. They were hardworking people. The system and society at the time was becoming so unfair and mechanized, and this guy was able to turn that all upside down. In an airline town, he was able to defeat the airlines. He was able to defeat the government and law enforcement. What his real motives were is an entirely different question that we may never know the answer to, but that's not the story that lingers in legend. Any time you have a legend, you have a hero who serves a purpose. To this day, Cooper serves a purpose. How so? There is a rebel in all of us, some more than others. This guy was able to strike that chord. He was able to show us what something bold truly is, and we love that. Is this why we still hang onto news about possible breaks in the case? The frenzy surrounding news of this case is strikingly similar to what happened on Nov. 25, 1971. Once people learn that a man had boarded a plane just like everyone else does, was able to convince the FBI to give him four parachutes and a small fortune, then disappeared into thin air over the remote mountains of the Pacific Northwest, it's impossible not to be interested in the story, and it's very easy to become obsessed with it. In an environment where the mystery lingers, there is only the pursuit for the facts. In this case, the hunt for Cooper is a really bumpy, infuriating and life-changing road. People have devoted their whole lives to solving this case. At this point, even if conclusive evidence existed, people would probably come up with reasons not to believe it. If we think about what is going on in this country at this moment -- the debt ceiling, the recession, high unemployment, failed wars, the increased reliance on technology -- there are some strains of similarity. In approaching the 40th anniversary of this event, maybe we are just in a similar moment where this story is the kind people want to hear about. Maybe this is simply a ripple effect from the history of one man jumping out of a plane in such epic fashion. ||||| Summary:","completion":"Actress Felicia \\"Snoop\\" Pearson, known for her role in The Wire, was arrested as part of a large-scale drug raid in Baltimore and surrounding counties.

Answer the question...where is a coil spring on a car??","completion":"To answer the question about the location of a coil spring on a car, I will perform the following steps: Step 1: Understand the function of a coil spring A coil spring is a mechanical component used to store energy and subsequently release it in order to absorb shocks or maintain a constant force between contacting surfaces. In the context of a car, the primary purpose of coil springs is to support the vehicle's weight and absorb impacts from irregularities in the road, providing a comfortable ride to passengers. Step 2: Identify the locations where coil springs are typically found in car suspensions Coil springs can be found in different types of car suspensions, such as the independent suspension system or the solid axle suspension system. In both systems, coil springs are typically located near the wheels, as they play a crucial role in the suspension mechanism that supports the vehicle and absorbs the impact from the road. Step 3: Specify the most common locations in which coil springs are used In most passenger cars, coil springs are usually found in the following locations: 1. Front Suspension - Coil springs can be found at the front suspension system, usually between the upper and lower control arms or between the lower control arm and the vehicle's chassis, depending on the specific design of the suspension. 2. Rear Suspension - Coil springs can also be found at the rear suspension system, usually between the rear axle housing and the vehicle's chassis, or between the upper and lower control arms if the car has an independent rear suspension.

To come up with the translation, I first identified the main components of the sentence, such as the subject (she), the verb phrases (has to face off, want to take, make him), and the objects (soldiers, elder brother Mark, boy soldier). Then, I translated each component into its equivalent in Spanish, while maintaining grammatical structures and appropriate vocabulary. For instance, \\"refugee camp\\" is translated as \\"campo de refugiados,\\" \\"face off\\" is translated as \\"enfrentarse,\\" and \\"nine\\" is translated as \\"nueve.\\" The final step was to reassemble those components into a coherent sentence in Spanish that carries the same meaning as the original English sentence."},{"prompt":"Based on this review, would the user recommend this product? === Review: Astonished that this book has recieved such favorable reviews - this guy is mining a territory he has in fact forgotten - he's now Martha's Vineyard, not Empire Falls.

Shares of Smithfield closed up 1.64 , or 8.5 percent , at 20.85 , on the New York Stock Exchange . Shares of Smithfield rose 1.64 yesterday to close at 20.85 , a rise of 8.5 per cent , on the New York Stock Exchange . Do the above sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"Yes, the two sentences provided both identify the same event but are structured slightly differently. They both report that shares of Smithfield increased by 1.64, equating to an 8.5 percent growth, and closed at 20.85 on the New York Stock Exchange. To delve into these sentences a bit further, both statements provide three key pieces of information. First, they identify the firm in which the shares are being traded as Smithfield. It is vital to note the company involved when discussing stock exchange transactions, and both phrases accomplish this. Secondly, both of these sentences indicate the change in Smithfield's shares value. They specify the absolute dollar increase as 1.64. Then, they also express this increase as a percentage (8.5 percent). Giving the price change in both dollar terms and as a percentage is important because it provides context. A 1.64 increase would be significant for a low-priced stock, but for a high-priced stock, it could be negligible. Therefore, incorporating the 8.5 percent gain gives a sense of magnitude. Both statements present these figures, ensuring the message of Smithfield's stocks appreciating value is presented accurately. Lastly, they substantiate that this transaction occurred on the New York Stock Exchange, one of the world's largest marketplaces for buying and selling stocks. It's an essential piece of information because it shows where the trading activity for Smithfield's stocks is being recorded. In summary, each excerpt, though composed differently, communicates the same financial report - the rise in share price of Smithfield on the New York Stock Exchange. The alternative structure and slight rephrasing do not alter the main message or the data provided - demonstrating the flexibility in language when representing the same concept or event. Consequently, it is accurate to state that these two sentences indeed denote the same thing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer the following question: Process: - A plant grows near or on a rock - The plant roots begin to grow - Break apart the rock - The plant acids dissolve parts of the rock - The rocks are broken into more and more pieces - Erosion starts to occur. suppose less stormy weather happens, how will it affect slower weathering occurring. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The situation described involves a plant growing near or on a rock and contributing to the weathering of the rock through its root growth and the release of acids that dissolve parts of the rock. Over time, the rocks are broken into smaller pieces, and this process is further facilitated by the occurrence of erosion. The hypothetical scenario presented involves a decrease in stormy weather, which would likely lead to changes in the rate of weathering. The supposed perturbation in this case can be described as indirectly impacting a step of the process. The process itself revolves around the plant's actions in breaking apart rocks and facilitating erosion. When there is a decrease in stormy weather, the rate of erosion may be affected as well. Erosion is often driven by natural forces, including wind and water movement, that can be directly affected by weather. In the absence of stormy weather, the intensity of these forces can be reduced, which in turn can slow down the rate of erosion. It should be noted that the decrease in stormy weather doesn't directly impact any of the steps involving the plant's growth, root expansion, or the release of acids to dissolve the rock. These processes will continue as long as the plant survives and thrives in its environment. However, the rate of erosion that contributes to the overall weathering process will be indirectly affected by the change in weather patterns. In conclusion, the supposed perturbation of less stormy weather in the given scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process. While the plant's actions in weathering the rock will continue, the decrease in stormy weather can lead to a slower rate of erosion, which in turn will influence the overall weathering process. This highlights the interconnected nature of various factors in natural processes, demonstrating that even indirect changes can lead to significant effects on the outcomes of these processes over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer: Although individual sports such as golf , tennis , and auto racing are also very popular, the term is usually limited to team sports. Question: what is the largest major league sport in the world? The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the initial statement does not provide a correct answer to the question about the largest major league sport in the world. To provide a more comprehensive response to the question, it is essential to consider multiple factors such as revenue, viewership, and popularity. Historically, soccer (association football) has been considered the most popular sport worldwide, with numerous major leagues and a vast global fan base. FIFA, the governing body for soccer, estimates that around 270 million people across the world are actively involved in the sport, either as players, referees, or coaches. When evaluating the largest major leagues in soccer, some of the most eminent ones include the English Premier League (EPL), Spain's La Liga, Germany's Bundesliga, Italy's Serie A, and France's Ligue 1. These leagues garner millions of viewers globally, with lucrative television rights and commercial deals that contribute to their enormity. The English Premier League, in particular, is often cited as the most-watched soccer league globally and is ranked as one of the most prominent leagues in terms of revenue generated. The EPL's broadcasting deals, brand appeal, and immense fan base contribute to its continued growth and influence in the global sports market. In contrast, major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada, such as the NFL (American football), NBA (basketball), MLB (baseball), NHL (ice hockey), and MLS (soccer), are indeed prevalent and successful, especially within their respective regions. However, none of these leagues can match the global reach and popularity of soccer. Therefore, the largest major league sport in the world is soccer, with the English Premier League frequently being considered as the most significant within the domain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: BEIJING, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- Commander-in-chief of China's manned space program Chang Wanquan announced Thursday night that the launch of Tiangong-1 space lab module is successful. China's first space lab module Tiangong-1 blasted off at 9:16 p.m. Beijing Time (1316 GMT) Thursday from Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center in northwest desert area. The unmanned module, carried by Long March-2FT1 rocket, will test space docking with a spacecraft later this year, _ the way for China to become the third country in the world to operate a permanent space station around 2020. The Tiangong-1 will orbit the Earth for about one month to await Shenzhou-8 unmanned spacecraft. Once the two vehicles successfully rendezvous , they will conduct the first space docking at a height of 340 kilometers above Earth surface. After two docking tests, Tiangong-1 will await Shenzhou-9 and Shenzhou-10 in the next two years, according to a plan of China's manned space program. The 8.5-tonne Tiangong-1, with a length of 10.4 meters and maximum diameter of 3.35 meters, provides a room of 15 cubic meters for two to three astronauts to live and work. Zhang Shancong, deputy chief designer of the Tiangong-1, told Xinhua that the module carries special cameras which will take hyperspectral images of China's vast farmlands to detect heavy metal pollution and pesticide residue as well as plant disease. Moreover, scientists on the ground will also conduct experiments on photonic crystal , a new material expected to revolutionize information technology, in the low-gravity environment inside the Tiangong-1 as these experiments would be extremely difficult to conduct on Earth's surface. \\"China is clearly becoming a global power and its investments in areas like technology and space exploration reflect this,\\" said Peter Singer, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Brookings Institution. \\"It is a natural result of the growth in political and economic power and is to be expected,\\" said Zhou Jianping, chief designer of China's manned space program,...

Movie title: The Spirit of St. Louis Movie plot: On the night before his epic solo flight across the Atlantic, Charles Lindbergh (James Stewart) lies awake in his hotel bed, worrying about his chances. Will he have enough fuel? Will he even be able to take off? Rain falls outside his window, dimming the chances for an early start. Time is short, and Lindbergh knows he must make his attempt soon, because there are others trying to make the same flight.Tossing and turning, he thinks back to the events that led him here. Once, flying airmail for the Army, his plane failed in a Midwest blizzard, and after bailing out, he had to find his way through the dark and take a train to his destination. Lindbergh was no stranger to the dangers of flight, but his faith in its capabilities was unshakable, and a dream formed in his mind: he wanted to do something remarkable, something that would show people what airplanes could really do.Back at his home base in St. Louis, he calls a New York aircraft builder to get a quote on a special plane. One that can make a very long distance flight: New York to Paris, non-stop. Lindbergh next sets out to raise the money needed to buy it, and manages to get several St. Louis businessmen interested. They like the idea, and they see its value, but aren't sure about Lindbergh's chances. Is he really sure he can do this? He convinces them that he can, and the name \\"The Spirit of St. Louis\\" is coined for the project.Lindbergh travels to New York to purchase the special plane, but the deal falls through and he returns home, discouraged. Another possible builder is found however, and Lindbergh is off to California to see the small Ryan Aircraft Co. He locates the sleepy little factory and finds the firm's president Frank Mahoney (Bartlett Robinson) frying fish with a torch. Amused, Lindbergh makes the deal, and they all get to work. In a few weeks, a little silver plane has taken shape, and Lindbergh takes it up for testing. Satisfied, he heads back to St. Louis, but learns that another team has taken off from Paris and is trying to make it... Answer:","completion":"\\"No, I can't\\" provide you with the exact type of bird that Lindbergh saw, as it is not directly mentioned in the movie plot description provided.

Context: By the mid-1870s, most scientists accepted evolution, but relegated natural selection to a minor role as they believed evolution was purposeful and progressive. The range of evolutionary theories during \\"the eclipse of Darwinism\\" included forms of \\"saltationism\\" in which new species were thought to arise through \\"jumps\\" rather than gradual adaptation, forms of orthogenesis claiming that species had an inherent tendency to change in a particular direction, and forms of neo-Lamarckism in which inheritance of acquired characteristics led to progress.

Soak the skin you’re removing for 5-10 minutes in warm water before rubbing your skin dry with a clean towel or cloth. If the callus or corn is still really hard, you may have an easier time doing this while the skin is wet or moist. If rubbing the skin hurts when it’s dry, try doing it while you’re in the shower. Do not attempt to remove a callus or corn if you haven’t softened the skin up for at least a few days. If you do, you may break your skin or cut yourself. A pumice stone is basically a chunk of volcanic rock that can remove dead skin without harming the healthy skin around it. You can use an emery board or soft nail file instead if you prefer. Hold the stone, board, or file flat against the corn or callus. Use gentle, straight strokes in a single direction to slowly wear away the dead skin. With a steady hand and constant, minimal pressure, rub off the top layer of the calluses to bring about healthy skin from underneath. Do this for 30-45 seconds to remove a little skin. Always remember that the callus is your body’s response to increased pressure and friction. Rubbing too hard may result in more callus formation. Once you’ve removed a layer of dead skin, protect the fresh skin that you’ve exposed. Squirt out a pea-sized dollop of moisturizing cream or lotion into your hand. Then, rub it into the callus or corn using soft, circular motions. This will keep the new skin from hardening or getting damaged while you’re still working on removing the rest of the dead skin. Be patient and work on removing the callus or corn for 30-45 seconds a day. With every use of the pumice stone or emery board, you’re removing a fraction of the dead skin. Over time, you will completely remove it and your skin will naturally heal on its own. You can tell when you’re done by feeling the skin. If the skin is uniform, soft, and it matches the rest of your skin, you’re done! Since the skin is hardened, you may not feel anything when you touch your callus or corn. While you may be able to cut or shave the skin off, this is a terrible idea. It can cause an infection or laceration injury. In addition, you can easily cut too deeply or at the wrong angle. You may require medical attention if you do this. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: Before attempting to remove a callus or corn, soften the skin for 3-5 days first. To remove it, soak the affected skin in warm water for 5-10 minutes, and then gently rub the area with a pumice stone, emery board, or soft nail file for 30-45 seconds. Avoid applying too much pressure while rubbing, as it may result in more callus formation. After each session, moisturize the exposed fresh skin to prevent hardening or damage. Continue this process daily until the callus or corn is completely removed and the skin is soft and healthy. Avoid cutting or shaving the callus or corn, as this may cause infection or injury."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — U.S. President Donald Trump’s decision to withdraw from the Iran nuclear agreement is not expected to derail diplomatic momentum to reach a deal to end North Korea’s nuclear weapons program, but it could complicate the negotiation process, analysts say. Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Useful while pondering the intricacies of a case, what musical instrument is Sherlock Holmes known to play?","completion":"Sherlock Holmes, the famous fictional detective created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, is known to play the violin. As an iconic figure in the world of literature and mystery-solving, the character of Holmes has been associated with the violin throughout his many adventures, a testament to Doyle's brilliant character development that included aspects of the detective's personal life and hobbies. The violin is a highly versatile and expressive instrument, which requires both precision and passion to play well. It is no surprise that Holmes, a man of tremendous intellect and intensity, gravitates towards an instrument that allows him to channel his keen mental focus and emotions. In various Sherlock Holmes stories, Doyle often describes Holmes as playing the violin in moments of deep contemplation or during periods of heightened emotions. Holmes uses music as an outlet for relaxation, inspiration, and given his methodical approach to problems he's solving, a way to help him think through complex scenarios. For instance, in \\"A Scandal in Bohemia,\\" Doyle writes that Holmes picks up his violin and \\"plunged into a powerful and melancholic reverie,\\" allowing the music to envelop him as he ponders the intricacies of the case. This demonstrates how playing the violin assists Holmes in navigating the inner workings of his mind. Furthermore, in \\"The Adventure of the Cardboard Box,\\" the violin is used as a means for Holmes to dissipate his nervous energy as he works through the details of a case. Holmes's violin playing also serves as a conduit for expressing the depths of his human emotions, such as love and pain. In \\"The Adventure of the Red-Headed League,\\" Holmes even composes a short melody to commemorate and celebrate the peculiar details of the case. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle skillfully utilizes the violin as a device to highlight the intriguing aspects of Holmes's character. Through the masterful use of this musical instrument, the author provides the reader with a glimpse into the detective's complex personality, making him a more relatable and intriguing protagonist. In conclusion, Sherlock Holmes is known to play the violin, using it as a medium to help him ponder the intricacies of his cases, as well as express his emotions and interests. The violin serves as a symbol of the creativity and intensity of Holmes's character, ultimately enriching the narratives of the Sherlock Holmes stories and captivating the reader's imagination."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Sacramento -- Public schools in California will be required to teach students about the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans starting Jan. 1 after Gov. Jerry Brown on Thursday signed a controversial bill to add the topic to the social sciences curriculum. Textbooks now must include information on the role of LGBT Americans, as well as Americans with disabilities, though California's budget crisis has delayed the purchasing of new books until at least 2015. \\"History should be honest,\\" Brown, a Democrat, said in a statement. \\"This bill revises existing laws that prohibit discrimination in education and ensures that the important contributions of Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life are included in our history books.\\" The governor called the legislation, SB48, introduced by Sen. Mark Leno, D-San Francisco, \\"historic.\\" The law - the first of its kind in the nation - adds the two groups to an existing list of minority and other groups that are required to be part of the social sciences curriculum. Safer schools Gay rights supporters heralded Brown's action as a major victory. They said the law will help make public schools a safer place for LGBT students as well as give those students, and their classmates, examples of accomplished and important LGBT people. Throughout the debate on the measure, backers noted the recent spate of suicides among young LGBT people and said it would help to combat bullying that typically occurs beforehand. Opponents, however, fiercely opposed the measure, citing religious objections to homosexuality and questioning whether such instruction is necessary. They expressed dismay with Brown's signing of the bill. \\"If children in other countries are learning math and science, and American children are learning about the private lives of historical figures, how will our students compete for jobs in the global economy?\\" said Sen. Sharon Runner, R-Lancaster (Los Angeles County), the vice chairwoman of the Senate Committee on Education. Beyond California The provision on inclusion in textbooks could reach beyond California, too, as many book publishers tailor their texts to California's standards because of the state's large population. The bill does not prescribe how schools will teach the subject, and Leno said that decision will be made by local school officials and teachers. \\"What the bill calls for is for the contributions of LGBT people to be included,\\" Leno said, adding, \\"We wrote it broadly for a reason. We would be subject to more criticism than we've already been getting if we were more dictatorial.\\" Leno said the mandates apply broadly, though, telling reporters it would affect kindergarten through high school curriculum, \\"and, of course, in an age-appropriate way.\\" Gay rights advocates said they will be vigilant about making sure schools across California comply. Carolyn Laub, the founder and executive director of the Gay-Straight Alliance Network, which works to establish gay-straight clubs in schools, said such clubs exist in 55 percent of California's high schools. \\"We'll certainly be letting all of our constituents know about this bill, and when it goes into effect I can assure you there will be thousands of students\\" watching to see how it is implemented, she said. Proponents have cited slain San Francisco Supervisor Harvey Milk as a person with historical significance, along with events such as the Stonewall Riots in New York City that helped launch the LGBT rights movement as examples of topics that could be taught. Superintendent of Public Instruction Tom Torlakson, a Democrat, praised Brown's move, saying, \\"Our history is more complete when we recognize the contributions of people from all backgrounds and walks of life.\\" Cutting into class time Still, opponents questioned the effect the bill would have and the need for explicit instruction for all students about a relatively small group. The bill \\"does absolutely nothing to reduce bullying, improve the poor state of our education system, ensure students graduate or prepare them for global competitiveness,\\" said Paulo Sibaja, legislative director of the Capitol Resource Institute, a socially conservative organization in Sacramento. \\"Instead it diverts precious classroom time away from science, math, reading and writing, and focuses on the agenda of a small group of people.\\" This article appeared on page A - 1 of the San Francisco Chronicle ||||| Reporting from SacramentoGov. Jerry Brown signed legislation Thursday making California the first state to require that school textbooks and history lessons include the contributions of gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.Brown took the action as lawmakers sent him scores of bills, including one that would allow undocumented immigrants access to privately financed student aid at state universities and colleges.Before adjourning for a monthlong summer recess, the Legislature also proposed changing the way California holds presidential primary elections and awards its electoral votes.In accepting a mandate that California students be taught the accomplishments of gays and lesbians, Brown said that \\"history should be honest.\\" The bill, he said in a statement, \\"revises existing laws that prohibit discrimination in education and ensures that the important contributions of Americans from all backgrounds and walks of life are included in our history books.''The measure had sparked hot debate in the Legislature, where Republicans argued that it would force a \\"gay agenda\\" on young people against many of their parents' wishes. State Sen. Mark Leno (D-San Francisco) said the new law, which he wrote, will reduce the bullying of gay students by showing role models in lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender citizens.\\"Denying LGBT people their rightful place in history gives our young people an inaccurate and incomplete view of the world around them,\\" said Leno, whose bill, SB 48, also covers the role of the disabled in history.The governor's action drew criticism from conservative groups.Benjamin Lopez of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition said schools should be focused on improving students' reading, writing, math and other skills.\\"It's a sad day for the state of California,\\" said Lopez, a legislative analyst and advocate for the organization. \\"We have failed at our core educational mission, and yet we are now going to inject gay studies into the classrooms. It's absurd and offensive.\\"Controversy also surrounds the proposal to give undocumented immigrants a shot at privately funded financial aid in the California State University, California Community Colleges and University of California systems.Brown is expected to approve the measure, AB 130, which is part of the California Dream Act . He declared during last year's election campaign that he would have signed a similar bill.A separate proposal (AB 131) to permit students lacking legal status to receive publicly funded financial aid has stalled in the Senate. Assemblyman Gilbert Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) wrote both measures.Arguing in favor of the private aid bill, state Sen. Ron Calderon (D-Montebello) said the state should not stand in the way of a college education for students who graduate from California high schools with good enough grades.\\"Their accomplishment should not be disregarded or their future jeopardized because of their legal status,\\" Calderon said during a floor debate before the Senate passed the measure on a largely party-line vote of 26-11.Senate Republican Leader Bob Dutton of Rancho Cucamonga opposed the measure, saying it would give students false hope by helping them go to college even though they may not be able to get a job afterward because of their illegal status.\\"If you don't have your citizenship squared away before you graduate, you cannot get a license to practice what you have been going to school for,\\" Dutton said. \\"This is just doing an injustice to these young people.\\"The Senate also gave final legislative approval to a measure that would move California's presidential primary election from February to June next year, saving 100 million by consolidating the presidential vote with the normal statewide primary. California had previously moved its presidential primary to February in hopes of gaining more sway in the national contest, but many other states also moved their votes to that month.State Sen. Kevin De Leon (D-Los Angeles) said that at a time when government is facing financial problems, it doesn't make sense to incur the extra cost of holding a presidential primary in February in addition to a statewide primary in June and a general election in November.\\"We have to be fiscally prudent with the taxpayer dollars,\\" De Leon said.State Sen. Tony Strickland (R-Moorpark) opposed the bill, arguing that the state could restore some clout and still save money by combining the state and presidential primaries in March.\\"Too many times California is ignored,\\" Strickland said. But the proposal, AB 80 by Assemblyman Paul Fong (D-Sunnyvale), passed 34-3.Similar concern was behind another measure sent to the governor Thursday. Both houses voted to allow California to join other states in awarding electoral votes to the presidential ticket that receives the most popular votes nationwide in a general election.California currently gives all of its 55 electoral votes to the ticket that receives the most votes in the state.Because the state is heavily Democratic, candidates often write it off as a place to campaign, instead focusing their attention on battlegrounds where the vote is more competitive.\\"This bill will make California relevant in the long run,\\" forcing candidates to discuss issues important to Californians, said Assemblyman Jerry Hill (D-San Mateo), author of the bill, AB 459.Some Republican lawmakers, including Sen. Doug La Malfa of Richvale, fought the measure, which passed 23-15 in the Senate and 49-5 in the lower house and went to the governor.\\"It flies in the face of 220 years of election law in the United States for deciding a president,\\" La Malfa said.The change would take effect only if adopted by states with a majority of the electoral votes, which has not yet occurred. |||||Summary:","completion":"In January 2012, California became the first state to require the teaching of the contributions of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) Americans in public schools.

It was a different category. \\"So on the first category he has no more joker, on the second category he has no more joker.\\" Vettel has apologised publicly for the incident, and also for falsely accusing Hamilton of brake-testing him. It was Vettel's belief that had caused him to run into the back of Hamilton, provoking his anger and leading to him then banging wheels with the Mercedes. Hamilton has said Vettel did not apologise in their first conversation about the incident on the day after the Baku race, but that the following day he did so when they exchanged text messages. Todt said he called the meeting on Monday to ensure Vettel understood Hamilton had not been responsible for the incident in any way and to acknowledge the German was the one who carried the responsibility for it. \\"I felt it was very bad for the sport and very bad for the image of the sport and for the fans, because when you are a champion at this level you must be an example,\\" Todt said. \\"I am sure a lot of young people and fans were shocked by this attitude and particularly - even if I said the matter was judged by the stewards - I was not very comfortably with the statements after the race where the team and the driver seemed not to understand what had happened.

News article: ZTE's Smart Phone Ambitions Chinese telecom giant ZTE has long sought a bigger slice of the American cellphone market. This year, it may finally break through with the introduction of higher-end devices. \\"We are focusing our resources on the high tier,\\" says George Sun, chief executive of ZTE USA, the Texas-based subsidiary of China's ZTE Corp. That means more investments in smart phones and, possibly, Qwerty keyboard handsets, according to Sun. It's a new direction for the company, which has carved out a niche providing low-cost phones to regional carriers. ZTE's best-selling U.S. handset is a slim flip phone called the C79 that MetroPCS sells for 149. Its other U.S. phone, the C78, is a bright purple candy bar-shaped handset that MetroPCS offers for 119. Affordable pricing is still an important part of ZTE USA's DNA, says Sun. But its parent company's global ambitions--it aims to be the No. 3 handset maker by 2014, up from No. 6 today--have redirected ZTE USA's attention to large operators like Sprint (nyse: S - news - people ), Verizon (nyse: VZ - news - people ) Wireless and AT&T. Sun hints that his firm is in talks with all three. ZTE's planned move to Dallas, near the AT&T (nyse: T - news - people ) headquarters, should forge stronger bonds between the two companies, he says. ZTE already has a close relationship with Sprint after producing devices for the company's WiMax network last year, he adds. An alliance with Verizon could come soon. Sun says ZTE USA is developing dual-mode devices that would switch seamlessly between third generation (3G) and fourth generation (4G) technology. \\"In the U.S., there is strong demand for a [3G] CDMA and [4G] LTE device,\\" Sun says. \\"It's highly likely these products will be announced this year.\\" Verizon is the only U.S. carrier that could support such a device. In the super-competitive mobile market, winning over the big carriers requires more than a friendly approach or the right technology. That's why ZTE USA is turning to more advanced phones. \\"U.S. consumers look for rich multimedia functions and high quality above everything else,\\" Sun says. Parent ZTE already offers smart phones powered by Microsoft's (nasdaq: MSFT - news - people ) Windows Mobile software in China. Sun says it's \\"highly possible\\" ZTE USA will announce a smart phone later this year. It's a strategy that other Asian manufacturers, such as Taiwan's HTC, have pioneered. Like HTC, ZTE is trying to build up its brand by asking U.S. carriers to allow a ZTE logo on its phones. Moving into the top three handset makers will require some fresh moves, along with stunning phones, brilliant marketing and close operator relationships. For now, ZTE is training its sights on the No. 5 slot, currently occupied by a struggling Motorola (nyse: MOT - news - people ). \\"The gap between No. 6 and No. 5 has shrunk dramatically,\\" Sun says. \\"It's highly possible we could move up.\\" The scheme is partly a reflection of the economy. Traditionally, ZTE has focused most of its resources on its fast-growing wireless infrastructure unit. But with the economy squeezing infrastructure contracts, the company is trying to play up its handset business. Sun says ZTE USA is still growing, despite the downturn. ZTE plans to break out its subsidiary's results for the first time when it releases its 2008 annual report at the end of the month.

Movie title: Iron Man 2 Context: The movie opens several months after the events in the first Iron Man movie. We are introduced to a man named Ivan Vanko. Ivan's father Anton is slowly dying and telling Ivan his final wishes. Ivan thinks he should have the fame that Tony Stark is enjoying but Anton tells him to \\"ignore that garbage.\\" All Anton can give Ivan is his knowledge. Ivan takes a blueprint that has his father's name on it, and also the name of Howard Stark, Tony Stark's father. Ivan then sets about recreating the Arc reactor and begins building his own weaponized suit. Tony Stark has become a champion for world peace thanks to the Iron Man suit, and has practically solved the issue of world peace, or so he claims.Six months after the end of the first movie, Tony Stark has used his Iron Man armor to bring about a negotiated peace treaty between the major super powers of the world, and his immense popularity with the general public is only furthered when he fulfills his father's dream by reopening the \\"Stark Expo\\" in Queens, NY, to showcase all the latest inventions that will benefit the world. Tony fulfills this dream by flying into the expo in full Iron Man regalia, and making a flamboyant entrance to become the new symbol of world peace. Backstage, following his address, Tony does a quick test of his blood: the palladium he uses to power his chest arc reactor is slowly poisoning his body. After the event, Tony and Happy are leaving when they are approached by a woman who hands Tony a subpoena, summoning him to a Senate Armed Forces Committee hearing. Tony and Happy decide to take a road trip to Washington DC in Tony's new Audi R8.The next morning, during the Senate hearing, Tony's usual brand of humor becomes the center of attention while completely ignoring the fact that the government has classified the Iron Man armor as a weapon.

Cooking Like Mario Batali, With Fluke, Scallops and Squash In 2002, Mario Batali published “The Babbo Cookbook,” a guide to the cooking at his flagship restaurant in Manhattan, and within two years I had made every recipe in it at least once. I worked carefully, using the cookbook’s photographs as blueprints. I made the dishes exactly as they were depicted on the page, as if I were expecting the chef himself to check my work before allowing the food to leave my kitchen. I ran my little fake-o Babbo well. One night my mother came to dinner. I served the restaurant’s braised short ribs with horseradish gremolata, arranging the food on individual plates. I might have been building model airplanes. It took a little while. Perhaps the dishes cooled a little by the time we all sat to eat. “At truly elegant homes,” my mother said, “the food is served on platters, en famille.” There is much to be said for passing warm china around a table filled with family and friends, serving one another. But there is also something magical about bringing the aesthetics of restaurant food into the home, offering to those same people the joy of a perfectly balanced plate, each ingredient placed just so, to marvelous effect. This is particularly the case with the dish that follows, which started out at Babbo as black bass served in a lemony capon stock, with Hubbard squash and delicate shell-on bay scallops from Taylor Shellfish Farms in Washington State. On a platter, it would be a soupy disaster. But in wide soup bowls, with each guest receiving a scattering of squash and scallops, a scant cup of broth to surround them and a crisp portion of fish placed delicately on top, every bite reveals a new and exciting layer of texture and flavor. There is no need to make the dish with black bass, Hubbard squash or Taylor bay scallops, much less capon broth. I made it with striped bass until stocks of that fish began to slide; with the porgies some know as scup; and most effectively with the Northeastern bottom fish known as fluke. You could use red snapper or any firm-fleshed white fish. Hubbard squash is a dream, but butternut squash works beautifully in its stead. As does chicken stock instead of the capon. And swapping out the farmed bay scallops for the deeper salinity of wild ones, or for small ocean scallops, is no crime. The key to success is to cook serially, allowing the dish to come together seamlessly at the end. You make a kind of uncooked lemon jam, bright with oregano, and swirl it into stock and wine. You sauté cubes of squash. You fry your fish, hard on one side and then barely on the other. And, while the fish is cooking, you poach the scallops in the broth, making it a kind of brodetto, or Adriatic fish soup. Spoon the squash into warm bowls, followed by the scallops and the brodetto. Top with the fish and a scattering of scallions. Forget the platters. It’s romantic, Ma.

This report will examine this problem and provide some possible ways to solve it. We live in a society that is producing and using electronics all the time. It is often cheaper to buy new products than to repair old ones. Also, through clever advertising, companies always encourage people to change their old TVs, mobile phones and computers for the latest models. E-waste is created when we throw away old ones. In the EU alone, about 8,700,000 tons of e-waste is produced each year. Sadly, just over 1,000,000 tons is recycled. Burying e-waste or burning it cause serious problems for the environment. Electronics have dangerous things in them. These things can then get into the ground or pollute the air when they are burnt. In recent years, _ . However, their plans are not always managed properly. Sometimes electronics are just sent to poor countries such as Ghana. Here they are often burnt in public areas, which is very bad for people's health. Setting up recycling centers is a good way to solve this problem. E-cycling centers could recycle the parts that can be reused and deal with the rest properly. Another way is to make producers responsible for their used products. This means that producers must take back old products which are no longer wanted. They should then make sure _ are properly recycled or reused. As for us, we should try to cut down on e-waste. Change electronics only when we have to. And don't buy a product just to have the latest model. E-waste is a serious problem in the modern world. Both producers and users must take actions and try to keep it to the smallest amount. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following statements is true regarding e-waste, according to the article?

In this case, the like terms are the terms with 'p'. Combine -4513*p and 4553*p. -4513*p + 4553*p = 40*p So, the equation becomes: 40*p + 320 = 0 Step 2: Isolate the variable 'p'. To do this, move the constant term '320' to the other side of the equation by subtracting it from both sides: 40*p = -320 Step 3: Solve for 'p' by dividing both sides of the equation by the coefficient of 'p', which is '40': p = -320/40 Step 4: Simplify the fraction: p = -8 Thus, the solution to the equation -4513*p + 4553*p + 320 = 0 is p = -8."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Closing the box and homeschooling are not directly relevant to the situation of a missing child, and thus do not serve as appropriate answers to the question.

Summarize this article in one sentence. India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi ratified the deal with his counterpart Sheikh Hasina in Dhaka. Thousands of Bangladeshis inhabit more than 50 enclaves in India, while Indians live in around 100 areas within Bangladesh. The countries will now swap territories and residents can choose where to live. \\"We have resolved a question that has lingered since independence. Our two nations now have a settled boundary,\\" Mr Modi said at a press conference. \\"We are not just neighbours, but nations bound by the threads of history, religion, culture, language and kinship - as well as a passion for cricket.\\" Bangladesh Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali described the agreement as \\"a historic milestone in the relationship between the two neighbouring countries\\". Mr Modi and Sheikh Hasina have also agreed to inaugurate a bus service that will link the Indian cities of Kolkata (Calcutta), Agartala, Guwahati and Shillong with Dhaka. The agreement is significant because it is the first step by Bangladesh to allow road transit to India, a long-running Indian demand which it hopes will eventually enable it to have better access to its north-eastern states. Foreign Ministry officials in India have described Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Bangladesh as one of his most significant since taking office a year ago. That's because of the historic Land Border Agreement that is to be signed between the two countries. More than 50,000 people currently live in tiny enclaves - citizens of one country but located in the other. Under the agreement, both sides will swap the enclaves enabling their citizens to finally reside in their own countries. It's a dispute that dates back to colonial times and has been a contentious issue since. Relations between Bangladesh and India have improved under the government of Sheikh Hasina, and Mr Modi has also made it a priority for his foreign policy. The enclaves along the 4,000km border are a legacy of colonial times - the British departed India before the border was properly demarcated - and have been a contentious issue between the two nations for decades. Inhabitants are in effect stateless and lack access to public services. In some enclaves it is possible to find houses that straddle both countries. Mr Ali said the two countries would also sign a number of deals to boost trade and security along the border, fight human trafficking and share water resources.

Please answer the following question: Question: To stay on the team he had to pass class, so he and the tutor began to what? Options: - homework - smart - study hard - take test - study last minute Explain why a human would choose \\"study hard\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"study hard\\" to answer the question above because it most accurately and logically fits the context of the situation described. The question presents a scenario where a team member is faced with the challenge of passing a class in order to remain on the team. This implies that their academic performance plays a crucial role in their continued participation in the team. The question also tells us that he and a tutor have come together, which suggests a focused and dedicated effort on the part of both parties to work together to improve his academic standing. Now, let us analyze each of the options given to better understand why \\"study hard\\" would be the preferred choice. 1. Homework: While it is true that completing homework is an essential aspect of academic success, it does not fully capture the scope of the efforts that the team member and the tutor would undertake to ensure passing the class. Homework is only one aspect of studying, and the option doesn't emphasize the intensity or dedication involved. 2. Smart: This option is vague and does not clearly explain the intended action to be taken by the team member and the tutor. Being \\"smart\\" is a general term that could relate to one's intelligence or abilities, but it does not specifically address the process through which they will work together to improve the team member's academic performance. 3. Study hard: This choice clearly articulates the focused and dedicated effort that would be required from both the team member and the tutor to ensure he passes the class. \\"Studying hard\\" involves investing significant time, energy, and commitment in the learning process, which aligns well with the context of the situation. 4. Take test: This option is not appropriate because simply taking a test does not guarantee that the team member will pass the class. Taking tests is a part of the academic process, but it is the preparation and understanding of the material leading up to the test that determines success, not just the act of taking the test itself. 5. Study last minute: This option suggests a procrastination and lack of dedication that is not in accordance with the determined attitude and effort described in the question. Waiting until the last minute to study would likely not be sufficient for the team member to improve his academic performance enough to pass the class and stay on the team. Given these considerations, \\"study hard\\" is the most suitable choice because it represents the focused and dedicated efforts that the team member and the tutor would need to engage in for him to successfully pass the class and maintain his position on the team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Health problems: This seems more of a potential negative consequence of eating too many hamburgers, rather than a reason for wanting more. D. Hunger: While this could initiate the desire to eat a hamburger, it doesn't really explain why someone would specifically and continually want hamburgers. E. Indigestion: Like health problems, this would likely deter someone from wanting more hamburgers, not encourage it.

You can also find this information on the company's website. There will likely be a number of figures within the report that show how the investment rose or fell during that time. What you want to annualize is the percentage figure, called the rate of return (ROR), which shows the percentage of growth (or shrinkage) you received during the previous three months. For example, at the bottom of the page of numbers it may show that your quarterly return is 1.5 percent. The annual return would be larger, because your money could be expected to have grown each quarter. The annualized return would be the percentage of growth if the investment grew at the same rate all year. In order to annualize, you first consider the time period being featured. In this case it's three months since it's a quarterly report. Then calculate how many such periods are contained in a year. Thus, there are four three-month periods (quarters) in a year. You would then use the number 4 when called for in the annualizing formula. If you were trying to annualize a monthly return, you would use the number 12. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: This article explains the process of annualizing the rate of return (ROR) from a quarterly investment report. It mentions that the information can be obtained through mail, online account, or the company's website. The ROR percentage for the previous three months is to be determined from the report, such as a 1.5% quarterly return. To annualize, consider the time period featured (three months) and calculate the number of such periods in a year. In this case, there are four quarters in a year. The annualized return represents the percentage of growth if the investment maintained the same growth rate throughout the year."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Many traditionalists prefer to use a circular meditation cushion called a zafu. If you prefer, though, you can use any type of soft but supportive cushion that helps you stay in the upright seated posture used for traditional Zen meditation. For extra comfort, place a meditation mat, or even a blanket or towel, on the floor underneath the cushion. Sit in the center of the cushion if you prefer keeping your knees on it. Especially if you’re new to Zen meditation, you may find it easier to sit with your crossed legs resting on the cushion along with your backside. Sit at the front of the cushion if you want to rest your knees on the floor. This is a more traditional approach—your backside on the zafu and your crossed legs draped over the front. The lotus position is the most traditional way to cross your legs during Zen meditation, but it may not be comfortable for newcomers or those with physical limitations. Fortunately, there are several positions you can use. Popular choices include: Lotus: Cross your left leg over your right so that the tops of both of your feet are resting on the upper thigh of the opposite leg. Half Lotus: Cross your left leg over your right and rest your left foot on your right upper thigh, but tuck your right foot beneath your left leg. You can reverse legs if desired. Quarter Lotus: Cross your legs loosely so that your left knee is resting on (or just slightly above, depending on your flexibility) the side of your right foot, and vice versa. Burmese: Instead of crossing one leg over the other, spread your legs a bit wider, rest your knees, lower legs, and feet on the mat (or floor), and touch the heel of one foot to the base of the ankle of the other foot. Don’t choose a soft, cushiony chair that you can sink down into, but rather one that enables you to sit flat-footed and fully upright. A wooden dining chair or even a folding metal chair may work—just make sure you can sit to the front of the chair and reach your feet flat to the ground. Sit far enough forward that, when sitting fully upright, no part of your body can contact the back of the chair. You could use a chair-height stool if desired, because you shouldn’t be in contact with the back of the chair anyway. Your lower legs, from your feet to your knees, should create 2 parallel vertical columns that are perpendicular to the floor. Your knees should bend at 90-degree angles, so that your upper legs are parallel to the floor. Your knees and feet should be at the same width apart as your hips, and your toes should be pointed straight forward. Find a higher or lower chair if necessary so you can achieve this position. Add a lumbar support behind your lower back if necessary. You may not be able to sit fully upright on the front section of the chair without experiencing lower back discomfort. In this case, wedge a rounded lumbar pillow between your lower back and the base of the chair back. Roll up your meditation cushion into a log shape. Your goal is to create a tubular cushion from your zafu that you can straddle with your legs, knees on the floor and backside resting on the cushion. If your zafu isn't big enough on its own, use additional cushions, mats, and/or blankets to build up the height needed to support this position. Lay one or multiple mats on the floor. Your knees will be supporting a fair amount of your body weight, so it’s helpful to give them some cushioning. Place at least one meditation mat or soft blanket on the floor, and use more than one if needed to provide additional cushioning. The rolled cushion needs to be sturdy enough so that you can keep your upper body straight, rather than slouching down into the cushion. Imagine that you are sitting on a bicycle or a horse. Your lower legs and knees should be flat on the floor and against the sides of the cushion, your upper legs should be at roughly 45-degree angles, and your upper body should be perpendicular to the ground. Your shoulders, hips, and the middle of your shins should all be in a vertical line. Meditation benches typically have 2 legs and a forward-slanted seat. Straddle the seat in the same way you would a rolled-up cushion, with your upper body upright and your lower legs flat on the floor. Some meditation benches are wide enough that you can tuck your lower legs between the bench legs, rather than straddling them to the outside. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is that traditionalists often use a circular meditation cushion called a zafu for Zen meditation. Various leg positions, such as Lotus, Half Lotus, Quarter Lotus, and Burmese, can be used based on individual comfort. Alternatively, a supportive chair or a rolled-up cushion can be utilized to maintain an upright seated posture. Providing cushioning for the knees using mats or blankets is also recommended. Meditation benches can be another option for maintaining a comfortable position during meditation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer is:","completion":"The 1986 Argentine drama-science fiction film in question is \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste,\\" also known as \\"Man Facing Southeast,\\" which was written and directed by Eliseo Subiela. This thought-provoking movie explores themes of existentialism, spirituality, and the nature of reality through its compelling narrative. The film tells the story of Rantés, a mysterious patient who claims to be an alien from another planet, who arrives at a mental institution in Buenos Aires. There, he meets Dr. Julio Denis, a psychiatrist struggling with his own personal and professional dilemmas. As the story unfolds, the boundary between reality and fantasy becomes increasingly blurred, leaving both the characters and the audience questioning the true nature of Rantés' identity. Now, coming to the 2001 American science fiction-mystery film based on Gene Brewer's 1995 novel, it is called \\"K-PAX.\\" Directed by Iain Softley and starring Kevin Spacey as the enigmatic Prot and Jeff Bridges as Dr. Mark Powell, this captivating movie also revolves around a central character who claims to be from a distant planet called K-PAX. Prot is placed under the care of Dr. Powell, a renowned psychiatrist at a Manhattan psychiatric hospital, after the former is detained by the police. Similar to \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste,\\" the film delves into the blurred lines that separate reality from illusion as Dr. Powell tries to decipher whether Prot is indeed an extraterrestrial or just an extraordinarily delusional human. Although \\"K-PAX\\" is an adaptation of Gene Brewer's novel, there are striking similarities between this film and \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste.\\" These parallels have led to speculation that \\"K-PAX\\" may have been, at least in part, influenced by or adapted from Subiela's earlier work. However, \\"K-PAX\\" remains uncredited as an adaptation of \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste.\\" Despite potential connections and similarities between the two films, their individual merits and impact on the science fiction genre cannot be ignored. Both movies challenge the audience's understanding of reality and encourage reflection on themes such as mental health, the nature of existence, and the possibility of extraterrestrial life. As standout examples of their respective nations' filmmaking prowess, \\"Hombre Mirando al Sudeste\\" and \\"K-PAX\\" ultimately deliver powerful, cerebral cinematic experiences that continue to captivate viewers to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A major problem is his chief rival Grocer, whose effort to cartelize the hitman business puts him at potentially lethal odds with the unaffiliated Martin. Following a botched contract, Martin receives an invitation to his 10-year high school reunion in his hometown of Grosse Pointe, Michigan. Initially reluctant to attend, he is pressured into it by both his therapist, Dr. Oatman, and his secretary, Marcella. She books him a contract in Michigan that coincides with the reunion, ostensibly to smooth things over with the client whose contract was botched. Upon arriving in Grosse Pointe, Martin reconnects with his friend Paul and seeks out his high school sweetheart Debi Newberry, now a radio DJ, whom Martin had abandoned on prom night to enlist in the Army. When asked about his livelihood, Martin readily reveals that he is a professional killer, a response taken as a joke by everyone he meets. Meanwhile, Martin is being stalked by Felix LaPoubelle, who attempts to kill Martin in the convenience store that stands in place of his childhood home. He is also tailed by two National Security Agency agents who were tipped off to Martin's contract by Grocer. Despite these dangers, Martin remains distracted by his desire to make amends with Debi and fails to open the background dossier on his prospective target. At the reunion, Martin mingles with his former classmates, one of whom hands him her toddler. Martin then experiences an epiphany, recognizing that his recent disillusionment with his work and his amends with Debi signify an opportunity to change his life for good. Moments later, while exploring the halls, Martin is attacked by LaPoubelle, whom he kills in self-defense. Debi stumbles upon the scene and, horrified to find that Martin was not joking about his work after all, flees the reunion.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which languages are spoken by more than 7% of the population?","completion":"Title: Languages Spoken by More Than 7% of the Global Population: A Comprehensive Overview Introduction Our world is home to approximately 7,000 languages, a reflection of the incredible diversity and rich cultural heritage that exists across the globe. However, a few major languages have risen to prominence and are widely spoken, either as a native language or as a second language, by a significant portion of the global population. This article will explore the languages spoken by more than 7% of the global population and delve into critical factors, such as their historical, economic, and cultural impact. The Five Most Spoken Languages Worldwide 1. Mandarin Chinese Mandarin Chinese is the most spoken language globally, with more than 1.1 billion speakers, equating to approximately 15.6% of the world's population. Mandarin is primarily spoken as a native language in China, Taiwan, and Singapore, as well as by Chinese diaspora communities worldwide. Driven by China's rapidly growing economy and its increasing global presence, Mandarin has become one of the primary languages in international trade, tourism, and diplomacy. 2. Spanish Spanning across continents, Spanish is spoken by over 460 million people, about 6.4% as a native language and an additional estimated 1.8% as a second language. This figure totals around 8.2% of the global population. As the official language in 21 countries, Spanish is predominant in Spain, Latin America, and the United States, with a significant number of speakers also residing in Europe and Africa. The language has roots in Latin and has been enriched by various cultural influences throughout its history, such as Arabic and indigenous American languages. 3. English English is the third most spoken language in terms of native speakers, with approximately 379 million people speaking it as their first language. However, as the most widely learned second language globally, English is spoken by an additional 15% of the world's population, resulting in 26.3% of the global population being able to communicate in English. With historical roots in the United Kingdom, English quickly expanded as a result of British colonialism and later solidified its status through the influence of the United States in various sectors, such as commerce, science, entertainment, and diplomacy. Today, English is the primary language of the Internet, aviation, and many international organizations, making it a critical language for global communication. 4. Hindi Spoken primarily in India, Hindi boasts over 615 million speakers, accounting for approximately 8.7% of the global population. As the official language of India alongside English, Hindi is widely spoken across the Indian subcontinent, particularly in northern and central India. Though Hindi and Urdu are mutually intelligible, they differ in script, with Hindi being written in the Devanagari script. As India continues to experience economic growth and development, Hindi's significance on the global stage concurrently expands. 5. Arabic As the official language for 26 countries, Arabic is spoken by approximately 280 million native speakers and an additional 132 million as a second language, totaling around 412 million speakers or about 5.8% of the world's population. While this falls just below our 7% threshold, we include Arabic due to its extensive cultural and historical influence, as well as its status as the liturgical language of 1.8 billion Muslims. With roots in the Arabian Peninsula, Arabic expanded rapidly with the spread of Islam during the 7th and 8th centuries. Today, there exist various regional dialects and Modern Standard Arabic, which is used for formal communication and the media. Conclusion The linguistic landscape of our world is incredibly diverse, with a few major languages spoken by more than 7% of the global population. Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, English, Hindi, and Arabic, in particular, hold significant weight in the realms of politics, economics, and cultural exchange. Learning these languages can broaden one's horizons, enhance cross-cultural communication, and open doors to new opportunities. As our global society becomes more interconnected, the importance of understanding and appreciating linguistic diversity will only continue to grow."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: jewishness means to Context: Culturally, an Ashkenazi Jew can be identified by the concept of Yiddishkeit, which means \\"Jewishness\\" in the Yiddish language. Yiddishkeit is specifically the Jewishness of Ashkenazi Jews. Before the Haskalah and the emancipation of Jews in Europe, this meant the study of Torah and Talmud for men, and a family and communal life governed by the observance of Jewish Law for men and women. From the Rhineland to Riga to Romania, most Jews prayed in liturgical Ashkenazi Hebrew, and spoke Yiddish in their secular lives. But with modernization, Yiddishkeit now encompasses not just Orthodoxy and Hasidism, but a broad range of movements, ideologies, practices, and traditions in which Ashkenazi Jews have participated and somehow retained a sense of Jewishness. Although a far smaller number of Jews still speak Yiddish, Yiddishkeit can be identified in manners of speech, in styles of humor, in patterns of association.

Write the answer: What type of flower is a cattleya?","completion":"A Cattleya is a beautiful, captivating type of orchid belonging to the Orchidaceae family. It consists of around 50 different natural species and numerous hybrids, further expanding the scope of this stunning genera. Named after Sir William Cattley, an esteemed horticulturist from the 19th century, Cattleya orchids are particularly popular for their striking appearance, mesmerizing fragrance, and vibrant color palette, which can range from shades of purple, pink, yellow, and white. Cattleya orchids can be characterized by their sturdy pseudobulbs (an enlarged portion of the stem), which store nutrients and help the plant withstand less-than-ideal conditions. Each pseudobulb typically produces one or two leathery leaves and a floral stem, emerging from the eye at the base of the pseudobulb. Cattleya flowers can vary in size, from a couple of inches to as large as 8 inches in diameter, depending on the species and hybridization. The unique features of a Cattleya flower include a showy, brightly colored lip known as the labellum, which serves as a landing platform for pollinators, and a specialized column that contains both male and female reproductive organs. The petals and sepals are arranged in a symmetrical pattern, usually with three sepals (two lateral and one dorsal) and three petals (two lateral and one modified as the labellum). Cattleya orchids are native to Central and South American tropical regions, including countries such as Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, and Argentina. They thrive in varying environmental conditions, from lowland forests to high-altitude mountains, and can be epiphytic (growing on trees), lithophytic (growing on rocks or cliffs), or terrestrial (growing on ground) in their natural habitat. The cultivation of Cattleya orchids as a hobby or for commercial purposes, like cut flowers and corsages, began in the 19th century. Their natural allure and exotic fragrance earned them the title of \\"Queen of Orchids,\\" which remains popular even today. The numerous hybrid varieties of Cattleya orchids have been created by cross-breeding different species and other orchid genera, aiming to enhance color, size, or fragrance. Caring for Cattleya orchids requires understanding their specific needs. They typically thrive in environments with moderate to bright indirect light, well-drained potting mixtures, and adequate humidity. The ideal temperature range for Cattleya orchids is around 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit during the night and 70 to 85 degrees Fahrenheit during the day. It is essential to maintain a proper balance of water and air circulation, as over-watering or under-watering can cause issues like root rot or dehydration. In conclusion, the Cattleya is a captivating and exotic type of orchid that comes in various species and hybrids, known for its beautiful appearance and captivating fragrance. Native to Central and South America, Cattleya orchids are valued as ornamental plants and have been nicknamed the \\"Queen of Orchids.\\" With proper care and attention to their specific needs, Cattleya orchids can grace your living space with their breathtaking beauty and enchanting aroma."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The protagonist, Aarav, is a talented young guitarist who dreams of making his mark on the world with his music. He comes from a modest middle-class family that values traditional Indian customs and norms. Step 2: Establish the conflict As Aarav begins to achieve some level of success with his music, his road to fame and independence is constantly hindered by the judgments and expectations of his family and the larger society. Aarav struggles with these expectations that define him based on caste, religion, family background, and academic achievements, rather than his own individual skills and talents. Step 3: Introduce supporting characters Enter Rani, a young woman from a conservative family but with a liberal mindset, who befriends Aarav and seeks to change the way people judge others. Rani, a skilled dancer, relates to Aarav's challenges as she, too, faces similar judgments from society. They form a bond over their shared passion for the arts. Step 4: Develop the relationship Rani and Aarav form a deep-rooted friendship, supporting and inspiring each other to follow their dreams despite societal judgments. They decide to create a musical production that tells their story, addressing issues of judging individuals in Indian society. Step 5: Show the impact of societal judgments Relationships in the story become strained when Aarav's family and society discourage him from pursuing a career in music, perceiving it as a profession with little financial stability. Aarav's performance opportunities dwindle, and Rani faces challenges in her own family as her parents desire for her to pursue an arranged marriage. Step 6: Climax In the face of adversity, Aarav and Rani decide to stage a final performance that directly confronts issues of societal judgment. Despite opposition from their families, they pour their hearts and souls into their emotional show, using their musical talents to break free from the societal norms that have imprisoned them.

Write an article based on this summary: Find small chunks of time to get active throughout the day. Spend less time sitting. Take the stairs instead of using elevators. Walk and ride your bike instead of driving.","completion":"Title: Simple Strategies for Sneaking in Daily Exercise Introduction In our increasingly busy lives, finding time to exercise can be a challenge. Maintaining an active lifestyle, however, is crucial for both our physical and mental well-being. One solution to this problem is to find small chunks of time to get active throughout the day. By making minor adjustments to our daily routines, such as taking the stairs instead of using elevators and walking or biking in place of driving, we can accumulate valuable minutes of exercise and help keep our bodies and minds fit and healthy. 1. Benefits of Staying Active Throughout the Day Incorporating physical activity into our daily lives has numerous benefits. Exercise helps improve cardiovascular health, reduces stress, boosts our mood and energy levels, and promotes better sleep. Finding ways to stay active and moving throughout the day can also counteract the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle, which is increasingly common in modern society. 2. The Power of Small Chunks of Time Fitting in small chunks of exercise throughout the day adds up and can contribute to a healthier lifestyle. Even just a few minutes here and there can benefit our overall fitness and health. In fact, research has shown that short periods of physical activity can be as effective as a single, longer workout session. 3. Practical Strategies for Incorporating Exercise into your Daily Routine a) Take the Stairs: When presented with the option between stairs and an elevator or escalator, opt for the stairs. Climbing stairs engages major muscle groups, burns calories, and helps build overall fitness. b) Walk or Bike to Work: Changing your mode of transportation to work can be an easy way to add more activity to your day. Walking or biking to work offers several benefits: it saves gas and parking costs, reduces vehicular pollution, and provides a workout in the process. c) Park Further Away: When driving to your destination, consider parking a little further away than usual. This provides an opportunity to add more walking to your daily routine, which can help improve cardiovascular health and overall wellness. d) Use Breaks Wisely: When on a break at work or home, take a brief walk, stretch at your desk, do a few bodyweight exercises, or practice deep breathing. These short activity breaks can help break up long periods of sitting and improve blood circulation. e) Set Reminders to Move: Utilize technology to prompt you to get moving. Set reminders on your phone or computer to take a break and engage in some form of physical activity every hour or two during the day. Conclusion Incorporating small chunks of physical activity into our daily routines is an effective way to boost overall health and fitness without requiring significant chunks of time. By actively seeking out opportunities to move and exercise throughout the day, we can combat the negative effects of a sedentary lifestyle and improve our well-being. So next time you have the chance to take the stairs, go for a walk, or ride your bike, seize the opportunity and make a positive change for your health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at Nonnberg Abbey in Salzburg in 1938. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven childrenLiesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children alone using strict military discipline following the death of his first wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and she teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay. Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming Salzburg Festival but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain who will not allow his children to sing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire waltz in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional Landler folk dance, he cuts in and partners with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain and Maria are married. While they are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed into the Third Reich in the Anschluss, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval Headquarters in Bremerhaven to accept a commission in the German Navy. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the Anschluss, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by German soldiers waiting outside the villa. When questioned by Gauleiter Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven. Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Nazi soldiers soon arrive and search the abbey, but the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car.

While three people tragically lost their lives, including 74-year-old pilot Jimmy Leeward, witnesses claim that the veteran pilot's quick thinking and skillful maneuvers saved the lives of countless attendees. This article delves into the inspiring story of a man who did everything he could to avert a greater tragedy and pays tribute to a legend in the aviation world. The Reno Air Race Crash: The Reno Air Race event, held annually in Nevada, has always been a thrilling show for aviation enthusiasts. It brings together pilots from across the globe to compete in high-speed races, pushing their planes to the limit. In a terrible twist of fate, this year's event became infamous for a catastrophic crash. Eyewitness accounts report that Leeward's plane experienced a sudden and rapid descent towards the spectator stands. For the horrified onlookers, it appeared the aircraft was on a collision course with the bleacher section. However, thanks to Leeward's lightning-fast reflexes, he managed to pull the plane up, narrowly missing the stands and ultimately crashing into the box area in front of the crowd. Mechanical Failure as the Likely Cause: Although a thorough investigation is still underway, early speculations point towards mechanical failure as the primary cause of the crash. Even as his plane plummeted towards the ground, witnesses insist that Leeward was attempting to do everything in his power to save as many lives as possible. Jimmy Leeward - A Legendary Figure in Aviation: In addition to being an accomplished real estate developer, Leeward was a respected figure in the plane racing circuit, known for his prowess as a pilot. With over 120 competitions and several stunt pilot roles in films under his belt, he had proven his mettle time and again. Leeward's chiseled features and salt-and-pepper hair belied his age, and his daring stunts often left viewers breathless. Controversy Surrounding Leeward's Age: Following the crash, some have questioned whether Leeward, at the age of 74, should have been participating in such a high-stakes event. Debates continue about whether age was a factor in the tragic accident, and whether strict age restrictions should be implemented in aviation sports involving public venues. This discussion raises important questions about the risks associated with aviation sports and the safety of both participants and spectators. A Legacy of Bravery: Yet, despite the controversy, there is no denying the bravery and selflessness displayed by Leeward during those final, harrowing moments. Had it not been for his quick thinking and piloting skills, many more lives could have been lost. As tributes pour onto his Facebook page, it's evident that Jimmy Leeward will be remembered as a hero who did everything he could to protect the people around him. Conclusion: The Reno Air Race crash serves as a stark reminder of the inherent dangers of high-speed aviation sports. During such events, pilots and spectators alike are well aware of the risks involved. While this tragic accident has instigated important conversations about safety measures in aviation, let us not forget the extraordinary efforts of pilot Jimmy Leeward, whose quick thinking and skilled flying prevented an even greater tragedy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Celtic dominated possession but had to wait until the 43rd minute before Scott Sinclair curled home a superb opener. Their second came 12 seconds into the second half, Moussa Dembele tapping in after a howler from Owain Fon Williams. Stuart Armstrong's whipped free-kick then beat the Welshman at his near post before Dembele chipped in his second. It was the Frenchman's 31st goal of a stellar debut season, and his 11th in five games. Media playback is not supported on this device With a 27-point lead over Aberdeen with 11 games left and a huge advantage in goal difference, two more wins would effectively be enough for Celtic to retain their title. Defeat left Caley Thistle two points adrift of Motherwell and Hamilton at the bottom. Celtic's one 'blemish' of their entire Premiership season had come at the Caledonian Stadium way back in September, when Inverness emerged with a precious point from a 2-2 draw, despite a dominant display from the visitors. This match followed a similar pattern initially, the champions-elect enjoying the majority of possession as they regularly manoeuvred themselves behind Caley lines, only to be repelled by the hosts' defensive resolve. Dembele, who scored a Scottish Cup hat-trick against the same opponents last month, had a couple of early sighters; his first from a tight angle brought a comfortable save from Fon Williams, while a snap-shot from 20 yards was also easy meat for the Caley keeper. Gary Mackay-Steven, back in the side for the unfit James Forrest, forced the home keeper into further action with a left-foot drive that he did well to beat away for a corner. The hosts had the odd glimpse of goal themselves, Liam Polworth with a speculative early long-ranger, while Billy Mckay cut in from the right but his left-foot shot barely troubled Craig Gordon. With two minutes of the first half remaining, the hosts would have been congratulating themselves on a job well done. But Sinclair showed strength to ride Ross Draper's challenge and then sublime skill to unleash a powerful 25-yarder curling beyond the reach of Fon Williams into the right corner. If that goal was a thing of beauty, Celtic's second was pure comedy. Inverness kicked off the second half but Gary Warren's slack back-pass was immediately intercepted by the alert Dembele, whose touch was too heavy to capitalise. But Fon Williams made a horrendous mess of his clearing kick, slicing it up in the air. Dembele tried to hook the high ball left-footed over the keeper, but had time to readjust and meet the dropping ball with a simple right-footed finish. That effectively settled the contest, and Sinclair should have scored again in the 51st minute after a powerful run and precise pass from Dembele, but the winger could only fire wildly over. It mattered not. Armstrong, showing more of the form that could lead to a Scotland call-up in the next few weeks, fired in a superb free-kick from 25 yards for his 10th goal of a highly productive season, though Fon Williams had cause to look at his positioning. Caley rallied briefly, Polworth warming Gordon's palms with a dipping volley that the Celtic keeper tipped over. But moments later it was all over, Dembele racing away onto Kieran Tierney's excellent pass and caressing the ball over the advancing Fon Williams with a delicate chip. The visitors - now unbeaten in 33 domestic games - might have added further to their tally, but Sinclair scuffed his effort wide when sent through on goal late on. Caley boss Richie Foran: \\"It's extremely disappointing. We lacked courage on the ball, we lacked belief on the ball. I'm not even sure Celtic got out of second gear. We never got going. Media playback is not supported on this device \\"I find it hard to think of a player that did well. The whole 11 lacked courage. Off the ball we were OK; on the ball we didn't want to pass forward and take responsibility. \\"On the counter we had the ability but we didn't have the belief to go with it. It doesn't matter how good Celtic were. We had opportunities to play and get forward but we didn't fancy it. \\"The second goal was comical. It's embarrassing. But we were poor all over the park. At least three of the goals we conceded were avoidable.\\" Celtic manager Brendan Rodgers: \\"It was an outstanding team performance. Collectively we defended very well and it was probably one of the most complete performances since I have been here. \\"It is how I want the team to play - defensively very compact, hunting in packs, giving little space to the opponent and when we had the ball, attacking with fluidity and a goal threat. \\"The work ethic typified the mentality of the team, with hunger and pressure from the front. That is why we have kept so many clean sheets. \\"The plan coming in was to have more goal-scorers in the squad. Young Leigh (Griffiths) was outstanding last season, getting 40, and only Tom Rogic got near him with 10. But the way I like my team to play means we have an attacking threat from all areas of the team.\\" Match ends, Inverness CT 0, Celtic 4. Second Half ends, Inverness CT 0, Celtic 4.

Summarize the following: Coconut oil contains three different fatty acids (caprylic, capric & lauric acids) that are fungicidal, which means they kill fungi such as Candida and other species. These fatty acids within coconut oil kill yeast by destroying their cell walls, so it's very unlikely and difficult for fungi to gain resistance against them. Buy a good quality coconut oil (it's likely to be a solid instead of a liquid) and rub some it into your yeast infection 3x per day. You should see results (less redness and itching) within a week. Coconut oil is also a popular remedy for fighting systemic (internal) Candida yeast infections, although its taken orally in such situations. Coconut oil is also effective against bacterial skin infections and other kind of skin conditions, such as eczema and psoriasis, which can look similar to yeast/fungal skin infections. Application of tea tree oil, an extract of melaleuca alternifolia, can also be effective on yeast/fungal infections of the skin because it has strong antimicrobial properties and works well as a fungicide. Tea tree oil also boosts immunity, which can be helpful in preventing initial infections and re-infections of Candida and other fungi. Start with 2-3 drops of the tea tree oil on your skin infection, 3x daily for at least a couple of weeks and see how it works. Tea tree oil has been a popular antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory for many years in Australia, but has become better known in the U.S. over the last decade or so. Tea tree oil can cause both skin irritation and allergic reactions in some people who are especially sensitive, but the prevalence is rare. As such, test a little on some healthy skin before applying it to your yeast infection. Oil of oregano contains a couple of different compounds (carvacrol and thymol) that are both strong fungicides. These compounds completely inhibit Candida and other fungi via dehydration — they dry out and eventually die. Oil of oregano is quite strong and can cause a burning sensation on skin, so make sure to dilute it with vitamin E or some cod liver oil — water won't work well to dilute because it doesn't mix with oils. Mix 1-2 drops of oregano oil with the same quantity of vitamin E or fish oil and apply it your skin infection 3x daily for a couple weeks and make note of the progress. With any type of infection (fungal, bacterial or viral), true prevention and protection depends on a strong and healthy immune response. Your immune system is made up of specialized white blood cells that are designed to search for and destroy potential pathogens such as fungi. However, when your immune system is weakened due to the above-mentioned reasons, disease-causing microorganisms can grow and spread virtually unchecked. Thus, focus on boosting your natural immunity in order to combat yeast infections and stay healthy. Getting more quantity and better quality of sleep, eating more fresh produce, eating less refined sugars (sodas, candy, deserts), reducing your alcohol consumption, quitting smoking, practicing good hygiene and exercising regularly are all methods of keeping your immune response strong. Vitamin and herbal supplements that can boost immune system function include: vitamin C, vitamin D, zinc, echinacea and olive leaf extract.","completion":"Coconut oil is a natural fungicide containing three fatty acids (caprylic, capric, and lauric acids) that effectively kill fungi such as Candida by destroying their cell walls.

What is the answer: In which English castle did King John die in 1216?","completion":"King John, who reigned as the King of England from 1199 until his death in 1216, died in Newark Castle, located in the town of Newark-on-Trent in Nottinghamshire, England. John's reign was marked by numerous controversies and conflicts, including disputes with the Pope over the appointment of the Archbishop of Canterbury and the baronial rebellion that led to the signing of the Magna Carta in 1215. He suffered military setbacks and lost substantial territories in France. With the barons' dissatisfaction, a civil war known as the First Barons' War broke out in the final years of his reign. In 1216, while King John was campaigning in Eastern England to suppress the baronial rebellion, he contracted dysentery, a disease that can cause severe diarrhea and dehydration. During this time, he was residing at Newark Castle, which was an important strategic stronghold on the River Trent. It served as one of John's headquarters during his military efforts. On October 18, 1216, King John passed away in Newark Castle, likely due to complications from dysentery. After his death, he was succeeded by his nine-year-old son, King Henry III, who eventually managed to regain stability in England and put an end to the First Barons' War. Newark Castle survived the centuries following King John's death and still stands today, albeit in a partially ruined state. The castle's most prominent feature is its imposing gatehouse, and visitors can now explore the grounds, archways, dungeons, and the riverside walk. As an important historical site filled with stories of power struggles and political tensions, Newark Castle holds a unique place in England's rich history, commemorating the life and reign of King John."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One wrote 'a diner unconvinced by proposed EU menu..refusing to pay bill' Another spoke of him 'abandoning traditional English reserve' in his rant. Article:","completion":"Title: The PM's Fury: A Fawlty Towers-esque Debacle in Politics Introduction A recent episode involving the Prime Minister (PM) has captured the attention of major outlets, who have portrayed the PM's explosive response and demeanor as strikingly similar to customers from the infamous British sitcom, Fawlty Towers. The situation, implicating the PM's disagreement over the EU proposal and the subsequent shedding of his traditionally restrained composure, has taken the political landscape by storm. The Fawlty Towers Comparison The comparison between the PM and characters from the widely popular Fawlty Towers sitcom is an amusing, albeit symbolic, analogy to elucidate the PM's wrathful display. Fawlty Towers, a television series first broadcast in the 1970s, showcased the eponymous hotel's eccentric owner Basil Fawlty, who became well-known for his short fuse, often directed at patrons of the establishment. One media outlet likened the PM to \\"a diner unconvinced by the proposed EU menu…refusing to pay the bill,\\" showcasing his dissatisfaction with the current state of the European Union's propositions. Another reported the PM's vigorous outburst, stating he was \\"abandoning the traditional English reserve\\" in his indignant rant. Effects on the Political Landscape This unorchestrated moment of visible discontent has not only set the stage for significant discussions regarding the EU's agenda but also impacted the image of the PM himself. Historically known for his usually composed and courteous nature, this sudden break from the \\"traditional English reserve\\" has shaken the public's perception and generated unease regarding his stance on the matter. Underlying Causes of the PM's Fury The general consensus among political analysts is that the PM's frustration was a culmination of mounting pressure and dissatisfaction with the EU's direction. The outburst was likely a product of tensions that had been prevalent for some time and simply reached a boiling point. Implications The PM's Fawlty Towers-like episode has far-reaching implications, both domestically and within the European political arena. The unease that his behavior has instilled in the public has intensified the desire for clarification on the intended direction of the nation. Furthermore, the Fawlty Towers comparison serves as a humorous indicator of the monumental impact that this peculiar behavior has had on broader political discussions. It is a reminder that, while maintaining a levelheaded and reserved demeanor is essential in diplomacy, even the most composed figures can reach their breaking point. Conclusion Ultimately, the image of the Prime Minister that has emerged from the fury he displayed toward the EU proposal has served as a catalyst for political discourse. This Fawlty Towers-esque outburst unraveled the PM's traditional image and brought to light the underlying tensions present in the European political landscape. While the comparison may have derived from a light-hearted perspective, it ultimately helps to underline the pressing issues that still need to be addressed in European politics and the importance of maintaining a composed and diplomatic approach in such matters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The SEC's primary objective is to protect investors and maintain fair, orderly, and efficient markets by regulating the securities market, issuers of securities, and the professionals who participate in these markets, including exchanges like Nasdaq. Moreover, financial markets operate within the framework of laws and regulations set by the government and other relevant institutions. Nasdaq, as a marketplace, must comply with these laws and regulations as well as any decisions made by the institutions overseeing these aspects of the market. Nasdaq might influence specific aspects of its marketplace operations and design by instituting new rules and regulatory measures.

It was built by the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) between 1998 and 2008 in collaboration with over 10,000 scientists and engineers from over 100 countries, as well as hundreds of universities and laboratories. It lies in a tunnel in circumference, as deep as beneath the FranceSwitzerland border near Geneva, Switzerland. Its first research run took place from 30 March 2010 to 13 February 2013 at an initial energy of 3.5 teraelectronvolts (TeV) per beam (7 TeV total), almost 4 times more than the previous world record for a collider, rising to 4 TeV per beam (8 TeV total) from 2012. On 13 February 2013 the LHC's first run officially ended, and it was shut down for planned upgrades. 'Test' collisions restarted in the upgraded collider on 5 April 2015, reaching 6.5 TeV per beam on 20 May 2015 (13 TeV total, the current world record). Its second research run commenced on schedule, on 3 June 2015. - Prague is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. It is the 14th largest city in the European Union. It is also the historical capital of Bohemia. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.26 million people, while its larger urban zone is estimated to have a population of nearly 2 million. The city has a temperate climate, with warm summers and chilly winters. - Charles University, known also as Charles University in Prague is the oldest and largest university in the Czech Republic. Founded in 1348, it was the first university in Central Europe. It is one of the oldest universities in Europe in continuous operation and ranks in the upper 1.5 percent of the worlds best universities. - The Cavendish experiment, performed in 17971798 by British scientist Henry Cavendish, was the first experiment to measure the force of gravity between masses in the laboratory and the first to yield accurate values for the gravitational constant. Because of the unit conventions then in use, the gravitational constant does not appear explicitly in Cavendish's work. Instead, the result was originally expressed as the specific gravity of the Earth, or equivalently the mass of the Earth. His experiment gave the first accurate values for these geophysical constants. The experiment was devised sometime before 1783 by geologist John Michell, who constructed a torsion balance apparatus for it. However, Michell died in 1793 without completing the work. After his death the apparatus passed to Francis John Hyde Wollaston and then to Henry Cavendish, who rebuilt the apparatus but kept close to Michell's original plan. Cavendish then carried out a series of measurements with the equipment and reported his results in the \\"Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society\\" in 1798. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force.

The app offers a unique take on interactive fiction gaming, bringing back memories of old-school text adventures like Zork and Planetfall. The interface of the app is simplistic yet functional, allowing for easy navigation while immersing oneself into the storylines. One aspect that I particularly appreciated was the app's compatibility with several formats, including Glulx, Z-Code, and TADS. This means that there is a vast library of interactive fiction titles to choose from, ensuring endless hours of entertainment. I also liked that the app is open-source, which allows developers and enthusiasts to collaborate and contribute to the app's ongoing development. However, there is room for improvement. The app could benefit from a more polished and modern design. Its text-based interface, although reminiscent of classic text adventures, can be quite overwhelming for new users. Furthermore, I noticed that there are occasional crashes and bugs that can hinder the overall gaming experience. Additionally, the app could offer more features for personalization and customization, such as adjusting the text size, color schemes, or font types. This would provide a more comfortable and tailored experience for users with different preferences and accessibility needs. In summary, I am quite impressed with the org.andglkmod.hunkypunk app. Despite its shortcomings, it provides a unique and engaging experience for fans of interactive fiction.

Article: If you can see the magic in a fairytale, you can face the future.\\" --Danielle Steel Who have not read fairytales? We all have had the experience of reveling in the beauty and innocence of fairytales. May it be Cinderella or Sleeping Beauty... fairytale is a word which cannot be new to us. But have you ever traveled ages back to the earliest of times and uncovered the fascinating facts about these stories? Well, if not, then here are some mystical finds I discovered when I undertook this journey. A fairytale or fairy story is a fictional tale that usually features folkloric characters (such as fairies, talking animals). A fairytale often stars transformed princes, princesses, animals, as in \\"fairytale ending\\" where the humble but heroic princes defeat the wicked enemies or as in \\"fairytale romance\\" where after much ado the beautiful princesses marry their Prince Charming. One distinct feature of fairytales is that, they take place \\"once upon a time\\". The history of the fairytale is particularly difficult to trace. The oral tradition of the fairytale came long before the written page. The oldest known fairytales stem from ancient Egypt around 1,300 B.C and now, after traveling through various periods of time, they have grown and matured in various aspects and have become the most popular genre of stories for young children. The most famous authors of fairytales are the Grimm Brothers whose works include Cinderella, Rapunzel, Sleeping Beauty, Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs and many more; The Grimm Brothers collected their tales from farmers and edited them to suit their audience. But whatever may the form be, fairytales are after all fairytales! G. K. Chesterton said, \\"Fairytales do not tell children the dragons exist; they tell the dragons can be killed.\\" This quote has great weight. Every child believes in fairies, dragons, etc. They do not need fairytales to tell them that. Instead fairytales tell that good always succeed over evil. So fairytales are necessary for young minds.

One day he decided to get the sweetest mango from the very top of the tree. Mangoes which are exposed to the sun the most are the sweetest. So he climbed up to the top, where the branches were thin. He managed to pick up a few sweet reddish fruits, but, in an attempt to climb down, he slipped and started falling towards the ground. Fortunately, he caught the branch as he was falling and remained helplessly hanging on the tree. Then he started to call nearby villagers for help. They immediately came with a ladder and sticks, but could do little to help him. Then after some time one calm and thoughtful person arrived - a well-known sage who lived in a simple hut nearby. People were very curious to see what he would do, as he was famous in solving many people's problems in the area and sometimes very complicated ones. He was silent for a minute and then picked up a stone and threw it at the hanging man. Everybody was surprised. The hanging mango lover started to shout: What are you doing?! Are you crazy? Do you want me to break my neck?\\" The sage was silent. Then he took another stone and threw it at the man. The man was very angry: \\"If I could just come down, I would show you!\\" That's what everybody wanted - that he came down. But how? Now everybody was tense, as to what would happen next! Some wanted to chastise the sage, but they didn't. The sage picked another stone and threw it again at the man, even more forcefully. Now the man on the tree was enraged and developed a great determination to come down and take revenge. He then used all his skill and strength and somehow reached the branches which were safe to start going down. And he made it! Everybody was amazed. However, the rescued man found the sage gone. He stood there, realizing that the man really sed him because he induced him to try his best and save himself. \\"I should be thankful and not angry.\\" How did the man feel when the sage hit him with a stone?

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"The owl hated the evil and the wise eagle.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would likely consider the sentence \\"The owl hated the evil and the wise eagle\\" to be acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to the basic rules of English syntax and grammar. However, there are several aspects of the sentence that a linguist may consider for further analysis and interpretation. 1. Syntax: The sentence follows the subject-verb-object (SVO) word order, which is conventional in English. The subject is \\"the owl,\\" the verb is \\"hated,\\" and the object is \\"the evil and the wise eagle.\\" The conjunction \\"and\\" is used to link two items within the object, which is syntactically acceptable. 2. Grammar: The sentence displays correct agreement between the subject and the verb. The singular noun \\"owl\\" corresponds with the singular verb \\"hated.\\" Additionally, the adjectives \\"evil\\" and \\"wise\\" properly describe the singular noun \\"eagle.\\" 3. Semantics: The meaning of the sentence is generally clear; an owl dislikes an eagle described as both evil and wise. However, it's worth noting that the adjectives \\"evil\\" and \\"wise\\" may be seen as contradictory. This ambiguity could lead to multiple interpretations of the sentence, as the characteristics of the eagle might not be immediately clear to a reader. For example, it could be inferred that the eagle possesses both good and bad qualities or that there are two different eagles, one being evil and the other being wise. 4. Pragmatics: In terms of pragmatic understanding, it may be necessary to contextualize the sentence to make sense of it. For instance, are the owl and eagle characters in a fable or story? Are they meant to represent human traits or qualities? As stand-alone information, the sentence seems unusual, but within a broader context, it may be more understandable. 5. Stylistics: While the sentence is grammatically and syntactically acceptable, a linguist may analyze its stylistic choices. For instance, the use of anthropomorphism in attributing human emotions (hatred) and characteristics (evil, wise) to animals could be a point of examination. Additionally, a linguist might consider the sentence's potential literary or cultural significance, such as its relation to folklore or familiar tropes involving animal personification. In conclusion, a linguist would likely rate this sentence as linguistically acceptable, as it adheres to the basic rules of English syntax and grammar. However, the sentence's semantics, pragmatics, and stylistic choices offer ample opportunity for further analysis and interpretation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Adriana is delighted with the gift, hugging her brother gratefully, but their mother, Lupe, is skeptic; where did Jorge get the money to pay for the bicycle? Moreover, she doesn't approve of his latest group of friends, believing they look seedy. Jorge says they helped him get a job giving tours at the Zocalo in English. He needs to hurry to work now, having just stopped by to drop off the bike. But Lupe doesn't approve, neither of Jorge's supposed job, nor of how he acquired the bike. She also believes, that with her husband and Jorge and Adriana's father gone, it falls to Jorge to look after his young sister.

Output:","completion":"Part #1: Understanding the given information. Usage: Carolyn bought 17 gumballs, Lew bought 12 gumballs. This information tells us the initial number of gumballs bought by Carolyn and Lew. It meets the criteria because we are given specific numbers for them. Part #2: Finding Carey's gumball range based on average. Usage: The average number of gumballs the 3 bought is between 19 and 25, inclusive. This information establishes a range for the average number of gumballs bought by each person. We know that (17 + 12 + x) / 3 must be within this range. This criterion is met as it establishes a constraint on Carey's gumballs. Part #3: Finding the smallest number of gumballs Carey could have bought. Usage: With the given average range, we can find the smallest number of gumballs Carey could have bought. Using 19 as the minimum average, we can calculate (17 + 12 + x) / 3 = 19. Solving for x, we would get x = 38 gumballs as the smallest number Carey could have bought. The criteria are met as it provides the lower limit for Carey's gumballs. Part #4: Finding the greatest number of gumballs Carey could have bought. Usage: Similarly, we can find the greatest number of gumballs Carey could have bought using the maximum average of 25. Calculating (17 + 12 + x) / 3 = 25, we get x = 56 gumballs as the largest number. This criterion is met as it provides the upper limit for Carey's gumballs. Part #5: Finding the difference between the greatest and smallest numbers of gumballs Carey could have bought. Usage: Now that we know the smallest (38) and greatest (56) possible numbers of gumballs, we can calculate the difference between them: 56 - 38 = 18 gumballs.

Paragraph: You couldnt survive without your skin. It has many important functions. The main function of the skin is controlling what enters and leaves the body. It prevents the loss of too much water from the body. It also prevents bacteria and other microorganisms from entering the body. The skin helps maintain a constant body temperature. It keeps the body cool in two ways. Sweat from sweat glands in the skin evaporates to cool the body. Blood vessels in the skin dilate, or widen. This action increases blood flow to the body surface. This allows more heat to reach the surface. The heat is then able to radiate off the body. The opposite happens to retain body heat. Blood vessels in the skin constrict, or narrow. This decreases blood flow to the body surface. This reduces the amount of heat that reaches the surface. When this happens, less heat can be lost to the air.

Furthermore, the reviewer expresses hope that Pun's work might have improved over time but does not feel that this particular album, along with the previous one, showcases the best of Pun's talent.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!). Yoko assured me that this soap was incredibly gentle and was not at all drying. Lucky for her I am...

Transport, policing, environment, and housing and planning in London are the four big areas which the mayor controls. The mayor also creates policies for arts and culture, business, fire, health, regeneration, sport and young people in London. The London Assembly debates the mayor's policies, The assembly must also be consulted over the GLA budget. It can reject mayoral policies or amend the draft budget if two-thirds of assembly members agree to do so. Polling stations are open from 0700 until 2200 on 5 May. Registered voters will be given three ballot papers - pink, yellow and orange. After polls close, ballot boxes are stored overnight and counting begins from 0900 on Friday. Results are expected on Friday evening. Using the pink ballot paper, voters choose their first and second preferences for mayor. The votes are counted and if a candidate has won more than 50% of first preferences, they are elected mayor. If no candidate has won more than 50%, all but the top two candidates are eliminated. Any second preferences for the top two candidates from the eliminated candidates are added to their totals. Whoever has the most votes combined is declared the winner. Second preferences on the ballot papers of the top two candidates for one of the other top candidates are not counted. Voters have two ballot papers to choose the two types of London Assembly member. The yellow ballot paper is used to choose the constituency member. Voters choose one candidate, who if elected will represent their area of London. Ballots are counted and whoever has won the most is elected. The orange ballot paper is used to choose one of the 11 additional London-wide assembly members, who represent the whole city. This time, voters choose one political party or an individual standing as an independent candidate. London-wide seats are allocated using proportional representation, using a mathematical formula called modified D'Hondt.","completion":"The Mayor and London Assembly are part of a group called the Greater London Authority (GLA). The Mayor helps to decide how London should be run, like how to handle transportation, police, environment, and where people should live. The Mayor also thinks about things like art, business, sports, and what's best for young people in the city. The London Assembly can discuss what the Mayor wants to do, and they can also help make decisions about how to spend the city's money. When it's time to choose a new Mayor and Assembly, people in London can vote. They get three pieces of colored paper to pick who they like best: pink for the Mayor, yellow for the Assembly member in their area, and orange for a person who will care for the whole city. After people vote, we need to count all the papers to find out who won. For the Mayor, someone needs more than 50% of the votes to win. If that doesn't happen, we check people's second choices and count those.

With the financial expansion, trading rights became more jealously guarded by the commercial elite. Towns saw the growing power of guilds, while on a national level special companies would be granted monopolies on particular trades, like the English wool Staple. The beneficiaries of these developments would accumulate immense wealth. Families like the Fuggers in Germany, the Medicis in Italy, the de la Poles in England, and individuals like Jacques Coeur in France would help finance the wars of kings, and achieve great political influence in the process. Which economic associations gained power in the towns?","completion":"The economic associations that gained power in the towns during the period of financial expansion were the guilds. Guilds were associations of craftsmen or merchants who often held considerable power in the local economies. They were responsible for maintaining standards for the quality of goods and services they provide. They also controlled the training of apprentices and acted as mutual aid societies for their members. As the economy expanded and trading rights became more exclusive, the guilds increased in power and influence. Their control over specific trades within towns meant that they could price goods and services appropriately and protect their members' economic interests.

Police said Gordon, 47, and 30-year-old sex offender Franc Cano abducted and killed the women in 2013 and 2014. Prosecutors first charged Gordon with rape but later dropped the charges. He may now face the death penalty. Gordon and Cano, both registered sex offenders, were first convicted in separate cases of lewd and lascivious acts with a child under 14. Gordon, who was convicted in 1992, also had a kidnapping conviction in 2002. Cano was convicted in 2008. Police believe Cano and Gordon had known each other since at least 2010, when Cano was arrested in Alabama with Gordon after cutting off his monitoring device. The pair then cut off their monitoring devices two years later and travelled on a Greyhound bus to Las Vegas before they were arrested again by federal agents. According to grand jury testimony, Gordon was living in a camper van, or recreational vehicle (RV), in Anaheim at the time of the killings. He and Cano brought their victims to the RV site and wore a GPS tracking device during at least three of the murders. Authorities connected Gordon and Cano to the disappearance of the women through their tracking devices after discovering the body of missing 21-year-old Jarrae Nykkole Estepp. The men were charged with killing three other women who went missing in Santa Ana in 2013: Kianna Jackson, 20; Josephine Monique Vargas, 34; and Martha Anaya, 28. All four women had connections to prostitution. The jurors, who deliberated for about an hour before handing down the verdict, also found there were special circumstances of murder during a kidnapping and multiple murders, making Gordon eligible for a death sentence.

Based on the sentence \\"A man in all black clothing on stage reading something from a piece of paper into the microphone to the audience.\\", is the sentence \\"There is one man in this picture, and he is inside.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The sentence \\"There is one man in this picture, and he is inside.\\" can neither be confirmed as true nor false based on the information provided in the original description. This is because the original sentence does not explicitly mention that it is describing a picture and also does not state whether the stage and the event are occurring indoors or outdoors. From the given information in the statement \\"A man in all black clothing on stage reading something from a piece of paper into the microphone to the audience.\\" we can gather the following details about the situation: 1. There is one man involved in the scene. 2. The man is wearing all black clothing. 3. The man is on stage. 4. The man is reading from a piece of paper. 5. The man is using a microphone while reading to the audience. However, we cannot deduce whether the scene pertains to a picture or whether the stage setting is inside an indoor facility or an outdoor area. For example, the stage could be set up inside an auditorium, theater, or conference room, or it could be an open-air event like in a park, festival, or street performance. The original sentence simply does not provide enough information to confirm or deny the second statement. In conclusion, based on the information in the first description, we cannot ascertain if the sentence \\"There is one man in this picture, and he is inside.\\" is completely true. The only aspect we can confirm as true from the first sentence is that there is indeed one man involved in the scene. Without further information or context about whether the scene is part of a picture or the location of the stage, it would be inappropriate to affirm the validity of the remaining statement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Rand Paul arrives in South Carolina on Friday for a handful of fundraisers and closed-door meetings with local Republicans, the latest in a series of expeditions to key primary states as he mulls a presidential bid in 2016. In New Hampshire, early signs of the 2016 presidential race If the Kentucky senator decides to embark on a White House run, a likely prospect according to those around him, his South Carolina foray crystallizes what could be a central challenge as a Republican candidate: assuaging skeptical donors in the party's establishment without rankling the grass-roots activists who helped lift him to national prominence. \\"But he is bridging some gaps that we haven't seen before from another","completion":"candidate,\\" said South Carolina GOP strategist David Wilkins. \\"His ability to connect with diverse audiences and bring together different factions within the party may be the key to his success in a crowded field.\\" Over the last year, Paul has been working to widen his appeal beyond his libertarian base, making strides in reaching out to more traditional Republicans, religious conservatives, and even minority communities disillusioned with the Democratic Party. The challenge for Paul in South Carolina, as well as in other early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire, will be finding a way to maintain his unique identity while winning over these skeptical donors and party power brokers. \\"Senator Paul is aware that winning the Republican nomination requires building coalitions within the party,\\" explained Doug Stafford, a senior adviser to the potential candidate. \\"However, he's also committed to offering a bold vision for the country, which includes small government principles, individual liberty, and fiscal responsibility. He's not going to compromise on those core beliefs.\\" As Paul continues his outreach efforts in South Carolina and other primary states, he'll have to walk a tightrope between reassuring establishment donors and not alienating his core supporters. While many insiders are predicting a contentious battle for the GOP nomination, Paul's ability to navigate these competing demands may ultimately determine his success on the national stage. If Rand Paul can successfully bridge the divide between the establishment and the grassroots, he may emerge as a unifying force in the Republican Party, defying conventional wisdom and potentially reshaping the 2016 presidential race."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: Actor Charlie Sheen is the subject of a felony threat investigation triggered by his ex-fiancée, Los Angeles police and the woman's lawyer told NBC News on Wednesday. Scottine Ross, a retired pornographic film star, has previously accused Sheen, 50, in a civil suit of assault, battery, intentional inflection of emotional distress, false imprisonment and negligence for failing to disclose that he was HIV-positive during their engagement, which ended in 2014. David Ring, an attorney for Ross, 26, who performed under the name Brett Rossi, told NBC News that his client returned to Los Angeles police recently to seek a protective order against Sheen. The order was sought after The National Enquirer and Radar Online published excerpts on March 31 of what they said was an audiotape in which Sheen confesses to having lied about his HIV status and having threatened to kill Ross. Los Angeles police served a search warrant Tuesday at the magazine's New York headquarters seeking the audiotape and confirmed Wednesday to NBC News that Sheen was the subject of a \\"felony threat investigation.\\" They would provide no further details. The magazine's parent company, American Media Inc., said in a statement to NBC News that it believes the warrant \\"violates federal and state law prohibiting the use of search warrants against media companies who are reporting news and information.\\" Charlie Sheen and Scottine Ross in an undated photo celebrating their engagement. MSNBC The search warrant, which was obtained Wednesday by NBC News, says Ross told investigators that Sheen had unprotected sex with her while he was infected with the human inmmunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS, without informing her of his condition. It said Ross told police that she \\"endured domestic violence, physical assaults and death threats\\" while she was with Sheen. The allegations included in the warrant match those made in a civil lawsuit Ross filed Dec. 3 in Los Angeles County Superior Court. In the suit, Ross alleges that in addition to concealing his HIV status from her, Sheen on numerous occasions erupted in violent fits, often accompanied by threats. On a November 2013 visit to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, for example, Sheen punched a hole in the hotel room wall, grabbed Ross and began violently shaking her while screaming obscenities, she alleges in the suit. In January 2014, she alleges, Sheen demanded information about Ross's ex-husband. When she refused to provide it, Sheen flipped over a coffee table, threw a punch at her and began kicking her as she lay huddled on the floor, Ross alleges. Later that month, she alleges, Sheen began graphically describing how he wanted to murder her ex-husband and other unidentified people. According to the lawsuit, Ross found text messages on Sheen's phone indicating that a \\"hit\\" had been placed on her ex-husband. Two months later, the suit alleges, Ross told Sheen that she was pregnant with his child. He again flew into a rage over the prospect of having a \\"retarded child\\" owing to his HIV status and browbeat her into getting an abortion she didn't want, the suit says. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Article: I was born in Ireland and lived there until I was nineteen years old. I came to New York in 1956. At first, I held several jobs to earn a few dollars. Later, to live a better life, I bought my own taxi car. Till now, I've been in the taxi car business for thirty-five years. I know there is a lot about taxi drivers that is not so good. Because of this, people get the wrong impression that they are bad. In fact, taxi drivers are just like other honest people. You can read in the papers almost every week where a taxi driver turns in money or jewels people leave in their cars. One time in Brooklyn, I found a ring in my car. I remembered helping a lady with a lot of bags that day, so I went back to the store where I had dropped her off. It took me almost two days to look for her in order to return the ring. I didn't get as much as \\"Thank you.\\" Still, I felt good because I had done what was right. In all my years of driving a taxi car, I have never had any trouble with the public because I always try to be nice to everyone. I try to be honest toward others. I have been trying this for a long time, and the longer I try, the easier it gets. I believe honesty is one of the greatest gifts there is. It's something that makes a man a good guy.

Morgan Freeman is an actor, who researches a character he is selected to play, before he makes a commitment. Freeman is a 'good fit' for this film (like he was for \\"Driving Miss Daisy\\"), and he is not only believable, but he gets a chance to change his image of playing a character with reserved dignity and propriety. Although there are no guarantees in life, for anyone, this gives an actor a great opportunity to play different or unique characters that stand out, in order to avoid getting stereotyping. And it must be said that stereotyping has hampered, or completely ruined, a significant number of acting careers. This is a low-budget film that, amazingly, was made in a time span of only two weeks. It is a film that is well directed and written by Brad Silberling. The location manager chose Carson, CA for the film's setting, and the location helps set the tone and timing for the film. The editing is fair to good, but a little rough. Silberling was the 'subcontractor', in getting Freeman to do this film, while the actor was in-between film projects. There is a good chemistry between Freeman and Paz Vega, a Spanish actress, and this opens an effective dialog between each of the cast members, who are diverse and come from different cultures. The film also encourages an understanding between people, who not only speak two languages (English and Spanish), but come from two different worlds of ethnicity, race, gender, norms, mores, beliefs, folkways, principles, and values. The film strives for some honesty, and arrives at some truth, to maintain the film's integrity. Part of the comedy is that Freeman plays an unemployed actor that has been out of work for four years. In truth, Freeman is so-in-demand as an actor that he is constantly working. The film offers an adventure of bonding, caring, sharing, changing, and exchanging. And, the film's outtakes give the viewer a preview of some of things an actor must go through in preparing for a role. If necessary, tell your boss that you're taking a 'mental health day', and go see this film. If you're able, take your significant other or your family with you. I rank the film a 10 out of 10. It's enjoyable, interesting, informative, poignant, and worthwhile.","completion":"The sentiment expressed in this text is overwhelmingly positive. The author praises Morgan Freeman's acting skills and his commitment to researching characters before taking on a role. They mention that Freeman is a \\"good fit\\" for this particular film and that he is believable in his performance. The author also appreciates that the film provides Freeman with an opportunity to change his image and avoid being typecast in certain roles. The low-budget nature and short production time of the film are mentioned as impressive, with the author commending the direction and writing by Brad Silberling. They also appreciate the choice of the location, the editing, and the role of Silberling in getting Freeman on board for the project.

Here is a goal: How do you roast broccoli? How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"Roasting broccoli is a delicious way to bring out its natural flavors and crispness. By following these steps, you'll be able to accomplish the goal of roasting broccoli to perfection. 1. Gather your ingredients and equipment: - Fresh broccoli - Olive oil (or your preferred cooking oil) - Salt - Freshly ground black pepper - Optional seasonings (garlic powder, onion powder, red pepper flakes, etc.) - A large mixing bowl - A baking sheet or roasting pan - Parchment paper or silicone baking mat (optional) 2. Preheat your oven: Preheat your oven to 425°F (220°C). This high temperature ensures that the broccoli will roast quickly and evenly, while developing a crispy, caramelized exterior. 3. Prepare the broccoli: Rinse the broccoli under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Then, pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. Cut the broccoli into florets, making sure they are roughly the same size to ensure even cooking. If desired, you can also cut the stems into thin, bite-sized pieces to include in the roasting. To reduce waste, remember to save the leftover stems for use in other recipes, such as soups or stir-fries. 4. Season the broccoli: In a large mixing bowl, combine the broccoli florets and any stem pieces. Drizzle with enough olive oil to lightly coat the broccoli (approximately 1-2 tablespoons). Toss the broccoli to ensure even oil distribution. Season the broccoli with salt and pepper to taste, as well as any other desired seasonings. Toss again to evenly coat the broccoli with the spices. 5. Prepare the baking sheet: Line a baking sheet or roasting pan with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. This step not only prevents the broccoli from sticking to the surface, but also simplifies the cleanup process. If you do not have parchment paper or a silicone mat, you can lightly grease the baking sheet with oil. 6. Arrange the broccoli on the baking sheet: Spread the seasoned broccoli out across the lined baking sheet or roasting pan in a single layer. Ensure that there is some space between the florets, as overcrowding can cause the broccoli to steam rather than roast. 7. Roast the broccoli: Place the baking sheet in the preheated oven, and roast for approximately 20-25 minutes. Halfway through the roasting time, turn the broccoli to promote even browning. The broccoli is done when it is tender and the edges are browned and crispy. 8. Taste and adjust seasoning: Once the broccoli is roasted, remove the baking sheet from the oven and allow it to cool slightly. Taste the broccoli and, if needed, adjust the seasoning by adding more salt, pepper, or other desired spices. 9. Serve and enjoy: Roasted broccoli can be served immediately as a side dish, added to a salad, or incorporated into other recipes, such as pasta dishes or grain bowls. By following these steps, you will be able to achieve the goal of roasting broccoli, resulting in a flavorful and nutritious dish that is sure to please any palate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our goal is to find out what number \\"v\\" is. We start with the equation: 84*v - 5200 = 604*v Step 1: To make things easier, we want to move all the \\"v\\" terms to one side, and all the numbers (constants) to the other side. So, let's subtract 84*v from both sides: 84*v - 84*v - 5200 = 604*v - 84*v This becomes: -5200 = 520*v Step 2: Now, we want to find what 1*v is (just \\"v\\"). To do that, we'll divide both sides of the equation by 520: -5200 divided by 520 = 520*v divided by 520 This gives us: -10 = v So, the solution is v = -10.

Under fire: Labour MP Ann Clwyd has has been attacked by the NHS and her own party after she complained that her husband Owen died 'like a battery hen' in hospital. Yesterday, the hospital where Ann Clwyd’s husband died issued an official report dismissing her claims against it. The Labour MP is the latest in a long list of patients and their families who the NHS feels it can ignore with impunity. This is despite the fact that this courageous widow, grieving for her beloved husband, stood up in Parliament determined to expose the ‘indifferent’ and ‘callous’ staff and the lack of care that she claimed caused his death. It is despite the fact that David Cameron was so impressed by her first-hand experiences that he asked her to overhaul the complaints system of the NHS. It is despite the fact that her harrowing testimony brought forth a flood of letters from the public telling similar stories of neglect. That cuts no ice with University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. Owen Roberts might have died like ‘a battery hen’, shoved up against the bars of his tiny bed, his feet hanging over the edge, bereft of even socks or a blanket to keep him warm, according to his wife. But the investigation by hospital staff, overseen by an independent panel of experts, dismissed 21 of the MP’s 31 complaints as unproven or by saying ‘insufficient evidence to uphold this concern’. Anyone who has made a complaint to the NHS, whether questioning an indifferent nurse or making a more formal accusation, knows the response they will get only too well — a barrage of doublespeak designed to confuse and weary you. Only once in the report into Owen Roberts’ death does the doublespeak falter. That is when it knocks up against the fact he waited 27 hours in A&E and then died of hospital-acquired pneumonia. ‘This concern is upheld except that it is not upheld that there was a lack of care and attention,’ is the hospital’s response. Go wonder at that one. George Orwell, the writer who invented the phrase doublespeak in his novel 1984, could not have put it better. Taking on the NHS is not for the faint-hearted, as Ms Clywd is discovering. Our health service seems to have reached new levels of paranoia. Happier times: Ann Clwyd with her husband Owen Roberts on their wedding day 1963. He died aged 73 at University Hospital of Wales. When I was investigating the NHS for the Centre of Policy Studies ten years ago, managers did not know what was going on in their hospitals because they rarely visited a ward or asked patients about their experiences. They could at least claim ignorance and hope the whole thing would go away. Now, instead of not responding to complaints, the NHS turns aggressively on the person daring to complain. Our caring service has become more like something out of an airport thriller — a vast, malign organisation bullying patients and their loved ones, threatening whistleblowers and spending huge sums of taxpayers’ money to grind them down. Just this week it emerged that University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire NHS Trust spent £6 million on legal fees, employed a PR firm and even set private detectives to dig dirt on Dr Raj Mattu, a heart surgeon who had spoken out about the dangerous conditions on his wards. That is all he had done. Complaint: Mrs Clwyd, 77, claimed her husband had been victim of an 'almost callous lack of care' and was treated with 'contempt' by NHS staff before his death in October 2012. For that, as his lawyer said, he was ‘vilified, bullied and harassed out of a job he loved’. Ann Clwyd does not work for the NHS, but the organisation has done its best to hit her where it hurts. She has accused hospital bosses of an ‘outrageous breach of confidentiality’ by publishing detailed information about her husband’s death. As she said: ‘No one is going to make a complaint in future if their personal details are going to be made public in this way.’ The NHS being essentially a political organisation. Ms Clwyd also finds herself under fire from her own party. Recently Wales’s First Minister Carwyn Jones launched a stinging attack on her for critical comments made about the Welsh NHS — saying she had ‘no evidence and no facts’ to back up allegations of a crisis in the service. The Labour Welsh Assembly Member Lynne Neagle was outraged at Ms Clwyd’s concerns about the high mortality rates in some Welsh hospitals. She accused Ms Clwyd of ‘denigrating’ the Welsh NHS and warned that ‘she should stop’. Actually, no, she shouldn’t. What should stop are the high mortality rates. But that is unlikely to happen any time soon, given the fact that Labour’s Welsh Assembly Members have voted against inviting her to give evidence to an influential Welsh Assembly committee. Where the UK Coalition asked her to lead an inquiry, the Welsh Labour government has blocked and denigrated her. Her facts were good enough to alarm Sir Bruce Keogh, Chief Medical Officer for England, but not Welsh Labour MPs. Ann Clywd has discovered that patients come a very poor second to propagating the NHS myth. How crucial that myth is we saw in spades at the Olympic opening ceremony. Its artistic director, Danny Boyle, would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely, dancing nurses in starched caps who read stories to sick children. Dream on. Many of our elderly patients would be pathetically grateful for a nurse that paused long enough at their bedside to offer them a drink — never mind bedtime stories. The response of assembly members and hospital boards is typical. I came across it when investigating the NHS over nine months. My accounts of what I had seen were also dismissed as ‘anecdotal’. While there are undoubtedly countless dedicated and caring people working for the NHS who put themselves out for patients, like Ann Clwyd, I, too, was flooded with letters from patients who’d suffered the same ‘anecdotal’ experiences of callousness and incompetence. Vision: The Olympic opening ceremony's artistic director, Danny Boyle, would have us believe that the health service is stuffed with lovely, dancing nurses in starched caps. An old man described on the phone how he had watched his wife die of neglect. His call reduced me to tears. ‘I don’t know who to complain to. No one will listen,’ he said by way of apology at the end of the conversation. In a court of law, the testimony of a witness is given due weight. In the NHS, the same testimony is traduced as anecdote. That is part of the problem. Every patient with a complaint is made to feel isolated — a one-off, who really shouldn’t presume to denigrate such a noble institution. Look at what happened to a Labour MP of long standing. What chance do the rest of us have? One of the only reasons that the scandal. of Mid Staffs came out was because a number of relatives of patients. happened to go to the same nearby cafe and started to exchange stories. Tragedy: Owen Roberts waited 27 hours in A&E and then died of hospital-acquired pneumonia. They quickly realised that what they had been told was a one-off was, in fact, a systematic failure of the trust and the whole New Labour project for the NHS. This was one reason why their evidence had to be rubbished — with the woman who led the protests falling victim to a vicious hate campaign. The tragedy is that similar evidence against the NHS is still being rubbished. Let us end with one of those anecdotes the authorities dismiss — one left by a woman to comment on a story about Ann Clywd on the Wales Online website. The woman describes the degrading treatment of her dying mother in one Welsh hospital. When she complains, she says, ‘ranks are closed so people don’t take things further’. The authorities know complaints fall on ‘deaf ears and some like myself, because of their own ill health, do not have the stamina to follow things through. Money will be another obstacle to fight these cases, as they will inevitably carry on for years before a conclusion.’ It has happened to two friends. ‘Three years down the line and they still do not have closure.’ She finishes with this heartfelt plea: ‘Let me explain how I feel about Ann Clwyd’s findings. Myself and many, many friends who have experienced the disgusting downfalls of the Welsh NHS have all said we’d rather commit suicide than go into hospital when we are too old to stay at home through ill health. ‘I will . . . trust me. I will not be treated as a discarded piece of nuisance rubbish, as my mother was.’ Rather than another expensive, time-wasting re-organisation of the NHS, let the Government take one simple step. Create a website, not particular to individual hospitals, but a general forum where people can post these heart-breaking stories. How many hospitals will have the gall to dismiss case after case with their blanket approach of ‘insufficient evidence’? That way, patients will know they are not alone. And a malign bureaucracy will no longer get away with dismissing stories of cruelty and death as ‘merely anecdotal’. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"1.

Momma's Man, completely unshakeable, is implicitly nostalgic, about a nostalgic man, but only because it has such an unsentimental commitment to the gap between past and present. 2. The movie is quiet and minimal in its dialogue, and it has flashes of humor and thoughtfulness. However, it's also unbearably slow and hard to empathize with Mikey. 3. The production has a patient, observant tone, which almost disguises the fact that Momma's Man can't decide what kind of movie it wants to be. 4.

On one hand, reviewers appreciate the unique premise of the movie, its nostalgic aura, and its ability to prompt thoughtful and emotional reactions. Many critics lauded its meticulous unfolding of the story, along with the witty and skillful exploration of the premise by writer-director Azazel Jacobs. Additionally, Matt Boren's central performance was highly praised, and the Jacobs' residence itself was identified as an indispensable cast member for its contribution to the narrative's authenticity. On the other hand, several critiques addressed certain issues with the film. Notably, some reviewers commented on the film's pace as being unbearably slow, and at times even dragging. The observant and patient tone of the production, while appreciated by some, seemed to blur the film’s objective, leading to confusion about the movie's true identity. Moreover, there was a sentiment of difficulty in empathizing with the protagonist, Mikey, making his progression towards absolute mobility tough to watch. Yet, his portrayal was regarded convincing enough to pique curiosity about his character arc. The film's minimalist dialogue, despite flashes of humor and thoughtfulness, may fall short for those favoring stronger verbal interplay. By presenting a man trapped between his past and present, \\"Momma's Man\\" managed to connect with its audiences, allowing them to relate to the protagonists’ circumstances, despite its stylistic and narrative disadvantages. In conclusion, while the movie has been criticized for its slow pace and ambiguity in direction, \\"Momma's Man\\" seems to be a thought-provoking, emotionally engaging film dealing with nostalgia and identity, supplemented by strong performances and an intimate, personal setting."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Business minister Matthew Hancock (pictured) said he was 'shocked' to be having to argue that 'business is a force for good' Businesses will today be promised a £10 billion boost in the Conservative manifesto as the party seeks to exploit Labour's damaging row with captains of industry. Business minister Matthew Hancock said he is 'shocked and dismayed' to be having to argue that 'business is a force for good', a question he said he thought had been 'settled in the last century'. In an interview with the Daily Mail, the Cabinet minister set out plans to cut regulation and red tape, saving firms an average of £2,000 a year. Mr Hancock also signalled the party is preparing to offer tax breaks to start-up companies taking on their first employees and further steps to rein in vexatious industrial tribunal claims. 'Business is a force for good in our society,' he said. 'It's the first time in my adult life that a major political party thinks that being against business is good for Britain. 'We have to support and build our nation's employers. This is where jobs and prosperity come from. Coming from a small business background, it's why I came into politics in the first place, and we've spent five years working hard to make Britain a beacon for enterprise. 'We are increasingly regarded as a good place to start and grow a business and we want to be the best in the world. Labour's idea that you can attack business and businesspeople without damaging people's standard of living and jobs in Britain should have been consigned to the history books in the last century.' Labour has been embroiled in a damaging row with business leaders since turning on the boss of Boots when he expressed alarm at the prospect of the party regaining power. Ed Miliband has launched a series of policies supposed to target what he calls 'predator' capitalists. The party has suggested it will not go ahead with a planned cut in corporation tax for large firms to 21 per cent. Over the last week, more business leaders, including several who previously supported Labour, have come out to raise concern about the party's anti-business rhetoric. Shadow Chancellor Ed Balls, meanwhile, faced embarrassment when he could only name someone called 'Bill' when asked to cite Labour's business backers. The row has left Mr Balls facing a tricky appearance next week at the British Chambers of Commerce, which he is due to address. Mr Hancock said the Conservatives would go into the election as 'unashamedly pro-business and pro-enterprise'. He said the coalition had gradually cut regulation -- consignined 110,000 pages to the dustbin, saving business £2.2 billion this year. But a Conservative-only government would go further, committing to more deregulation -- with the initial focus on agriculture, railways, energy, construction, retail, travel operators and the chemical industry. A review of each sector will take place this year if the Tories remain in power, and Government departments made to implement a 'one in, two out' rule whenever they introduce any new regulation. Mr Hancock said he accepted there was scepticism about red tape 'bonfires', but the coalition had made 'solid' progress. Most striking was a 75 per cent fall in the number of tribunal claims against firms following reforms introduced by the Government to weed out vexatious claims. Employees now have to have been working for their employer for two years before they can take them to a tribunal alleging unfair dismissal, and go through a conciliation process before lodging a claim. Boots chief Stefano Pessina (left) has warned it would be a 'catastrophe' if Labour and Ed Miliband (right) win power. Pessina claimed Miliband’s policies were ‘not helpful for business and not helpful for the country’ Boots, which has 70,000 UK workers, came under fire from senior Labour figures after the attack on its business policies. But the minister said: 'There are areas where we haven't been able to go, because of the Liberal Democrats -- particularly in terms of making it easier to employ people.' Business Secretary Vince Cable has accused the Tories of wanting to make it possible for firms to 'fire at will'. Mr Hancock said: 'It's about making it easier to take on your first employees. We need greater clarity that you can take somebody on and if it goes wrong you won't pay an unduly heavy price. 'There is a lot of bureaucracy around taking people on and we want to make it easier.' Baroness Brady, the Apprentice star who now a Conservative peer and an adviser on small business to the Government, said: 'Red tape hits small businesses harder than anything else. For an entrepreneur working all hours to build their business and provide for themselves and their family it really can mean the difference between success and failure. Former Apprentice star Karen Brady said government rep tape hits small businesses 'harder than anything else' 'Government should do everything it can to celebrate enterprise and back risk takers, but sometimes that means getting out of the way of their success. 'Cutting red tape has been a key part of this Government’s economic plan and has already saved businesses £10 billion, but there’s still much more we can do. Every penny we can save small businesses by scrapping unnecessary regulations means more jobs, more growth and more hardworking people able to make a success of their business.' John Longworth, Director General of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: 'Government regulation all too often places excessive financial and administrative burdens on British businesses. After years of campaigning to cut red tape, it is welcome to see proposals for stretching deregulation targets for the next Parliament — which would help companies concentrate on jobs and exports, rather than on endless compliance measures. 'A stretch target for deregulation would also send a clear message to Whitehall that new rules must be a last resort, rather than a first reflex for mandarins and ministers alike.' Simon Walker, Director General of the Institute of Directors, said: 'The coalition Government has made encouraging progress in reducing the burden of regulation on business, and in particular on small and medium sized businesses. We welcome the ambition shown in the commitment to finding a further £10billion worth of regulatory savings, and urge all political parties to consider how they can make it easier, smoother and more efficient to do business in the UK. The target announced by the Conservatives is admirable, and we’ll work with all parties to make sure deregulation stays at the top of political agenda. 'The next parliament will see continuing pressure of the public finances whoever wins, so we need to unleash business to drive economic growth and generate tax revenues.' Toby Perkins, Labour’s shadow small business minister, said: 'The truth is that ministers have blocked Labour’s plans to back small business by tackling late payment and to deal with unfair and uncompetitive treatment of suppliers. They’ve opposed our plans to cut – then freeze – business rates, and at a time when net lending to small and medium sized businesses has fallen by £1 billion in the last quarter, they’ve opposed our plans for a proper British Investment Bank supported by a regional network. 'Where the Tory-led government has failed to act to support small firms, the next Labour government will.'

Context: Oklahoma City has a very active severe weather season from March through June, especially during April and May. Being in the center of what is colloquially referred to as Tornado Alley, it is prone to especially frequent and severe tornadoes, as well as very severe hailstorms and occasional derechoes. Tornadoes have occurred in every month of the year and a secondary smaller peak also occurs during autumn, especially October. The Oklahoma City metropolitan area is one of the most tornado-prone major cities in the world, with about 150 tornadoes striking within the city limits since 1890. Since the time weather records have been kept, Oklahoma City has been struck by thirteen violent tornadoes, eleven F/EF4s and two F/EF5. On May 3, 1999 parts of southern Oklahoma City and nearby suburban communities suffered from one of the most powerful tornadoes on record, an F5 on the Fujita scale, with wind speeds estimated by radar at 318 mph (510 km/h). On May 20, 2013, far southwest Oklahoma City, along with Newcastle and Moore, was hit again by a EF5 tornado; it was 0.5 to 1.3 miles (0.80 to 2.09 km) wide and killed 23 people. Less than two weeks later, on May 31, another outbreak affected the Oklahoma City area, including an EF1 and an EF0 within the city and a tornado several miles west of the city that was 2.6 miles (4.2 km) in width, the widest tornado ever recorded. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The F in EF4 stands for Fujita, which refers to the Fujita scale, a system used to measure the strength and intensity of tornadoes."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honor-bound to return to captivity in England. The French crown had been at odds with Navarre since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as king of France. On 7 May 1364, one month after the dauphin's accession and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel.

Face one of them and place the rope to the right or left of your feet. Have them throw the rope over your head, and jump when it reaches your other side. Get the rhythm of this jumping pattern before moving on. It takes some timing, but it can be done. Once you're comfortable running into the rope, you can practice jumping while looking between the turners instead of at them. One or two other jumpers can join you as you run into the rope, but you should approach the rope one by one. Once one person finds a rhythm, the next person should jump in. For double dutch jumping, the two turners have a rope in each hand. The turners should turn one rope, and then turn the other in the opposite direction when the first rope is halfway through its arc. Once the ropes start moving, you should jump over each rope while still facing the turners.

Choices: - strong planetary fields - weak gravitational fields - strong magnetic fields - strong gravitational fields A: A:","completion":"The phenomenon capable of altering the rate of time passing is strong gravitational fields. This effect occurs due to a phenomenon called time dilation, which is one of the key predictions of Albert Einstein's theory of relativity. The theory of relativity consists of two parts: the special theory of relativity and the general theory of relativity. The special theory of relativity, published in 1905, addresses the behavior of objects in inertial reference frames (frames that are not accelerating). One of the principal insights of this theory is that time is relative, depending on the relative motion of an observer and an observed object. This effect, called time dilation, means that time passes more slowly for an object in motion relative to a stationary observer. The general theory of relativity, published in 1915, extends the special theory to consider the effects of acceleration and gravity on the behavior of objects. The general theory of relativity predicts that strong gravitational fields can cause time dilation, with time passing more slowly in the presence of a massive object compared to a location further away from the object. This phenomenon has been confirmed experimentally through several tests and observations. For example, the Global Positioning System (GPS) relies on a network of satellites orbiting Earth, and the time dilation effect caused by Earth's gravitational field must be taken into account for the system to function accurately. The clocks on GPS satellites tick slightly faster (about 38 microseconds per day) than clocks on Earth's surface due to the weaker gravitational field at the satellites' altitude. Contrary to strong gravitational fields, strong planetary fields, weak gravitational fields, and strong magnetic fields do not have a significant effect on the rate of time passing. While magnetic fields can influence charged particles, their direct effect on the flow of time is negligible. Similarly, weak gravitational fields would have a minimal impact on time dilation, and strong planetary fields refer to factors such as the planet's geology, atmosphere, or climate, which are not directly associated with time dilation. In conclusion, strong gravitational fields have the capability to alter the rate of time passing due to the time dilation effect predicted by Einstein's theory of relativity. This phenomenon is not only a fascinating aspect of our understanding of the universe but is also an essential consideration for the accurate functioning of technologies such as the Global Positioning System."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: UNIVERSITY PARK, Pa. -- How people perceive and taste alcohol depends on genetic factors, and that likely influences whether they \\"like\\" and consume alcoholic beverages, according to researchers in Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences. In the first study to show that the sensations from sampled alcohol vary as a function of genetics, researchers focused on three chemosensory genes -- two bitter-taste receptor genes known as TAS2R13 and TAS2R38 and a burn receptor gene, TRPV1. The research was also the first to consider whether variation in the burn receptor gene might influence alcohol sensations, which has not previously been linked to alcohol consumption. People may differ in the sensations they experience from a food or beverage, and these perceptual differences have a biological basis, explained John Hayes, assistant professor of food science and director of Penn State's Sensory Evaluation Center. He noted that prior studies have shown that some people experience more bitterness and less sweetness from an alcoholic beverage, such as beer. \\"In general, greater bitterness relates to lower liking, and because we generally avoid eating or drinking things we don't like, lower liking for alcoholic beverages associates with lower intake,\\" he said. \\"The burn receptor gene TRPV1 has not previously been linked to differences in intake, but we reasoned that this gene might be important as alcohol causes burning sensations in addition to bitterness. \\"In our research, we show that when people taste alcohol in the laboratory, the amount of bitterness they experience differs, and these differences are related to which variant of a bitter receptor gene the individual has.\\" To determine which variant of the receptor genes study participants possess, DNA was collected via saliva samples for genetic analysis. The results appear in the October online issue of Alcoholism Clinical and Experimental Research. Ninety-three people of European ancestry, age 18 to 45, completed all four of the study's tasting sessions. People are hard-wired by evolution to like sweetness and dislike bitterness, and this influences the food and beverage choices we make every day, pointed out lead researcher Alissa (Allen) Nolden, a doctoral candidate in food science advised by Hayes. Nolden added that it is also well established that individuals differ in the amount of bitterness they perceive from some foods or beverages, and this variation can be attributed to genetic differences. Normally, sweet and bitter sensations suppress each other, so in foods and beverages, genetic differences in bitter perception can also influence perceived sweetness. \\"Prior work suggests greater bitterness and less sweetness each influence the liking of alcohol beverages, which influences intake,\\" Nolden said. \\"Here we show that the bitterness of sampled ethanol varies with genetic differences in bitter taste receptor genes, which suggests a likely mechanism to explain previously reported relationships between these gene variants and alcohol intake.\\" The researchers conceded that the relationship between burn and intake is more complicated, at least for foods, as personality traits also play a role. Some people enjoy the burn of chil peppers, for example. \\"Still, anecdote suggests that many individuals find the burn of ethanol aversive,\\" Hayes said. \\"Accordingly, greater burn would presumably reduce liking and thus intake, although this needs to be confirmed.\\" Nolden and Haye's study only used ethanol cut with water, so caution is needed in generalizing how the results apply to alcoholic beverages because in addition to ethanol, almost all contain other sensory-active compounds that may enhance or suppress bitterness. For example, the sugar in flavored malt beverages will presumably reduce or eliminate the bitterness of ethanol while the addition of hops to beer will add bitterness that may be perceived through other receptors. Hayes suggested that chemosensory variation probably plays little or no role in predicting alcohol intake once an individual is dependent. However, he said that genetic variation in chemosensation may be underappreciated as a risk factor when an individual is initially exposed to alcohol, and is still learning to consume alcohol. Prior studies by Hayes' laboratory group and others have repeatedly associated bitter receptor gene variants with alcohol intake, a relationship that was presumably mediated via perceptual differences and thus differential liking. Data from this study begin to fill in the gaps in this chain by showing the sensations evoked by ethanol differ across people as a function of genetic variation. \\"Additional work is needed to see if these variants can prospectively predict alcohol use behaviors in naïve individuals,\\" he said. \\"But biology is not destiny. That is, food choice remains that, a choice. Some individuals may learn to overcome their innate aversions to bitterness and consume excessive amounts of alcohol, while others who do not experience heightened bitterness may still choose not to consume alcohol for many reasons unrelated to taste.\\" The National Institutes of Health supported this research. ||||| Do you drink a glass of wine with dinner every night? That puts you in the top 30 percent of American adults in terms of per-capita alcohol consumption. If you drink two glasses, that would put you in the top 20 percent. But in order to break into the top 10 percent of American drinkers, you would need to drink more than two bottles of wine with every dinner. And you'd still be below-average among those top 10 percenters. The top 10 percent of American drinkers - 24 million adults over age 18 - consume, on average, 74 alcoholic drinks per week. That works out to a little more than four-and-a-half 750 ml bottles of Jack Daniels, 18 bottles of wine, or three 24-can cases of beer. In one week. Or, if you prefer, 10 drinks per day. These figures come from Philip J. Cook's \\"Paying the Tab,\\" an economically-minded examination of the costs and benefits of alcohol control in the U.S. Specifically, they're calculations made using the National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC) data. I double-checked these figures with Cook, just to make sure I wasn't reading them wrong. \\"I agree that it’s hard to imagine consuming 10 drinks a day,\\" he told me. But, \\"there are a remarkable number of people who drink a couple of six packs a day, or a pint of whiskey.\\" As Cook notes in his book, the top 10 percent of drinkers account for well over half of the alcohol consumed in any given year. On the other hand, people in the bottom three deciles don't drink at all, and even the median consumption among those who do drink is just three beverages per week. The shape of this usage curve isn't exactly unique. The Pareto Law states that \\"the top 20 percent of buyers for most any consumer product account for fully 80 percent of sales,\\" according to Cook. The rule can be applied to everything from hair care products to X-Boxes. But the consequences of the Pareto Law are different when it comes to industries like alcohol, tobacco, and now marijuana. If you consume 10+ drinks per day, for instance, you almost certainly have a drinking problem. But the beverage industry is heavily dependent on you for their profits. \\"One consequence is that the heaviest drinkers are of greatly disproportionate importance to the sales and profitability of the alcoholic-beverage industry,\\" he writes writes. \\"If the top decile somehow could be induced to curb their consumption level to that of the next lower group (the ninth decile), then total ethanol sales would fall by 60 percent.\\" More from Wonkblog on the economics of drinking: The Wonkblog Guide to Efficient Drinking » The Beverage Curve: How to Get the Most Buzz for Your Buck » ||||| Summary:","completion":"Researchers at Penn State's College of Agricultural Sciences have found that genetic factors affect how people perceive and taste alcohol, which in turn influences their consumption of alcoholic beverages. The study focused on two bitter-taste receptor genes and a burn receptor gene, and found that the sensations that people experience when tasting alcohol varies depending on an individual's specific gene variant. While more research is needed to understand the complete implications of these genetic differences, the study highlights that genetics could be an underappreciated risk factor when an individual is initially exposed to alcohol."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There, an addictive new drug called \\"Slo-Mo\\" has been introduced, which slows the user's perception of time to 1% of normal. The only force for order are the Judges, who act as judge, jury and executioner. Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is tasked by the Chief Judge (Rakie Ajola) with evaluating new recruit Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thrilby), a powerful psychic who failed the aptitude tests to be a Judge.In Peach Trees, a 200-storey slum tower block, drug lord Madeline Madrigal, also known as \\"Ma-Ma\\" (Lena Headley), executes three rogue drug dealers (Travis Snyders, Chad Phillips) by having them skinned, infused with Slo-Mo and thrown down the atrium from the top floor. Dredd and Anderson are sent in to investigate and learn of a drug den, which they raid. They arrest a thug named Kay (Wood Harris), whom Anderson's mind probe reveals to be the one who carried out the drug dealers' execution. Dredd decides to take him in for questioning. In response, Ma-Ma's forces seize the tower's security control room and seal the building, using its blast shields under the pretence of a security test, preventing the Judges from leaving or summoning help.Ma-Ma orders Dredd and Anderson killed, and the Judges fight their way through dozens of armed thugs. Arriving at the 76th floor, the Judges are assaulted by Ma-Ma and her men with miniguns that rip through the walls, killing numerous residents. By breaching a damaged outer wall, the Judges become able to call for backup. Meanwhile, Ma-Ma sends her henchman Caleb (Warrick Grier) to confirm the Judges' deaths, but when they meet, Dredd throws Caleb off the tower in full view of Ma-Ma.Dredd suspects Ma-Ma is desperate to keep Kay quiet and beats him for information.

Multi-choice problem: Choose from the options at the end, and answer how do you do this: board pick from the following. + can be cleaned with baby wipe + can be cleaned with pen","completion":"From the options provided, it appears you are seeking guidance on how to clean a board. Let's explore both these options further to allow you to make an informed decision: Option 1: Cleaning with a Baby Wipe 1.1: Materials needed: You will need baby wipes. Preferably unscented ones as they are less likely to leave behind any unwanted odor on your board, and a dry cloth. 1.2: Cleaning steps: First, shake off any loose debris from the board. Then, take a baby wipe and gently start wiping the surface of the board. To remove stubborn stains or marks, apply a slight pressure and rub in a circular motion. Make sure to clean all the corners and edges of the board where the dirt might be accumulated. Once done, wipe over the board one more time to pick up any leftover residue. Following wiping with the baby wipe, take your dry cloth and gently buff the surface of the board. This will help to remove any remaining residue or moisture left over from the cleaning process. Option 2: Cleaning with a Pen 2.1: Materials needed: You will need a special type of pen called the dry erase marker and a clean, dry cloth. 2.2: Cleaning steps: Firstly, using the dry erase marker, scribble over the permanent marker stains or other stubborn marks you want to remove on the board. Completely cover the stains with the ink of the dry erase marker. Allow the marker ink to dry for a few moments, then take your cloth and start rubbing at the marker stains. The solvents in the dry-erase marker will dissolve the stubborn marks, enabling you to wipe them away. Continue this action until all stains are gone. If a stain is particularly stubborn, you may need to repeat this process. Please keep in mind, regular pen ink is not for cleaning, so you should avoid using normal pens for this purpose as they might worsen the problem assuming that's what the word \\"pen\\" refers to in the second option. Based on the above explanation, it would be safe to say that both options have their practical uses. It depends on the type of dirt, mark, or stain on your board that you're trying to clean. You might want to consider what cleaning resources you readily have at your disposal too. It's also worth mentioning that for a comprehensive cleaning, you might want to resort to special board cleaning solutions available on the market. Using such dedicated cleaning supplies often tends to be less harsh on the surfaces and they do a great job in keeping your board clean and increasing its lifespan."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

News article: 265 SHARES Share Tweet Google Reddit Linkedin Mail Sign up to receive our weekly newsletter of the most popular space stories: A New Hampshire auction house will reportedly put up the EKG of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their descent to the moon, an item that could fetch more than 10,000. The EKG, which records the minutes right before the duo touched down on the moon, shows the tense final minutes as the lunar module soared across the lunar landscape and Aldrin and Armstrong sought to discover a place to safely land the craft. The auction, which is being led by RR Auction, will take bids on the EKG and other items during a series of auctions between May 16 and May 23. Other items include the joystick used to control the lunar module’s descent onto the moon, and 85 other items from the Apollo 11 mission. According to those familiar with the EKG, it shows Aldrin’s blood pressure rising as the pair of astronauts began to run short on fuel. Armstrong’s blood pressure remains relatively low as he spent the time scouring the lunar surface for an area void of house-sized boulders. The pair successfully landed the lunar module on the surface of the moon with less than 20 seconds of fuel remaining. PHOTOS: The 10 best images of the moon It remains unclear how much the EKG will fetch. The auction house has listed the item of 3,000, although its historic significance will likely push the actual purchase price far higher. The Apollo missions were able to reveal a great deal of information about the moon and its relationship to the Earth. The National Air and Space Museum lists the Apollo discoveries as showing not only the nature and history of the moon and its formation, but also important information about its environment. Armstrong, a space legend, passed away in August of last year at the age of 82. He passed away from complications due to heart surgery. The former U.S. Navy pilot made two trips two space, one in 1966 as commander of the Gemini 8 mission and a second in 1969 during which Mr. Armstrong became the first man to walk on the surface of the moon. ||||| In a bit of news from the \\"not quite sure what to think about this one\\" department, an auction house in New Hampshire is offering up a bit of eye-opening moon memorabilia in an upcoming online auction. Before you get your hopes up, however, let's be clear: It's not a piece of the moon, nor anything that's been found and brought back from said moon. We suppose you could say that it's technically been to the moon and back, in a manner of speaking. The object is, of course, the electrocardiogram that was taken the moment the late Neil Armstrong first stepped on the moon  the first person to do so and the end goal of the famed Apollo 11 mission, which blasted off in mid-July of 1969. While that artifact of-sorts might seem like a relatively benign item to go up for auction, the Wikicollecting site notes that Armstrong's EKG previously went for a cool 12,500 at an auction in April of 2004. There's nothing particularly strange or erratic about the EKG reading itself. It's more noteworthy for the fact that Armstrong remained so relatively calm when descending to the lunar surface and ultimately stepping on the moon itself. \\"It was really slow on the way down, while Aldrin's was racing\\" described Gerald Schaber, geologist, who had the task of monitoring Armstrong's heartbeat during the final famous moments of the Apollo 11 landing. \\"But that was typical of Neil. Just like the first thing he really said was, 'Houston we have engine shut down here,' really calmly. Mission control told him to he speak again. It was then he said, 'The eagle has landed,' for the TV networks. He was just that cool,\\" Schaber added. If you want to check out more EKG readings related to the Apollo 11 moon mission, Jay Walker, curator and chairman of TEDMED, showed off fellow astronaut Buzz Aldrin's EKG reading in a TEDMED 2012 presentation. The reading, taken as the astronauts were attempting to find a place to park the Apollo 11 lunar module during the craft's descent onto the moon's surface, is \\"a bit accelerated,\\" Walker comments. \\"In a thousand years this will still be an amazing artifact, because we saw, at the moment man landed on the moon  we were monitoring their vital signs back on the Earth which is something we will all be doing, as a matter of course, in just a few years for all of us and our loved ones.\\" The Armstrong EKG reading is part of a series of 85 lots of Apollo 11 material that's scheduled to hit the online site RR Auction starting May 16. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A New Hampshire auction house, RR Auction, is set to auction off the EKG of Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin during their descent to the moon.

Which entity is this text about? Carousel is the second musical by the team of Richard Rodgers (music) and Oscar Hammerstein II (book and lyrics). The 1945 work was adapted from Ferenc Molnar's 1909 play Liliom, transplanting its Budapest setting to the Maine coastline. The story revolves around carousel barker Billy Bigelow, whose romance with millworker Julie Jordan comes at the price of both their jobs. He participates in a robbery to provide for Julie and their unborn child; after it goes tragically wrong, he is given a chance to make things right. The cast album of the 1945 Broadway production was issued on 78s, and the score was significantly cut--as was the 1950 London cast recording. Theatre historian John Kenrick notes of the 1945 recording that a number of songs had to be abridged to fit the 78 format, but that there is a small part of \\"Soliloquy\\" found on no other recording, as Rodgers cut it from the score immediately after the studio recording was made. A number of songs were cut for the 1956 film, but two of the deleted numbers had been recorded and were ultimately retained on the soundtrack album. The expanded CD version of the soundtrack, issued in 2001, contains all of the singing recorded for the film, including the cut portions, and nearly all of the dance music. The recording of the 1965 Lincoln Center revival featured Raitt reprising the role of Billy. Studio recordings of Carousel's songs were released in 1956 (with Robert Merrill as Billy, Patrice Munsel as Julie, and Florence Henderson as Carrie), 1962 and 1987. The 1987 version featured a mix of opera and musical stars, including Samuel Ramey, Barbara Cook and Sarah Brightman. Kenrick recommends the 1962 studio recording for its outstanding cast, including Alfred Drake, Roberta Peters, Claramae Turner, Lee Venora, and Norman Treigle. Both the London (1993) and New York (1994) cast albums of the Hytner production contain portions of dialogue that, according to Hischak, speak to the power of Michael Hayden's portrayal of Billy. Kenrick judges the 1994 recording the best all-around performance of Carousel on disc, despite uneven singing by Hayden, due to Sally Murphy's Julie and the strong supporting cast (calling Audra McDonald the best Carrie he has heard).

Summarize this article: STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - A man once believed to be one of Sweden's worst serial killers was freed by court order on Wednesday after spending two decades confined in a mental institution after a string of false murder confessions. In a series of trials between 1994 and 2001, Sture Bergwall was convicted of eight murders, despite there being no forensic evidence or witness statements, and confessed to many more. But Bergwall, 63, later recanted his confessions, saying he made them to get attention and drugs, and prosecutors dropped the final murder charge in July last year. \\"He has been detained for 20 years in a locked psychiatric clinic. It is a miscarriage of justice,\\" his lawyer Thomas Olsson told Reuters. Bergwall had been kept at the mental institution until now, waiting for a verdict on whether his mental health was good enough to let him out. The case has gripped Sweden for years. The government launched a commission of inquiry last November looking into possible shortfalls in the legal system that may have resulted in Bergwall's convictions. Bergwall and his lawyer will now start looking at whether to seek damages, Olsson said. (Reporting by Daniel Dickson; editing by Niklas Pollard/Mark Heinrich) ||||| Part 1: Inside the asylum. Sture Bergwall woke up at 5:30 a.m. this morning, as he does every morning, and at 6 a.m. he walked for an hour in the interior yard of the secure psychiatric unit at Säter hospital, his home for the past twenty-three years. He likes to do this every day, pacing a figure eight over and over again. Sometimes he listens to music, but more often to the morning news, eavesdropping on a world he was separated from more than two decades ago. Sweden is the kind of country where being a convicted murderer in a secure psychiatric unit is not necessarily an impediment to having a Twitter feed, and Bergwall often tweets about these endless morning circuits. \\"Exercise yard reflections,\\" he titles them. Small wistful poems about what you can see when this is your only physical access to the world beyond: the budding of a branch, the way fresh snow sits on top of the courtyard walls, the glow against the underside of the sky that he knows is from the lights of the waking town to the east. On a good day, he sees a nightingale. Sture Bergwall is better known to most people in Sweden as Thomas Quick, the name he took not long after he arrived at this institution in 1991. Quick is his mother's family name. Thomas, he liked to explain, was the name of his first victim, a 14-year-old boy whose body was found in a bicycle shed, belt undone, trouser button ripped off, and face bloody. Bergwall was never prosecuted for that murder, because he was 14 years old when it happened, and by the time he confessed to it, the statute of limitations had expired. But he was later convicted in six separate trials for eight other murders, and the full number of murders he has claimed responsibility for is around thirty. That is how he became Sweden's most famous serial killer. \\"Sweden's answer,\\" as he himself would later put it, \\"to Hannibal Lecter.\\" For a time it was a role he seemed to revel in, but then in 2001, after his eighth murder conviction, Bergwall announced that he was no longer going to cooperate with prosecutors and he was no longer going to speak with the media. He reclaimed the name Sture Bergwall and went silent. As his reputation swirled, the man at its center kept his own counsel. But recently he has decided to start talking again, and he has agreed to see me. I have come here to try and understand his story—an awful story about what human beings can do, and about responsibility and guilt, and about deceit and retribution, one that has lessons for us all. To reach the secure psychiatric unit's visitors room, which is where Bergwall and I will talk, this is what you must do: walk through the security entrance, put your passport in a tray where it is kept by a man in a secure booth, go through a heavy metal door that is opened remotely, walk through a metal detector, go through another remotely opened heavy metal door, sit in a waiting room where a coffee table is littered with Swedish women's magazines, then go through two more locked doors, each opened with keypads. And there, at the end of this, is Sture Bergwall, waiting, smiling a little unsurely, a 63-year-old man with a short gray beard, barely a wisp of hair on his head, thick glasses. Here, five doors from the free world, it is hard not to feel a little apprehension. There is an odd moment after I first arrive when the translator has gone to the bathroom and the two people from the hospital who will sit by the door as we talk are not yet in place, and so it is just myself and Bergwall, meeting for the first time, exchanging stilted pleasantries. He takes a seat on one side of a low coffee table—a position chosen, I later discover, because he doesn't like to see the staff who are monitoring him. I move toward the sofa on the other side of the coffee table. But then he overrules me. He gently taps on the chair right next to him. Okay. So that's where I'll sit for the next three hours, my right knee a couple of inches from his left. Bergwall's lawyer, Thomas Olsson, will tell me later about his first visit here: He and his future client were ushered into a kitchen, and the door was locked behind them. \\"Having your first meeting with a cannibal in a kitchen,\\" Olsson will note, \\"that's something to remember.\\" Today I have brought pastries, and Bergwall seems pleased about this. \\"Ooooh,\\" he says, and smiles. And then he begins to talk. · · · Part 2: Eight murders. To understand who this man is—the man who was once Thomas Quick and is now Sture Bergwall—one unavoidable place to start is by looking at exactly what the person I am now sitting knee-to-knee with was convicted for. The accounts that follow are drawn from transcripts of police interrogations with Quick, and from trial testimony and written verdicts, and from his own writing in the garrulous Thomas Quick years, and from media interviews he gave to explain himself before his period of silence. Many of the details are very difficult to bear. The first murder that came to trial, in 1994, was of a 15-year-old boy called Charles Zelmanovits. Quick explained how he and a friend, on the lookout for a suitable boy in November 1976, spotted Zelmanovits walking along the road late one evening, visibly distressed. (Friends would explain that he had become upset after things had turned out weirdly with a girl at a school dance.) Quick pulled over to offer him sympathy and a ride home. He asked to feel Zelmanovits's hands, and so Zelmanovits took off his gloves, and then Quick said he persuaded the boy that they should masturbate each other. They stopped at a logging yard—Quick's driver friend wanted to join in—but then Quick became angered enough at something Zelmanovits said that he held the boy around the neck until he was dead. After Quick played further sexual games with the dead body, they carried it into a forest. Quick had a knife and a saw. \\"He is controlled by a sexuality where specific parts of the body have a certain symbolic value,\\" the trial verdict would explain, \\"and he knew which body parts he wanted.\\" Quick would describe the way the body seemed to groan as he cut it, and the sweet odor that was released. He explained how he took one leg and at least one hand away with him in a gray plastic bag and covered the rest of the body with moss. A short time later the accomplice came to Quick and said that he was having suicidal thoughts. \\"Do it,\\" Quick told him, advice the accomplice followed. ||||| It was a caper that defied all logic. The story of a man who raped children, murdered eight people, and cannibalized at least one of his victims, had appalled and captivated Sweden for two decades, and kept him locked away for as long. But on Wednesday, Sture Bergwall, who formerly went by the name of Thomas Quick, finally saw the light of day as a free man, with his confessions to those crimes discredited. It has left a whole country wondering how it could all have gone so wrong. “It’s the judicial scandal of a century,” says Dan Josefsson, who was nominated to Sweden’s foremost non-fiction award Augustpriset for his book on Sture Bergwall, Mannen Som Slutade Ljuga (“The Man Who Stopped Lying,” to be published in English by Granta in 2015). “And it all has to do with a therapeutic idea that was in fashion in the nineties.” Bergwall’s plan was born in 1991, when he was about to be released from Säter psychiatric ward, to which he was sentenced after a botched bank robbery. A long-time drug fiend, estranged from the outside world, Bergwall figured he’d be better off remaining in the clinic and started confessing to one murder after another. “It’s fairly typical for a mixed-substance addict as Bergwall to lie to gain privileges,” says Josefsson. “He started telling the psychologists what they wanted to hear, and he was rewarded with drugs and encouragement.” The therapeutic model that dominated the Säter facility at the time held that crimes could be inspired by repressed childhood memories. Allowed library access, Bergwall began reading up on famous, unsolved murders and claimed responsibility for them, fabricating justifications for those horrible deeds by citing repressed memories of sexual abuse as a child. He soon became the clinic’s star patient, reveling in the attention and comparing himself with Hannibal Lecter, Anthony Hopkins’ cannibalistic character in The Silence of the Lambs. Even worse, his so-called repressed memories were given enormous weight in the criminal investigations and trials that followed. Bergwall frequently misstated details regarding the victims’ appearances, the murder weapons used and the sequence of events. Yet, those statements were taken as proof of his repression of painful memories, and Bergwall willingly played along. At one time, when asked why he said a victim had blonde hair instead of black, he replied that the agony of his recollections had made him reverse the colors as a kind of psychic self-defense. “Police and prosecutors were completely into the idea too, even though it lacked scientific credibility,” says Josefsson. “It became a sect-like phenomenon where every piece of information was twisted to confirm their belief.” Throughout the years, several commentators have published their doubts, but it wasn’t until 2009 that an appeal process was commenced. By that time, Bergwall had been convicted for eight of the more than thirty murders he had confessed to. However, he had also began to recover his mind, thanks to a doctor who began reducing Bergwall’s extremely high doses of medication. On Nov. 26, Bergwall was declared not guilty in the last of the eight cases, and will from Mar. 19 continue with an outpatient program at the clinic. “The real victims in this systemic collapse are the relatives of the murdered,” says Josefsson. “They had to sit through the trials and listen to this man orate about the heinous things he supposedly did to their children – it’s practically psychological terror. At the same time, the real murderers have been able to breathe out.” The Swedish government has appointed a commission to investigate what systemic failures led to this judicial catastrophe, although it won’t look into individual culpability. Bergwall, now 64, has said that he will write about his experiences at Säter. He already released a book in 2011, together with his brother Sten-Ove, called Thomas Quick is Dead. |||||","completion":"Sture Bergwall, once believed to be one of Sweden's worst serial killers, has been freed by court order after spending 20 years confined in a mental institution following a series of false murder confessions. Bergwall was convicted of eight murders between 1994 and 2001, despite no forensic evidence or witness statements. He later recanted his confessions, claiming they were made for attention and drugs. Prosecutors dropped the final murder charge in July last year. The case has prompted the Swedish government to launch a commission of inquiry into potential shortcomings in the legal system that may have led to Bergwall's convictions."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Tito has raised a foundling (a young and beautiful Loretta Young) to adulthood and names her Simonetta. Tito has raised the girl in the circus life, and she has become an accomplished ballerina. While Chaney gives his usual great performance, I could not get past the fact that Tito, now well into middle age, has the hots for the young Simonetta. Although he is not her biological father, he has raised her like a daughter. That kind of \\"ick\\" factor permeates throughout the film. Tito competes for Simonetta's affections with a young and handsome 'Count' Luigi (Nils Asther). Simonetta clearly falls for the young man, but feels guilt about abandoning Tito (out of loyalty, not romantic love). The whole premise of the film is ridiculous, and I find it amazing that no one in the film tells Tito what a stupid old fool he is being (until he reveals it himself at the end). The film is noteworthy only because of Loretta Young, who would go on to have a great career. While I adore Chaney's brilliance as an actor, this whole film seems off to me and just downright creepy. How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"This review talks about an old movie called \\"Laugh, Clown Laugh\\" with actors Lon Chaney, Loretta Young, and Nils Asther. The person writing the review thinks the movie is a little strange and uncomfortable because the older clown, Tito, likes the young girl, Simonetta, who he raised like a daughter. The writer likes the actors, especially Loretta Young, but they think the story of the movie is not very good and feels creepy.

The woman's lips were bigger than her cheeks because there was botox in the","completion":"mixture she had used. She applied the concoction out of desperation in an attempt to recapture her fading youth. But, as we all know, things don't always go according to plan. It all started a month ago when Melinda, a 45-year-old woman with a seemingly ordinary life, began to notice the lines creeping up at the corners of her mouth. The wrinkles around her eyes, once a faint trace, were becoming more pronounced. One particularly daunting morning, after catching an unflattering glimpse of herself in the bathroom mirror, Melinda's fascination with the concept of eternal youth turned into an obsession. In that moment, Melinda was reminiscent of her twenty-year-old self, feeling invincible and effortlessly flawless. The dark cloud of discontent blanketing her thoughts pushed her to seek a solution to turn back the hands of time. The idea of age slowly eroding her beauty was a thought she would not entertain. So, like many before her, she decided to dive into the world of cosmetic procedures. Melinda voraciously read articles about facelifts, facial fillers, and chemical peels. She visited beauty forums, exchanging ideas and stories with other women embarking upon similar quests for rejuvenation. Despite her rigorous research, Melinda's lack of experience and know-how left her exposed to half-baked promises and empty guarantees from the darkest corners of the internet. Alas, the day finally came when she stumbled upon a small subgroup on one of the self-proclaimed beauty forums. Dedicated to a discounted botox-like solution, the women in this group shared their glowing success stories. They claimed that this magical concoction would rival the finest Beverly Hills clinics at a fraction of the cost. Blinded by the desperate need for instant gratification, Melinda decided to give this miracle product a try. With trembling hands, she administered the solution as instructed in a YouTube video. Her heart began racing, praying it would dry quickly and she would behold her newly restored youthfulness. But within minutes, Melinda realized that the consequences of her actions were irreversible. As the botox-like substance began to fill her lips, steadily inflating their girth, the sensation of tightness enveloped her face. Within the span of a few hours, her once normal-sized lips had transformed into swollen, engorged masses of flesh. Disbelief and horror overshadowed her initial panic as she realized that her plight was the result of the concoction she had unwittingly subjected herself to. Despair consumed her as she understood the extent of her mistake. The discounted solution she had blindly believed in had not been medically tested or FDA-approved; a truth that should have been obvious when she sourced it from an online discussion board. Feeling too embarrassed to face her friends and the world outside, Melinda dreaded stepping out of her apartment. The once vibrant woman now chose to live in self-inflicted solitude as she grappled with the consequences of her ill-conceived decision. She contacted facial surgery experts and sought their consultation in hopes of reversing the disastrous outcome. They advised her to wait for the substance to wear off, which could take several months or even years, and then reassess the situation. Temporary options, like dissolving injections, were also mentioned, but they were costly and provided no guarantee of full recovery. The woman's lips now served as a constant reminder of the fickle and unpredictable nature of beauty. As the world continued to spin, Melinda learned to accept her circumstances and the importance of embracing one's natural aging process. With time, she found solace in sharing her story; warning people about their own perilous pursuits for eternal youth. Melinda eventually reclaimed her former passions, slipping back into her daily routines as she learned to adapt to her new reality. And despite the larger-than-life lips she had unintentionally acquired, Melinda felt more comfortable in her own skin than ever before. Little did she realize that the wisdom of aging and the acceptance of its inevitability would lead to the inner beauty she had been seeking all along."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What can decompose wood?\\" is - mushrooms. To provide a detailed explanation, let us shed light on the given answer choices: 1. Chlorophyll - Chlorophyll is a pigment found in plants, algae, and some bacteria, responsible for capturing light energy to perform photosynthesis. It is not an organism itself and cannot decompose wood. 2. Bacteria - While certain bacteria can contribute to the process of wood decomposition by breaking down cellulose and hemicellulose, they are not the primary organisms responsible for this process. 3. Mushrooms - As mentioned, mushrooms are a type of fungi. Fungi are the main decomposers of wood, as they produce enzymes capable of breaking down the tough lignin that's present in wood, which other organisms struggle to process. Thus, mushrooms serve as the best answer amongst the available choices. 4. Bushes - These are woody plants that are smaller than trees and have several main stems arising from the base. They do not decompose wood; they compete for space and resources with other plants. 5. Ferns - Ferns are vascular plants that reproduce through spores. They grow around decaying wood but are not capable of decomposing it. 6. Most plants - Plants generally do not decompose wood. Instead, they compete for sunlight, water, and nutrients in their environment. 7. Roots - While roots can crack and break wood by growing through it, they don’t decompose the wood. Their primary function is to anchor a plant to the ground and absorb water and nutrients. 8. Evaporation - Evaporation refers to the process by which liquid water changes into water vapor, which then enters the atmosphere. It is a physical process and unrelated to wood decomposition. In conclusion, amongst the given answer choices, mushrooms are the best answer considering fungi play the primary role in breaking down and decomposing wood. They produce enzymes that can efficiently break down the complex structures in wood, allowing them to recycle nutrients and contribute to the natural process of decay in forest ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He only had two meat sandwiches to keep him going, as crocodiles moved beneath his tree each night until his rescue. Gatty said he decided it was safer to hold out for a rescue team than try to make a run for it. His problems began after he fell off his horse while out in the northern Australia outback. Dazed and bleeding, he climbed back on his horse and hoped it would lead him home.

I couldn't go back, it was too far and too dangerous, so I headed to the nearest high ground and stayed there, hoping someone would come and find me before the crocs did.\\" Gatty explained how each night two crocodiles would sit at the bottom of the tree staring at him.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose body was flown to Adelaide? ? By 1957 Grainger's physical health had markedly declined, as had his powers of concentration. Nevertheless, he continued to visit Britain regularly; in May of that year he made his only television appearance, in a BBC \\"Concert Hour\\" programme when he played \\"Handel in the Strand\\" on the piano. Back home, after further surgery he recovered sufficiently to undertake a modest winter concerts season. On his 1958 visit to England he met Benjamin Britten, the two having previously maintained a mutually complimentary correspondence. He agreed to visit Britten's Aldeburgh Festival in 1959, but was prevented by illness. Sensing that death was drawing near, he made a new will, bequeathing his skeleton \\"for preservation and possible display in the Grainger Museum\\". This wish was not carried out.Through the winter of 1959–60 Grainger continued to perform his own music, often covering long distances by bus or train; he would not travel by air. On 29 April 1960 he gave his last public concert, at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, although by now his illness was affecting his concentration. On this occasion his morning recital went well, but his conducting in the afternoon was, in his own words, \\"a fiasco\\". Subsequently confined to his home, he continued to revise his music and arrange that of others; in August he informed Elsie that he was working on an adaptation of one of Cyril Scott's early songs. His last letters, written from hospital in December 1960 and January 1961, record attempts to work, despite failing eyesight and hallucinations: \\"I have been trying to write score for several days. But I have not succeeded yet.\\"Grainger died in the White Plains hospital on 20 February 1961, at the age of 78.

The S500 was a two-seat sports car and the predecessor to the S600 mentioned in the initial answer. Therefore, the Honda S600 was an early model by the company, but it was not the first Honda car."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. what you’ll do if you don’t have any backup of those important picture files, in such situation of photo loss you can use photo recovery application which guide you to restore deleted photos from memory card. Make this proper case","completion":"If you find yourself in a situation where you don't have any backup of those important picture files and are facing a photo loss crisis, there's no need to panic just yet! A photo recovery application can come to your rescue and guide you in restoring deleted photos from the memory card. In instances where backup options, such as cloud storage or external drives, haven't been utilized, using a photo recovery application serves as an excellent solution. Here is a step-by-step guide on recovering deleted photos from a memory card using a photo recovery application: 1. Choose a Reliable Photo Recovery Application: First, select a trusted and efficient photo recovery application for your specific device. There are various software options available, both free and paid, so it's essential to research and select the one that best meets your needs. Examples of trusted photo recovery applications include EaseUS Data Recovery Wizard, Recoverit, Remo Recover, and Disk Drill, among others. 2. Install the Photo Recovery Application: After making your choice, download and install the selected photo recovery application on your computer. Make sure to use a trusted source when downloading the software to avoid potential threats or malware. 3. Connect the Memory Card to Your Computer: In order to recover deleted photos from the memory card, you must first connect the memory card to your computer. You can do this either by inserting the memory card directly into your computer's built-in memory card slot or by using an external memory card reader. 4. Launch the Photo Recovery Application: Once the memory card is connected, launch the photo recovery application and select the memory card as the location to recover lost files. Most applications will display the memory card as a separate drive. 5. Scan for Lost Photos: Initiate a scan on the memory card to search for deleted or lost photos. The duration of the scanning process may vary depending on the size of the memory card and the number of files stored on it. 6. Preview Recovered Photos: After the scanning process is complete, you will be presented with a list of recoverable files. Browse through the list and preview the photos in order to determine which ones you'd like to recover. 7. Select and Recover Photos: Select the photos you want to recover from the list of recoverable files and click on the \\"Recover\\" button (or a similar option, depending on the application). The software will then start the recovery process and save the restored photos to a specified location on your computer. 8. Save Recovered Photos: Finally, save the recovered photos to a secure location on your computer or an external storage device. It is important to have a proper backup system in place to avoid future photo loss. Remember that while photo recovery applications can be highly effective in restoring deleted photos from a memory card, the success rate will depend on various factors, such as the extent of data loss and the time elapsed since the deletion. It is always recommended to maintain regular backups of your important photo files and promptly address any photo loss situations to improve recovery chances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: It's home to some stunning Lake District scenery - but their visits have been with an eagerly-anticipated by-election in mind. Voters go the polls on 23 February to elect a replacement for Labour MP Jamie Reed, who quit Parliament to work in the nuclear industry. It's one of two by-elections taking place that day, with Labour also defending the seat of Stoke-on-Trent Central. The remote coastal seat is mainly rural, hill-farming country and includes Scafell Pike, England's tallest mountain, and Wastwater, its deepest lake, which was named Britain's favourite view in 2007. It is also home to the fishing port of Whitehaven and the Sellafield nuclear processing site, which directly employs over 10,000 people. Labour has chosen Gill Troughton as its candidate. The councillor and former doctor and ambulance driver was chosen from an all-woman shortlist. Up against her for the Conservatives is Trudy Harrison, who lives in the village of Bootle and was a parish councillor for a number of years. UKIP has chosen its 2015 general election candidate, Fiona Mills. The Liberal Democrats have chosen Rebecca Hanson and the Green Party Jack Lenox as their candidates. There are also two independent candidates - Michael Guest and Roy Ivinson. Copeland and its predecessor Whitehaven have been Labour since 1935, but the seat has become more marginal in recent years. Mr Reed, who had been an MP since 2005, held the seat by 2,564 votes from the Conservatives in 2015, with UKIP another 8,038 votes behind in third. The Tories are bidding to become the first governing party to make a by-election gain - not including a 1982 poll triggered by a defecting Labour MP - since 1960. With nearly 11,000 people employed at Sellafield, thousands more in the supply chain and a new power plant proposed in the constituency, the nuclear industry has been a key issue. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power stations has been highlighted by his opponents, although the Labour leader has since given his backing for the Â£10bn Moorside plant, due to open in 2024. Doubts were raised over the project after Toshiba, which has a 60% share in NuGen, the firm behind the scheme, sustained heavy losses. During a visit to the constituency, Prime Minister Theresa May was asked about union calls for the government to guarantee the investment to ensure the project goes ahead, saying her party \\"recognises the importance\\" of the nuclear industry. The prime minister also faced questions about the future of Whitehaven's West Cumberland Hospital, with Labour campaigning hard on the future of the maternity unit amid concerns consultant-led services could be moved elsewhere. A key link road, the A595, has also been inspected by both Transport Secretary, Chris Grayling and his Labour counterpart, Andy McDonald, with campaigners calling for urgent improvements to be made. Polls will be open from 07:00 GMT on 23 February until 22:00 BST, with the result expected overnight. Summary:","completion":"A by-election to replace Labour MP Jamie Reed will take place on 23 February; Reed departed the UK Parliament to work in the nuclear industry. The vote is key due to the 10,000 plus workers involved in the nuclear industry in the Copeland constituency. The area is home to Sellafield, Europe's largest nuclear site, and the proposed site of the troubled £10bn Moorside nuclear power plant development. Prime Minister Theresa May is facing calls from unions to guarantee its future, and Opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn's previous opposition to new nuclear power plants could become an issue in the by-election."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Marc Marquez Alenta (born 17 February 1993) is a Spanish Grand Prix motorcycle road racer and four-time MotoGP world champion. Marquez races for Honda's factory team since his MotoGP debut in 2013. Nicknamed the \\"Ant of Cervera\\", he is one of four riders to have won world championship titles in three different categories, after Mike Hailwood, Phil Read and Valentino Rossi. Marquez won the 2010 125cc World Championship, the 2012 Moto2 World Championship, and the 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017 MotoGP World Championships. Born in Cervera, Catalonia, Spain, Marquez made his championship debut on 13 April 2008 at the 125cc 2008 Portuguese Grand Prix at the age of 15 years and 56 days. He is the youngest Spanish rider to take a pole position or a podium in a motorcycle racing world championship. Marquez achieved his first podium on 22 June 2008 at the British Grand Prix. For 2009, as a factory KTM rider, at the French Grand Prix achieved his first pole position at the age of 16 years and 89 days. He also took pole for the 2010 Spanish Grand Prix but the exhaust pipe fell off on the opening lap and went under the rear wheel, causing Marquez to crash and injure his shoulder. His first win was on 6 June 2010 at Mugello. Further victories at Silverstone, Assen and Catalonia in the next three races made Marquez the youngest rider to win four successive races. His fifth win in succession at the Sachsenring was Derbi's 100th victory in Grand Prix racing, and Marquez became the first rider since Valentino Rossi in 1997 to win five successive races in 125cc racing. He was less successful in the following races, dropping to third in the standings at one point behind Nicolas Terol and Pol Espargaro after being involved in an accident with Randy Krummenacher at the first corner at the Aragon Grand Prix. Four successive wins from Motegi onwards had moved Marquez into a 17-point lead over Terol with only one round to go. At Estoril, the race was red-flagged due to rain with Marquez running second to Terol. When returning to the grid for the second race, Marquez fell on the sighting lap and had to return to the pits. With repairs, Marquez started at the back of the field having not made it out of the pit lane before it closed five minutes prior to the start. Despite this, Marquez recovered to win the race and thus extend his lead before the Valencia finale. His tenth victory of the season moved him to within one of tying the record set by Rossi in 1997. He would fall short of tying it as he was fourth at the final race in Valencia to become the second-youngest World Champion after Loris Capirossi.

The SS Claridon is an old ship that is scheduled to be scrapped after just a few more voyages. Cliff and Laurie Henderson and their daughter, Jill, are relocating to Tokyo and decide to sail there on board the ship. A fire in the boiler room is extinguished, but not before a boiler fuel supply valve is fused open. Before Chief Engineer Pringle can manually open a steam relief valve, a huge explosion rips through the boiler room and the many decks situated above it, killing him and some of the passengers and trapping Laurie under a steel beam in their state room, in addition to opening a huge hole in the side of the ship. Cliff runs back to their state room and can't get Laurie out alone. He then finds Jill trapped on the other side of the room. He tries to use a shattered piece of the bed to get to the other side, but it falls through the huge hole made by the explosion. Third Officer Osborne believes that the crew should start loading the passengers into the lifeboats, but Captain Robert Adams is reluctant, as he never lost a ship. Cliff rescues Jill by using a board to have her crawl across the hole on. Down in the boiler room, Second Engineer Walsh reports to Captain Adams that a seam to the bulkhead has broken away. Cliff tries to get a steward's help, but to no avail. A passenger states that he overheard his conversation, and wants to help. Osborne reports that the boiler room is now half full. The ship then begins to transmit an SOS, on orders of Captain Adams. Cliff and a few other men return to his state room to try to help free Laurie, but find that they need a torch.

When 74-year-old Penny Sweat was evicted from the HUD-subsidized Glendale Senior Housing in Salt Lake City last month, she moved to a nonsubsidized apartment at five times her previous rent because she was unaware of her rights. It turns out the manager of the seniors complex, its attorneys and government overseers were unaware, too. Lee Kemp, a hearing-impaired World War II disabled vet, also was evicted, but he contacted Utah Legal Services and was told to stay put. Attorney Marty Blaustein then notified Utah Nonprofit Housing Corp., the building's owner, that Kemp's eviction was not legal and that he had a right to a hearing. That didn't stop Utah Nonprofit Housing's attorneys from then sending Kemp a summons to show cause why he had not moved out. Meanwhile, Sweat's granddaughter called Salt Lake City housing officials, federal housing officials, state officials and several agents of Utah Nonprofit Housing to find out about her grandmother's rights. Nobody knew. Blaustein then took Sweat's case along with Kemp's and demanded her ousting be rectified. Utah Nonprofit Housing President Marion Willey returned from an out-of-town trip and learned HUD procedures were not followed. The eviction was activated because of ongoing personality conflicts among seniors in the complex, he said, and the new building manager decided the problems were with Sweat and Kemp. Several tenants blame other neighbors as perpetrators of the rift, however. Willey said when his building manager called attorneys retained by the company, they erroneously told her she could go ahead and kick out the tenants. When she called HUD to make sure, the inquiry got bogged down in bureaucracy and nobody called her back. Willey says he has offered Sweat and Kemp apartments in another complex operated by his company at their old rates. He also is retaining new attorneys.

Led by scientists at the Zoological Society of London, the Edge Coral Reefs project has identified 10 coral species in most urgent risk of becoming extinct.The scientists say that reefs are under pressure from a variety of threats including rising sea temperatures due to climatic instability, increased acidity , overfishing and pollution. The Edge plan, which focuses on the most evolutionarily distinct and globally endangered species , will take a regional approach to conservation.This means focusing on the \\"coral triangle\\" around the Philippines, the West Indian Ocean around the Mozambique channel, and in the Caribbean channel. \\"Coral reefs are threatened with functional extinction in the next 20-50 years, due predominantly to global climatic instability,\\" said Catherine Head, coordinator of the reefs project.\\"In these regions, we'll be supporting and training in-country conservationists to carry out research and implement targeted conservation actions,\\" she said.\\"Their projects will last initially for two years.We provide them with a whole host of tools to carry out their projects including funding and intensive training.\\" She added.

Article: Don't try to sing or practice along just yet-- you'll be practicing the wrong words and melodies until you know the song well. Listen for the lyrics, the melody, and how the singer reacts to the band or backing track. Most music has a consistent pattern of \\"beats\\" that keeps the entire band playing at the same time. The easiest way to learn the rhythm of a song is to tap your feet along with the song. Each \\"tap\\" is a beat. In modern songs, listening to the kick drum (the deepest sounding drum) is the easiest way find rhythm if you are unsure. This is usually found in jazz or metal, or old song's without consistent beats. Time signatures, like 4/4 or 3/2, are used to write out rhythm. The first number tells you how many beats are in a measure, and the second tells you the length of each beat. 4/4 is the most common, and it means that the song repeats 4 beats of 4 quarter notes (1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, 1 2 3 4, etc). Any instrument that plays notes and chords is a melody instrument. Often, finding the root note is usually as easy as finding the first note played. The song's key most important part of it's melodic structure, and is the first thing you need to know to figure out a song. To find a song's key, look for the one note that you can play over every section of the song without sounding bad or \\"out of key.\\" It can help to hum to a song. Our brains are wired to understand melody, and often the first note you will try to hum is the song's key. Find the note on your instrument that matches your humming and you have the key! Sheet music is a blueprint for playing a song. If you play an orchestral instrument or a piano, reading music is essential to learning new songs, but all instruments can benefit from written music. Spend some time every day practicing reading music and look up notes or symbols your don't know. Reading music can also help teach music theory, which will help you decipher songs that you can't find music for. Guitars, bass guitars, and drums are often written in \\"tablature,\\" a simplified way of reading music that tells you where to place your hands or drumsticks instead of what notes to play. if you cannot buy or find sheet music. This can be difficult for some songs, but start by finding out what key the song is in and what tempo it is at. Then experiment from there with relevant scales, chords, and rhythms until you feel confident that you know the song. Write down the part as you figure it out so you don't forget anything.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: The Norwegian Government is doing its best to keep the oil industry under control. A new law limits exploration to an area south of the southern end of the long coastline; production limits have been laid down (though these have already been raised); and oil companies have not been allowed to employ more than a limited number of foreign workers. But the oil industry has a way of getting over such problems, and few people believe that the Government will be able to hold things back for long. As one Norwegian politician said last week: \\" We will soon be changed beyond all recognition.\\" Ever since the war, the Government has been carrying out a program of development in the area north of the Arctic Circle. During the past few years this program has had a great deal of success. Tromso has been built up into a local capital with a university, a large hospital and a healthy industry. But the oil industry has already started to draw people south, and within a few years the whole northern policy could be in ruins. The effects of the oil industry would not be limited to the north, however. With nearly 100 percent employment, everyone can see a situation developing in which the service industries and the tourist industry will lose more of their workers to the oil industry. Some smaller industries might even disappear altogether when it becomes cheaper to buy goods from abroad. The real argument over oil is its threat to the Norwegian way of life. Farmers and fishermen do not make up most of the population, but they are an important part of it, because Norwegians see in them many of the qualities that they regard with pride as essentially Norwegian. And it is the farmers and the fishermen who are most critical of the oil industry because of the damage that it might cause to the countryside and to the sea.

This trend is explained by the increase in size of the atoms within a group. The valence electron that is being removed is further from the nucleus in the case of a larger atom.

Answer this question please: Which element is smaller? Answer:","completion":"Lithium is the smaller element in comparison to cesium. This is because, in the periodic table, atomic size generally increases from top to bottom within a group. As you go down the alkali metals group, the atoms increase in size because they have more energy levels, causing the outermost electrons to be further from the nucleus. Since lithium is at the top of the group and cesium is at the bottom, lithium has fewer energy levels and its valence electrons are closer to the nucleus, making it the smaller element."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Ice forms inside a cloud - Ice inside the cloud bumps around and causes electrostatic charges - The cloud becomes a thundercloud - Electrostatic energy builds and forms a strong negative charge - Positive energy is attracted to the negative energy in the cloud - This positive energy gathers on the ground - The positive energy connects with the negative energy and forms lightning. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there is more ice that inside the clouds happens, how will it affect LESS or LESS POWERFUL lightning. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis proposes that an increase in ice within the clouds might affect the frequency or power of lightning. In this case, the increased ice presence may have both direct and indirect effects on the lightning formation process. Direct effect: If there is more ice inside the clouds, it could result in intensified collisions among ice particles, leading to a higher buildup of electrostatic charges. As a result, this could potentially create a stronger negative charge within the cloud, attracting more positive energy on the ground and increasing the likelihood or intensity of lightning strikes. Indirect effect: An increased presence of ice in the clouds can also affect the cloud's overall structure, temperature profile, and dynamics. These changes could potentially alter the balance of positive and negative charges inside the cloud, impacting the conditions necessary for the lightning formation process. In conclusion, the presence of more ice within clouds may lead to less frequent or less powerful lightning, but the precise outcome depends on how the increased ice presence affects the cloud's electrostatic charge distribution and overall dynamics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A few years ago we went fishing down the hill from a mushroom farm called Happy Pond. Since that time, there has been a lot of rain and we noticed Happy Pond had a green coating across the top of it. We also thought about going to a new pond in center of the park called Ridge Pond. We are hoping to catch a lot of fish to serve at our family reunion. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond? Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. The nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water bodies. Since there is a lot of nitrogen it causes algae to grow out of control. Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, the family is more likely to catch more fish at Ridge Pond rather than Happy Pond. As mentioned in the hint, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and the runoff carries it away, eventually ending up in bodies of water like ponds and oceans. The excessive nitrogen from the fertilizers promotes the growth of algae in the water bodies. In Happy Pond's case, the noticeable green coating across the top of the pond indicates an algal bloom, which is a result of the excessive rain and its proximity to the mushroom farm. Algal blooms can have various negative effects on the water quality and aquatic life. When algae use up much of the oxygen in the water, other aquatic life, such as fish, can struggle to survive as the oxygen levels become too low to sustain them. Moreover, after the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and also consume the remaining oxygen, creating a dead zone. Dead zones are areas in bodies of water where nothing grows due to the lack of oxygen. In contrast, Ridge Pond does not have any mention of algal blooms or issues related to fertilizer runoff. Being a new pond in the center of the park, it is also more likely to have better water quality and a healthier aquatic ecosystem compared to Happy Pond. Thus, the family has a higher chance of catching a significant number of fish at Ridge Pond for their family reunion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

To call the main character a rapper is an insult to the people who actually do. The lyrics had no rhythm or flow and seemed more along the lines of senseless rants. Budget? Did this movie even have a budget? It seemed like they used less money than I've seen in a home-shot YouTube video. Bad lighting, props, poor sound post production. Bad special effects, if you want to go so far as to call them that.

Please tell me the sentiment of the following review: Now look, I won't lie to you, but I only got this movie for 3.99 from a friend because it had Danni Filth, the lead singer of the ever popular death metal band \\"Cradle Of Filth\\" in it. I expected of course violence and gore at its finest, as that is what Mr Filth can be portrayed as, amongst a plot line. But dear god, I was oh so wrong. This movie seriously bites, big time. Being a low budget film (haha, wait, make that ZERO BUDGET), this obviously lacks the beautiful Howard Stern orchestra musical scores and the Spielberg special effects. Nope, it's all one camera, bad angles, and bad blood scenes. Take for example when our star and violent fiend, Mr Filth, violently kills a mugger. A grab at the throat, and blood spits out, but oh my, it looks like there's a juice packet filled with fake blood in the man's shirt. To you Cradle Of Filth fans: You'll hear two songs throughout the movie, but with the camera angles and shoddy filming, they drag the overall pleasure of the song DOWN. My final comment: Steer well away from it. It's blood, gore, breasts, and hey, even a shoddy story to go with it. So if you like appalling violence, near no voices (yes, there's hardly any words in this movie), then by all means, buy it. But if shoddy movies isn't your thing, then avoid it. Don't waste your money.","completion":"To analyze the sentiment of this review, I will break it down step-by-step: 1. The reviewer mentions that they only got the movie due to its low cost and the presence of Danni Filth, indicating a possible neutral or slightly positive sentiment at the beginning. 2. However, the reviewer quickly states that the movie \\"seriously bites, big time\\", which demonstrates a negative sentiment. 3. Further negative sentiments are expressed when the reviewer mentions the film's low budget, poor camera angles, and unconvincing special effects. 4. The reviewer gives a specific example of the poor quality of the film, which again highlights their negative sentiment. 5. A neutral point is mentioned when talking about the Cradle of Filth songs featured in the movie, but the reviewer quickly goes back to the negative sentiment by stating that the camera angles and shoddy filming drag the pleasure of the songs down. 6. The final comment strongly suggests avoiding the movie, with the reviewer listing its many flaws and describing it as a waste of money, reinforcing the negative sentiment. Based on these points, I would say that the overall sentiment of this review is negative.

He participated in three World Championship Grands Prix, including his participation in the 1968 French Grand Prix which was part of the Formula One season of that year. This indicates his clear association with Formula One racing. Additionally, he is also identified as a sports car racing driver, which is a form of auto racing. Yet, there is – as far as the provided text goes – no mention of him being directly involved in auto racing as a general category or in rallying. Therefore, the possible answers could either be \\"Formula One\\" or \\"Sports Car racing\\". However, given the context of the 1968 French Grand Prix and his fatal participation in it, which was a Formula One event, \\"Formula One\\" could be seen as the more directly relevant answer regarding the type of sport Jo Schlesser is known for. To summarize, the entity that is most related to 'Jo Schlesser' in the context of 'sport' from the information provided is 'Formula One'. This is because his career and tragic end are most notably marked by his participation in the Formula One event, even though he was also involved in sports car racing.

About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. I am facing a new situation today: Daniel visited two countries. Switzerland and India. There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which country had fewer people develop lung cancer? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the situation mentioned, it can be inferred that Switzerland had fewer people developing lung cancer compared to India. The reasoning behind this statement is the significant difference in air pollution levels between the two countries. Air pollution is a major contributing factor in the development of lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing these diseases, as well as the chances of dying from them. India, which is known for having high levels of air pollution, poses a greater health risk to its residents when it comes to respiratory illnesses and lung cancer. On the other hand, Switzerland is known for its clean air and low levels of air pollution. Living in an environment with cleaner air reduces the risks associated with respiratory issues and decreases the likelihood of developing lung cancer. As a result, the rate of lung cancer development in Switzerland is anticipated to be lower than that in India. It is crucial to note that air pollution is not the only variable influencing the development of lung cancer. Factors such as genetic predisposition, exposure to tobacco smoke, occupational exposure to carcinogens, and lifestyle choices can all have an impact on an individual's risk of developing lung cancer. However, considering the stark contrast in air pollution levels between Switzerland and India, it is reasonable to assume that the rate of lung cancer development would be lower in Switzerland."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The White House tells the Fact Checker blog at the Washington Post that he's relying on reports \\"from BBC, Heat Street, New York Times, Fox News, among others.” After an analysis, the Post finds that the two most important ones are from the right-leaning Heat Street and the BBC. (Other reports have cited an article at Breitbart News, but it relies on the Heat Street piece.) The two articles say that US intelligence officials went to the FISA court (which deals with intelligence matters) because they wanted to investigate possible activity between two banks in Russia and a computer server in Trump Tower (which, to make matters more confusing, might actually be located in Philadelphia). Excerpts: Heat Street: “Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.” BBC: It says Justice Department lawyers went to the FISA court. \\"Their first application, in June, was rejected outright by the judge. They returned with a more narrowly drawn order in July and were rejected again. Finally, before a new judge, the order was granted, on 15 October, three weeks before election day.\\" The Fact Checker's assessment? Even if the stories are accurate, and that hasn't been confirmed, they do not say that President Obama was behind the request. Plus, they involve a computer server, not the tapping of phone lines.

Article:","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Origins of President Trump's Wiretapping Accusations Recently, President Trump made a bombshell accusation that his predecessor, President Obama, tapped his phones during the election campaign. The White House informed the Fact Checker blog at the Washington Post that President Trump based his accusations on reports from news outlets such as BBC, Heat Street, New York Times, and Fox News. An analysis performed by the Washington Post found that the two most essential sources are the right-leaning Heat Street and the BBC. The Heat Street report states: “Two separate sources with links to the counter-intelligence community have confirmed to Heat Street that the FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counter-intelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia.” Meanwhile, the BBC report indicates that the Department of Justice lawyers went to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) court with three separate applications. The first one in June was denied, one in July was rejected again, and the final one was granted on 15 October - three weeks before the election. The articles report that US intelligence officials sought permission from the FISA court to investigate potential activity occurring between two Russian banks and a computer server in Trump Tower, which may be located in Philadelphia. The sources, however, do not indicate that President Obama was directly involved in these requests. Moreover, the reports discuss the examination of a computer server rather than the tapping of phone lines, making President Trump's accusations questionable. Upon a thorough analysis of these primary sources, it is evident that the reports do not support the administration's revised claim of politically motivated investigations.

The supermarket manager was forced to apologize to the customer who complained she was told her goods would not be scanned unless she hung up her phone. Jo Clark, 46, said, \\"I don't know what she was playing at. I couldn't believe how rude she was. When did she have the right to give me a lecture on checkout manners? I won't be shopping there again!\\" But users of social media sites and Internet forums were very angry that store gave in and the public appeared to be supporting the angry checkout worker. \\"Perhaps this is a turning point for mobile phone users everywhere.

On one hand, the reviewer appreciates the quality of the rolls, indicating that they find the food to be good. This is a positive aspect of the review. However, the recurring issue of incorrect orders when calling in for carry out, which the reviewer explicitly mentions to be a point of frustration, serves as a negative aspect of the review. The fact that the reviewer has resorted to ordering different items because of the incorrect orders, and identifies a specific issue with a \\"spicy salmon roll\\" versus a \\"spicy salmon bowl\\", emphasizes the negative experience they have had with this establishment. This indicates a lack of satisfaction with the ordering process and creates a sense of disappointment when receiving the wrong item. Despite this negative experience, the reviewer still mentions that the restaurant is \\"good\\" overall, which suggests that they do find some redeeming qualities. This may be due to enjoying the food itself, or perhaps having positive experiences in other areas of the restaurant's service.

However, one expert doubted the firm's rivals would support the idea. \\"Samsung is the most aggressive competitor that exists,\\" said Martin Garner, who covers connected homes technologies for the consultancy CCS Insight. \\"So, why would another manufacturer want to use its platform?\\" The South Korean firm will show off the technology at its booth at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES) when it opens in Las Vegas on Tuesday, Other companies are expected to demonstrate competing visions at the event. Archos has already said it will show off an Android-powered Smart Home Tablet designed to control and access information from other connected devices.

Look at the bulbs on your strand of lights to be sure that each one is seated firmly into its plastic socket, as they sometimes come loose. Focus first on looking at individual unlit bulbs, or the first and last bulbs in a section that is unlit, but you should check all bulbs for loose connections. Gently push a loose bulb down into the socket until its connecting edge appears flush with the socket or it clicks into place. Remove any bulb that you know for certain is dead, either because it is an isolated unlit bulb in a strand of otherwise functioning bulbs, or it is clearly shattered, burnt-looking, or otherwise discolored. Gently remove a dead bulb by grasping it between two fingers and pulling it up out of the socket. Some bulbs may require you to twist the bulb before pulling up. Replace any individual dead bulb with a new one of equal size and wattage, placing it firmly down into the socket. If you have a section of unlit bulbs in the strand, use a bulb tester, found in stores where Christmas lights are sold, to determine which bulb is causing the problem. Inexpensive bulb testers can be found as a plastic mold or pen-shaped tool powered by a 9-volt battery. Start with the first and last bulbs in an entire strand that is unlit, or the first unlit bulb that follows a section of working bulbs. Follow the individual instructions provided with your bulb tester for proper use. Remove any bulb you discover to be dead and replace with one of equal size and wattage. Plug your strand back into a power source after you’ve replaced any bulbs found to be dead to determine if all bulbs are now lit. You may need to replace more than one bulb in a section of unlit ones. Continue to test all bulbs in an unlit section if replacing just one doesn’t solve the problem. At the end of the season, of after you’ve replaced bulbs, ensure that others are not broken or damaged by storing them where they will not be crushed or exposed to extreme temperatures. When putting up or taking down lights, be sure not to pull too hard on the strand, or otherwise roughly handle the wires and bulbs in such a way that could damage them. Coil your light strands neatly around a piece of cardboard, a clothes hanger, or other sturdy object, then place them into a box where there will not be pressure placed on the bulbs or wires. Note that typical Christmas tree lights usually have a life of about 1,000-1,500 hours, or about one to three seasons of use (unless they are LED lights, in which case they can last much longer). Plan to replace light strands every few years rather than continuing to attempt bulb replacements beyond the strand’s expected lifespan.","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to maintain and troubleshoot a strand of Christmas lights, instructing how to check for and rectify loose or dead bulbs, use a bulb tester, replace bulbs properly, handle and store the strand with care to avoid damage, and to consider replacing the entire strand every few years or after its expected lifespan of 1,000-1,500 hours of use."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this lower case","completion":"iran has been the home of a culture which has been influential but not mainstream in the history of world civilization. Iran, historically known as Persia, has had a rich cultural heritage extending over thousands of years. Its cultural influence has reached beyond its borders, impacting neighboring countries and contributing to the development of world civilization in various ways. Although it may not be considered \\"mainstream\\" today, Iran's contributions have left a lasting legacy that continues to shape modern society. Geographically located in an area of significant historical importance, Iran has served as a bridge between the East and the West. Throughout its history, it has experienced numerous invasions, conquests, and outside influences from its neighbors, which have contributed to a rich and complex cultural tapestry. The ancient Persian Empire, dating back to around 550 BCE, was one of the world's first empires and stretched from the Indus Valley in present-day Pakistan and India to parts of Europe, Egypt, and Asia Minor. The Achaemenid Empire, founded by Cyrus the Great, saw an organized administration, promotion of cultural exchange, and the establishment of the Old Persian script. It was during this time that Zoroastrianism, one of the world's oldest monotheistic religions, also emerged which significantly impacted Persian culture and influenced the development of other religious systems globally. Iran's contributions to science, mathematics, and literature have also been notable and influential. Persian polymath Al-Khwarizmi, often regarded as the father of algebra, contributed greatly to the development of modern mathematics. Similarly, Persian scholar Al-Razi made advancements in the field of medicine, while the Persian poet Ferdowsi chronicled the history and myths of Persia in his epic work, the Shahnameh (The Book of Kings). The Persian poet Rumi, on the other hand, remains one of the most famous poets and continues to be widely read and translated globally. In the realm of architecture, Iranian civilization left its mark with numerous monuments and landmarks that reflect its innovative designs and craftsmanship. The construction of monumental palaces, such as those built by the Achaemenid king Darius the Great in the ancient city of Persepolis or those constructed during the Safavid dynasty, like the Ali Qapu Palace in Isfahan, serve as a testament to Iran's architectural creativity and grandeur. Furthermore, Iranian civilization has had an impact on the development of arts and crafts. Persian carpets, for example, are esteemed for their quality and intricate designs, which make them cherished treasures to this day. Additionally, the arts of Persian calligraphy and miniature painting have inspired other cultural traditions and earned widespread admiration. Although Iran's cultural influence may not have gained the widespread recognition that some other civilizations did, its contributions to the fields of governance, religion, science, literature, arts, and architecture are undeniable. In this regard, Iran's unique cultural heritage has left an indelible mark on the history of world civilization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The young prince was sworn heir to the throne in 1503, the year his youngest sister, Isabella of Portugal, Empress Consort of the Holy Roman Empire between 1527 and 1538, was born. John was educated by notable scholars of the time, including the astrologer Tomás de Torres, Diogo de Ortiz, Bishop of Viseu, and Luís Teixeira Lobo, one of the first Portuguese Renaissance humanists, rector of the University of Siena and Professor of Law at Ferrara . John's chronicler António de Castilho said that, \\"Dom João III faced problems easily, complementing his lack of culture with a practice formation that he always showed during his reign\\" .

No one knows your body better than you, so listen to it—take breaks when you need to and don't be afraid to simply rest when you begin to feel tired. Wearing tight clothing can make it difficult for you to breath. Shortness of breath can cause nausea so it is a good idea to wear loose clothing that is comfortable and will allow you to breathe as deeply as you like. While smell is the largest trigger, simply being in a place where you know the smell was once can make you gag. In addition, even thinking about certain food can make you feel nauseous. Keep track of what makes you feel nauseous and write them down. Avoid these things as much as possible. Smells are not limited to food. The smell of the subway, sprays, chemicals, or stinky feet may also make you nauseous. Two common environmental factors that you should avoid are loud noises and bright lights, which can make nausea worse. If possible, dim the lights in your home or office and keep noise to a minimum. You may want to purchase noise-canceling headphones. Other things that may trigger nausea include blinking, motion, standing or sitting upright, showering, swallowing pills, riding in a vehicle, pressure on the abdomen, sleeping with a partner and vitamins containing iron. Some women find that both acupuncture and hypnosis can help alleviate nausea and vomiting. Seek out a licensed acupuncturist and/or a hypnotist if you want an alternative method for treating hyperemesis gravidarum.

Its ten provinces and three territories extend from the Atlantic to the Pacific and northward into the Arctic Ocean, covering , making it the world's second-largest country by total area and the fourth-largest country by land area. Canada's border with the United States is the world's longest land border. The majority of the country has a cold or severely cold winter climate, but southerly areas are warm in summer. Canada is sparsely populated, the majority of its land territory being dominated by forest and tundra and the Rocky Mountains. About four-fifths of the country's population of 36 million people is urbanized and live near the southern border. Its capital is Ottawa, its largest city is Toronto; other major urban areas include Montreal, Vancouver, Calgary, Edmonton, Quebec City, Winnipeg and Hamilton. - The Rocky Mountains, commonly known as the Rockies, are a major mountain range in western North America. The Rocky Mountains stretch more than from the northernmost part of British Columbia, in western Canada, to New Mexico, in the southwestern United States. Within the North American Cordillera, the Rockies are somewhat distinct from the Pacific Coast Ranges and the Cascade Range and Sierra Nevada which all lie further to the west. - Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell, (\\"née\\" Stevenson; 29 September 1810 12 November 1865), often referred to as Mrs Gaskell, was an English novelist and short story writer. Her novels offer a detailed portrait of the lives of many strata of Victorian society, including the very poor, and are of interest to social historians as well as lovers of literature. Her first novel, \\"Mary Barton\\", was published in 1848. Gaskell's \\"The Life of Charlotte Brontë\\", published in 1857, was the first biography about Brontë.

The City of Ottawa reported that the city had an estimated population of 960,754 as of December 2015. - The collie is a distinctive type of herding dog, including many related landraces and standardised breeds. The type originated in Scotland and Northern England. The collie is a medium-sized, fairly lightly built dog, with a pointed snout. Many types have a distinctive white pattern over the shoulders. Collies are very active and agile, and most types of collies have a very strong herding instinct. Collie breeds have spread through many parts of the world (especially Australia and North America) and have diversified into many varieties, sometimes with mixture from other dog types. Some collie breeds have remained as working dogs, used for herding cattle, sheep and other livestock, while others are kept as pets, show dogs or for dog sports, in which they display great agility, stamina and trainability. While the AKC has a breed they call \\"Collie\\", in fact collie dogs are a distinctive type of herding dog including many related landraces and formal breeds. There are usually major distinctions between show dogs and those bred for herding trials or dog sports. They typically display great agility, stamina and trainability and more importantly sagacity. Common use of the name \\"collie\\" in some areas is limited largely to certain breeds such as to the Rough Collie in parts of the United States, or to the Border Collie in many rural parts of Great Britain. Many collie types do not actually include \\"collie\\" in their name. - Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (known professionally as Warner Bros.

The breed's officially recognized name is German Shepherd Dog in the English language, sometimes abbreviated as \\"GSD\\" and was also formerly known as the Alsatian in Britain. The German Shepherd is a relatively new breed of dog, with their origin dating to 1899. As part of the Herding Group, German Shepherds are working dogs developed originally for herding sheep. Since that time, however, because of their strength, intelligence, trainability, and obedience, German Shepherds around the world are often the preferred breed for many types of work, including disability assistance, search-and-rescue, police and military roles, and even acting. The German Shepherd is the second-most registered breed by the American Kennel Club and fourth-most registered breed by The Kennel Club in the United Kingdom. - Rin Tin Tin (often hyphenated as Rin-Tin-Tin, September 10, 1918 August 10, 1932) was a male German Shepherd that was an international star in motion pictures. He was rescued from a World War I battlefield by an American soldier, Lee Duncan, who nicknamed him \\"Rinty\\". Duncan trained Rin Tin Tin and obtained silent film work for the dog. Rin Tin Tin was an immediate box-office success and went on to appear in 27 Hollywood films, gaining worldwide fame. Along with the earlier canine film star Strongheart, Rin Tin Tin was responsible for greatly increasing the popularity of German Shepherd dogs as family pets. The immense profitability of his films contributed to the success of Warner Bros. studios, and helped advance the career of Darryl F. Zanuck. - Etzel von Oeringen (October 1, 1917 June 24, 1929), better known as Strongheart, was a male German Shepherd who became one of the earliest canine film stars. - Quebec City (pronounced or ) officially Québec) is the capital city of the Canadian province of Quebec.

The silent film era lasted from 1895 to 1936. In silent films for entertainment, the dialogue is transmitted through muted gestures, mime and title cards which contain a written indication of the plot or key dialogue. The idea of combining motion pictures with recorded sound is nearly as old as film itself, but because of the technical challenges involved, synchronized dialogue was only made practical in the late 1920s with the perfection of the Audion amplifier tube and the introduction of the Vitaphone system. During silent films, a pianist, theatre organist, or, in large cities, even a small orchestra would often play music to accompany the films. Pianists and organists would either play from sheet music or improvise; an orchestra would play from sheet music. - Eric Oswald Mowbray Knight (April 10, 1897 in Menston in West Yorkshire, England January 15, 1943 in Suriname) was an English novelist and screenwriter, who is mainly notable for creating the fictional collie Lassie. He took American citizenship in 1942 shortly before his death. - Nunavut (from Inuktitut: ) is the newest, largest, northernmost, and least populous territory of Canada. It was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999, via the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the boundaries had been contemplatively drawn in 1993.

More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - Lassie is a fictional character created by Eric Knight, she is a female Rough Collie dog, and is featured in a short story that was later expanded to a full-length novel called \\"Lassie Come-Home\\". Knight's portrayal of Lassie bears some features in common with another fictional female collie of the same name, and is featured in the British writer Elizabeth Gaskell's 1859 short story called \\"The Half Brothers.\\" In \\"The Half Brothers\\", Lassie is loved only by her young master and guides the adults back to where two boys are lost in a snowstorm. - In physical geography, tundra is a type of biome where the tree growth is hindered by low temperatures and short growing seasons. The term \\"tundra\\" comes through Russian (\\"tûndra\\") from the Kildin Sami word \\"tndâr\\" \\"uplands\\", \\"treeless mountain tract\\". There are three types of tundra: Arctic tundra, alpine tundra, and Antarctic tundra. In tundra, the vegetation is composed of dwarf shrubs, sedges and grasses, mosses, and lichens. Scattered trees grow in some tundra regions. The ecotone (or ecological boundary region) between the tundra and the forest is known as the tree line or timberline. - Ontario, one of the 13 provinces and territories of Canada, is located in east-central Canada. It is Canada's most populous province by a large margin, accounting for nearly 40 percent of all Canadians, and is the second-largest province in total area. Ontario is fourth-largest in total area when the territories of the Northwest Territories and Nunavut are included. It is home to the nation's capital city, Ottawa, and the nation's most populous city, Toronto. - Winnipeg is the capital and largest city of the province of Manitoba in Canada. It is located near the longitudinal centre of North America, at the confluence of the Red and Assiniboine Rivers. - Canada's geography is divided into administrative divisions known as provinces and territories that are responsible for delivery of sub-national governance. When Canada was formed in 1867, three provinces of British North America New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and the Province of Canada (which, on the formation of Canada, was divided into Ontario and Quebec) were united to form a federated colony, which eventually became a sovereign nation in the next century. Over its history, Canada's international borders have changed several times, and the country has grown from the original four provinces to the current ten provinces and three territories. The ten provinces are Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland and Labrador, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, Quebec, and Saskatchewan. Several of the provinces were former British colonies, Quebec was originally a French colony, while others were added as Canada grew. The three territories are Northwest Territories, Nunavut, and Yukon, which govern the rest of the area of the former British North America. Together, the provinces and territories make up the world's second-largest country by area. - The Rough Collie (also known as the Long-Haired Collie) is a long-coated breed of medium to large size dog that in its original form was a type of collie used and bred for herding in Scotland. Originating in the 1800s, it is now well known through the works of author Albert Payson Terhune, and through the \\"Lassie\\" novel, movies, and television shows. There is also a smooth-coated variety; some breed organisations, including both the American and the Canadian Kennel Clubs, consider the smooth-coat and rough-coat dogs to be variations of the same breed. Rough Collies generally come in shades of sable, merles, and tri-coloured. This breed looks like a bigger version of the Shetland Sheepdog, but they are not related.

The user is asking about the level of activity that a person with Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) can maintain. Also, the user wants to know if the statement \\"Some patients go on to require long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.\\" is reasonable in this context. Step 2: Determine if the provided statement answers the initial question. The statement talks about some patients requiring long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation. However, it does not directly address the level of activity that can be maintained with COPD. Step 3: Research the level of activity that can be maintained with COPD. After researching, I found that the level of activity can vary depending on the severity of the disease, individual characteristics, and the presence of other health conditions. Many people with COPD can still engage in physical activities like walking, swimming, and yoga, but at a reduced intensity compared to healthy people. Step 4: Relate the provided statement to the researched information. While the provided statement does not directly answer the question about activity levels, it does highlight that some COPD patients experience severe limitations that could impact their ability to be active, and might need additional treatments like oxygen therapy or lung transplantation to manage the disease. Step 5: Provide a comprehensive answer. The level of activity a person with COPD can maintain depends on the severity of the disease, their individual characteristics, and any other health conditions they may have. While many people with COPD can still engage in low-intensity physical activities like walking, swimming, and yoga, some patients experience severe limitations that require additional treatments like long-term oxygen therapy or lung transplantation.

Please answer the following question: If you visited the Getty Center in July or early August, you may have encountered a group of high school students wearing white lab coats with “Teen Lab” splattered across the back. You might have spotted them testing kinetic sculptures made from recycled materials, sketching in front of artworks in the galleries, or taking Polaroid self-portraits inspired by David Hockney’s photocollages. Online, you may have seen the playful social media stories they created to share their experiments with artistic and scientific processes. The teens were participants in the Getty Teen Lab, a four-week paid internship for high school students. Supported by a generous grant from the Vera R. Campbell Foundation, Teen Lab was the first of several teen-focused initiatives that the J. Paul Getty Museum is launching in 2017 and 2018. The Getty’s Education Department developed Teen Lab in response to several seemingly disconnected questions that many art museums are grappling with today: How can we engage diverse youth in meaningful ways? How can museums help meet the rising demand for K-12 curriculum that integrates Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Math (STEAM)? Can art museums themselves be sites for STEAM learning? To address these questions, we looked at other teen programs and discovered that the most successful models are those that give teens agency and a voice in the museum.(1) For example, many museums have teen councils that program events for their peers or offer opportunities for students to collaborate on projects with artists.(2) The Getty wanted to build on these models by empowering teens to be active creators of educational content. In keeping with this goal, we designed the program using the project-based learning approach, which develops skills and knowledge by inviting students to explore solutions to authentic, real-world problems. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What was the name of one of the students?

Hal soon marries an exceedingly vain, and selfish woman named Fiona, who has socially-awkward fraternal twin daughters, Brianna and Gabriella. During the 1994 Northridge earthquake, Hal is killed when he runs to save Fiona. Having supposedly left no will, Fiona receives all of his belongings, including the house, the diner, and to her dismay, Sam. Eight years later, Sam is employed as a waitress at the diner to save money to attend Princeton University, but she is regularly tormented by her stepfamily. Sam struggles to cope socially at North Valley High School, where queen bee and cheerleader Shelby Cummings, also torments her and calls her \\"Diner Girl\\" along with other members of the popular clique. Sam confides in her online pen pal \\"Nomad\\" about her dream to attend Princeton, a dream which he also shares. However, Nomad's true identity is Austin Ames, the popular, yet unhappy, quarterback of the school's football team, and Shelby's ex-boyfriend, although she refuses to accept that he has broken up with her.

Based on the premise \\"Then I must speak for you. Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"So I have to speak in your place; Inglethorp shot out of his seat.\\" is true?","completion":"To determine the validity of the hypothesis \\"So I have to speak in your place; Inglethorp shot out of his seat.\\", we should first analyze the given premise \\"Then I must speak for you. Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\" that serves as the basis for this hypothesis. The premise consists of two separate statements: 1. \\"Then I must speak for you\\" – This statement suggests that the speaker has accepted the responsibility to speak on behalf of someone else, possibly because the other person is unable or unwilling to express themselves. 2. \\"Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again\\" – This statement implies that Alfred Inglethorp, a character in the scenario, has suddenly risen from his seated position for the second time (due to the use of \\"again\\"). Now let's examine the hypothesis in question, which also consists of two separate statements: A. \\"So I have to speak in your place\\" – This statement is essentially a rephrasing of the first statement in the premise: \\"Then I must speak for you.\\" Both sentences convey the same meaning, implying that the speaker is taking on the role of spokesperson for someone else. B. \\"Inglethorp shot out of his seat\\" – This statement shares similarities with the second statement in the premise: \\"Alfred Inglethorp sprang up again.\\" Both sentences describe Alfred Inglethorp rising suddenly from his seat. The use of \\"shot\\" in the hypothesis suggests a more rapid or intense movement than \\"sprang,\\" but both phrases indicate a similar action. Given that both parts of the hypothesis align with the corresponding statements in the premise, albeit with slightly different phrasings, the hypothesis \\"So I have to speak in your place; Inglethorp shot out of his seat.\\" can be considered true based on the premise provided. However, it is necessary to keep in mind that the context and surrounding details of the scenario have not been provided, which could potentially affect the validity of this conclusion.

Which of the following methods is more reasonable for accomplishing this goal? Available choices: (A). Buy a long cord phone charger.. (B). Buy a short cord phone charger.....I think the answer is","completion":"(B). Buy a short cord phone charger. While both a long cord phone charger (Option A) and a short cord phone charger (Option B) can be considered in an attempt to reduce the craving to use a phone when charging, option B offers certain advantages that make it the more reasonable choice for achieving this goal. Let's examine the reasons supporting each choice in detail. Option A: Buy a long cord phone charger A long cord phone charger offers users the mobility and flexibility to use their phone easily when charging. The comfort and convenience provided by a long cord can lead users to continue their normal phone usage habits while the device charges, deterring any kind of behavioral change. Since the primary goal in this case is to reduce the craving to use the phone during charging, the advantages offered by a long cord phone charger work against the intended goal. Option B: Buy a short cord phone charger A short cord phone charger can help limit the physical reach of the phone while it is being charged. This restriction can work in favor of the intended goal, as it disrupts the comfort associated with using the phone during charging. The user might be less inclined to use their phone, as the short cord would limit their ability to continue using it freely. This constraint can help reduce the desire to use the phone during charging, as the user needs to adjust their body posture or sit near the charging point to use their device, making it less comfortable and potentially discouraging. In conclusion, while a long cord phone charger provides convenience and comfort for continued phone use during charging, it does not address the goal of reducing the craving to use the phone while charging. On the other hand, a short cord phone charger creates a disruption in regular usage habits by limiting mobility, which can contribute to reducing phone usage and cravings during the charging process. Therefore, option B, buying a short cord phone charger, is the more reasonable method for accomplishing the goal of reducing the craving to use the phone when charging."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who is annoyed with Cryrano De Begerc? Movie title: Cyrano de Bergerac Movie plot: In a Paris theater in 1640, a play begins before a fairly full house. After a few painfully dull lines are delivered by principal actor Montfleury (Arthur Blake), a boisterous heckler in a box disrupts the proceedings. The heckler is Cyrano de Bergerac (José Ferrer), poet and supreme swordsman, who says he cannot endure the actor's bombastic style. He gives Montfleury a slow count of three to disappear before coming at him, and the actor runs away. Eventually Cyrano confronts the playwright and theater manager, insisting that the play be closed. When the manager complains that he can't afford to refund money to the audience, Cyrano throws him a bag of gold coins.Watching from another box in the theater are Cyrano's distant cousin, the beautiful Roxane (Mala Powers), with her attendant (Virginia Farmer); the Comte de Guiche (Ralph Clanton), who is Roxane's suitor; and the Vicomte de Valvert (Albert Cavens), an arrogant aristocrat who is so annoyed he insults Cyrano with snide but clichéd comments about his enormous nose. This can only lead to a duel.Cyrano first mocks the vicomte's lack of wit, improvising numerous inventive ways in which Valvert might have phrased references to the giant nose, much to the amusement of the audience. Cyrano then announces he will compose a poem and recite it during the duel, which he does -- thus showing off simultaneously his skills as poet and swordsman. With the last line, he stabs his opponent, and the audience leaves.Cyrano's friend Le Bret (Morris Carnovsky), captain of the Gascony guards, warns him he has made powerful enemies, but Cyrano is unconcerned.When Le Bret presses him as to why he hates Montfleury, Cyrano admits that he became jealous when he saw the actor making advances towards Roxane. He confesses that he is in love with her, but harbors no hope of being loved in return because of his deformity, his huge nose. Le Bret suggests they go out to eat, but Cyrano says he has no money left, as all he had was in the bag he threw at the theater manager -- a costly...

Options: (I). rainy environments; (II). underwater environments; (III). forest areas; (IV). frozen areas;","completion":"Among the four options given, the frozen areas (IV) would appear the brightest when you wake up there. The reasons for this are elaborated below, as well as a comparison to the other environments mentioned. (I) Rainy environments: Rainy environments, by nature, have overcast sky that obstruct direct sunlight. Clouds scatter and absorb the sunlight arriving at Earth's surface, resulting in a range of diffuse light that has low intensity. This makes the rainy environment appear rather dull, and definitely not the brightest among the options presented. (II) Underwater environments: Underwater environments experience a dramatic decrease in sunlight penetration as you descend deeper into the water. At the surface, the sunlight is filtered and absorbed by water molecules, which causes a decrease in wavelength that results in the loss of red, orange, and yellow colors the deeper you go. However, even if you were right at the surface of the water, the sunlight would still be diffused and scattered by the water, making the overall environment dimmer than a frozen land. (III) Forest areas: Forests, although filled with significant amounts of vegetation that reflect sunlight in various ways, are relatively dark environments due to the canopy created by the tall trees. The dense foliage of the trees absorbs a large portion of the sunlight that reaches the forest, leading to limited penetration of direct sunlight to the ground. As a result, the environment appears dimmer and darker due to the play of light and shadow beneath the tree cover. (IV) Frozen areas: Snow-covered frozen areas appear the brightest among the options due to several factors. Firstly, the color white that characterizes snowy landscapes has a high albedo, meaning it reflects a significant portion of the sunlight that illuminates it. Albedo is the measurement of the reflectivity of a surface, and it is well-known that snow has an albedo of up to 0.9 or higher, meaning it reflects up to 90% of incoming sunlight. This leads to an enhanced brightness in regions like the Arctic and Antarctic during periods of sunlight. Moreover, snowy environments often lack tall trees or structures that would create shade, which contributes to a more uniform and widespread reflection of light. In conclusion, should you wake up in a frozen area covered in snow, it would appear as the brightest environment among the four options provided, due to the high albedo of the snowy landscape and the lack of obstructions hindering sunlight reflection."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more glucose is produced happens, how will it affect LESS regulation of blood sugar level being needed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis in this case suggests that if more glucose is produced, less regulation of blood sugar levels would be needed. To examine this hypothesis, let's consider the effect of the increased glucose production on the process: 1. If more glucose is produced, it would mean that blood sugar levels are higher than normal. 2. Since the regulation of blood sugar levels is aimed at maintaining a balance, higher levels of glucose would likely lead to a compensatory mechanism. 3. One compensatory mechanism is the release of insulin, a hormone that helps lower blood glucose levels. If glucose levels are elevated, cells in the pancreas would release more insulin, causing cells in the body to take up the excess glucose and store it away as glycogen or fat. 4. This increased uptake of glucose and storage would help counteract the excess glucose production and restore the blood sugar levels to normal. In conclusion, the perturbation does have an effect on the process. It is likely that in response to the increased glucose production, the regulation of blood sugar levels would be adjusted through the increased release of insulin. This would, in turn, help maintain blood sugar levels within the normal range, ensuring that less regulation is needed. However, it is essential to note that chronic exposure to high blood sugar levels can lead to complications, such as insulin resistance or diabetes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. To look like a VS Angel, you need to learn how to do your makeup like a VS angel. The Angels don’t tend to go overboard on their makeup, they prefer more of a healthy, glowing look with some added sparkle and shimmer! Try to go for a mineral or powder foundation that matches your skin tone perfectly - you really don’t want to look like you’re caked in makeup! Apply a little matching concealer under the eyes or to cover any blemishes, if necessary. Then use a pinky-bronze colored blush to add a healthy glow to your cheeks. Apply eyeshadow in neutral colored creams and browns. Then, depending on your skin tone, use a black or brown eyeliner to line your upper lid only. Use a matching mascara to add volume and definition to your lashes. The Angels don’t usually wear bold lipsticks, they prefer to go for soft pink and nude pouts. Try using a balmy lipstick that’s just a shade or two lighter or darker than your natural lip color. Stay away from glosses or anything that’s too shiny or shimmering. Just look at MAC lipsticks for a lovely nude shade. Having fabulous hair is essential for any VS Angel. Make sure yours is in tip top condition by getting regular trims, using a weekly deep conditioning treatment and by avoiding excessive heat from styling tools like flat irons, curling tongs, and hair dryers. The better you treat your hair, the faster it will grow - and as you know, long, healthy hair is a VS model’s trademark. When it’s time to get all-dolled up, the Angels favor loose, tousled-looking curls. To achieve this make sure your hair is freshly washed and conditioned, and use a nourishing serum or oil (such as argan oil) to add shine. Blow dry your hair using a round bristled brush to add lots of volume. When your hair is dry, spritz it with some heat protection spray and begin making large, loose curls using your flat iron or curling tongs (for more specific instructions see here and here). When you’re done, spritz your hair with some loose hold hairspray and you’re ready for the runway! As you may have noticed, all of the Angel’s have beautiful, sun-kissed glows. Therefore, if you want to look like a VS model you’ll have to get your tan on! However, as the Angels know, having healthy skin is far more important than having a tan. Therefore, it is absolutely essential that you wear sunscreen if you plan on lying out by the pool. Otherwise, you could be exposing your skin to burns and sunspots - not to mention contributing to wrinkles, premature aging and skin cancer! If getting a natural tan feels like too much effort, you’re super pale, or you just want to avoid sun exposure - fret not! You can get a natural-looking tan from a bottle. Just make sure to exfoliate well before you apply any self-tanning products. For more info on using a self-tanner, see here. Having perfect, straight, white teeth is another Angel must-have! Practice good oral hygiene by brushing your teeth 2 to 3 times a day, flossing regularly and avoiding sugary food and drinks. You should also make an effort to see your dentist a couple of times a year. He can give your teeth a proper cleaning, getting rid of any stains or built-up plaque that are impossible to remove at home. This will also leave your teeth looking whiter! If necessary, you can also ask your dentist about whitening treatments like laser or bleaching. These can be pricey, but are worth it if you really want a dazzlingly white smile! The same goes for braces - if your teeth are a little crooked, ask your dentist about your options for straightening them. The VS models are classy ladies, and even though they spend a lot of time in their underwear, they still manage to look glamorous and elegant - never trashy. Try to emulate this in your everyday life by wearing polished, well-tailored clothes which highlight your feminine side. Think dark bootcut jeans, with crisp, button down shirts, or A-line dresses and skirts which cinch in at the waist. Wear understated jewelry and opt for low heels or pretty flats. The most important thing is to wear clothes that fit you. Don’t wear too-small clothes thinking that they’ll make you look skinnier - they’ll actually have the opposite effect. Always try on clothes before buying and bring a trusted friend with you who can give you an honest opinion. Even in their downtime, the Angel’s look well-put-together. Wear matching gym clothes (like the oh-so-comfortable yet stylish VS tracksuits) and always have your hair looking neat, even if it’s just tied back in a pony. Of course, no Angel would be complete without her VS lingerie! Don’t be afraid of sexy lingerie, girls - it’s designed to make you feel beautiful, even underneath jeans and a t-shirt! Again, it’s important to wear the right size, as too-small lingerie can create bulges and lumps in all the wrong places, while too-big lingerie won’t give you the support you need. Not only are they some of the most beautiful people on the planet, the VS Angels are also well-known for their friendliness, kindness and overall great personalities! This is something you can easily adopt in your everyday life. Just by smiling and being kind, you will radiate beauty - just like an Angel!","completion":"To look like a Victoria's Secret Angel, focus on natural makeup, healthy and shiny hair, sun-kissed skin, good dental hygiene, classy clothing, and a friendly personality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: People have smoked cigarettes for a long time now. The tobacco which is used to make cigarettes was first grown in what is now part of the United States. Christopher Columbus, who discovered America, saw the Indians smoking. Soon the dried leaves were transported to Europe. In the late 1800s, the Turks made cigarettes popular. Cigarette smoke contains at least two harmful substances, tar and nicotine. Tar, which forms as the tobacco burns, damages the lungs and therefore affects breathing. Nicotine, which is found in the leaves, causes the heart to beat faster and increases the breathing rate. Nicotine in large can kill a person by stopping a person's breathing muscles. Smokers usually take in small amounts that the body can quickly break down. Nicotine can make new smokers feel dizzy or sick to their stomachs. The heart rate for young smokers increases 2 to 3 beats per minute. Nicotine also lowers skin temperature and reduces blood flow in the legs and feet. It plays an important role in increasing smokers' risk of heart disease and stroke. Smoking cigarettes is dangerous. Cigarette smoking was the cause of lung cancer and several other deadly diseases.

Plot title: Pinocchio Movie plot: After singing the film's signature song \\"When You Wish Upon a Star\\", Jiminy Cricket explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Tuscany workshop of a woodworker named Geppetto. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names Pinocchio (a name his cat Figaro and fish Cleo both dislike). Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio would be a real boy. During the night, a Blue Fairy visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience. Gideon and Honest John Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat, who convince him to join Stromboli's puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings while performing with marionettes of Dutch girls, French can-can girls, and Russian Cossacks. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him up in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy then appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets them free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him. Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a coachman who promises to pay them big money if they can find foolish little boys for him to take to Pleasure Island.

Q: In the fruit fly Drosophila, the Inscuteable protein localises to the apical cell cortex in neuroblasts and directs both the apical-basal orientation of the mitotic spindle and the basal localisation of the protein determinants Numb and Prospero during mitosis. Asymmetric localisation of Inscuteable is initiated during neuroblast delamination by direct binding to Bazooka, an apically localised protein that contains protein-interaction motifs known as PDZ domains. How apically localised Inscuteable directs asymmetric cell divisions is unclear.', 'A novel 70 kDa protein called Partner of Inscuteable (Pins) and a heterotrimeric G-protein alpha subunit were found to bind specifically to the functional domain of Inscuteable in vivo. The predicted sequence of Pins contained tetratrico-peptide repeats (TPRs) and motifs implicated in binding Galpha proteins. Pins colocalised with Inscuteable at the apical cell cortex in interphase and mitotic neuroblasts. Asymmetric localisation of Pins required both Inscuteable and Bazooka. In epithelial cells, which do not express inscuteable, Pins was not apically localised but could be recruited to the apical cortex by ectopic expression of Inscuteable. In pins mutants, these epithelial cells were not affected, but neuroblasts showed defects in the orientation of their mitotic spindle and the basal asymmetric localisation of Numb and Miranda during metaphase. Although localisation of Inscuteable in pins mutants was initiated correctly during neuroblast delamination, Inscuteable became homogeneously distributed in the cytoplasm during mitosis. A:","completion":"To determine if the passage has a definite objective/aim/goal, I will analyze the content and look for a specific intent to achieve something or solve a problem. The passage talks about the Inscuteable protein and its localization in the fruit fly Drosophila. It explains how the asymmetric localization of Inscuteable is initiated and introduces a new protein called Partner of Inscuteable (Pins). The passage discusses Pins' function, its relationship with Inscuteable, and its effect on neuroblasts during mitosis. It also highlights some experimental results and observations pointing towards the roles of these proteins in cell division. While the passage discusses the interaction between Inscuteable, Pins, and neuroblast cell division in detail, it does not clearly state a definite objective, aim, or goal that the reader is supposed to achieve or infer.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Molly and Brian are two friends who moved away from one another after becoming close in college. They still talk on the phone regularly and see each other a couple times a year. During a recent conversation, the subject of population comes up. Molly's town is currently increasing a steady decrease in population, and Brian's town has been seeing an increase in population. and a hint : Declines in population size can result in a loss of genetic diversity, and owing to genetic variation's role in the evolutionary potential of a species, this could in turn result in an observable Allee effect. As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Movie title: Westworld Context: It is sometime in the near future, in a fictional high-tech adult amusement park called Delos. The park is divided into three zones: WesternWorld, MedievalWorld and RomanWorld. The entertainment in all three areas consists primarily of interaction by the guests with androids programmed to act in character (the Old West, medieval Europe, and pre-Christian Rome, respectively). The androids are indistinguishable from human beings, apart from minor flaws in their hands, and guests are encouraged to indulge in any fantasy, including killing the androids. The androids are programmed to respond positively to guest requests, specifically including requests for sex. Delos's guests pay 1,000 a day for the experience.Peter Martin (Benjamin) a first-timer and his friend John Blane (Brolin), who has visited previously, come to the WesternWorld zone, where one of the main attractions is the Gunslinger (Yul Brynner), a robot programmed to start duels. Thanks to its programming, humans can always outdraw the Gunslinger and kill it. The guns issued to the guests also have temperature sensors that prevent them from firing at each other or anything else living but allow them to 'kill' the room-temperature androids.Gradually, the technicians running Delos begin to notice problems with the androids. In what may be the first mention of the concept of a computer virus in a film, the technical staff describe inexplicable problems and breakdowns spreading \\"like a disease\\" between the machines, first in one area of the park and then on to the others. First, the robots in MedievalWorld begin suffering an inexplicable number of systemic failures. Then, a robot rattlesnake strikes Blane. Against her programming, a female servant android refuses a guest's request for sex. The failures increase until the robotic Black Knight kills a guest in a sword-fight in MedievalWorld. The resort's supervisors, in increasing desperation, attempt to regain control by shutting down power to the entire park. Unfortunately, this results in trapping them...

Answer this question: when was the last time germany lost world cup??","completion":"As of my knowledge update in 2021, the last time Germany lost in a FIFA World Cup was during the 2018 tournament held in Russia. The German national football team, which has historically been one of the strongest teams and the winner of the 2014 World Cup, had a surprisingly poor performance in the 2018 edition. Germany, which was part of Group F, lost two out of their three group-stage matches. They began the tournament with a 1-0 defeat against Mexico on June 17, 2018. Although they managed to beat Sweden 2-1 in their second match on June 23, 2018, the victory wasn't enough to save them. Germany faced South Korea in their last group-stage match on June 27, 2018, where they were expected to win and advance to the Round of 16. However, in a stunning turn of events, the German team lost 2-0 to South Korea, leading to their elimination from the tournament. This was the first time since 1938 that Germany had been knocked out of a World Cup during the group stage. The unexpected loss and elimination can be attributed to various factors, such as an ageing squad, lack of consistent performance, and tactical errors. In addition, several key players from the 2014 World Cup-winning team were missing or not in optimal form during the 2018 tournament. The poor performance in the 2018 World Cup sparked a period of reflection and reform in German football, with the aim to rebuild and rejuvenate the national team for future international competitions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"The last step of the sediment transport process is the deposition of the sediment particles in a new location. Deposition occurs when the forces responsible for transporting sediment, such as water or wind currents, lose their energy or when the sediment particles encounter obstacles that hinder their movement. This reduction in energy or encountering an obstacle causes the sediment particles to lose their momentum and settle down onto the new surface, forming a variety of depositional landforms and features. Examples of such landforms and features include sandbars, river deltas, alluvial fans, beaches, dunes, and glacial moraines. Over time, these deposited sediments can accumulate and eventually transform into sedimentary rocks through a process known as lithification. In summary, the final step in the sediment transport process is the deposition of sediment particles in a new location, leading to the formation of various depositional landforms and, eventually, sedimentary rocks."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Poles, Finns, and the Baltic provinces all sought autonomy, and also freedom to use their national languages and promote their own culture. Muslim groups were also active, founding the Union of the Muslims of Russia in August 1905. Certain groups took the opportunity to settle differences with each other rather than the government. Some nationalists undertook anti-Jewish pogroms, possibly with government aid, and in total over 3,000 Jews were killed. The number of prisoners throughout the Russian Empire, which had peaked at 116,376 in 1893, fell by over a third to a record low of 75,009 in January 1905, chiefly because of several mass amnesties granted by the Tsar; the historian S G Wheatcroft has wondered what role these released criminals played in the 1905-06 social unrest.

Write a title for this article: President Barack Obama has pledged to destroy Islamic State and ensure fighters “find no safe haven.” But even as U.S.-led airstrikes are underway in Iraq and Syria, it is clear that bombs alone will not do the job. For Islamic State hides out in the most perfect haven: the World Wide Web. In June 2014, the militant group that Obama refers to as Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, grabbed the world’s attention after it took over much of northern Iraq in roughly four days. Islamic State accomplished this by building a massive, sophisticated virtual network of fighters in addition to those on the ground. Indeed, its expansion online has been as swift as its territorial gains. It is this virtual power grab that will be most difficult to combat. The Internet has largely sustained the jihadist movement since 9/11. With this powerful tool, jihadists coordinate actions, share information, recruit new members and propagate their ideology. Until the rise of Islamic State, extremist activity and exchanges online usually took place inside restricted, password-protected jihadist forums. But Islamic State brought online jihadism out of the shadows and into the mainstream, using social media — especially Twitter – to issue rapid updates on its successes to a theoretically unlimited audience. In the same way that Islamic State’s land grab proved stunning, the group’s actions online have been deeply troubling. Up until a recent crackdown by Twitter, Islamic State’s presence on the site had grown tremendously — from a small one to a well-organized network with dozens of accounts. For example, Al-Hayat Media Center, the group’s primary Western-aimed media producer and distributor, was using the micro-blogging site to tweet jihadist material, including magazines, Islamic chants, e-books, leadership messages and calls to join the group. It also sent high-definition videos in Arabic, English, Bosnian, German, French, Russian, Indonesian and other languages. In addition, Islamic State had been openly running local Twitter accounts, designated for specific cities and regions in Iraq and Syria. These provided news updates and martyr profiles — geared to win the hearts and minds of the local Sunnis. Yet it was not just the official Islamic State media accounts that were worrisome. With the widespread adoption of social media and smartphones, individual fighters were turning their fierce military battles into real-time, glorifying accounts for potential jihadists around the world to consume. These self-styled social media personalities used online platforms to interact with prospective recruits in their own languages, boasting of their “heroic” exploits and desires for martyrdom. Islamic State clearly must see Twitter as crucial to its survival. So it is unlikely to be chased off the platform without a fight. When Twitter cracked down on Islamic State-related accounts, the militants ignited a massive anti-Twitter campaign, filled with death threats against the company and its employees. The scare campaign even used its own hashtags, such as “#Thought_of_a_Lone_Lion,” which accompanied calls for lone-wolf attacks. It didn’t end there. A few days later, Islamic State demonstrated that it can beat Twitter in its battle to silence the group’s propaganda machine. After Twitter suspended the Islamic State accounts on the site, the militants still managed to tweet the beheading video of the British aid worker David Haines on Sept. 13, 2014. The group used a carefully calculated maneuver on private account settings. Soon after, links to the beheading flooded Twitter feeds everywhere. This continues today. The fact that the latest beheading video of a French hostage, released Wednesday by an Islamic State-inspired group in Algeria, was distributed on Twitter demonstrates that the site remains the primary outlet for propaganda from Islamic State and its supporters. The group’s message is clear: You can’t stop us. As the West continuous to mishandle the electronic jihad it is proving the militants right. Consider the State Department’s “Think Again Turn Away” social media campaign. In trying to win over would-be jihadists online, the program engages in childish discussions with jihadists. Some have compared this to “trolling” and has proved not only to be ineffective but counter-productive. “It is a silly game,” said a former State Department official involved in countering Islamic propaganda online. Some experts, including me, regard the program as an embarrassment. Islamic State is a new kind of enemy. Fighters killed in bombing raids can be easily replaced by new recruits found online. To fully end this cycle, the online recruitment of extremists must stop. Without excising the source of the problem, Washington and its allies will not succeed. In Iraq and Syria now, the United States is not using “silly games” to destroy Islamic State. It is using serious firepower. It is time to do the same with the online caliphate.

What are some of the most unique classical piano pieces?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. They are asking for different types of piano pieces with distinct characteristics. Let's break down each question to better understand their meanings and provide appropriate responses. 1. What are the greatest melancholic piano pieces? This question is asking for piano pieces that evoke a sense of melancholy, which generally refers to a feeling of sadness, sorrow, or depression. In this case, the person is interested in knowing about the most renowned or exceptional melancholic piano pieces. To provide a detailed answer, we'll list some examples of well-known melancholic piano compositions, including their composers and some context. - Frédéric Chopin's Nocturnes: Chopin's Nocturnes are a collection of solo piano pieces that often have melancholic and introspective themes. A notable example is the Nocturne Op. 9 No. 2 in E♭ Major, which features a beautifully haunting melody and delicate expressivity. - Ludwig van Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata (Piano Sonata No. 14 in C♯ minor, Op. 27, No. 2): The first movement, \\"Adagio sostenuto,\\" is famous for its somber melody and tone. It is often associated with feelings of sadness and introspection. - Erik Satie's Gymnopédies: These are three piano compositions that exude a languid, melancholic aura. The most famous of these is the Gymnopédie No. 1, with its gentle, hypnotic melody and introspective tone. - Robert Schumann's \\"Kinderszenen\\" (Scenes from Childhood), Op. 15: Specifically, the piece titled \\"Träumerei\\" (Dreaming) is known for its tender, nostalgic mood, evoking a longing for lost innocence and youth. 2. What are some of the most unique classical piano pieces? This question is about classical piano pieces that stand out for their distinct or unusual qualities, making them different from more conventional compositions. In this case, the person wants to know about piano pieces that display innovative techniques, structures, ideas, or other aspects that make them unique. Below are some examples of such piano compositions. - Maurice Ravel's \\"Gaspard de la Nuit\\": Known as one of the most challenging solo piano works, this suite consists of three movements inspired by Aloysius Bertrand's poetry. It's noted for its inventive harmonies and virtuosic technical demands, pushing the boundaries of piano performance. - Igor Stravinsky's \\"Petrushka\\" (Piano Transcription): This is a challenging piano transcription based on Stravinsky's ballet. Its unique rhythmic complexity and bold harmonic language make it stand out in the world of piano compositions. - Charles Ives' \\"Concord Sonata\\" (Piano Sonata No. 2): This highly original work melds classical sonata form with an experimental American aesthetic, incorporating quotations from famous historical works, polytonality, and atonality. - John Cage's \\"Sonatas and Interludes\\" for Prepared Piano: These pieces for \\"prepared piano\\" (a piano modified with various objects to produce unconventional sounds) showcase Cage's innovative approach to instrumentation and composition, blurring the boundaries between music and noise. In conclusion, while both questions focus on different types of piano pieces, their intended meanings are distinct. The first question seeks piano compositions that embody a melancholic mood, whereas the second question aims to discover unique, unconventional classical piano pieces that defy traditional norms in music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yemen, officially known as the Republic of Yemen, is an Arab country in Western Asia at the southern end of the Arabian Peninsula. Yemen is the second-largest country in the peninsula, occupying 527,970 km (203,850 sq mi). The coastline stretches for about 2,000 km (1,200 mi). It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the north, the Red Sea to the west, the Gulf of Aden and Arabian Sea to the south, and Oman to the east-northeast. Although Yemen's constitutionally stated capital is the city of Sana'a, the city has been under rebel control since February 2015. Because of this, Yemen's capital has been temporarily relocated to the port city of Aden, on the southern coast. Yemen's territory includes more than 200 islands; the largest of these is Socotra. Yemen was the home of the Sabaeans (biblical Sheba), a trading state that flourished for over a thousand years and also included parts of modern-day Ethiopia and Eritrea. In 275 AD, the region came under the rule of the later Jewish-influenced Himyarite Kingdom. Christianity arrived in the fourth century, whereas Judaism and local paganism were already established. Islam spread quickly in the seventh century and Yemenite troops were crucial in the expansion of the early Islamic conquests. Administration of Yemen has long been notoriously difficult. Several dynasties emerged from the ninth to 16th centuries, the Rasulid dynasty being the strongest and most prosperous. The country was divided between the Ottoman and British empires in the early twentieth century. The Zaydi Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen was established after World War I in North Yemen before the creation of the Yemen Arab Republic in 1962.

The drink is now marketed in America as 'healthier alternative' to lager. Article:","completion":"Title: The Rising Popularity of Premium Products and Flavored Ciders: A Healthier Alternative to Lager Introduction: The global landscape of the alcoholic beverage industry is constantly evolving, thanks to the changing preferences and tastes of consumers. As their palates become more refined and they seek healthier choices, discerning drinkers are now more than ever, willing to pay a premium for quality products that offer unique flavors and experiences. One particular category that has gained significant traction in recent times is flavored ciders. Initially popularized in Europe, these ciders have now made their way to the American market, where they are being marketed as a healthier alternative to traditional lager. This article will explore the factors behind their surge in popularity and how flavored ciders are poised to become the new go-to choice for health-conscious consumers. The Shift Towards Premium and Flavored Ciders: One of the key drivers behind the growing demand for premium alcoholic products and flavored ciders is the increased focus on health and wellbeing. With numerous studies highlighting the negative impacts of excessive alcohol consumption, more and more consumers are becoming aware of the importance of moderation and opting for healthier alternatives when indulging in their favorite tipple. Flavored ciders fit the bill perfectly, offering lower alcohol content and fewer calories than their lager counterparts. Moreover, the introduction of innovative flavor combinations and limited-edition offerings has piqued consumers' curiosity and encouraged them to try something different. Flavored ciders have not only reinvented the traditional apple-based drink but also expanded the category to include a wider variety of fruits, such as pear, cherry, and even tropical flavors like pineapple and passion fruit. This diversification of flavors has attracted a broader range of consumers with varying taste preferences, contributing to the growth of the category. The American Market Embrace: As the demand for flavored ciders grows, brands have begun capitalizing on this trend by launching their versions of these beverages in the American market. The US has always been a significant player in the global alcoholic beverage industry, and the increasing popularity of flavored ciders offers a promising opportunity for both domestic and international producers to capture the attention of a wide audience. One of the strategies that these brands have employed is marketing their ciders as a healthier alternative to lager. This approach has resonated well with American consumers, who are increasingly conscious of their dietary choices and more likely to prioritize wellness when making purchases. Furthermore, a study published in the scientific journal BMJ Open revealed that alcohol content in beer, one of America's favorite beverages, has been steadily increasing, making the option of flavored ciders even more appealing. In addition to the health angle, the convenience and versatility of flavored ciders also contribute to their appeal in the American market. Available in cans, bottles, and even on tap at select bars, the ease of consumption makes ciders the ideal choice for on-the-go drinking or for enjoying at home. Conclusion: The ascent of premium products and flavored ciders as a preferred choice for health-conscious drinkers is a testament to the evolving preferences of consumers in the alcoholic beverage industry. The combination of innovative flavors, lower alcohol content, convenience, and the tag of being a healthier alternative to lager has positioned flavored ciders for continued growth in the years to come. As more producers recognize the potential in this burgeoning category and continue to innovate, the popularity of these ciders is only set to grow, catering to the diverse tastes and preferences of the modern consumer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Suddenly, a bat with a crippled wing and peg leg bursts into the Flaversham's workshop, kidnapping Hiram. Olivia searches to find the famed Great Mouse Detective named Basil of Baker Street, but gets lost. A surgeon named Dr. David Q. Dawson, who is returning from a lengthy service of the Mouse Queen's 66th Regiment in Afghanistan, stumbles upon Olivia, and escorts Olivia to Basil's residence. Upon their arrival at his residence, Basil is initially indifferent, but when Olivia mentions the peg-legged bat that kidnapped her father, Basil realizes that Olivia saw Fidget, a henchman of Professor Ratigan, a villain Basil has been trying to arrest for years. It is then revealed that Professor Ratigan kidnapped Hiram to create a clockwork robot which mimics the Queen of the Mice so Ratigan can rule England. Hiram initially refuses to participate in the scheme, but gives in when Ratigan threatens to harm Olivia. Ratigan then announces his plans to kill the Queen and become \\"supreme ruler of all mousedom\\" to his henchmen. Meanwhile, as Basil is deducing the case, Fidget appears through the window, scaring Olivia. They give chase as Basil finds Fidget's footprints, declaring that they purse him in order to find Hiram. Basil, along with Dawson and Olivia, takes Toby, Sherlock Holmes's pet Basset Hound, to track Fidget's scent, where they locate him in a toyshop stealing clockwork mechanisms and toy soldiers' uniforms. Fidget then ambushes Olivia from inside a toy cradle and kidnaps her. Basil and Dawson pursue Fidget, but become entangled and fall behind. While searching the shop, Dawson discovers Fidget's checklist, to which Basil does some chemical tests to discover the list came from a riverfront near the Thames.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, the two questions—\\"What is an authentication factor?\\" and \\"What are Authentication Factors?\\"—are paraphrases of each other. They both seek to understand the concept of authentication factors. Here is a detailed and long answer to elaborate on the topic: Authentication factors are the means or methods used to verify the identity of a user, device, or system that is trying to access a restricted area or resource. These methods help in determining whether the entity requesting access is genuine or not and play a crucial role in maintaining the security and integrity of sensitive data and systems. Traditionally, there are three main types of authentication factors. Each type represents a unique category of authentication methods: 1. Knowledge-based factors (something you know): This involves the user providing information that only they should know, effectively proving their identity. The most common example is the use of passwords. Other examples include personal identification numbers (PINs) and security questions. 2. Possession-based factors (something you have): These factors involve the user verifying their identity by providing proof of possession of a particular object/device. This object could be a physical key, an access card, or a hardware token like key fobs. In the digital world, possession-based factors often involve cryptographic keys or certificates, such as those used in Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) secure connections, or an SMS token or authenticator app generating time-based one-time passwords (e.g., Google Authenticator). 3. Inherence-based factors (something you are): Also known as biometric factors, these authenticate the user based on their unique physical or behavioral characteristics. Physical biometric features include fingerprints, facial recognition, iris or retinal scans, or even palm vein patterns, while behavioral features may involve analyzing a user's typing patterns, voice recognition, and gait analysis. Biometric authentication systems process raw biometric data to create a unique biometric template that user's can be identified against. These three types of authentication factors can be combined to create multi-factor authentication (MFA) or two-factor authentication (2FA) systems. Multi-factor authentication is the practice of using two or more distinct authentication factors to verify the identity of a user, device, or system. Implementing MFA significantly increases the security level by ensuring that even if one of the factors is compromised (e.g., a password), the attacker still cannot gain unauthorized access. For instance, 2FA is frequently used when accessing online banking systems or other sensitive data portals, and it usually combines something you know, like a password, with something you have, such as a temporary code sent to your mobile device via SMS or an authenticator app. In summary, authentication factors play a fundamental role in verifying the identity of users, devices, and systems that seek access to protected resources. Implementing multi-factor authentication methodologies is a crucial step in enhancing security measures and protecting sensitive data from unauthorized access."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A great-grandfather has put up his Christmas tree for the 84th time this year after his father first bought it from a toy shop in 1929. Douglas Hewitt, 84, has celebrated every Christmas with the artificial tree since he was born and he and his wife Mavis, 82, have once again put it up this year. Mr Hewitt's father bought the tree from Redgates toy shop, in Sheffield, just months after Douglas was born. The 4ft tree has been kept in its original red stand throughout the years and remains the centrepoint of the Hewitt family household during every festive season. Mr Hewitt, of South Anston, South Yorkshire, said: 'It reminds us of my childhood, our children's childhood and our grandchildren and great-grandchildren's after that. 'They all come and look at it and smile, it's become part of the furniture. 'If we didn't put that Christmas tree up, it wouldn't feel like Christmas. It would be different.' The tree was passed down to Mr Hewitt when he married Mavis in 1951. Mrs Hewitt said: 'Douglas was born in 1929 and they went into Redgates and asked for a Christmas tree and they didn't have any. 'The only one that was left was in the widow so his father said, \\"right, we will have that\\". 'Year after year we have just carried on using that one.

Scroll down for video. Mr Hewitt and his wife Mavis (pictured in 1980) have once again put the artificial tree up, 84 years after it was first bought. Mr Hewitt has said the tree used to have more branches on it and had 'seen better days' but it is once again standing pride of place in the Hewitt family home. Their daughter June Murphy also has fond memories of the Christmas tree. Mrs Murphy, 60, said: 'It was in my grandparents' home and then it was given to us. 'The lights that are on there now have been there since we went to a three-pin plug. 'It's looking a little thin now as each time you get it out something else falls off.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: Article: As Artificial Intelligence(AI) becomes increasingly sophisticated, there are growing concerns that robots could become a threat. This danger can be avoided, according to computer science professor Stuart Russell, if we figure out how to turn human values into a programmable code. Russell argues that as robots take on more complicated tasks, it's necessary to translate our morals into AI language. For example, if a robot does chores around the house, you wouldn't want it to put the pet cat in the oven to make dinner for the hungry children. \\"You would want that robot preloaded with a good set of values,\\" said Russell. Some robots are already programmed with basic human values. For example, mobile robots have been programmed to keep a comfortable distance from humans. Obviously there are cultural differences, but if you were talking to another person and they came up close in your personal space, you wouldn't think that's the kind of thing a properly brought-up person would do. It will be possible to create more sophisticated moral machines, if only we can find a way to set out human values as clear rules. Robots could also learn values from drawing patterns from large sets of data on human behavior. They are dangerous only if programmers are careless. The biggest concern with robots going against human values is that human beings fail to so sufficient testing and they've produced a system that will break some kind of taboo . One simple check would be to program a robot to check the correct course of action with a human when presented with an unusual situation. If the robot is unsure whether an animal is suitable for the microwave, it has the opportunity to stop, send out beeps , and ask for directions from a human. If we humans aren't quite sure about a decision, we go and ask somebody else. The most difficult step in programming values will be deciding exactly what we believe in moral, and how to create a set of ethical rules. But if we come up with an answer, robots could be good for humanity. Question: What does the author say about the threat of robots? Yes or no, is the answer \\"It can be avoided if human values are translated into their language.\\"?

It provides information about the man's emotional state, which is him smiling, and the object he holds, which is an acoustic guitar. 2. An acoustic guitar is part of the musical instruments family. In particular, it's a stringed instrument usually made of wood and played by either strumming or plucking the strings with fingers or a pick. Its ability to produce sound relies on generating vibrations in the air, which subsequently create audible sounds. Given this information, we can analyze the correspondence between the two statements: Statement 1: \\"A man smiling while holding an acoustic guitar.\\" Statement 2: \\"A man has an instrument.\\" From Statement 1, when examining the part related to the man holding an acoustic guitar, it implies that the man has that specific object under his possession or control, at least temporarily. Furthermore, since an acoustic guitar is a musical instrument, we can infer that the man has not just any object, but specifically a musical instrument. Therefore, based on the information provided in the initial statement and our understanding of an acoustic guitar as a musical instrument, it is entirely reasonable and logical to conclude that \\"A man has an instrument\\" when given the statement \\"A man smiling while holding an acoustic guitar.\\""},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor. A landmark budget agreement that passed in the U.S. House on Thursday faces certain death in the Senate unless at least five Republicans step up to support it – but so far there are no takers at all. The GOP's Senate leaders plan to launch a procedural effort to kill the plan over a laundry list of objections – including a claim that it short-changes military veterans and other government retirees. Senate Majority Whip Dick Durbin conceded that he needs to find Republicans who will vote for the measure after Republicans announced their intention Thursday night to block the deal. 'We need Republican votes to pass the budget agreement, period,' Durbin told reporters on Thursday. 'We need at least five. And I’m hoping that there will be more than that.' Durbin, an Illinois Democrat and the third-most powerful Senate leader, acknowledged that 'there are not five Republicans who have announced they’re for it.' In fact, no Republican senators have publicly said that they will vote in favor of the agreement that Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray unveiled Tuesday evening. Turtle in the headlights? Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell is on the hot seat as his caucus prepares to fight against the budget agreement that the House passed easily Thursday night. No way, Jose: Texas Senator Ted Cruz, a conservative tea-party darling, said the budget proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare. I cannot support it' Their plan would roll back. 63 billion in mandatory cuts from the so-called budget sequester that took effect in March. Some of that restored spending. would be offset by cuts to military and civilian government pensions. Annual cost-of-living increases in most military veterans' retirement benefits would be cut by 1 per cent, an amount that the Military Officers Association of America says could cost a typical former soldier or sailor 80,000 over a 20-year period. The GOP's three most senior senators, including Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, have announced that they will vote 'no.' Senators Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all considered top-tier presidential contenders in 2016, are all lined up against the measure. The proposal 'spends more, taxes more, and allows continued funding for Obamacare,' Cruz said Thursday. 'I cannot support it.' Gang of two: House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan and Senate Budget Committee Chair Patty Murray negotiated a shutdown-averting agreement that could be headed nowhere. Rubio emailed supporters on Wednesday, saying that the agreement Ryan and Murray negotiated over a six-week period 'continues Washington's irresponsible budgeting decisions by spending more money than the government takes in and placing additional financial burdens on everyday Americans.' House Speaker John Boehner fanned the flames of a civil war inside the GOP by slamming conservative groups that opposed the budget deal -- but it could all be for nought if his Senate colleagues decide to kill it. And Paul said in a statement that the March sequester cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem. Undoing tens of billions of this modest spending restraint is shameful and must be opposed.' Other Republicans who face primary challenges from tea party-backed candidates are also vowing to cast 'no' votes. 'After careful review of the agreement, I believe it will do disproportionate harm to our military retirees,' South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham said in a statement. 'Our men and women in uniform have served admirably during some of our nation’s most troubling times. They deserve more from us in their retirement than this agreement provides.' Sen. Roger Wicker, a Mississippi Republican, echoed Graham's complaint. 'I do not support paying for increased federal spending on the backs of our retired and active duty troops,' Wicker's Thursday statement read. 'Congress should not change the rules in the middle of the game for those who have chosen to serve our nation in the military. ... The plan should be rejected.' Other Republicans object to what one GOP Senate staffer told MailOnline is the agreement's 'pixie dust approach to budgeting.' 'We're doing what we always do,' said the aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity. 'We set out a ten-year plan while knowing full well that we have a decade to undo it and shift gears again.' Looking toward 2016: Sen. Rand Paul said the unpopular 'sequester' budget cuts 'were not nearly enough to address our deficit problem' and should never be rolled back. Alabama Republican Jeff Sessions explained that Democrats will need 60 'yes' votes – on two separate procedural ballots – in order to pass it. The GOP's parliamentary roadblocks will have the same effect as a traditional filibuster without consuming countless hours of Senate time when the measure is considered early next week. Even if Senate Democrats manage to find enough Republican support to pass the agreement, it won't have the force of law. What Ryan and Murray proposed Wednesday is merely a framework for a budget that has yet to be written. Members of Congress who sit on appropriation committees will still be required to craft – and pass in both houses – a final budget bill by January 15. Unless they can pull it off, the federal government will be headed for its second shutdown in three months.","completion":"The U.S. House passed a landmark budget agreement on Thursday, but faces potential defeat in the Senate unless at least five Republicans support it.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Miracle Cat Survives Harrowing Week Trapped in Car Engine A remarkable story of feline endurance has emerged from Malton, North Yorkshire, as a cat was recently found trapped in a car's engine, having survived there for an entire week. The cat, now affectionately known as Tabby, was discovered wedged between the steering rack and gear cables of a vehicle that had broken down unexpectedly. The car's owner, unaware of their stowaway passenger, had been experiencing issues with the vehicle and decided to take the car to a local mechanic. It was there that the skilled mechanic made the startling discovery of the trapped feline. The precarious situation Tabby found herself in has captured the hearts of animal lovers and created waves in the local community. It is believed that Tabby, likely in search of warmth and shelter, may have climbed into the car's engine compartment a week prior to being discovered. During that week, the starving cat had somehow avoided the many dangerous components within the engine, including the fan belts, moving gears, and scorching hot surfaces present during operation. Malton residents have expressed both shock and relief at Tabby's miraculous survival story, with many pondering just how she managed to stay alive for so long without food or water, while enduring the car's continuous operation. The mechanic who discovered Tabby, hailed as a hero by the community, shared his account of the heart-stopping moment when he discovered the cat. \\"I started working on the vehicle, trying to diagnose the problem, when I noticed something unusual. At first, I couldn't quite tell what it was, but then I saw fur and realized it was a cat. I couldn't believe my eyes!\\" he stated. The mechanic then carefully extracted Tabby from the tight space where she had been lodged, and although visibly weakened, the cat appeared to be in stable condition. Following this miraculous rescue, Tabby was examined by local animal welfare experts, who determined that she was indeed malnourished but otherwise unharmed. Tabby has since been given proper nourishment and veterinary care, and her health and spirits have improved tremendously. In light of this incredible story, local animal welfare advocates have taken the opportunity to emphasize the importance of checking for small animals in the engine compartments of vehicles, particularly during colder months when they might seek warmth. With Tabby now safe and sound, the community is rallying around her, sharing her incredible story as an example of the resilience and survival instincts of cats. While the car's owner has understandably opted not to adopt Tabby, she is presently being cared for by animal rescue specialists and is soon expected to find a new forever home. In the end, Tabby's extraordinary tale of survival against the odds serves as an example of the importance of compassion and vigilance when it comes to the lives of our furry friends, reminding us that even the smallest or seemingly insignificant creature can teach us powerful and unexpected lessons about survival and hope."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: A 46-year-old Iowa man accused of ambushing and killing two police officers early Wednesday morning has been arrested, authorities say. Officers had been searching for Scott Michael Greene, of Urbandale, who was considered to be armed and dangerous, police told the Des Moines Register. He was arrested in Dallas County, Iowa, about 9:30 a.m. local time, about seven hours after the shootings, KCCI-TV reports. The slain officers have been identified as Urbandale Police Officer Justin Martin and Des Moines Sergeant Anthony “Tony” Beminio. They were killed in two shootings about 20 minutes apart in Urbandale and Des Moines, police say. “It doesn’t look like there was any interaction between these officers and whoever the coward is who shot them while they sat in their cars,” Des Moines Police Sergeant Paul Parizek said at a press conference. The officers’ patrol vehicles were riddled with bullets. Police said in radio dispatches that it is believed a rifle was used in the shootings. Here’s what you need to know: 1. Scott Greene Clashed With Cops Last Month After Being Kicked Out of a Football Game for Flying a Confederate Flag During the National Anthem A man named Scott Greene, who matches the description of the suspect, recorded himself being kicked out of a football game in Urbandale, Iowa, on October 14, 2016. The Urbandale School District confirmed to the Des Moines Register that a man named Scott Greene was removed from the football stadium that day. The stadium is at the same intersection where the Urbandale police officer was killed Wednesday morning, the newspaper reports. Greene also posted a 10-second video featuring only a still photo showing him in the stands of the high school holding American and Confederate flags. You can see that photo above. In the comments of one of the videos, Greene wrote, “I was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem. Thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom. However this is not about the Armed forces, they are cop haters. ” He titled the second video, which you can watch below, “Police Abuse, Civil Rights Violation at Urbandale High School.” “This is an assault on a person exercising his constitution rights on free speech!” he wrote in the description. The 10-minute video shows Greene after he was removed from the stadium, interacting with Des Moines and Urbandale police officers who are trying to get him to leave the area. It begins with officers telling Greene to leave for “committing a disturbance in the stands.” He asks them repeatedly, “Have I committed a crime?” He also accuses an officer of “assaulting” him by “grabbing” him and “shoving” him around.

I was actually assaulted. I would like to report an assault.” The officer then directs him to a public sidewalk off of the high school property. “Someone behind me hit me and they stole, it was almost like a mugging, because I had my property and I was holding it and they stole it from me,” Greene tells an officer. He said he was standing there “holding a flag,” during the National Anthem, when he was attacked by “African-American people” behind him, who took his flag. He tells the police he wants to press charges. An officer tells Greene the flag he was holding, a Confederate flag, is in violation of school code. “You came just to fly the flag and possibly cause a disruption tonight,” an officer says. “You have to understand in the current social climate we’re in, when you fly a Confederate flag standing in front of several African-American people, that’s going to cause a disturbance, whether you intended to or not.” Greene argues that it is his Constitutional right to do so and says he was “peacefully protesting.” 2. Greene Called a Man at His Apartment Complex the ‘N-Word’ & Threatened to Kill Him in 2014, Court Records Show On the scene where an officer was found shot at Merle Hay road and Sheridan dr early Wed. morning. pic.twitter.com/KupgOHWr6O — Brian Powers (@bpowersphoto) November 2, 2016 Greene has been arrested numerous times, online court records show. According to the Des Moines Register, he was convicted of harassment in 2014 after police said he approached a man in the parking lot of his apartment complex, shined a flash light in his eyes and called him the “N-word.” Greene then told the man, “I will kill you, (expletive) kill you,” according to records. He was sentenced to one year of probation. A probation discharge report filed in June 2015 shows that Greene received a mental health evaluation and “complied with the medication recommendations,” according to the newspaper. Greene was convicted of interference with official acts in 2014 after resisting officers’ attempts to pat him down for weapons at the same apartment complex, the Des Moines Register reports. According to the police report, the officers wanted to search Greene after noticing a pouch similar to a holster on his belt. Officer Chris Greenfield wrote that Greene, was “noncompliant, hostile, combative and made furtive movements toward his pockets,” according to the Register. He was also arrested in 2001 and charged with domestic assault, assault causing bodily injury and fourth-degree criminal mischief. He was also charged in 2010 with driving under the influence. The charges in those cases were all later dismissed, according to court records. Other details about the cases were not immediately available. Police were recently called to the home of Patricia Greene, Scott’s mother, for a domestic disturbance, and arrested Patricia after her son said she assaulted him, the Associated Press reports. According to the criminal complaint obtained by the AP, Scott Greene told police his 66-year-old mother yelled at him on October 17, telling him to remove his daughter’s service dog from the house. Scott Greene told police he was wearing his deceased father’s dog tags, and his mother tried to tear them from his neck. Police said Scott Greene grabbed his mother’s hand and she scratched his face. Scott Greene recorded video of the incident and showed it to police, leading to her arrest. She was released after posting 1,000 bail and is due in court later this month, according to the Associated Press. She was also ordered not to have contact with her son. Patricia Greene appears to have been referencing her troubles with her son in a Facebook post Tuesday night, “ “I can’t believe the love and kindness you are all showing me. With friends and relatives like all you guys, how could a girl ever go wrong. Things are looking up but, please don’t stop your prayers. They are still needed.” 3. His Daughter Posted a Photo to Facebook Saying #Scott’sLifeMatters After the Shootings, Saying He Was ‘Very Sick Mentally’ Greene, a father of three originally from Iowa, filed for bankruptcy in 2007, according to federal court records. He lists a daughter and two sons as dependents in the filing. He also says he was working at an office furniture store and previously worked for a boating company. A recent video on his Youtube account indicates he was fired from a job with a fencing company. “First day on the job, 5 ton truck, pulling skid loader on trailer and driving 75mph down a gravel road. I was fired after reporting this to the owner,” he wrote in the caption of the video, which shows him filming as another man drives a truck. He posted the video, which you can watch below, on October 27, but it’s not clear when it was recorded. His daughter, Sammie Greene, posted a photo of Greene to Facebook with #Scott’sLifeMatters after the shooting, sparking angry comments. “He was also a loving father grandfather and the greatest man I know. He was very very sick mentally,” she wrote. “Evil succumbed him and he made the up worst mistake. Now he will have to live with that for the rest of his life. But I will never turn my back on this man.” “This poor man was consumed by the devil himself this morning. I will continue to pray for him. Along with the families of the officers,” she wrote. Scott Greene’s Facebook page does not include any public photos or details about his life. One post from from 2014, about child abuse, is visible: I have been surrounded by stories of sexual abuse toward children and I am fed up with the predators that lurk in our communities. It seems that nearly all of my dear friends, family, ex relationships, and peers have a story in their lives about someone being sexually abused as a child. We need to band together as a society and protect our children by all legal means necessary. We cannot turn a blind eye to these little victims that are now scarred for the rest of their lives. Please join me in exposing this sickness that lives among all of us. Do not be afraid any longer to speak out against child abuse, awareness is the key in keeping our preciuos children safe. Police searched a home where Greene lived in Urbandale after the shooting. At a press conference, officials said he was known to officers.

According to WHO-TV, Greene turned himself in to a police officer from the Iowa Department of Natural Resources without a struggle. He was then taken into custody by the Iowa State Patrol and Dallas County Sheriff. The arrest happened in a rural part of the state, near Redfield, the news station reports. He had been spotted walking on a G Trail, a road in Wiscotta, south of Redfield, police said.

He was taken to the hospital for an unknown reason after the arrest, the Des Moines Register reports. Greene was believed to be driving a blue 2011 Ford F-150 pickup truck with a silver topper (truck bed cover) and a ladder rack, police say. The truck has the license plate 780 YFR, police say. He was described as being about 5 foot 11 inches tall, weighs 180 pounds and has brown hair and green eyes, according to police. 5. The Officers Were Ambushed & Killed in Their Patrol Cars About 2 Miles Apart The first officer, Urbandale Officer Justin Martin, was found dead about 1:06 a.m. when police responded to a report of shots fired in the area of 70th Street and Aurora Avenue in Urbandale, Des Moines Police Sergeant Paul Parizek said in a press release. Responding officers “found an Urbandale Police Department police officer who had been shot.” Martin was “still seated in his vehicle,” Parizek said at a press conference, “and he’d been shot and killed.” Parizek said Des Moines officers were called to assist at that scene. The second officer, Des Moines Sergeant Tony Beminio, was found fatally shot about 1:25 a.m. in the intersection of Merle Hay Road and Sheridan Drive, Des Moines Police said in a statement. Beminio was found by another Des Moines officer who was in the area assisting in the search for a suspect in the Urbandale shooting, Des Moines Sergeant Paul Parizek said at a press conference. Beminio was taken to a local hospital, where he later died, Parizek said. The scene of the second shooting is about two miles away from where the Urbandale officer was killed. Beminio, 38, had been with the Des Moines Police Department since 2005. He was promoted to sergeant last year. Martin, 24, joined the Urbandale Police Department in 2015.

Beminio graduated in 2001 and Martin in 2015. Martin grew up in Rockwell City and was an Eagle Scout. Beminio is the third officer to be killed in the line of duty this year, and the first to die by gunfire, according to the Des Moines Register. Officers Susan Farrell and Carlos Puente-Morales were killed in March when their cruiser was struck head on- in a wrong-way drunken driver, the newspaper reports. “I don’t even know where to begin on how bad this year is,” Sergeant Paul Parizek said at a press conference. But, “This is what we do. We come in day in and day out, we go out there and provide the same level of service regardless of what’s going on in our personal and professional lives.” The Des Moines officer is the first to be shot in the line of duty since two officers were killed in 1977, Parizek said. The Urbandale officer is the first to be fatally shot in the line of duty in the history of the department. Iowa Governor Terry Branstad’s office said in a press release that he had been briefed on the shooting. “An attack on public safety officers is an attack on the public safety of all Iowans. We call on Iowans to support our law enforcement officials in bringing this suspect to justice,” the governor’s office said in a statement. “Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families of the police officers who were tragically killed in the line of duty as well as the officers who continue to put themselves in harm’s way.” The shootings also come in a year when five police officers were killed in Dallas and three officers killed in Baton Rouge in ambush attacks. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded.

A sub-discipline of biology, its focus is in how organisms, organ systems, organs, cells, and biomolecules carry out the chemical or physical functions that exist in a living system. Given the size of the field, it is divided into, among others, animal physiology (including that of humans), plant physiology, cellular physiology, microbial physiology (microbial metabolism), bacterial physiology, and viral physiology. The Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine is awarded to those who make significant achievements in this discipline by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. In medicine, a physiologic state is one occurring from normal body function, rather than pathologically, which is centered on the abnormalities that occur in animal diseases, including humans. - The Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine (JHUSOM), located in Baltimore, Maryland, U.S., is the academic medical teaching and research arm of Johns Hopkins University.

Its major teaching hospital, the Johns Hopkins Hospital, was ranked the #1 hospital in the United States for 22 years by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\". - Nanotechnology (\\"nanotech\\") is manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology. A more generalized description of nanotechnology was subsequently established by the National Nanotechnology Initiative, which defines nanotechnology as the manipulation of matter with at least one dimension sized from 1 to 100 nanometers. This definition reflects the fact that quantum mechanical effects are important at this quantum-realm scale, and so the definition shifted from a particular technological goal to a research category inclusive of all types of research and technologies that deal with the special properties of matter which occur below the given size threshold. It is therefore common to see the plural form \\"nanotechnologies\\" as well as \\"nanoscale technologies\\" to refer to the broad range of research and applications whose common trait is size. Because of the variety of potential applications (including industrial and military), governments have invested billions of dollars in nanotechnology research. Until 2012, through its National Nanotechnology Initiative, the USA has invested 3.7 billion dollars, the European Union has invested 1.2 billion and Japan 750 million dollars. - Aquaporins also called water channels, are integral membrane proteins from a larger family of major intrinsic proteins that form pores in the membrane of biological cells. - Peter Agre (born January 30, 1949) is an American physician and molecular biologist, Bloomberg Distinguished Professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, and director of the Johns Hopkins Malaria Research Institute.

A highly influential theoretical chemist of his time, van 't Hoff was the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry. His pioneering work helped found the modern theory of chemical affinity, chemical equilibrium, chemical kinetics, and chemical thermodynamics. In his 1874 pamphlet Van't Hoff formulated the theory of the tetrahedral carbon atom and laid the foundations of stereochemistry. In 1875 he predicted the correct structures of allenes and cumulenes as well as their axial chirality.

It is also defined as the measure of the tendency of a solution to take in water by osmosis. Potential osmotic pressure is the maximum osmotic pressure that could develop in a solution if it were separated from distilled water by a selectively permeable membrane. The phenomenon of osmosis arises from the propensity of a pure solvent to move through a semi-permeable membrane and into a solution containing a solute to which the membrane is impermeable. This process is of vital importance in biology as the cell's membrane is semipermeable. - The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences or \\"Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien\\" is one of the Royal Academies of Sweden.
