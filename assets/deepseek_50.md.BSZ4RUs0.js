A:","completion":"In the 1956 epic film \\"The Ten Commandments,\\" directed by Cecil B. DeMille, baby Moses was portrayed by Frazer C. Heston. Frazer is the son of the film's leading actor, Charlton Heston, who played the adult Moses. Born in February 1955, Frazer was only about a year old when he appeared in the film. The Ten Commandments is a biblical drama based on the story of the exodus of the Hebrews from slavery in Egypt and the life of Moses, as depicted in the Bible's Book of Exodus. The movie is renowned for its grand cinematography, impressive special effects, and outstanding portrayals by its ensemble cast, which included actors such as Charlton Heston, Anne Baxter, Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo, and John Derek. In the film, baby Moses is set adrift in the Nile River in a basket by his mother Yocheved, fearing for her child's safety due to the Egyptian Pharaoh's order to kill all newborn Hebrew boys. The basket floats along the river and is eventually found by Bithiah, the Pharaoh's sister, played by Nina Foch. Bithiah decides to adopt the baby and raise him as a prince of Egypt, unaware that he is actually a Hebrew child. The scene where baby Moses is found along the riverbank is iconic and is one of the most significant moments of the film. As an adult, Frazer C. Heston followed in his father's footsteps and earned a name for himself in the film industry. He worked as an assistant director, screenwriter, and producer, even producing a TV miniseries called \\"Treasure Island\\" (1990) in which his father, Charlton Heston, starred as Long John Silver. Despite not pursuing acting as his main career, Frazer's appearance as baby Moses in \\"The Ten Commandments\\" remains an interesting trivia fact and testament to his family's legacy in Hollywood."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Who had a horse named Lightning taken away? from the following article ? Sonora Webster lives with her sister and abusive aunt during the Great Depression. She learns that because of her accidentally letting the cows loose and her suspension from school, her treasured horse Lightning has been sold and she will be placed in an orphanage. Instead, Sonora slips out of the house during the night. She ends up at a county fair and sees a performance by Marie, a diving girl who rides a horse off a platform, and aspires to do the same. Doc Carver, Marie's employer, tells her she is too young but gives Sonora a job as a stable hand due to her ability with horses, and she begins traveling with them. Doc's son Al wins a wild horse in a card game and Sonora names him Lightning. She later surprises Doc by taming and riding Lightning, so he promises to train her as a diving girl if she can mount it while it's moving, which she succeeds after multiple attempts. Marie falls and dislocates her shoulder, leaving her unable to perform, and Sonora steps in. Although she has never dived with Lightning, their first jump is successful. Marie becomes jealous, and as Doc tires of her diva-like behavior, she quits rather than share billing with Sonora. Al develops a romance with Sonora that strains his relationship with his father, leaving after a particularly bad fight. Al promises to write to Sonora, but Doc hides his letters. As Doc and the new stable hand Clifford leave the farm in search of work, Lightning falls ill with colic. Al returns, and he and Sonora work together to heal Lightning. Doc fails to find any jobs, but Al announces he has arranged a six-month contract to perform at the Steel Pier in Atlantic City, New Jersey, reconciling father and son. Doc passes away en route from a heart attack, and Al assumes his father's role as show presenter. Sonora searches for Doc's jacket to give Al confidence on his first show, and finds one of Al's letters inside, confessing his love for her, letting him know she feels the same. Answer:","completion":"The answer to the question \\"Who had a horse named Lightning taken away?\\" from the given article is Sonora Webster."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article in one sentence. In particular, there is a sound reason they didn't make it into your future, and that is a lack of compatibility. You can't force the other person to feel the same way. And, if this person hurt you, they're not worthy of you from that point onward. Anything that you contributed or were told contributed to the breakup is water under the bridge. If the person really cared to make a go of things, they'd have been ready to work through any such issues. These things become convenient excuses rather than an accurate assessment of who you are or your self worth. You can certainly learn lessons from mistakes you made but there's no need to beat yourself up over it––learn and improve for the next time. Sometimes the relationship you need to fix /rescue is with yourself, not the person who left you. Even if it wasn't your fault (and seriously, talking about \\"fault\\" is unhelpful in personal relations), you need to take time out to find yourself again and be confident with yourself. Don't start thinking about being friends with your ex right away––if ever. You have to be your own friend first. Grief is a process to go through, not a destination to wallow in. In this process it's a little bit like dancing, putting one foot in front of the other, learning anew; each step you take is a part of your healing. Allow time to unfold and embrace your healing process. Don't be hard on yourself. Your feelings are normal, while suppressing them is not. Let the feelings out as needed, and respect that healing requires the range of emotions, rather than a stiff upper lip. You deserve tender loving care and support. Talk to people who can help you. Talk to friends, family, or even close co-workers. Most have probably gone through the same thing and can help. Express your feelings. Sometimes you need to express your feelings of anger, pain, sadness and grief. Don't be shy to cry or talk about the way you feel about the situation. Take your dog for a walk, go see your far away relatives, go take a tour of the White House, go shopping. Do things you love that will keep you busy so you don't have time to think of the person who hurt you. Rearrange your furniture. Especially if you had an intimate relationship, rearrange your bedroom. Wash your sheets, get a new couch. You'll be distracted by moving everything, and when it's all done, your house will look fresh, and it won't look the same as when the person who hurt you was there. Listen to good breakup songs. For example: Picture to Burn-Taylor Swift, I Will Survive-Gloria Gaynor. Go to the spa, indulge in a new purchase, indulge once or twice to remember you're still important and you don't need a that person, you're doing fine by yourself. Flirting and partying are a good way to help you get off your feet, meet some new people, have a good time at the party/club, and getting ready are all fun ways to help keep you distracted. It is vital to put the pain away and move on with your life and love. It might be hard but it's worth it. Otherwise, you are giving away your power to the people who hurt you.

The Triassic was named in 1834 by Friedrich von Alberti, after the three distinct rock layers (\\"tri\\" meaning \\"three\\") that are found throughout Germany and northwestern Europered beds, capped by marine limestone, followed by a series of terrestrial mud- and sandstonescalled the \\"Trias\\". - Huso is a genus of large sturgeons from Eurasia.

Both sturgeons and paddlefish have been referred to as \\"primitive fishes\\" because their morphological characteristics have remained relatively unchanged since the earliest fossil record. Sturgeons are native to subtropical, temperate and sub-Arctic rivers, lakes and coastlines of Eurasia and North America. Sturgeons are long-lived, late-maturing fishes with distinctive characteristics, such as a heterocercal caudal fin similar to that of sharks, and an elongated spindle-like body that is smooth-skinned, scaleless and armored with 5 lateral rows of bony plates called scutes. Several species can grow quite large, typically ranging 712 feet (2-3 m) in length. The largest sturgeon on record was a Beluga female captured in the Volga estuary in 1827, weighing and long. Most sturgeons are anadromous bottom-feeders which migrate upstream to spawn but spend most of their lives feeding in river deltas and estuaries.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Ukip suspends general secretary over ‘candidate selection allegations’ The UK Independence party has suspended its general secretary in relation to alleged “impropriety” over candidate selection, even though he was selected to run for the party in a London consitutency less than two weeks ago. Roger Bird, who has been a senior Ukip official since July, said told the Guardian he could not discuss an “ongoing process” but there were no criminal allegations involved. In a statement, Ukip said: “Shortly after a claim came to light about the conduct of Mr Bird with regard to candidate selection, the UK Independence party took action swiftly and decisively, including steps involving external human resources consultants, as well as following due process and the party’s constitution to the letter. “Unfortunately, Ukip has had to suspend Mr Bird pending a full investigation into allegations made against him. The party has acted swiftly and decisively and will not tolerate impropriety of any kind amongst its staff.” In the absence of explanation, it is unclear whether the allegations related to his time as party secretary, his previous role as chairman of Ukip presiding over selections in the south-east of England, or his recent selection as a candidate for the seat of Cities of London and Westminster. It was initially thought Bird was the general election candidate in Mole Valley in Surrey, but the local branch chairman confirmed to the Guardian that he had resigned from that position last year and was selected for the London seat currently held by Tory MP Mark Field in late November. The party has recently been under scrutiny over the way some local candidates have been deselected potentially to make way for bigger names. Bird was involved in at least one of these controversies, as he told the Portsmouth News that the removal of Douglas Denny in Portsmouth South was a “routine event”. However, the senior official’s suspension is not thought to be related to this row. Bird’s LinkedIn page says he has been general secretary of the party since July 2014 and was previously a finance director and auditor. Summary:","completion":"UK Independence Party has suspended its general secretary, Roger Bird, because of some problems with how candidates were chosen for the party.

Figure below shows a pond covered with algae. Algae may use up so much oxygen in the water that nothing else can grow. Soon, even the algae die out. Decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico. You can see it Figure below . Please answer this question : Which pond will the family most likely catch more fish, Ridge Pond or Happy Pond? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the family will most likely catch more fish at Ridge Pond. This is because Happy Pond has a green coating across the top of it, which could be algae caused by excessive nitrogen from the nearby mushroom farm. This can lead to low oxygen levels and dead zones, making it difficult for fish to survive. Ridge Pond, on the other hand, is located in the center of the park and there is no mention of any potential issues with algae or dead zones, making it a better choice for fishing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A veteran politician and industrialist, he previously served as the Prime Minister from November 1990 to July 1993 and from February 1997 to October 1999. Sharif is the president of Pakistan Muslim League (N), which holds a parliamentary majority since 2013. - The Directorate General for Inter-Services Intelligence or Inter-Services Intelligence (abbreviated ISI) is the premier intelligence service of Pakistan, operationally responsible for providing critical national security and intelligence assessment to the Government of Pakistan. The ISI is the largest of the five intelligence services of Pakistan, the others being the Intelligence Bureau (IB), Military Intelligence (MI), Naval Intelligence (NI) and Air Intelligence (AI). In the late 20th century, the ISI's work and activities in relation to Afghan mujahideen against the Soviet Union during the SovietAfghan War in then-communist Afghanistan became quite famous. During this war, ISI worked in close coordination with the Central Intelligence Agency. The latter provided strategic support and intelligence to the Afghan Taliban against the Northern Alliance in the civil war in Afghanistan in the 1990s. - The Prime Minister of Pakistan ( , ; lit. \\"Grand Vizier\\"), is the head of government of Pakistan and designated as the \\"chief executive of the Republic\\".

The first Pakistan Muslim League was founded by President Ayub Khan in 1962 as a successor to the original Muslim League. Just a short period after its foundation, the party broke into two factions: Convention Muslim League that supported the President and the new Constitution, and the Council Muslim League, that opposed the new Constitution, denouncing it as undemocratic that made the Presidency an autocratic position. The CML itself broke down into several parties following the 1965 Elections such as: Muslim League (Qayyum) and Pakistan Muslim League (F). - The Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (or \\"IJI\\") English lit.

Title: Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life Movie plot: The film begins on Santorini island, Greece, during a wedding when it is interrupted by an earthquake. The earthquake uncovers the Luna Temple, built by Alexander the Great to house his most prized treasures. Among these treasures is a glowing orb with a pattern resembling a code etched into it. Lara finds this orb, as well as a strange medallion; but both are stolen by the crime lord Chen Lo (Simon Yam). Lara (Angelina Jolie) only just manages to escape as a subsequent earthquake causes the Luna Temple to collapse, while her two companions are killed by Chen's men. Lara is tasked by MI6 to find Pandora's Box, an object from ancient legends that supposedly contains a deadly plague, before Nobel Prize-winning scientist turned bio-terrorist Jonathan Reiss (Ciarán Hinds) can get his hands on it. The key to finding the box, which is hidden in the mysterious Cradle of Life, is a magical luminous sphere that serves as a map, the one stolen by Chen Lo in Santorini, who plans to sell the sphere to Reiss. To help her track down Chen Lo and the ball, Lara recruits an old lover, Terry Sheridan (Gerard Butler), a former mercenary and Royal Marine, who was in prison in the Republic of Kazakhstan.Among the action sequences that take place during this time are Lara and Terry's entry into China, a fight scene in suburban Shanghai, and a leap off the then-under-construction International Finance Centre skyscraper in Hong Kong, using special winged flight-suits that Terry had arranged for, landing on a ship out in the Kowloon Bay after taking the Orb from Reiss.

Summarize the following: The tongue's unique texture and large surface area makes it host to millions of bacteria, which can travel to the teeth and gums and cause cavities and gingivitis. The teeth gather plenty of bacteria themselves, but unlike the teeth, the tongue is not a smooth surface. It follows that even more bacteria accumulate in the taste-buds and small pits on the tongue. Just rinsing the mouth with water is insufficient to remove the bacteria on the tongue, primarily because the bacteria gather in what is called a \\"biofilm\\"-- a sticky, gooey, living layer of bacteria. It must be disrupted by rubbing or scraping to fully remove it. The bacteria that live on the tongue cause a chemical reaction that produces volatile sulfur compounds, which results in bad breath. Tongue brushing can also remove traces of odorous foods like garlic and onions, which can also improve your breath. Many people with bad breath are not aware that they have it. Its a good idea to practice good oral hygiene, including regularly cleaning the tongue, in order to reduce the chance that you are one of them. Certain foods and health conditions can cause a colored or filmy appearance on the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can eliminate this problem. Foods containing dyes like cupcakes, lollipops, or popsicles can temporarily dye the surface of the tongue. Brushing the tongue can reduce the coloration of the tongue, making it less noticeable to others. Some illnesses like oral thrush or syphilis can cause a buildup of bacteria or fungi on the tongue that cause a filmy, white appearance. In some cases, the white film cannot be brushed off. Be sure that you see your doctor if you suspect that your filmy tongue is caused by an illness. Certain medications like antibiotics or Pepto-Bismol as well as certain illnesses can also cause a startling discoloration of the tongue called \\"black hairy tongue,\\" which is caused by an overgrowth of yeast in the mouth. The condition is not serious and the discoloration can be brushed off with a toothbrush or washcloth, although it might be a good idea to see your doctor to determine the cause.","completion":"The tongue's texture and large surface area allow it to host millions of bacteria, which can cause cavities, gingivitis, and bad breath.

With a deadline of the end of October set by the BRDC to save the prestigious race, all eyes are focused on the potential agreements and the consequences of losing this historic event from the F1 calendar. Taking place at Silverstone, a world-renowned racetrack and cornerstone of the sport, the British Grand Prix has a storied history and a special place in the hearts of the many fans, teams, and drivers who have experienced its challenges and triumphs over the years. The circuit has been on the provisional Formula 1 calendar for decades, but recent developments and negotiations regarding staging rights have left the iconic race in a precarious position. The BRDC, as the leading force behind the organization and management of the British Grand Prix, has taken on the responsibility of negotiating with Ecclestone. Although the BRDC has occasionally met with resistance and dissatisfaction, expressing concerns about the escalating financial demands and logistical requirements necessary for hosting the race, they remain steadfast in their determination to find a workable solution. Ecclestone, known for his shrewd business acumen, is not one to make things easy. He has presented various options to the BRDC, including proposals that aim to share the burden of costs across multiple parties. These include partnering with other circuits, investors, and even the British government. However, the complex structure and legal aspects of these proposals require careful consideration and collaboration. Each party involved must fully understand the stakes and financial implications before reaching a definitive agreement. The potential loss of the British Grand Prix from the F1 calendar would not only be a heavy blow to Britain's motorsport heritage, but it would also have a significant effect on the international appeal and momentum of the sport as a whole. Silverstone has long been a hub for innovation and engineering excellence, attracting global attention and fanfare. Should the negotiation process fail to produce a satisfactory financial and logistical arrangement, the ripple effects would be felt both domestically and internationally. As the October deadline approaches, all parties involved are undoubtedly feeling the weight of responsibility to protect and preserve this iconic race for the benefit of fans, teams, and drivers alike. The British Grand Prix has long been synonymous with excitement, passion, and pride, and it deserves its place on the F1 calendar as a testament to the enduring spirit and skill of British racing talent. Only time will tell if the BRDC, led by president Derek Warwick, and Ecclestone can reach a mutually beneficial agreement. The motorsport community waits with bated breath, hoping that their shared love for the sport and the British Grand Prix will rise above any financial constraints. While the negotiations continue, one thing is certain: the British Grand Prix represents a vital part of the motorsport story and losing it would leave an indelible mark on Formula 1 history."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It helps unfold the clothing after washing, eliminating wrinkles. The more you can prevent the clothing from bunching up, the easier it is to dry. If you live in a sunny area, turn dark shirts and jeans inside out. Your clothing will still fade over time, but this slows the process. Also, if you hang dark clothing in direct sunlight, move it out of the light as soon as it finishes drying. White clothing is okay to leave out. The sun brightens it. Starting with the larger items is recommended since these take up the most space and dry slower. These large items should be folded in half first. Bring the folded end up, draping it slightly over the clothesline. Pin the corner, then move across the line to pin the middle and other corner. Keep the top of the sheet flat and straight against the clothesline. Do this with every article you hang to prevent wrinkles. Unfold the towels, then bring them to the clothesline. Drape 1 end slightly over the clothesline. Pin both corners to hold the towel in place. Hang the towel vertically and unfolded so it dries faster. To save on clothespins, hang the towels next to one another and clip the ends with the same pin. Bring the bottom hem up to the line. Clip 1 corner, then stretch the hem out over the clothesline and clip the other corner. The hem should be straight and flat against the line so the shirt doesn’t sag at all. Let the shirt’s heavier end dangle to encourage drying. Another way to hang shirts is with hangers. Slide the clothing onto the hangers, then hook the hangers onto the clothesline. Fold the pants in half, pressing the legs together. Hold the bottom hems against the clothesline and pin them in place. If you have 2 clotheslines side by side, separate the legs and pin 1 to each line. It will reduce the drying time even further. The waist end is heavier, so it’s better to let it hang lower. However, you can hang the pants by the waist hem if you wish. Keep your socks paired together to save on space. Set the socks side by side with the toe end curled over the line. Place a single clothespin between the socks, fastening both in place. Repeat this with any other pairs of socks that need drying. For items like baby pants, small towels, and underwear, hang them like you would with a towel. Stretch them out on the line so they don’t sag. Clamp the clothespins on both corners. Hopefully, you have enough extra space to stretch these items out on the line. If you’re short on space, try to find spots between the other articles and fit them there.

Answer this question: where does spring water found in mountains come from??","completion":"To answer the question, I will gather relevant information about sources of spring water, and specifically focus on those found in mountains. I will then synthesize this information to provide a clear and accurate answer. Step 1: Understanding spring water Spring water comes from underground sources that flow naturally to the Earth's surface. It is typically characterized by its purity, consistent mineral content, and lack of pollutants. Step 2: Identifying sources of mountain spring water In the case of mountain springs, the water primarily comes from two sources: precipitation (such as rain or snow) and melting snow and ice. Step 3: Analyzing precipitation When rain or snow falls on a mountain, it seeps into the ground where it becomes part of the underlying rock layers and soil. The water then travels through these layers, getting filtered and purified in the process, and eventually reaches a point in the mountain where it can flow out as a spring. Step 4: Analyzing melting snow and ice Similarly, melting snow and ice from higher elevations of the mountain may also contribute to the spring water flow. As the snow and ice melt, the water flows downward and seeps into the ground. Just like precipitation, this water also goes through the process of filtering and purification as it moves through rock layers and soil. The melting water eventually joins with other underground water sources and emerges as a spring lower down the mountain. Step 5: Drawing conclusions In conclusion, spring water found in mountains primarily comes from precipitation and melting snow and ice. The water seeps into the ground and gets filtered and purified as it moves through rock layers and soil before eventually emerging as a spring. This process ensures the purity and consistent mineral content of the mountain spring water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

This will ensure that the frosting doesn't melt and retains its proper texture. Step 2: Placing the torte on a plate or stand - Carefully place the chocolate toffee torte on a serving plate or cake stand. You can add a little bit of frosting on the center of the plate to keep the torte in place while you work on it. Step 3: Applying the frosting - Scoop a generous amount of frosting onto the top of the chocolate toffee torte using a butter knife or an offset spatula. - Starting from the center of the torte, spread the frosting evenly outwards with gentle strokes, turning the stand/plate as needed. Avoid too much pressure, as it might tear or damage the torte. - If additional frosting is needed, scoop more onto the spatula and continue spreading until the entire top surface is covered with an even layer of frosting. Step 4: Frosting the sides - Apply more frosting to the sides of the torte, starting at the bottom and working your way up. You should apply enough frosting to fully cover the sides, with the spatula held perpendicular to the torte. - Once the frosting has been applied to the sides, smooth it out by running the spatula around the torte, removing excess frosting as you go. Step 5: Optional decorations - If you want to add some decorations to your chocolate toffee torte, you can do so by using the back of a spoon, a piping bag with a decorative tip, or even just your spatula to create swirls, lines, or other patterns in the frosting. - Add crushed toffee or chocolate shavings on top of the frosting for an added touch of flavor and texture. Step 6: Serve and enjoy - Once the frosting is smoothly and evenly applied, and any desired decorations are added, the creamy chocolate toffee torte is ready to be served. - Cut the torte into slices using a sharp, clean knife, and enjoy your delicious creation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Ironically, J. Paul Getty never saw the Getty Villa. He died two years after his museum opened to the public in January 1974 in a new building modeled on an ancient Roman luxury home. It was not until after Getty’s death in June 1976 that he returned from his estate in England to his “ranch” on the Pacific Coast: he is buried there at the edge of the property on a private plot overlooking the ocean, alongside his eldest and youngest sons, George and Timothy, both of whom predeceased him. Following a renovation and reinstallation of the galleries, the Getty Villa opens a new chapter in its history. Although Getty never set eyes on his creation, the story of how he built the Villa and assembled his collection pervades the galleries even today. A suite of revamped rooms—Galleries 105 to 108—share this history. Featuring ancient works of art Getty bought himself along with archival documents, the new displays place the objects in their cultural contexts and shed light on Getty’s personal relationship to his museum and final resting place. From a Ranch House to an Ancient Villa Getty bought the 64-acre ranch—once part of the Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, an early-nineteenth-century 6,656-acre Mexican land grant—just after the end of World War II, intending it as a weekend retreat where his fifth wife Theodora (“Teddy”) could ride horses and he could display his growing art collection. He knew the area well, for he already owned a small house on the beach in nearby Santa Monica, just steps from the sprawling complex his friend and rival collector William Randolph Hearst had built for the actress Marion Davies. (The Davies estate is now the Annenberg Community Beach House, while Getty’s beach house has been replaced by a large modern condo complex, 270 Palisades Beach Road.)

Firstly, we can tell you that the lives of your relatives could depend on your ability to give first aid. If you think highly of human's life, this website is for you! Here you can find information about first aid. The very first thing that you should do when you see an accident is to _ the situation and prevent further dangerous incidents. First of all, you have to recognize what has happened and what the dangers to rescuers and victims are. Think about how to take care of the victims. Helping usually takes place in very difficult conditions and injuries can be very bad. Therefore, you cannot be too afraid of making mistakes to help. Sometimes you have to face the fact that regardless of your actions and your efforts the victim's condition might not improve--he or she could even die. In some cases even professional medical aid may not succeed. If you have done everything you think you should do, you shouldn't feel guilty. Do not expose yourself to danger. Giving first aid can be dangerous. While trying to help a victim, do not forget about your own safety. If something happens to you, you won't be able to help anyone. Call for help after you find out the condition of a victim. But remember if a victim faints due to breathing failure caused by drowning, choking or poisoning, you should first take actions that help to bring back the heart beat and breathing. While calling, talk shortly but clearly.

No longer live 3. Dies 4. Fine 5. Feeling of guilt Step 3: Evaluate each option in relation to the question Option 1 (\\"being imprisoned\\") refers to the act of being confined to jail or prison as a result of committing a crime. This can be seen as a legal consequence of killing and seems like a plausible answer. Option 2 (\\"no longer live\\") is ambiguous. If it refers to the person who committed the killing, it could be interpreted as death as a consequence of capital punishment in some jurisdictions. However, without clarification, it is not a precise answer to the question. Option 3 (\\"dies\\") is also ambiguous and may refer to either the victim or the perpetrator; but without context, it does not provide a clear answer about legal consequences. Option 4 (\\"fine\\") implies a monetary penalty, which is generally not associated with the legal consequence of killing since it is a severe crime and would typically have more substantial consequences. This is not a likely answer to the question. Option 5 (\\"feeling of guilt\\") is not a legal consequence but rather an emotional experience that may accompany the act of killing. Thus, this option does not answer the question. Step 4: Choose the most appropriate answer Given the analysis and evaluation of the options, I can confidently conclude that \\"being imprisoned\\" is the most appropriate answer to the question. This is because it accurately reflects the legal consequence of killing, as it involves being incarcerated and deprived of freedom as a result of committing the crime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Comparing the two sentences, we can see that the actions and characters involved are different, even though there is some similarity in the structure of the sentences: - In Sentence 1, either Aaron or Adam is telling Holly about an attempted kiss involving the two of them, and Holly does not believe this. - In Sentence 2, Adam is telling Aaron about an event where Holly tried to kiss Aaron, but Holly does not believe this when Adam tells her. These differences lead to the conclusion that the two sentences are not the same in meaning, so the correct answer is (a). No."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Michael Bernard Bloomfield (July 28, 1943 - February 15, 1981) was an American guitarist and composer, born in Chicago, Illinois, who became one of the first popular music superstars of the 1960s to earn his reputation almost entirely on his instrumental prowess, since he rarely sang before 1969. Respected for his guitar playing, Bloomfield knew and played with many of Chicago's blues legends before achieving his own fame and was instrumental in popularizing blues music in the mid-1960s. He was ranked number 22 on Rolling Stone's list of \\"100 Greatest Guitarists of All Time\\" in 2003 and number 42 by the same magazine in 2011. He was inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 2012 and, as a member of the Paul Butterfield Blues Band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2015. Bloomfield also made an impact through his work with Al Kooper, who had played with Bloomfield on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Kooper had become an A&R man for Columbia Records, and Bloomfield and Kooper had played piano on Moby Grape's 1968 Grape Jam, an instrumental album that had been packaged with the group's Wow collection. \\"Why not do an entire jam album together?\\" Kooper remembered in 1998, writing the booklet notes for the Bloomfield anthology Don't Say That I Ain't Your Man: Essential Blues, 1964-1969. \\"At the time, most jazz albums were made using this modus operandi: pick a leader or two co-leaders, hire appropriate sidemen, pick some tunes, make some up and record an entire album on the fly in one or two days. Why not try and legitimize rock by adhering to these standards? In addition, as a fan, I was dissatisfied with Bloomfield's recorded studio output up until then. It seemed that his studio work was inhibited and reined in, compared to his incendiary live performances. Could I put him in a studio setting where he could feel free to just burn like he did in live performances?\\" The result was Super Session, a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield's guitar skills on one side. Bloomfield, who suffered from insomnia, left the sessions after the first day. Guitarist Stephen Stills completed the album with Kooper. It received excellent reviews and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield's career. Its success led to a live sequel, The Live Adventures of Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper, recorded over three nights at Fillmore West in September 1968. all they did was play piano together? (mike and al)","completion":"\\"No, Mike Bloomfield and Al Kooper did not only play piano together. Their collaboration began with playing on Dylan's \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\". Later, when Kooper became an A&R man for Columbia Records, they both played piano on Moby Grape's 1968 Grape Jam, an instrumental album. Yet, their collaboration extended further than just playing piano. Kooper proposed to Bloomfield to make an entire jam album together. This resulted in Super Session, a jam album that spotlighted Bloomfield's guitar skills on one side and became the best-selling album of Bloomfield's career.\\""},{"prompt":"Question: Build a movie plot around this: What does Ludo summon to save Darah from falling into the bog?

Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family. He died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound after being shot and chased by two residents as he was leaving the church.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Can dogs help with OCD? You might watch and laugh when your dog chases its tail because it looks cute. But did you know that, even though it might appear like a fun game, it could mean your pet is sick? Researchers have found that if a dog runs after its tail, chases cars and barks at flies that are not there, it may have obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD, ). In fact, OCD is even more common among humans. The symptoms are varied: some people check and recheck the locks before they go out; others are extremely afraid of germs and have to wash their hands many times a day. English soccer star David Beckham, for example, cannot stand odd numbers of items in his fridge. So if he has three cans of drink he will throw one out, according to his wife Victoria. Hoping to better understand OCD in humans, a team of scientists from the University of Helsinki, Finland, studied 368 dogs, including those that chase their tail for several hours daily or a few times a month, according to Sciencedaily.com. They also examined dogs that had never chased their tails. Scientists took the dogs' blood sample and asked their owners some questions about their pets' daily life. Findings showed that among all kinds of dogs, bull terriers and German shepherds were likely to chase their tails, which led scientists to believe that genes can cause OCD. Diet also plays a part. It was found that dogs that eat food with certain vitamins and minerals chased their tails less. \\"Interestingly, there are indications that vitamins and minerals are helpful in human OCD treatment,\\" said researcher Katriina Tiira. Moreover, tail-chasing is often found among dogs that were separated from their mothers too early or ones that didn't receive enough care. They are also more likely to turn out to be shyer and more afraid of loud noises at a young age. The study can help us understand the causes of OCD in humans. \\"Dogs share the same environment with humans, and large animals are physiologically close to humans,\\" said Hannes Lohi, leader...

Input: I wanted to give these soy crisps more justice than just the 5 stars (and ordering them all the time). I bought a bag of these Sea Salt flavor crisps and a bag of BBQ crisps about a month ago, in a bid to eat more healthy food. I've always loved BBQ chips, especially Ruffles and Lays K.C. Masterpiece chips, but they've got to be killing me slowly, right? So I busted open the BBQ soy crisps and gagged. How could this be BBQ? They tasted like cardboard, and I gave them to my friends who will eat anything. I begrudgingly opened the Sea Salt bag, and though more palatable, I was still disappointed. (I know...\\"I thought you said 5 stars.\\" It gets better.) Anyway, I had sworn off chips and midday snacking, so for two weeks I saw nothing on the counter but Genisoy Soy Crisps. I'd eat two or three here and there, and when I ran out, I bought 2 bags of the Sea Salt flavor again. What happened must be akin to rebooting your computer or defragging your hard drive--my body forgot what those strong BBQ flavored chips were like, and I started craving Soy Crisps. I began to taste a delicious roasted soybean flavor, like those roasted and salted soy beans they sell in jars, which I had completely missed before, apparently because it wasn't a sweet, red-crusted, overbearing BBQ powder. I polished the next bags off in three days. Now, I'm ordering 12 here on Amazon (1 cheaper per bag than my local grocery store which seems to want to punish my wallet for trying to eat healthy food). My advice is this--give these soy crisps a chance, but don't mix them in with your regular Doritos and BBQ Ruffles or you'll think they're awful. Stop eating, for a month, the oily BBQ chips that have deadened your taste buds for years and reboot your taste buds with these markedly healthier chips. You'll feel better about snacking!

Kennedy to enter the White House with no executive experience, Mr Obama's background offers few clues. His first priority is likely to be the economy. Mr Obama will inherit a 500 billion budget deficit from President George W. Bush and will be under pressure to reduce this in the longer term. But he is in the fortunate position of having what amounts to a blank cheque of between 150 million and 500 billion – at least equivalent to what the United States spent on this Iraq war this year – to spend in the early months of his presidency. The money has already been authorised in last month's 700 billion financial rescue package and will enable Mr Obama to fulfil a number of expensive campaign promises without raising taxes. But he is likely to face calls from budget officials to abandon his promise to keep most of Mr Bush's tax cuts after they are due to expire in 2010, which will cost about 100 billion. Another problem will be an emboldened Nancy Pelosi, Speaker of the House of Representatives, a liberal Democrat who has an increased majority. She has already talked of an additional two or three economic stimulus packages, which would come with heavy price tags. One of the most expensive items on Mr Obama's policy agenda is a pledge to work towards achieving \\"quality, affordable and portable health coverage for all\\", which is likely to cost up to 65 billion. Many of his advisers will counsel caution, pointing to the example of President Bill Clinton, who gave his wife Hillary the task of achieving universal health care, which collapsed after being rejected by Congress. That failure triggered to the 1994 \\"Republican revolution\\" that swept Democrats from control in Capitol Hill and gave Republicans control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. Trade union bosses, who organised massive voter turnout operations that helped elect Mr Obama, will push the new president push for new measures to make it much easier for them to recruit members, a move which could alienate industry leaders. As well as the economic priorities, which Mr Obama has already announced he will begin to tackle on Friday with a meeting of his advisers in Chicago on Friday followed by a press conference, there will be pressing foreign policy concerns. A centrepiece of Mr Obama's campaign was the vow to begin bringing back American troops from Iraq and transfer many of them to Afghanistan. Military commanders are very reluctant to commit themselves to fixed timetables but Mr Obama has made clear he will establish a withdrawal strategy that they will have to enact. Some foreign leaders are likely to want to test Mr Obama early on. President Dmitry Medvedev of Russia has already warned that he will station short-range missiles near Poland and within striking distance of Nato countries if Mr Obama does not abandon plans for a missile defence shield. Mr Obama himself has already tried to dampen down expectations. In his victory speech on Tuesday, he said: \\"We may not get there in one year or even one term but, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.\\"","completion":"\\"President Obama's Challenges: Economy, Taxes, and Foreign Policy\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose the earth is an unusually hot period happens, how will it affect food is digested in stomach. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect The answer is:","completion":"B: less During an unusually hot period on Earth, the digestion of food in the stomach may be affected in several ways. The process of digestion involves multiple organs and enzymes, all of which can be influenced by temperature changes. The effects of increased temperatures on the planet can result in alterations to these digestive processes and potentially lead to less efficient digestion. 1. Impact on enzyme function: Digestive enzymes, such as trypsin and chymotrypsin mentioned in the process, have optimal temperature ranges at which they function most efficiently. If the temperature rises beyond this optimal range, the enzymes may lose their shape or become denatured, diminishing their ability to aid in digestion. This would result in less efficient digestion of food. 2. Organ function: The pancreas, an essential organ in the digestive process, may also be affected by high temperatures. Increased body temperature can lead to heat stress in the pancreas, impairing its ability to produce the digestive enzymes and hormones like insulin. This may disrupt the normal function of the pancreas and could potentially contribute to less efficient digestion of food. 3. Altered eating habits: Hot periods often lead to changes in eating habits, with people reducing their food intake or consuming lighter, more easily digestible meals. This may result in fewer and smaller food particles reaching the stomach, which in turn may contribute to the reduced efficiency of the digestive process. Additionally, changes in the types of food consumed can influence the activity of the stomach's enzymes, which could further impact digestion. 4. Dehydration: During hot periods, the risk of dehydration increases, which can lead to a reduced amount of available fluids for proper digestion. Adequate fluids are essential to maintain gastric secretions and for the absorption of nutrients. A reduction in gastric fluids can hinder the digestive process and result in less efficient digestion. In conclusion, during an unusually hot period on Earth, several factors may contribute to less efficient digestion of food in the stomach. Increased temperatures can impact enzyme function, organ function, alter eating habits, and increase the risk of dehydration, all of which can negatively affect the digestion process. As a result, option B: \\"less\\" is the most accurate answer to how an unusually hot period will affect food digestion in the stomach."},{"prompt":"Question: - The human body takes a breath inward - Air is transported to the lungs - Air reaches the alveoli, the smallest air sacs in the lungs - In the alveoli, air passes into the blood within small capillaries - The gaseous oxygen in the air dissolves into the capillary blood - The dissolved oxygen is picked-up by red blood cells - The red blood cells bind the oxygen via a protein called heme - Red blood cells circulate throughout the body and reach the various tissues - Within small capillaries, the heme release the oxygen What might be the last step of the process?

Write an article based on this \\"Government cuts have disproportionately affected disadvantaged children, a cross-party committee of MPs has said.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Disadvantaged Children Hit Hardest by Government Cuts, Cross-Party Committee of MPs Claims Introduction: A cross-party committee of Members of Parliament (MPs) has expressed concern over the recent government's cuts, stating that they disproportionately affect disadvantaged children. As public spending continues to shrink and many essential services are reduced, the MPs emphasized the importance of addressing the issue, highlighting the potential long-term consequences on the country’s future. This article examines the impact of these government cuts on disadvantaged children and explores the government's response and potential solutions. Background: The economic downturn and global financial crisis of 2008 forced many governments worldwide to impose austerity measures and reduce public spending. In the years that followed, the UK government implemented significant cuts to various sectors, including education, healthcare, and social services. One consequence of these cuts has been an increasing divide between the rich and poor, with the most vulnerable often bearing the brunt of the budget reductions. Impact of Government Cuts on Disadvantaged Children: The cross-party committee of MPs points out that recent government cuts have disproportionately affected disadvantaged children. Several areas have been impacted, including: 1. Education: Funding reductions for schools have meant that the most underprivileged students have been hit the hardest, as they are often reliant on additional support and resources. Furthermore, extra-curricular activities are often the first to face cuts, depriving these children of essential opportunities for personal and social development. 2. Healthcare: Budget constraints within the National Health Service (NHS) have led to the reduction of services essential for disadvantaged children, including mental health support and early intervention services. As a result, those children who need the support the most are often left unable to access appropriate care when needed. 3. Social Services: Cuts in social services budgets have led to the closure of many essential facilities, such as youth centers and family support services that serve as a lifeline for vulnerable families. These closures contribute to the marginalization and isolation of disadvantaged children and their families, further exacerbating their difficulties. 4. Welfare Benefits: Reductions in welfare benefits have put significant financial strain on low-income families, forcing many to make difficult decisions regarding essentials such as food, housing, and heating. This economic insecurity not only impacts the well-being of disadvantaged children but also affects their ability to engage in educational and recreational activities. Government's Response: Facing growing concerns about the impact of these cuts on disadvantaged children, the government has made efforts to address the issue. In recent years, initiatives such as the Pupil Premium, free school meals for disadvantaged children, and mental health support in schools have been introduced. However, critics argue that these measures are insufficient considering the scale of the issue, and more needs to be done to protect the most vulnerable children in society. Potential Solutions: There are several steps the government could take to mitigate the impact of cuts on disadvantaged children: 1. Targeted funding: Allocate additional resources specifically for supporting disadvantaged children, ensuring that schools, healthcare providers, and social services can afford to provide essential services. 2. Early intervention: Invest in early intervention programs, including parenting classes, preschool education, and early-years mental health services. These programs can help to address underlying issues before they escalate, reducing long-term costs and providing better outcomes for children. 3. Collaboration: Encourage collaboration between schools, healthcare providers, and social services to facilitate more seamless support for children and families in need. This would allow for a more holistic approach, improving both the efficiency and effectiveness of service delivery. 4. Raising awareness: Launch public awareness campaigns highlighting the importance of supporting disadvantaged children and families and the long-term benefits to society. Conclusion: The cross-party committee of MPs has drawn attention to the significant impact of government cuts on disadvantaged children. In addressing this issue, it is essential for the government to prioritize targeted funding, early intervention, collaboration, and raising public awareness. Ignoring the needs of these vulnerable children will have long-lasting consequences for the country's future, and the government must act now to ensure that everyone has a chance to succeed."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In court on Friday, Oneal Ron Morris appeared in court to ask a judge to lower her bond so she could remain free while awaiting trial in seven separate cases, the South Florida Sun Sentinel reported. The paper said Morris told the judge she could not afford to pay the 40,000 bond and would have to remain in jail. She has been behind bars for more than a year, having served a sentence for related charges in Miami Dade County before being taken into custody in Broward jail, to await trial. “I’m not a danger to society,” the paper quoted Morris as saying. “This whole experience has taught me a lot about how people will try to destroy my life. I just want to put it behind me.” Morris is accused of masquerading as a doctor and illegally injecting a concoction of cement, caulk, flat-tire sealant, mineral oil and glue into her patients’ bottoms.

Derek felt warm as he stood in the sun, and since his body was heating up, he knew that his blood vessels in his skin were expanding or contracting? A:","completion":"Since Derek felt warm as he stood in the sun, and his body was heating up, his blood vessels in his skin were expanding. This process is known as vasodilation. Step 1: Identify the situation - Derek standing in the sun feeling warm. Step 2: Understand the body's reaction to increased temperature - The brain senses a rise in body temperature. Step 3: Determine the response - The brain sends messages to the blood vessels in the skin. Step 4: Consider the effect on blood vessels - The messages cause the blood vessels to change diameter. Step 5: Conclude the action - In response to increased body temperature, blood vessels in the skin expand (vasodilation) to help dissipate heat and cool down the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: A little forethought can go a long way towards keeping your fish healthy and your aquarium fun to maintain. Do a little research on what kind of fish you want, (described in further detail later in this article) and then select a tank that will accommodate them. The tank you choose needs to be large enough to hold enough water for the type and number of fish you plan to have. Different fish need different amounts of room and produce different amounts of waste. In general, the larger the fish are, the more waste they make and the more water is needed. Keep in mind that live plants and other decorations will also take up space. There exist various calculators to help you decide what fish are safe to keep based on tank size, compatibility, and needs. The one-inch per gallon rule you may have heard is a rule of thumb that scales quite poorly to smaller or larger tanks. You would never keep two five-inch fish in a 10 gallon (37.9 L) aquarium! A 55 gallon (208.2 L) tank is a standard size that will allow you to have a variety of fish. As a beginner, you probably don't want to go larger than this just yet. You could also go with a 20 or 25 gallon (75.7 or 94.6 L) tank for a starter tank and keep just a few hardy fish (Mollies, guppies, platys, tetra, small cory cats and no cichlids) to see if you like the hobby. It is not recommended to start out with anything less than 10 gallons (37.9 L) - meaning no \\"Desktop\\" aquariums or the small, single Betta holders. As tempting as it is, it is actually harder to maintain good water quality in a small tank. Aquariums that hold 20 gallons (75.7 L) or more will need a stand no matter what. The only exception is if they are on a heavy, well-anchored counter. Buy one that is designed for the dimensions and shape of your tank. Don't underestimate the weight of a full fish tank! Make sure the stand is either rated for the size of your tank or that it has been custom built to be very sturdy. It is vital to the integrity of the tank it will hold that it be sturdy enough to hold the tank's weight. In addition, it is not safe to have an edge of the tank sticking out over the side. Furniture like dressers, TV stands, end tables/buffets, or flimsy wooden desks aren't strong enough. Look for complete tank kits at those big box pet stores. Used setups from websites like Craigslist are often available for great prices, but be sure to check for leaks and clean very well before use. If you don't buy a complete setup, make sure the equipment you choose is rated for the size of your tank. Choosing the right spot is important for the health of your fish. You'll want to put it in a place where the temperature remains pretty consistent and the amount of light doesn't get overpowering. Allow at least 5 inches (12.7 cm) between the wall and the aquarium to make room for the filter. Some things to keep in mind when choosing location for your tank: Too much sunlight will cause excessive algae growth and a maintenance nightmare. An interior wall, away from bright light, is best. Try to stay away from putting the tank under a vent - dust will blow out and drop into the fish tank. It will also be harder to maintain a consistent water temperature, something that is important for all fish but vital for some. It is also important to consider the ability of the floor to support the weight of the fully loaded aquarium. Make sure that there is adequate structural support under the floor. If necessary find your home's blueprints and look for crossbeams. Choose a location near an outlet, and keep in mind how far you will have to haul water for weekly tank maintenance! No cords should be straining to get to the outlet either. In fact, it's a good idea all around to get a surge protector power strip (which you'll love when the power snaps back on after an outage) and go from there. Set up your tank stand ideally on a wooden floor, not a rug or carpet. What is a summary?","completion":"The article provides a comprehensive guide on setting up and maintaining home aquariums. It emphasizes the importance of research and careful planning in selecting the right types of fish and the appropriate tank size that can accommodate them comfortably. Large fish produce more waste, thus requiring bigger tanks, while the presence of live plants and decorations would also consume space. Using calculators can help determine, based on compatibility and needs, which fish types are safe to keep. The article dispenses with the one-inch-per-gallon rule, noting its inapplicability to smaller or larger tanks. It suggests a starter tank size of 20 or 25 gallons for beginners intending to keep hardy fish while cautioning against starting with tanks less than 10 gallons due to challenges in maintaining water quality. Tanks with a capacity of 20 gallons or more would necessitate a sturdy stand, a factor often overlooked by beginners but important in ensuring the safety and integrity of the tank. In selecting the right stand, one should take into account the weight of the full fish tank and ensure that it is sturdy enough to carry this weight effectively. Light, flimsy furniture like dressers and TV stands may not be sturdy enough to support a fish tank. Aquarium location is also crucial and should be chosen carefully. The location should provide a consistent temperature and avoid excessive sunlight. It's also advisable to avoid placing the tank near vents or spaces that would interfere with the maintaining of a consistent water temperature. Lastly, the location should be placed near an outlet for convenience and allows for comfortable hauling of water during weekly tank maintenance. The article also encourages the use of surge protector power strips for safety and suggests setting up the tank stand on a wooden floor rather than a rug or carpet for stability purposes. Comprehensive setup kits can be found in pet stores, or used setups can be procured online, though ensuring their quality and cleanliness is crucial."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","completion":"\\"40 Lines, 4 × 5 Wheel Scatter Bucks HAR 7 Free Game Features.\\" This is a bit tricky as it seems to refer to a specific situation or product, where certain words might be names or proper nouns and thus need capitalization. However, let's break down the possible capitalization and punctuation using common English grammar rules: 1. Numbers and Mathematical Symbols: English grammar rules don't require capitalizing numbers or mathematical symbols. Thus, \\"40\\" and \\"4 × 5\\" remain the same. 2. Titles: If something is a title, in English, we use title case. Title case generally capitalizes the first word, the last word, and all important words in between. Prepositions, articles, and conjunctions typically remain lower case unless they start or end the title. Given \\"Wheel Scatter Bucks\\" could potentially be a title; it would be capitalized as \\"Wheel Scatter Bucks.\\" 3. Acronyms: Acronyms (abbreviations formed from the initial letters of other words and pronounced as a word) are typically capitalized in English. If \\"HAR\\" is an acronym, it should be left in its capitalized form. 4. Game elements: If \\"7 Free Game Features\\" is referring to a specific set of features in a game, it would be capitalized as \\"7 Free Game Features\\" because it's descriptive of a set entity within the context of the game. 5. Full Stops: There are no rules necessary for adding any full stops/periods in this sentence as it doesn't appear to contain multiple distinct sentences. Following these guidelines, the capitalized version of the sentence would be: \\"40 Lines, 4 × 5 Wheel Scatter Bucks HAR 7 Free Game Features.\\" This capitalization may vary depending on the actual context and original source's stylization as it might contain specific product names or unique spellings that go against standard English grammar rules. It is always good to refer to the original document or context to make sure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If Such simulations can illustrate the long-term economic consequences of saving choices that are made today., can we conclude that \\"What is done today has no affect on the long term consequences.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"What is done today has no effect on the long-term consequences.\\" In fact, the concept of simulations illustrating the long-term economic consequences of saving choices made today emphasizes the opposite notion: that the decisions we make in the present do, indeed, have an impact on future outcomes. Various factors such as savings, investments, spending habits, government policies, and technological advancements play a crucial role in shaping long-term economic consequences. Using simulations, we can model these factors and observe how different choices may affect future economic growth, stability, and prosperity. For instance, consider the choices an individual or family makes with respect to savings and investments: 1. Savings rate: The percentage of income saved by a family or an individual largely impacts their financial security, access to better opportunities, and time required for retirement. A higher savings rate today helps accumulate more wealth in the long term due to the power of compounding returns. This, in turn, enables greater financial security and disposable income in the future. 2. Investment strategy: The decision on how to allocate savings between various assets and financial instruments (such as stocks, bonds, real estate, or simply cash savings), known as portfolio allocation, can significantly affect the growth of wealth over time. A well-diversified portfolio, balanced between high and low risk investments, can better withstand market fluctuations and generate stable, long-term returns. 3. Impact on the economy: Individual savings and investment choices collectively determine the amount of capital available for businesses to borrow and invest. This, in turn, influences the economy's long-term growth. A higher level of overall savings can lead to more funds for business investments, innovation, and expansion, which in turn can boost GDP growth and job creation in the long run. Moreover, the choices made by governments and regulatory bodies today regarding fiscal and monetary policies, public spending, education, and infrastructure development also have long-term consequences on economic growth, development, and social welfare. In conclusion, it is essential to recognize that decisions made today – be it on an individual or collective level – do have an impact on the long-term economic consequences. Therefore, it is important to approach our choices with foresight, understanding their long-term implications and striking a balance between immediate needs and future goals. By leveraging the power of simulations, we can better understand the potential outcomes of today's decisions and strive to shape a more stable and prosperous future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They would score first as Ben Roethlisberger found Emmanuel Sanders on a 5-yard pass for a 7-0 lead. The Dolphins managed to get on the board as Caleb Sturgis kicked a 30-yard field goal making the score 7-3. In the 2nd quarter, Charles Clay caught a 6-yard touchdown pass from Ryan Tannehill as the Phins took the lead 10-7 at halftime. After the break, the Dolphins went right back to work as Daniel Thomas ran for a 4-yard touchdown making the score 17-7. The Steelers then came within 3 when Roethlisberger found Antonio Brown on a 43-yard touchdown pass making the score 17-14 and would eventually score again when Troy Polamalu picked off Tannehill and returned it 19 yards for a touchdown as they retook the lead 21-17. The Dolphins however moved back into the lead as Tannehill found Brian Hartline on a 4-yard pass for a 24-21 score.

Write a title for this article: Researchers have combed beaches and ocean floors looking for compounds that can be effective antibiotics, a process that's assumed greater urgency as untreatable superbugs appear more frequently. Now they’re targeting a new location: your nose. Scientists at the University of Tübingen in Germany have found an antibiotic made by a nasal bacterium that can kill Staphylococcus aureus, the source of many human infections. Existing antibiotics have been unable to kill its various strains, most notably MRSA, which can cause deadly sepsis and pneumonia. This gives the new antibiotic, which they call lugdunin, the potential to aid new treatments of bacterial infections. Lugdunin has been shown to fight a range of bacteria and treat skin infections in mice, according to an article published on Wednesday in the scientific journal Nature. Not only does it combat MRSA, it does so while being less likely to cause a patient to develop resistance. Overuse of antibiotics has played an outsized role in making such drugs ineffective for a broad swath of existing treatments. As part of their discovery, the authors also illustrate a novel method of using human microorganisms to develop antibiotics. “We’ve come up with a new concept,” said Andreas Peschel, one of the paper's 17 authors. “It was totally unexpected to find a human-associated bacterium to produce a real antibiotic.” Antibiotic-resistant strains of bacteria such as MRSA, which kills 20,000 Americans each year, are of growing concern for clinicians and microbiologists because of their ability to lead to pandemics. Superbugs already kill 700,000 people around the world annually, a number that researchers predict (PDF) could reach 10 million by 2050. “It’s such a huge problem that we expect in 10 years more people to die from these diseases than cancer,” Peschel said of diseases such as those derived from MRSA. The authors of the new study looked at nasal swabs from 187 hospital patients and found that only 5.9 percent of those with the Staphylococcus lugdunensis bacterium, which produces lugdunin, also had the unwanted Staphylococcus aureus. By comparison, some 34.7 percent of patients who didn't have the lugdunin-producing bacterium had Staphylococcus aureus. Additionally, researchers showed that, within 72 hours of its introduction, lugdunin led to a strong reduction or killed Staphylococcus aureus on the surface and in deeper layers of the skin of most mice. The authors said they're unsure how Staphylococcus aureus could become resistant to lugdunin. Peschel said, based on their findings, that such resistance “seems very difficult, if not impossible.” Another advantage of the antibiotic is that it keeps its full activity within the human body, said co-author Bernhard Krismer, potentially making it more effective than compounds derived elsewhere. However, there's a drawback: Since it's the first non-ribosomal peptide antibiotic, meaning that it is not synthesized using DNA or RNA, scientists would have a more difficult time modifying it for research or drug development. Peschel said that researchers have filed a patent application to begin negotiations with pharmaceutical companies, though they're several years from starting clinical trials. While a new antibiotic is always welcome in these times of diminishing drug effectiveness, what may be more important is the discovery that the tools to fight fearsome superbugs could lie within our own bodies. “We are sure there will be additional antibiotics that can be discovered from these sources,” Peschel said.","completion":"The title for this article could be: \\"The New Antibiotic Found in our Noses can Fight Harmful Germs!\\" In this article, scientists discovered a new helpful medicine (antibiotic) in our noses that can fight against some really harmful germs, like MRSA, which can make people very sick. This new antibiotic is called lugdunin and it comes from one of the tiny living things (bacteria) that live in our noses. This discovery is super important because it can help us find better ways to treat infections from these bad germs that have become so strong and difficult to fight. So, our noses might have a tiny superhero antibiotic that can protect us from some really bad germs in the future!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: About 100,000 bats dead after heatwave in southern Queensland Updated About 100,000 bats may have died as a result of last weekend's heatwave in southern Queensland, the RSPCA says. Mass deaths at about 25 separate colonies have been reported since the weekend, including at Mt Ommaney, Redbank, Boonah, Palmwoods, Laidley and Gatton. RSPCA spokesman Michael Beatty says the heatwave was a significant hit to the population of bats across the state. \\"The heatwave was basically a catastrophe for all the bat colonies in south-east Queensland,\\" he said. \\"That's obviously going to have a pretty disturbing impact on those colonies and those colonies are vital to our ecosystem.\\" The smell of bat carcasses has caused problems for locals. The Scenic Rim Regional Council, west of Brisbane, has organised rubbish collectors to clear up the carcasses of about 2,000 bats. Residents near Boonah's Athol Terrace lookout say they have been putting up with the stench of the dead animals for four days. Hundreds of bats also lie dead in trees and nearby bushes, and are being eaten by maggots. The council today advised local residents it will not send workers into nearby bushland to collect the remaining bat carcasses, as it could cause further disruption to the nearby colony. One resident has told the ABC she is receiving anti-viral treatment after being scratched by a baby bat while clearing the dead animals out of her tree with a rake. Further north, Lockyer Valley Regional Council says it also faces a massive task of cleaning up thousands of dead bats from around Laidley and Gatton. Sunshine Coast Regional Council has sent workers out to collect thousands more dead bats near Palmwoods. At least 16 people across south-east Queensland are receiving anti-viral treatment after coming into close contact with a bat. Queensland Health is advising people not to touch the animals and to call authorities for help in clearing them away. Sammy Ringer from Bat Rescue echoed those concerns, saying it was best to call a wildlife volunteer or a vet. \\"Don't touch them, they're stressed,\\" she said. \\"If they do bite or scratch you and break the skin you can get a vaccination, you can get a shot for the lyssavirus.\\" Topics: local-government, phenomena, environmental-impact, boonah-4310, southport-4215, maroochydore-4558 First posted ||||| Queensland heatwave: Brisbane set to roast as weekend temperatures soar Updated The scorching heatwave gripping much of Queensland is being felt in Brisbane today, with residents set to roast in temperatures of up to 41 degrees Celsius. At 9:25am, the mercury had already hit 35.1C, with the apparent temperature hovering at 37.4C, according to the Bureau of Meteorology website. By 1:00pm, the temperature had risen to 38C, although the apparent temperature was 41C. Queensland's interior has been sweltering through record-breaking heat in recent days, along with parts of Central Australia and north-western New South Wales. The heatwave continued as a Bureau of Meteorology report revealed 2013 was the hottest year on record in Australia. The mass of hot air causing the extreme weather again led to searing temperatures in central and western Queensland on Friday. St George topped the temperature list with 47.2C, while Winton and Longreach also had scorchers at 46.4C and 46.3C respectively. Charleville followed on 46.1C, while Blackall, Roma and Thargomindah all recorded temperatures just above 45C. Brisbane's top for Friday was 34.3C, but the mercury is predicted to reach 41C today as northerly winds push the heatwave south. Further evacuations not expected Firefighters are confident no further evacuations will be needed as they battle a large bushfire on Stradbroke Island. Firefighters are confident no further evacuations will be needed as they battle a large bushfire on Stradbroke Island. The Gold Coast's beaches have been packed with people keen to beat the heat, and that is sure to be the case over the weekend. Queenslanders have also been urged to put their health first during the current heatwave. Last summer, paramedics responded to more than 350 cases of heat-related illness across the state. Steven Clarke from Queensland Ambulance says drinking plenty of water is the key. Mr Clarke says families should ensure loved ones are coping with the heat, with the elderly particularly vulnerable. \\"For the elderly and people with chronic illnesses, especially with kidney problems, diabetic problems, obese people, they need to take extra care,\\" he said. \\"Probably a critical point to make is family need to check their loved ones - grandad and grandma living on their own - they need to ring them up, they need to go around and visit them and make sure they are doing the right thing.

The album reached number 166 on the Billboard 200 . - Mickey Hart (born Michael Steven Hartman, September 11, 1943) is an American percussionist and musicologist. He is best known as one of the two drummers of the rock band Grateful Dead. He was a member of the Grateful Dead from September 1967 to February 1971 and from October 1974 to August 1995. He and fellow Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann earned the nickname \\"the rhythm devils\\". - Robert Hall \\"Bob\\" Weir (born October 16, 1947) is an American singer, songwriter, and guitarist, most recognized as a founding member of the Grateful Dead. After the Grateful Dead disbanded in 1995, Weir performed with The Other Ones, later known as The Dead, together with other former members of the Grateful Dead. Weir also founded and played in several other bands during and after his career with the Grateful Dead, including Kingfish, the Bob Weir Band, Bobby and the Midnites, Scaring the Children, RatDog and Furthur, co-led by former Grateful Dead bassist Phil Lesh. In 2015, Weir, along with former Grateful Dead members Mickey Hart and Bill Kreutzmann, joined with Grammy-winning singer/guitarist John Mayer to form the band Dead & Company. Weir continued to tour with Dead & Company in 2016. - Bobby and the Midnites was a rock group led by Bob Weir of the Grateful Dead. The band was Weir's main side project during the first half of the 1980s. They released two albums, but were better known for their live concerts than for their work in the recording studio. With a rhythm section that included jazz veterans Billy Cobham and, for a time, Alphonso Johnson, Bobby and the Midnites played rock music that was influenced by jazz-rock fusion. - Space rock is a subgenre of rock music; the term originally referred to a group of early, mostly British, 1970s progressive and psychedelic rock bands such as Hawkwind, Gong, and Pink Floyd, characterised by slow, lengthy instrumental passages dominated by electronic organs, synthesizers, experimental guitar work and science fiction or outer space-related lyrical themes. - Philip Chapman Lesh (born March 15, 1940) is a musician and a founding member of the Grateful Dead, with whom he played bass guitar throughout their 30-year career. - The Other Ones was an American rock band formed in 1998 by former Grateful Dead members Bob Weir, Phil Lesh, and Mickey Hart, along with part-time Grateful Dead collaborator Bruce Hornsby. In 2000, Bill Kreutzmann, another Grateful Dead alumnus, joined the group, while Phil Lesh dropped out. In 2002, Lesh rejoined the band, and Hornsby left.

A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument. - John Clayton Mayer (born October 16, 1977) is an American singer-songwriter, guitarist, and producer.

The band was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1994 and their Barton Hall Concert at Cornell University (May 8, 1977) was added to the National Recording Registry of the Library of Congress.

Latium was originally a small triangle of fertile, volcanic soil on which resided the tribe of the Latins or Latians. It was located on the left bank (east and south) of the Tiber river, extending northward to the Anio river (a left-bank tributary of the Tiber) and southeastward to the Pomptina Palus (Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields) as far south as the Circeian promontory. The right bank of the Tiber was occupied by the Etruscan city of Veii, and the other borders were occupied by Italic tribes. Subsequently, Rome defeated Veii and then its Italic neighbors, expanding Latium to the Apennine Mountains in the northeast and to the opposite end of the marsh in the southeast.

When cultural movements go through revolutions from one to the next, genres tend to get attacked and mixed up, and often new genres are generated and old ones fade. These changes are often reactions against the prior cultural form, which typically has grown stale and repetitive. An obsession emerges among the mainstream with the new movement, and the old one falls into neglect - sometimes it dies out entirely, but often it chugs along favored in a few disciplines and occasionally making reappearances (sometimes prefixed with \\"neo-\\"). - The European Union (EU) is a political and economic union of member states that are located primarily in Europe.

ООН, провозглашающая независимость Израиля. Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The United Nations, proclaiming the independence of Israel. Now, in order to provide you with a detailed and long answer, let me elaborate on the role of the United Nations in recognizing and establishing the independence of Israel. The establishment of Israel as an independent nation was a result of numerous international events leading up to its declaration of independence on May 14, 1948. The process of Israeli independence traces its origins back to the aftermath of World War I and the fall of the Ottoman Empire. The United Nations, as an international organization, played a significant role in facilitating the country's independence. In the early 20th century, leading up to the declaration of Israel's independence, there was a growing movement of Jewish nationalism called Zionism. This movement sought the re-establishment of a Jewish homeland in their ancestral lands, known as Palestine. During World War I, the British government issued the Balfour Declaration in 1917, which supported the establishment of a national home for the Jewish people in Palestine. After World War I, the League of Nations (the precursor of the United Nations) granted the United Kingdom a mandate over Palestine, assigning them the responsibility of administering the territory and implementing the terms of the Balfour Declaration. This British Mandate of Palestine was in effect from 1922 to 1948. During this time, tensions grew between the Arab and Jewish communities living in Palestine, leading to multiple incidents of violence and political conflict. In the aftermath of World War II and the Holocaust, there was increased international sympathy for the Jewish people and their quest for a homeland. This led to the United Nations getting involved in finding a solution for the ongoing conflict in Palestine. On November 29, 1947, the United Nations General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, which recommended the partition of Palestine into separate Jewish and Arab states, with Jerusalem being placed under international control. The partition plan aimed at creating two states that could coexist peacefully in the region, but it was met with resistance by Arab countries who opposed the creation of a Jewish state in Palestine. Despite this, Jewish leaders accepted the partition plan, and the preparations for the establishment of the State of Israel began. On May 14, 1948, David Ben-Gurion, the head of the Jewish Agency, declared the establishment of the State of Israel, marking the end of the British Mandate in Palestine. Immediately following this declaration, Israel found itself at war with neighboring Arab countries, a conflict known as the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The United Nations played a crucial role in the creation of Israel, from the British Mandate period to the adoption of the Partition Plan. The UN further engaged in diplomatic efforts to broker peace agreements between Israel and Arab nations throughout history. While the question of Israel's independence remains a contentious issue with ongoing conflicts, it is undeniable that the United Nations has made significant efforts to address the challenges arising from this historical event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: 15 Minutes Movie plot: The film begins with Emil Slovak (Karel Roden) and Oleg Razgul (Oleg Taktarov) arriving in America. They were former criminals and, after getting out of prison, have come to the U.S. to claim their part of a bank heist in Russia (or somewhere in Czech Republic). Within minutes of arriving, Oleg steals a video camera from a Make-Your-Own-Movie establishment. They go to the run-down apartment of their old partner and demand their share. He doesn't have it so Emil stabs him and his wife to death as Oleg tapes it with the camera. The couple's friend, Czech immigrant Daphne Handlova (Vera Farmiga), witnesses the murders from the bathroom; but she escapes before they can kill her, too. To hide the crime, Emil burns down the apartment. Jordy Warsaw (Edward Burns) is an arson investigator and is called to the case. Eddie Flemming (Robert De Niro) is a much celebrated detective who is also called to the scene. Flemming is such a high-profile celebrity detective that he is even followed around by the local tabloid TV show Top Story. Everywhere he goes, the townspeople cheer him on. Flemming and Warsaw decide to help each other out and work the case together. While checking out the crowd outside, Warsaw spots Daphne trying to get his attention. When he finally gets to where she was, she's gone. Emil calls an escort service from a business card he found in the girl's wallet and asks for a \\"Czech girl\\". When Honey (Noelle Evans), a regular call girl arrives, he kills her but not before getting the address of the escort service. Oleg tapes the murder. In fact, he tapes everything he can, trying to be the next Frank Capra. Flemming and Warsaw investigate her murder and also visit the escort service. Rose Hearn (Charlize Theron) runs the service and tells them that the girl they're looking for doesn't work for her but rather a local hairdresser.

The U.S. Supreme Court signaled Wednesday it may be open to new limits on the government's ability to track someone's movements by accessing data on that person's cellphone. A case before the high court could result in a landmark decision in the ongoing debate over civil liberties protections in an era of rapid technological change. At issue is whether law enforcement will be able to access cellphone data that can reveal a person's whereabouts without having to first obtain a court-issued search warrant. The case stems from the conviction of Timothy Carpenter for a series of robberies back in 2010 and 2011. Prosecutors were able to obtain cellphone records that indicated his location over a period of months, information that proved crucial to his conviction. On Wednesday, lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union argued that law enforcement should be required to obtain a court-ordered search warrant before obtaining such information. They also argued that allowing law enforcement to access the cellphone data without a warrant would violate the prohibition on unreasonable search and seizures contained in the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. \\"It is impossible to go about our daily lives without leaving a trail of digital breadcrumbs that reveal where we have been over time, what we have done, who we spent time with,\\" said ACLU attorney Nathan Freed Wessler, who spoke to reporters outside the Supreme Court following oral arguments. \\"It is time for the court, we think, to update Fourth Amendment doctrine to provide reasonable protections today.\\" Some of the justices also raised concerns about privacy in the digital age. \\"Most Americans, I think, still want to avoid Big Brother,\\" Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who often sides with the liberal wing of the court, said.

The jury in the Michael Jackson wrongful death trial has ruled that the concert promoter was not negligent in hiring the doctor who treated the singer. Jackson's mother sued concert promoter AEG Live LLC over the hiring of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of the anesthetic propofol in 2009. Katherine Jackson claimed AEG Live should have done a thorough background check on Murray. The Jackson family matriarch was seeking hundreds of millions of dollars in damages for herself and her son's three children. The company denied hiring Murray and said he had been picked by the singer as the doctor for his upcoming shows. The panel of six men and six women began deliberating on September 26, more than five months after the start of the trial that offered an unprecedented look into the superstar's private life. The case provided the closest look yet at Jackson's drug use and his battles against chronic pain and insomnia. It also took jurors behind the scenes in the rough and tumble world of negotiations with one of the world's most famous entertainers looking to solidify his legendary status after scandal interrupted his career. 'We reached a verdict that we understand that not everybody is going to agree with,' jury foreman Gregg Barden said after the decision was reached. Scroll down for video. Trouble: Dr Conrad Murray, who was already convicted of involuntary manslaughter for giving Jackson an overdose of the anesthetic, was the basis for the latest trial which was a lawsuit against the concert promoter. 'But the decision was reached after very careful consideration of five months of testimony, thousands of documents and of course the guidance of the court.' Witnesses said he saw the 'This Is It' concerts as a chance for personal redemption after being acquitted of child molestation. But as the opening date of the shows approached, associates testified that he had bouts of insecurity and agonized over his inability to sleep. They said he turned to the drug propofol and found Murray, who was willing to buy it in bulk and administer it to him on a nightly basis even though it is not meant to be used outside operating rooms. Saying their peace: Juror Gregg Barden spoke to the awaiting media after arriving at the not guilty verdict against AEG. All eyes on them: The group issued a joint statement saying that they knew not everyone would agree with them. Testimony at the civil trial showed that only Jackson and Murray knew he was taking the drug. In his closing argument, AEG Live attorney Marvin Putnam told jurors that the company would have pulled the plug on the shows if they knew he was using the anesthetic. 'AEG would have never agreed to finance this tour if they knew Mr. Jackson was playing Russian roulette in his bedroom every night,' Brian Panish, a lawyer for the Jackson family, countered that AEG Live was negligent by not looking far enough to find out what it needed to know about Murray. Major pull: At the time of his death Jackson was prepping for the 10-night 'This Is It' concert in London which was run by concert promoter AEG Live LLC, who the jury ruled was not negligent in hiring Murray. Those who live on: Michael's mother Katherine is now the trustee of his estate and cares for his children, including daughter Paris (seen together in January 2012) He claimed in his closing argument that the lure of riches turned the company and Murray into mercenaries who sacrificed the pop star's life in a quest to boost their own fortunes. Panish asked jurors: 'Do people do things they shouldn't do for money? People do it every day.' He said a 150,000-a-month contract to care for Jackson was a lifeline to help Murray climb out of his financial troubles, which included 500,000 in debt. AEG Live, meanwhile, had only one interest — launching a world tour for the King of Pop that would yield untold millions in profits, the lawyer said. AEG Live's lawyers framed the case as being about personal choice, saying Jackson made bad choices about the drug that killed him and the doctor who provided it. They said he was the architect of his own demise and no one else can be blamed. Putnam said Jackson insisted on hiring the cardiologist, despite objections from AEG Live. 'It was his money and he certainly wasn't going to take no for an answer,' the lawyer said. Putnam portrayed AEG Live and its executives as victims of deception by Jackson and Murray. He showed brief excerpts from the 'This Is It' documentary to show that Jackson appeared in top form just 12 hours before he died. Making the case: Brian Panish was hired by Jackson's family to argue that AEG should have done a background check on the doctor and found him to be unsuitable to treat the 'King of Pop' Legal minds: Panish, seen here talking with AEG's attorneys Kathryn Cahan and Marvin Putnam, ultimately won the case. Closing argument: Putnam told jurors that the company would have pulled the plug on the shows if they knew he was using the anesthetic. 'AEG Live did not have a crystal ball,' he said. 'Dr. Murray and Mr. Jackson fooled everyone. They want to blame AEG for something no one saw.' Murray was convicted in 2011 of involuntary manslaughter for causing Jackson's death and is due to be released in October after serving a two year jail sentence. Jurors heard testimony from more than 50 witnesses, including Jackson's mother and his eldest son, Prince, as well as days of testimony from AEG executives who were repeatedly asked about emails in which they discussed Jackson's missed rehearsals and described Murray's pay as a done deal. They also heard about Jackson's close relationship to many of his doctors, including Murray, who he first met in Las Vegas in 2007. Katherine Jackson called the case a search for the truth about the death of her son and the trial featured potentially embarrassing revelations for both sides. AEG's executives had their emails picked apart, revealing concerns that Jackson wouldn't be able to perform the shows as planned, that a lawyer at their parent company referred to Michael Jackson as 'the freak,' and that Jackson was derided even though the company had invested more than 30million in his shows. AEG Live, meanwhile, laid out Jackson's medical history, presenting testimony about his use of drugs, including the powerful painkiller Demerol, for pain stemming from an accident that occurred decades ago while he was filming a Pepsi commercial. Jackson had no trace of that drug in his system when he died. Legend lives on: Fans pay tribute to Jackson by imitating his signature moves outside the Los Angeles court. The lawyers called witnesses who recounted Jackson's use of propofol dating back to the 1990s. In 1997, two German doctors administered the anesthetic to help the singer sleep between shows in Munich. A few years later, Jackson requested the anesthetic from a dental anesthesiologist who refused, as did another doctor who testified that Jackson kept a box of propofol in his bedroom at Neverland Ranch. On the issue of possible damages, expert witnesses for the company said any estimate of Jackson's future earnings were speculative, and they showed the panel that the singer was deeply in debt and consistently spent more than he earned. In the verdict form, jurors were first asked to decide the central question of the case — whether AEG Live hired Murray to treat Jackson. During the trial, they heard evidence that AEG had drafted a contract that was signed by Murray. But there were no indications that it was signed by AEG Live or Jackson. Attorneys for the singer's mother argued that Jackson's signature was not necessary, but the company's attorneys said the contract required his consent to be binding. Jackson's mother and his three children are supported by his estate, which provides a comfortable lifestyle for them and erased hundreds of millions of dollars in debts by debuting new projects and releasing new music featuring the King of Pop.

At a reception, he meets a group of other promising math and science graduate students, Richard Sol (Goldberg), Ainsley (Jason Gray-Stanford), and Bender (Rapp). He also meets his roommate Charles Herman (Bettany), a literature student. Nash is under extreme pressure to publish, but he wants to publish his own original idea. His inspiration comes when he and his fellow graduate students discuss how to approach a group of women at a bar. Hansen quotes Adam Smith and advocates \\"every man for himself\\", but Nash argues that a cooperative approach would lead to better chances of success. Nash develops a new concept of governing dynamics and publishes an article on this. On the strength of this, he is offered an appointment at MIT where Sol and Bender join him. Some years later, Nash is invited to the Pentagon to crack encrypted enemy telecommunication. Nash can decipher the code mentally, to the astonishment of other decrypters.

Write highlights for this article: When was the last time you looked at the label on your clothes to check where they were made or what they are made of? A few years ago, I was living a paradox familiar to many Americans: eating local and organic food, carrying reusable bags to the grocery store and choosing eco-friendly products wherever I could. This mindfulness was in no way extended to my closet -- I owned more than 350 items of clothes, every single bit of it cheap, trendy, poorly made and assembled in low-wage factories in other countries. See the lifecycle of your cotton T-shirt. Fashion today has a here-today-gone-tomorrow mentality, where the latest look, lowest price or the hottest designer are paramount and quantity is valued over quality. For the first time in history, we are consuming clothes as a disposable good, buying a cheap dress for a date night and wearing it but once or twice. These changing attitudes prompted me to write my book, \\"Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion,\\" and what I learned about the fashion industry during the process compelled me to change. Complete coverage: Fashion Week. Our consumption of clothing is growing at an alarming rate. Most Americans have closets brimming, if not overflowing with clothes. Few of those purchases are made here -- 3% of apparel is produced in the United States, down from about half in 1990. While American factories sit empty, our thirst for cheap imported clothing has kept the cash registers at many stores humming throughout the recession. Fashion's environmental footprint has also mushroomed. There are more than 80 billion garments produced around the world today, and according to a study by the UK's Cambridge University, the industry is creating 70 million tons of waste water as of 2006 in the UK alone. In China, the largest clothing manufacturer in the world, the textile industry is also a major polluter. Last year, I traveled undercover to southern China and saw smog enshrouding a landscape of factories and, more shockingly, hundreds of factory workers wearing cheap, trendy clothes. As China's consumer class grows, already-scarce resources like water and petroleum may soon buckle under all of this shopping. In July, when it came out that the Olympic uniforms were made in China, Americans were outraged, making it clear that we're growing weary of soulless consumption. I believe we're ready for more meaningful wardrobes, and to support our amazing clothing heritage. My mother recently gave me a dress that she wore in high school in the 1960s. It was made by Jonathan Logan, a juniors brand that was considered cheap for its day -- the dress is 100% wool, fully lined, finished with French seams and made in the USA. What's so wonderful about locally made fashion is that it offers designers tight control over their product, has a lower environmental footprint and makes it easier to keep an eye on any labor problems. And according to a Cotton Incorporated Lifestyle Monitor survey, approximately 55% of consumers agree it is \\"very/somewhat important\\" that their clothing is made in the U.S. I was recently in Portland, Oregon, and met with the owners of Spooltown and the Portland Garment Factory, two small shops that have opened recently in a city that had very little existing garment industry infrastructure. They were able to build profitable manufacturing businesses from scratch. Just imagine what other Americans cities could do with the right government and consumer support. Major fashion brands also have an obligation to dramatically reduce the amount of water and energy used and waste emitted in making and selling their clothes, as well as to offer consumers more stylish products that are made out of recycled and eco-friendly materials. Nike is creating athletic team uniforms out of recycled PET bottles and has recycled more than 28 million pairs of athletic shoes through their Reuse-a-Shoe program; Eileen Fisher has just released a beautiful line of bluesign-certified silk shirts dyed without hazardous chemicals; and H&M has agreed to stop using toxic and nonbiodegradable perfluorinated compounds, called PFCs, in their outerwear by 2013. These efforts need to be expanded. Clothing designers also need to rethink the materials they're using and how they're sourced. Fortunately, eco-friendly textiles have improved so much in recent years that luxurious eco-friendly fibers like Tencel, Modal and Cupro have far more in common with silk than a hemp sack. Some emerging designers are eschewing new textiles altogether for upcycling, which means taking waste and reclaimed textile material and turning it into a product with higher value. I recently bought a lovely red tunic upcycled from a men's dress shirt produced by a small Brooklyn designer called State. Designer on the rise: Mohapatra's moment. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, we are throwing away 68 pounds of textiles per person per year and donating such a staggering volume of clothes that a majority of our donations to charity have to be sold to textile recyclers who then sell more than half of our used clothes overseas, largely to Africa. Retailers like Eileen Fisher and Patagonia are accepting returns of their worn products -- Fisher resells them in her Green Eileen retail store, while Patagonia recycles theirs into new products. Fast-fashion stores need to start these types of recycling programs. Consumers can also take more responsibility by repairing and caring for the clothes they own, trading their duds at clothing swaps and, for the particularly creative, refashioning last year's styles into fresh looks. Now for the million-dollar question: How can you afford this? It all starts by taking an honest look at how you're spending money on clothes. The average American consumer spends 1,700 a year on apparel. Most of us own more clothing than we know what to do with, so I encourage people to first of all buy less clothing and to try to limit trendy, throwaway purchases to only one or two a season. Divert the rest of your clothing budget to clothes that you truly love and are going to wear for several seasons. If just a quarter of our purchases were put toward locally made or eco-friendly fashion and fashion companies with a commitment to sustainability, we could change the face of the industry. I also believe we'd be happier with our clothes. See what a cotton T-shirt goes through before it gets to you. Is your closet filled with cheap, disposable clothing?

What can I do if my friend likes my crush? Choose from: A. no. B. yes.","completion":"A. no. These two questions convey different meanings and scenarios: 1. \\"What should I do when my crush is my friend?\\" This question is asking for advice on how to handle a situation where the person you have romantic feelings for is also your friend. The main focus is on the person who has the crush, and the uncertainty revolves around how to proceed to maintain the friendship while also exploring the potential for a romantic relationship. Here's a detailed response: In this situation, first, it's important to gauge the feelings of your crush, as well as their current relationship status. Try to spend more time with your crush in group settings and observe their behavior. Pay attention to how they interact with you and with others around them. If you notice any signs of attraction, your crush may reciprocate your feelings. However, be prepared for the possibility that your crush may not share the same feelings for you. This can be difficult, especially since you are friends. You should consider whether you can be content with just being friends or if your romantic feelings will get in the way. Decide if pursuing a romantic relationship is worth potentially damaging an existing friendship. If you decide to convey your feelings, it's essential to be open and honest with your crush. Choose an appropriate time and place for the conversation, and be prepared to deal with the outcome, whether positive or negative. If they share your feelings, then you can discuss how to move forward. If they don't, try to maintain your friendship and remember that your feelings may fade over time. Regardless of the outcome, always respect their decision and their feelings. 2. \\"What can I do if my friend likes my crush?\\" This question pertains to a situation where your friend is interested in the same person you have a crush on. The challenge, in this case, is navigating the feelings of both your friend and yourself, while avoiding potential conflict or hurt feelings. Here's a detailed response: First and foremost, communication is key. Talk to your friend about your feelings and gauge their reaction. They may not know that you are also interested in the same person and might be more considerate if they are aware of the situation. Be honest about your feelings, but also express that you value the friendship and don't want it to be affected by the situation. In the case where both of you are open to pursuing your crush, decide together how to approach the situation. It might involve respectfully competing for the crush's attention or agreeing to let the crush decide between the two of you, if they are interested in both. Although it might be difficult, set your boundaries and ground rules to ensure that no matter the outcome, your friendship remains intact. Alternatively, if you genuinely care for your friend and their happiness, you might choose to step back and let them pursue your mutual crush. Keep in mind that the right person for you might still be out there, and sacrificing your chance with this particular crush could potentially save your friendship. Ultimately, each case is unique, and the appropriate course of action depends on your specific situation and friendships. However, in both situations, it is important to prioritize open communication, respect for one another's feelings, and the value of the established connections."},{"prompt":"On a scale of 1-5 (with 1 being least favorable and 5 being most favorable), how would you rate this review? \\"I like his\\" A:","completion":"2"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The handout video from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute (KARI) showed the entire process of the rocket entering orbit and releasing the satellite. Wednesday's launch followed two failed attempts in 2009 and 2010 to launch a civilian rocket carrying a scientific satellite. Scroll down for video. New frontiers: South Korea has released video of a satellite being released into orbit after it was successfully launched last week. Line of communication: South Korea said the day after the launch the satellite had successfully made contact with the ground station. Exploring new territory: The country's Satellite Technology Research Centre said first contact was made at 3.27.12am on Thursday, January 31. South Korea said the day after the launch the satellite had successfully made contact with the ground station. The country's Satellite Technology Research Centre at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (KAIST) said the first communication contact was made at 3.27.12 am on Thursday. South Korea already has satellites in space which have been launched from other countries. The launch came at a time of tension. resulting from North Korea's announcement that it would carry out more. rocket launches and nuclear test after it was censured by the United. Nations Security Council over the launch of a rocket in December. The reclusive country declared a boycott of all dialogue aimed at ending its nuclear programme. Space race: The handout video from the Korea Aerospace Research Institute showed the entire process of the rocket entering orbit and releasing the satellite. Third time lucky: The launch followed two failed attempts in 2009 and 2010 to launch a civilian rocket carrying a scientific satellite. Lift-off: The launch came at a time of tension resulting from North Korea's announcement that it would carry out more rocket launches and nuclear test after it was censured by the United Nations Security Council. South Korea's U.N. ambassador said today a North Korean nuclear test 'seems to be imminent.' Ambassador. Kim Sook said there are 'very busy activities' taking place at North. Korea's nuclear test site 'and everybody's watching.' Kim. told a press conference that in the event of a nuclear test, he expects. the U.N. Security Council to respond with 'firm and strong measures.' North Korea announced last month that. it would conduct a nuclear test to protest Security Council sanctions. toughened after a satellite launch in December that the U.S. and others. say was a disguised test of banned missile technology. The council ordered North Korea in the sanctions resolution to refrain from a nuclear test or face 'significant action.'

A man walks past a display illustrating the damage a 1MT class nuclear weapon would cause if detonated in Seoul, at the War Memorial Museum of Korea in Seoul on February 5. South Korea joined the Security Council in January and holds the rotating presidency this month. Kim said he was speaking as South Korea's ambassador, not as the council president. He said that during negotiations on the latest sanctions resolution all 15 council members - including North Korean ally China - were unified. 'They are very firm and resolute and I would expect very firm and strong measures to be taken in terms of format as well as in substance once they go ahead with such provocation' as a nuclear test, Kim said. Pyongyang's two previous nuclear tests, in 2006 and 2009, both occurred after it was condemned by the United Nations for rocket launches. The sanctions, aimed at trying to derail the country's rogue nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, bar North Korea from testing or using nuclear or ballistic missile technology, and from importing or exporting material for these programs. The latest sanctions resolution again demanded that North Korea abandon its nuclear weapons program and cease launches. It slapped sanctions on North Korean companies and government agencies, including its space agency and several individuals. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Okay kiddo, this might sound a bit complicated, but I'll simplify it best I can. So, on February 5th, 2013, South Korea sent a satellite into space all by itself for the first time ever. They even filmed the whole thing from the rocket and shared it with everyone. That's just like if you attach a camera to your toy plane and let it fly, capturing its entire flight. They had tried doing this two times before in 2009 and 2010 but didn't succeed, like how sometimes we need a few tries to ride a bike without training wheels. They've sent satellites into space before, but they always needed help from other countries. This time they did it by themselves, like when you first dress up yourself without anyone's help which is quite a big deal! But, at the same time, their neighbors, North Korea, were causing some trouble. They were doing things that could make people feel unsafe, including some tests with very powerful weapons that can harm a lot of people. That's why all countries, including South Korea, were watching North Korea closely, like how a teacher watches a naughty kid in class. The United Nations, a group of countries that works together to maintain world peace, were not happy with North Korea's actions and warned them to stop. South Korea, as part of the United Nations, also expressed their concerns. To summarize, South Korea pulled off a great achievement, just like when you score fantastic in your maths test, but at the same time, they were worried about how North Korea was behaving."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: At age 11, Ghulam was married off to 40-year-old Jaiz in a rural Afghan village, making her only one of more than 10 million young girls who are being forced to wed men old enough to be their fathers of grandfather every year. In an effort to start a global conversation about the devastating effects of early marriages, which are currently practiced in more than 50 developing countries, the United Nations designed October 11 as International Day of the Girl Child this year. Although child marriage is against the law in many countries, and international treaties forbid the practice, it is estimated that about 51 million girls below age 18 are currently married, often under the cover of darkness and in secret. In Afghanistan alone, it is believed that approximately 57 percent of girls wed before the legal age of 16. Various factors drive parents of child bridges to marry off their daughters, from the community's pressure to confirm to age-old cultural customs to economic considerations. In poor, developing nations, it is not uncommon for families to settle debts by offering their daughters as payment. Experts agree that early marriage denies the girl education and robs them of their childhood because most young wives, burdened by grownup responsibilities, do not get a chance to interact with their peers or carry on friendships outside the household. In many cases, the girls are lorded over by their husbands and in-laws, leaving them vulnerable to domestic violence as well as physical, sexual and verbal abuse. Underage wives who are lucky enough to escape from their husbands end up living in poverty, or worse. Most girls who enter early marriages are expected to get pregnant right away, which often leads to tragedy for both the mothers, who are still children themselves, and their babies. Unless international organizations take steps to reverse the troubling trend, it is estimated that over the next decade, 100 million more girls--or about 25,000 girls a day ---will marry before they turn 18.

Under caretaker boss Mike Phelan, Hull took the lead when Adama Diomande and Abel Hernandez combined acrobatically, with Diomande awarded the goal. Riyad Mahrez replied from the penalty spot at the start of the second half after Demarai Gray had been fouled. But Robert Snodgrass earned the Tigers victory after a cross was not cleared. Danny Simpson's clearance from Ahmed Elmohamady's ball into the area only found Snodgrass on the edge of the box, and he drilled home. It is the first time the reigning English champions have started the season with a defeat since 1989, when Arsenal lost at Manchester United. The Foxes' title success was built on a solid defence and clinical finishing, but they managed neither at the KCOM Stadium. With Robert Huth suspended, summer signing Luis Hernandez came into the Leicester back four, which looked vulnerable whenever Hull attacked down the flanks. The defending champions also struggled up front, with Jamie Vardy missing their best chances - and they needed the help of referee Mike Dean for their equaliser. Tom Huddlestone appeared to stand on Gray's heels outside the Hull area, but he fell into the box and Dean pointed to the spot. Vardy, who scored 24 Premier League goals last season, miscued badly from two Musa pull-backs and had another follow-up effort blocked by Jake Livermore after Christian Fuchs' shot was saved. But otherwise Leicester created little against a makeshift Hull defence that featured midfielder Livermore at centre-half alongside Curtis Davies. Media playback is not supported on this device BBC Radio 5 live analyst Chris Waddle felt the balance of Claudio Ranieri's side was wrong, with Gray, Musa and Vardy often all in the same area of the pitch. \\"Mahrez was great on the left but Gray kept cutting in from the left and the two strikers Musa and Vardy were almost holding hands with him. \\"N'Golo Kante has been sold so Andy King was playing in front of their defence, but he did not look like he has the energy to play there. \\"King likes to get forward - dropping off and getting the ball like Kante did is not his strength.\\" There was a distinct lack of a party atmosphere at the KCOM Stadium as the game started, with home fans protesting against current owner Assam Allam and a lot of empty seats as well as banners. With no manager to replace Steve Bruce, no new signings since they were promoted via the play-offs and talk of a takeover, it was a far from ideal way for Hull to mark their return to the Premier League. Phelan's wafer-thin squad was expected to be cannon fodder for the champions, but he had clearly prepared them well because they started solidly and soon began causing Leicester problems. Their spectacular and slightly bizarre opening goal came from a well-worked corner routine that saw Davies nod on at the near post. They looked lively down the flanks, especially the impressive Elmohamady down the right, and rarely looked in danger when Leicester attacked. The Foxes only lost three out of 38 league games last season - to Arsenal twice and Liverpool - but while Hull's success was unexpected, it was also fully deserved for their organisation and endeavour.

Substance D, a powerful and dangerous drug that causes bizarre hallucinations, has swept the country. Approximately 20% of the total population is addicted. In response, the government has developed an invasive, high-tech surveillance system and a network of undercover officers and informants. Bob Arctor is one of these undercover agents, assigned to immerse himself in the drug's underworld and infiltrate the supply chain. Sometime in the past, Arctor was abandoned by his wife and two children, leaving him alone in a now-rundown suburban house in Anaheim, California; the house has since been repopulated by Arctor's two drug-addicted, layabout housemates: Luckman and Barris. The three spend their days intoxicated and having long, paranoiac conversations. At the police station, Arctor maintains privacy by wearing a \\"scramble suit\\" that constantly changes every aspect of his appearance and he is known only by the code name \\"Fred.\\" Arctor's senior officer, \\"Hank\\", and all other undercover officers, also wear scramble suits, protecting their identities even from each other. Since going undercover, Arctor himself has become addicted to Substance D and he has befriended the main woman he has been spying on: a cocaine addict and Substance D supplier named Donna. Arctor hopes to purchase large enough quantities of Substance D from Donna that she is forced to introduce him to her own supplier, but he has also developed seemingly unrequited romantic feelings towards her. At work, Hank orders Arctor to step up surveillance on Donna and her associates; however, Arctor's house is now at the center of his own investigation, since this is where Donna and the other addicts in her and Arctor's life now spend most of their time. Hank names Bob Arctor as the suspected ringleader, and thus orders Arctor to spy on himself. Arctor, therefore, has to even more carefully plan his double life, though his prolonged use of Substance D is damaging his brain, causing him to sometimes forget his...

It was certified gold just over two months later on November 26, 1991, and certified platinum on April 1, 1992; since then it has gone seven times platinum in the United States. The album peaked at number 3 on the Billboard 200. Originally, \\"Give it Away\\" did not fare well in the mainstream; several of Warner Bros.' target radio stations refused to air it, telling the band to \\"come back to us when you have a melody in your song\\". KROQ (of Los Angeles), however, began to play the single several times daily, and that, according to Kiedis, \\"was the beginning of the infusion of 'Give It Away' into mass consciousness.\\" The single ultimately peaked at number 9 on the UK Top 40 and number 73 on the Billboard Hot 100. Blood Sugar Sex Magik has sold over 13 million copies worldwide.Due to the success of \\"Give it Away\\", the band did not foresee \\"Under the Bridge\\" as being equally viable. Warner Bros. sent representatives to a Chili Peppers' concert in order to figure out what would ultimately be the next single. When Frusciante began playing \\"Under the Bridge\\", Kiedis missed his cue; the entire audience began singing the song, instead. Kiedis was initially \\"mortified that I had fucked up in front of Warner's people ... I apologized for fucking up but they said 'Fucking up? Are you kidding me? When every single kid at the show sings a song, that's our next single.'\\" \\"Under the Bridge\\" was, therefore, selected as Blood Sugar Sex Magik's second single. By January 1992, \\"Under the Bridge\\" had exploded, peaking at number 2 on the Billboard Hot 100.To promote the album in Europe, Kiedis and Frusciante both agreed they would make the trip. However, it proved difficult for Frusciante to adapt to life outside of the mansion, after being in near-seclusion for almost 30 days.

It's said that it's the day that store ledgers move into the black and companies become profitable. On that day, retailers slash prices to get consumers to buy. It is also a time when many Americans start their Christmas shopping. VOA's Elizabeth Lee tells us how the economy may affect consumers on that bargain day. This day should be a shopper's dream. \\"It's just the deals, the sales and everything you can get for a lesser price,\\" said Sandy Thomas, a shopper. But it's a nightmare for others. \\"I think it's crazy. I've done all of my shopping throughout the week so I don't have to go out on Friday,\\" she said. It's called Black Friday, the start of the traditional Christmas shopping season in the United States. Every year it's the day after the Thanksgiving holiday. Stores open before sunrise and there are deep discounts everywhere you look. Last year a crowd of bargain-hunters killed a Wal-mart worker in a New York suburb. This year, many stores are increasing security while they slash prices. \\"This is a huge time for the retail stores,\\" said Fred Joutz from George Washington University. \\"This is when they begin making their profits for the year.\\" Economics professor Fred Joutz says how Americans spend the weekend after Thanksgiving is a good indication of how consumers feel about the future. With the unemployment rate above 10 percent, Joutz says Americans are saving more and spending less. Some retailers are attracting consumers by opening on Thanksgiving Day, when shops are traditionally closed. Other stores open their doors anywhere from midnight to four in the morning. And shoppers will be lining up in front of the doors in order to be one of the first ones to walk through and get a big discount. Electronics like flat screen TVs are usually the first items to go. Sandy Thomas says it's an annual family tradition and well worth it. \\"I just save maybe half of what I would have spent on a regular, you know, shopping trip,\\" she... Answer:","completion":"What is the primary reason behind the name \\"Black Friday\\" for the day after Thanksgiving in the United States?

Let's break down the components to better understand the sentiment portrayed in this tweet. 1. '@nas_car_rocks BTW Jason if you did': The person is addressing 'Jason' and mentioning a specific action - \\"killing your laptop.\\" This opening line sets a context for the upcoming statement, referring to the fact that Jason might have done something to his laptop. The tone here seems to be quite casual. 2. 'kill your laptop': This phrase implies that some damage has been done to the laptop, or it might also be a metaphor meaning that Jason has rendered the laptop unusable. This part introduces an element of concern, but the overall sentiment remains light-hearted. 3. 'then you could be done for \\"computercide by laptoptomy\\"': The user invents two new, humorously exaggerated terms, \\"computercide\\" and \\"laptoptomy,\\" playing on the words \\"homicide\\" and other such -cide words and “laparotomy” (a medical procedure). It paints a ridiculously exaggerated scenario, suggesting that the act of damaging a laptop is a kind of crime or serious wrongdoing. This part brings in a strong sense of humor and sarcasm. Summing it up, the primary sentiment in this tweet can be described as humorous and light-hearted, given the use of wordplay and made-up terms to poke fun at the idea that damaging a laptop could be treated like a crime. The slight element of concern for the laptop also keeps the overall sentiment from being solely focused on humor, but it remains a casual and amusing statement."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

He becomes a taxi driver to cope with his chronic insomnia, driving passengers every night around the boroughs of New York City. He also spends time in seedy porn theaters and keeps a diary. Travis becomes infatuated with Betsy, a campaign volunteer for Senator and presidential candidate Charles Palantine. After watching her interact with fellow worker Tom through her window, Travis enters to volunteer as a pretext to talk to her, and takes her out for coffee.

His attempts at reconciliation by sending flowers are rebuffed, so he berates her at the campaign office, before being kicked out by Tom.

Strasser loses his right thumb and trigger finger to Joe, and swears revenge. Twelve years later, Jill has raised Joe, now grown to a height of 16Â 1â2 feet (5Â m) weighting 2,200 pounds (1,000Â kg). As a result, other gorillas won't accept him and both are now living in relative peace until a wildlife refuge director, Gregg O'Hara, convinces Jill they would be safer from poachers if they relocate to the United States. The trio goes to Los Angeles, and win the hearts of the refuge staff at the conservancy, who put Jill in charge of Joe. Jill is approached by Strasser, now running a fraudulent Animal Preserve in Botswana, while actually selling animal organs on the black market. He saw a news report about Joe and is eager for revenge. At first Jill does not recognize Strasser, since Strasser's right hand is hidden in his coat pocket. He tries to convince Jill that Joe would be better off in his wildlife refuge back in Africa. During a gala, Strasser's henchman, Garth, uses a poacher's noisemaker to scare Joe into a frenzy. Joe in a fit of rage trashes the gala, with the intention of attacking Strasser. Joe is captured and placed in a concrete bunker. Before their departure, Gregg has fallen in love with Jill and kisses her goodbye. When Jill learns that Joe may be euthanized, she takes Strasser's offer. She and the refuge staff smuggle Joe out in a truck. On the way to the airport, Jill notices the half-glove covering Strasser's missing fingers, and realizes who he is. She fights Strasser and Garth, then jumps from the truck onto Hollywood Boulevard, leading to several automobile accidents. Joe sees her and rocks the truck over onto its side and escapes.

As the Ferris wheel rolls towards the child, Joe sees the imminent danger and abandons his own fear to try to save the child. He pushes his strength beyond limits, managing to stop the rolling Ferris wheel in its tracks just in time. With the Ferris wheel now teetering dangerously, Joe carefully retrieves the child from the wreckage and passes the young boy into the waiting arms of Gregg, Jill, and rescue workers below. The crowd witnesses Joe putting himself in mortal danger to save the child, dispelling any belief that he is a dangerous animal. Despite his heroic act, Joe is severely injured, having suffered physical strain and several cuts and bruises. As Gregg and Jill tend to the injured Joe, they share their love for each other and their determination to protect both Joe and his future. Meanwhile, the police and animal control officers pursue and confront Strasser and Garth. A violent altercation ensues, leading to the deaths of Garth and Strasser. With the malicious poachers no longer a threat to Joe's safety, Jill, Gregg, and the refuge staff are able to focus on Joe's recovery and his relocation to a safer, more protected environment. Ultimately, Joe recovers from his injuries under the loving care of Jill, Gregg, and the wildlife refuge staff. Thanks to the heroism he displayed in saving the child, public sentiment becomes overwhelmingly supportive of Joe, leading to increased efforts to preserve the habitat and protect his gorilla family and other endangered species. In the end, Joe is relocated to a vast natural reserve where he enjoys protection and freedom.

Viktor (Bill Nighy) has built up an army of vampires to fight off the threat and have begun the process of exterminating the lycans. It appears that when someone is infected by a lycan, they transform into werewolves, but do not change back and appear to behave like vicious animals rather than people. However, one day, in a prison cell, Viktor hears the cries of a human child, and investigates. What he discovers is a human child born of a lycan later named Lucian. Viktor contemplates killing the child, but could not bring himself to do it.Lucian grows up, and appears to be stronger and more focused than others of his kind; this is evident when Viktor tests him by making him fight vampires. Viktor decides to make more of Lucians kind (the new lycans that have human form). Viktor uses Lucian to make more like him by starving him and letting him feed on human slaves. The ones that survived became the new lycans, a new slave race to serve the vampires. The vampires think they have control of the lycans, but this may not be the case for long.Note: there are two types of were-wolves in this film, ones that are permanently in wolf form and wild, and ones that can transform when its a full moon and are in service to the vampires.

In 1929 young Brooklynite Moss Hart, influenced by the great playwrights, devotes his leisure time to writing for the theater. Failing in his aspirations, however, he accepts a job as social director in the Catskills and then stages plays at the YMHA in Newark. Eventually he takes the advice of agent Richard Maxwell and writes a comedy, Once in a Lifetime, which deals with the early days of Hollywood films, despite the fact that his knowledge of the movie industry is derived from the pages of Variety.

Although Kaufman consents, the Atlantic City opening is a failure, and he considers quitting until Hart comes up with an idea that both men feel will turn the play into a hit.

Background: Simply Red are a British soul and pop band which formed in 1985 in Manchester. The lead singer of the band was the singer and songwriter Mick Hucknall, who, by the time the band was disbanded in 2010, was the only original member left. Since the release of their debut studio album Picture Book (1985), they have had ten songs reach top 10 in the UK Singles Chart, including \\"Holding Back the Years\\" and \\"If You Don't Know Me by Now\\", both of which reached number one on the US Billboard Hot 100. They have had five number one albums in the UK, with their 1991 album, Stars, one of the best-selling albums in UK chart history. Context: McIntyre, the only original remaining band member aside from lead singer Hucknall, left the group after the Life album, as did Pereira. From that time in 1996, Simply Red was essentially a trade name for Hucknall and a bevy of session musicians, which would vary from track to track (and gig to gig) as needed, although all post-1996 Simply Red albums and live shows did include contributions from sax player Ian Kirkham. Returning drummer Gota Yashiki (co-producing several album tracks) and backing vocalist Dee Johnson were also frequently involved with the band's later recordings and shows, as was new keyboardist/co-producer Andy Wright. The group issued the compilation album Greatest Hits in 1996, reportedly against Hucknall's wishes. The album featured one new track, a cover of the 1973 Aretha Franklin hit \\"Angel\\" which was co-produced with The Fugees (who also served as backing musicians). Released as a single, \\"Angel\\" reached #4 in the UK. 1998 saw the release of the cover-heavy Blue, which produced four UK top 40 singles, including the top 10 hits \\"Say You Love Me\\" and \\"The Air That I Breathe\\". The follow-up album, 1999's Love and the Russian Winter, was a relative disappointment, spawning two minor hits that failed to break the top 10. Simply Red were dropped from their label, East West Records in April 2000. Hucknall subsequently set up the website Simplyred.com to handle releases of new recordings; the new label/website venture proved to be quite successful, many of the band's Simplyred.com releases selling and charting almost as well as their earlier recordings. Question: what was the point of the website? Answer:","completion":"The point of the Simplyred.com website was to handle the releases of new recordings for Simply Red after they were dropped from their label, East West Records. By setting up the website, Mick Hucknall was able to maintain control over the band's music output and continue to share their work with fans. The website venture proved to be quite successful, as many of the band's releases through Simplyred.com sold and charted almost as well as their earlier recordings under a traditional record label. This allowed Simply Red to continue their musical career and reach their audience without the constraints of a label."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

What happens next? How to adjust a garage door spring Recognize side-mounted extension springs. There are two kinds of springs your garage door might use: side-mounted extension springs or torsion springs. Before you can adjust the spring on your garage door, you must determine what kind of springs your door has. Pick your answer from: A). Side-mounted extension springs are larger than torsion springs. Torsion springs refer to the way the door is mounted.; B). Side-mounted extension springs can allow easy installation to a new door if you are unsure how to attach one. Torsion springs are similar but have triangular openings from which to attach the spring.; C). Side-mounted springs are easier to adjust, while torsion springs are more dangerous to meddle with, so you would be better off calling a professional if you have these. Side-mounted extension springs run above and parallel to the door track, and they'll have an attached pulley and cable.; D). Side-mounted spring springs are also known as \\" folded springs. \\" the springs are usually used to secure a door latch so that it will not move when the door opens.;","completion":"C). Side-mounted springs are easier to adjust, while torsion springs are more dangerous to meddle with, so you would be better off calling a professional if you have these. Side-mounted extension springs run above and parallel to the door track, and they'll have an attached pulley and cable. To adjust a garage door spring, you will need to follow these steps: 1. Unplug the garage door opener: Before beginning any work on your garage door, always disconnect the garage door opener from power to prevent any accidents. 2. Gather necessary tools: You will need a sturdy ladder, two C-Clamp locking pliers, a wrench, gloves, and safety goggles to adjust the side-mounted extension springs safely. 3. Observe safety precautions: Besides wearing safety glasses and gloves, make sure the garage door is fully closed and no one is around during the adjustment process. 4. Secure the garage door: To prevent the door from opening suddenly during the adjustment process, use the C-Clamp locking pliers to secure the door to the vertical track on either side. 5. Loosen the spring: Identify the side-mounted extension spring that requires adjustment, and use the wrench to loosen the bolt and nut that hold it in place. Be cautious not to fully remove the hardware. 6. Adjust the tension: If your door was too difficult to open, carefully stretch the spring away from the door to increase tension. If it was challenging to close, you need to compress the spring towards the door to decrease tension. Make small adjustments and test the door to observe any changes in the operation. 7. Secure the hardware: Once the desired tension is achieved, use the wrench to tighten the nut and bolt securely while holding the spring in place. 8. Test the door: Carefully remove the C-Clamps from the vertical tracks and plug in the garage door opener. Test the door several times to ensure smooth and balanced operation. 9. Keep an eye on the balance: Adjusting the garage door spring can alter the door's balance. If the door's balance is off, you might need to adjust the other spring as well, following the steps above. Remember, if you are unsure of your ability to adjust the garage door spring or if you have torsion springs, it is best to call a professional to perform the adjustments. Garage door springs are under high tension, and mishandling them can result in severe injury or property damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

However, this statement does not explicitly convey the color of the paint being used, or if the man is indeed painting the building purple. To reach the conclusion that \\"The man is painting the building purple,\\" we need more details or additional context that specifically identifies the color purple as relevant to the situation. Correlations without enough information may lead to jumping to conclusions or making assumptions that may not be accurate. For example, further context may be provided in the following ways: 1. A clear statement provided: \\"The man in the blue shirt on a ladder is painting the building purple.\\" This basic sentence explicitly states that the man is using purple paint to cover the building. 2. The color is introduced through a description of the scene or the paint: \\"The man in the blue shirt on a ladder is painting the building with a vibrant shade of purple.\\" This additional information indicates that purple paint is being used in this particular scene. 3. A visual representation of the scene (like an image or video): If a visual aid were available, it could display the man on a ladder with purple paint dripping from his brush or a partially-painted purple building in the background.

Keene and Alexandra Kaczenski of the Getty Museum’s Manuscripts Department have spent the last few years preparing for an exhibition and publication titled Sacred Landscapes: Nature in Renaissance Manuscripts that aims to examine representations of “green spaces” such as gardens, vistas, and their relation to the divine. In particular, Bryan and Alexandra focus on the ways in which artists during the European Middle Ages and Renaissance embedded the pages of illuminated manuscripts with depictions of the natural world so that nature could guide prayer, chant, and meditation. For Bryan, this project represents a continuation of his interest in sacred gardens that began with his graduate work on the garden imagery that influenced Botticelli’s Agony in the Garden painting. In 2013 he curated the exhibition and authored the accompanying book Gardens of the Renaissance. For Alexandra, interest in this subject stems from her scholarly focus on Flemish manuscripts and their relation to Flemish landscape paintings. She brought to the project a complementary interest in issues of environmental and landscape destruction, which also were themes of the exhibition and publication. Though floral and nature studies of the Renaissance and Early Modern periods have been extensively investigated—the scientific notebooks of Leonardo da Vinci, for example, are well documented—this exhibition turns its focus on landscape and the divine. Curatorial research has shed new light on subjects such as the seemingly “scattered” floral arrangements represented within the pages of these books and their relationship to humoral theory and religion. Bryan adds, “The tension that we find in these borders is, on the one hand, intricately rendered leaf and petal structures of plants or flowers, and on the other, hidden whimsical elements, all of which combine to create a rich tapestry of meaning, both symbolic and scientific. Alex and I will continue to explore the potential meaning within this botanical and arboreal chaos.” Sacred... Question: Who authored Gardens of the Resaissance?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. and the situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Answer the following question: Which lake will have less algae? Answer:","completion":"Lake Costanza will have less algae compared to Lake Montopeke, and there are several factors contributing to this outcome. First, as mentioned in the background information, rain plays a crucial role in dissolving fertilizer in the soil. The farm next to Lake Montopeke receives regular rainfall, which means that a substantial amount of fertilizer will be dissolved in the soil, increasing the likelihood of runoff being carried away. In contrast, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza experiences very little rain, which implies that less fertilizer will be dissolved in the soil. Second, the runoff carrying dissolved fertilizer in the farm near Lake Montopeke will transport these nutrients into the nearby water body. Consequently, Lake Montopeke will receive a higher concentration of nitrogen from the fertilizer. As explained in the background, nitrogen boosts the growth of algae, and higher levels of nitrogen lead to excessive algae growth. On the other hand, the farm next to Lake Costanza receives very little rain, which results in less runoff and a lower amount of dissolved fertilizer entering the lake. This means that the concentration of nitrogen in Lake Costanza will be comparatively lower than in Lake Montopeke. Since the amount of nitrogen in a body of water is directly related to the growth of algae, Lake Costanza, with its lower nitrogen concentration, will consequently have less algae growth compared to Lake Montopeke. This is primarily due to the difference in rainfall, which affects the dissolution of fertilizer in the soil, the runoff, and the subsequent introduction of nitrogen to the lakes. Both farms may be able to prosper and do well, but the impact of their agricultural practices on the adjacent lakes will differ due to the varying levels of rainfall each farm experiences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Following the Pixies' breakup, Lovering drummed with several artists, including Nitzer Ebb, but turned down an invitation to join the Foo Fighters. Lovering then joined Santiago's band The Martinis, appearing on their song \\"Free\\" on the soundtrack of Empire Records. However, he soon left the band to become a touring drummer for Cracker. Lovering moved from band to band, drumming with Tanya Donelly's group on 1997's Lovesongs for Underdogs and with Boston band Eeenie Meenie. After facing difficulty finding new work, Lovering gave up the drums and moved into a rented house that banned drumming.Towards the end of the 1990s, Lovering's friend Grant-Lee Phillips took him to a magic convention. Lovering was very impressed by some of the illusions, and later said \\"I had to learn how to do it\\". Mutual friend Carl Grasso invited them to a show at the Magic Castle, a magic-oriented nightclub in Los Angeles. There Lovering met Possum Dixon frontman Rob Zabrecky, and the pair soon became friends. Zabrecky convinced Lovering to apply for a performers' membership to the Magic Castle. After gaining his membership, Lovering reinvented himself as \\"The Scientific Phenomenalist\\". His act combined his electrical engineering knowledge with his stage performance experience. His decision to pursue a career in magic was influenced by the fact that as a musician, he \\"couldn't top the Pixies\\".As the Scientific Phenomentalist, Lovering performs science and physics experiments in a lab coat while on stage.

Among the topics we address in our course is the retention of quality employees-a real challenge to managers when you consider the pay scale in the service industry. During these discussions, I ask the participants , \\"What has caused you to stay long enough to become a manager?\\" Some time back a new manager took the question and slowly, with her voice almost breaking, said, \\"It was a 19 baseball glove.\\" Cynthia told the group that she originally took a Circle K clerk job as an interim position while she looked for something better. On her second or third day behind the counter, she received a phone call from her nine-year-old son, Jessie. He needed a baseball glove for Little League. She explained that as a single mother, money was very tight, and her first check would have to go for paying bills. Perhaps she could buy his baseball glove with her second or third check. When Cynthia arrived for work the next morning, Patricia, the store manager, asked her to come to the small room in the back of the store that served as an office. Cynthia wondered if she had done something wrong or left some part of her job incomplete from the day before. She was concerned and confused. Patricia handed her a box. \\"I overheard you talking to your son yesterday,\\" she said, \\"and I know that it is hard to explain things to kids. This is a baseball glove for Jessie because he may not understand how important he is, even though you have to pay bills before you can buy gloves. You know we can't pay good people like you as much as we would like to; but we do care, and I want you to know you are important to us.\\" The thoughtfulness, empathy and love of this convenience store manager demonstrates vividly that people remember more how much an employer cares than how much the employer pays.

Both statements provide the following information: 1. There are two people. 2. These two people are of different genders - a man and a woman. 3. They are both wearing clothing that is representative of the Costa Rican culture. The first statement presents the information in a more casual and conversational tone, using a simple subject-verb-object structure. The subject is \\"a man and woman,\\" the verb is \\"wearing,\\" and the object is \\"their cultural Costa Rican wear.\\" The sentence suggests that the two people, a man and a woman, are wearing traditional clothing that represents Costa Rican culture. On the other hand, the second statement restructures the information using a more logical format. In this case, the subject is \\"Two people,\\" followed by the defined specification of their attire by using the phrase \\"dressed in cultural Costa Rican wear.\\" The sentence then provides additional identifying information about the people by mentioning that they consist of a man and a woman. The second statement emphasizes the number of people and their attire before stating their gender. To sum up, it is logically consistent that \\"A man and woman wearing their cultural Costa Rican wear\\" is equivalent to \\"Two people are dressed in cultural Costa Rican wear, a man and a woman.\\" The main difference between the two statements lies in their structure and phrasing, but the overall meaning remains the same.

The sudden burst of spring produce in the market after a long, monotonous winter of cavolo nero and bright oranges is one of the things that constantly reminds me why I love living and eating in Italy. A wander through the market like any other becomes, in spring time, a new experience. I feel like a fresh arrival, like it’s my first time walking through my local market. There are long, twisty fava bean pods, waiting to be podded and munched on with bitey pecorino cheese to tame the bitterness of the raw beans. Thin, long-stemmed asparagus. A lovely array of greens, including radishes with leaves so happy that they become the main ingredient, fluffy-fronded fresh herbs and fresh garlic. Artichokes of many different kinds, but especially the pointed purple ones that are either local, from Tuscany’s Maremma, or sometimes from Puglia or Sicily. Rarely the rounded globe artichokes you find spilling out of crates in Rome, or the tiny, delicate Venetian ones, the so-called castraure (though they often aren’t the real deal, how you can tell is by the price) that you can find in the shadow of the Rialto. And then there are thick bunches of agretti (salsola soda), looking more like mermaid’s hair than a monk’s beard, their English namesake.

It’s worth getting up and out of the house a little earlier for these (a note to myself, of course).

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: A Deep Dive Into Maritime History: The Remarkable Collection of Ray Ives Goes on Display Subtitle: Plymouth's residents and maritime enthusiasts now get to experience the incredible collection of deep-sea treasures curated by legendary diver, Ray Ives. During a time when people are increasingly distancing from the hustle and bustle of the world, treasures from the depths of the ocean bring a sense of adventure, evoking memories of maritime history and tales of shipwrecks besieged by battling empires. The mesmerizing collection of Ray Ives, a passionate deep-sea diver from Plymouth, Devon, breathes life into these stories as his extensive assortment of artifacts goes on display in a newly established museum. For many years, Ives, a seasoned treasure hunter and marine-life expert, has been meticulously collecting relics from his deep-sea dives. His collection boasts a striking range of historical items, including cannonballs, muskets, swords, and the crowning jewel of his compilation: the bell from an ocean liner that was tragically sunk by a German U-boat during World War I. This rich assemblage of maritime antiques is bound to captivate those with an affinity for the ocean or a curiosity for bygone eras. Ives' initial enthusiasm for deep-sea exploration and fascination for the secrets hidden within the ocean's depths eventually transformed into an outstanding career. His unrelenting dedication to safeguarding his discoveries led him to house his collection in a tiny shed at his home in Plymouth. Subsequently, the wealth of history contained within his trove remained hidden from the public eye—a massive cache of shipwreck findings and war relics, patiently awaiting an opportunity to resurface and recapture the hearts and minds of history enthusiasts and casual observers alike. That golden opportunity has finally arrived. The treasures that lay dormant in Ray Ives' humble shed have now been relocated and given their rightful place under the spotlight in a newly erected, albeit ramshackle, museum. This extraordinary exhibit provides an exclusive opportunity for visitors to embark on an exploratory journey into the depths of the sea, delving into the stories behind the artifacts and the various tempestuous circumstances under which they were claimed by the ocean. Apart from satisfying the curiosity of maritime adventurers, the museum also aims to educate its visitors about the art of deep-sea diving, treasure hunting, and the importance of preserving the submerged testimonies of history that these artifacts represent. It highlights the role Ray Ives has played in bringing these stories to life and heralds his unwavering commitment to share his findings with the world. The museum, nestled within the harbor town of Plymouth, is a delightful and enchanting addition to the local culture, further emphasizing the region's strong maritime tradition. While the façade may be humble, the extraordinary array of treasures meticulously gathered by Ray Ives is nothing short of awe-inspiring, offering an enticing experience to those willing to immerse themselves in the wonders hidden beneath the ocean's surface. As you navigate through the corridors of this unique museum, be prepared to be transported back in time. Unravel the stories locked within each artifact, and let your imagination embark on a journey through the uncharted waters of history and the maritime legacy that helped shape the world we know today. With every discovery comes a tale of triumph and disaster, etched in the echoes of time, now revealed through the incredible collection of Ray Ives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less larvae matures happens, how will it affect LESS butterflies. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you provided suggests that if fewer larvae mature inside the eggs, it will result in fewer butterflies. This proposed change does have a direct effect on the butterfly lifecycle process. Let's analyze how this may impact the process: 1. A butterfly lays an egg: Since the perturbation hypothesis does not mention any changes at this stage, we can assume the same number of eggs are being laid. 2. A larvae matures inside of the egg: According to the perturbation hypothesis, fewer larvae mature at this stage. This could be due to various factors, such as unfavorable environmental conditions, diseases, or predation of eggs by other insects and creatures. 3. The caterpillar hatches from the egg: With fewer larvae maturing inside the eggs, there will be fewer caterpillars hatching from the eggs. 4. The caterpillar eats and grows: The reduced number of caterpillars will result in less consumption of food (mainly leaves), leading to less growth overall. 5. The caterpillar spins a cocoon around itself and forms into a pupa: With fewer caterpillars, there will be fewer cocoons and pupae formed. 6. The butterfly forms inside of the cocoon: Since there are fewer pupae, fewer butterflies will develop within the cocoons. 7. The mature butterfly emerges from the cocoon: As a direct consequence of having fewer butterflies forming inside the cocoons, fewer mature butterflies will emerge. 8. The butterfly mates: The reduced butterfly population may lead to fewer mating opportunities, potentially affecting the genetic diversity of the species and overall population numbers. 9. The female butterfly lays eggs: With fewer mating events, there could be a decrease in the number of eggs laid, subsequently affecting the overall butterfly population. In conclusion, the perturbation hypothesis suggesting that fewer mature larvae will lead to fewer butterflies does have a direct effect on the entire butterfly lifecycle process. With fewer butterflies, a series of consequences may follow, including reduced food consumption, fewer mating events, and a possible decline in overall butterfly population numbers."},{"prompt":"Teacher:You are given a sentence in Persian.

To do that, we will add 862*d to both sides to get rid of the -862*d on the right side. When we do that, we have: -905*d + 862*d - 645 = 0 Now we combine the terms with 'd' on the left side: (-905 + 862)*d - 645 = 0 -43*d - 645 = 0 Now, we want to isolate the term with 'd' on one side. We do this by adding 645 to both sides of the equation: -43*d = 645 Now to find the value of 'd', we need to divide both sides by -43: d = 645 / -43 d = -15 So, the value of d is -15.

Information: - The Scottish Football League (SFL) was a league featuring professional and semi-professional football clubs mostly from Scotland. From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL represented the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Ayrshire is a historic county in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde. It is also, under the name the County of Ayr, a registration county. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800. - The Old Firm is the collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, who are both based in Glasgow. The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as \\"like two old, firm friends\\", and represents the commercial benefits of the two clubs' rivalry. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original 11 members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890. The rivalry between the two clubs has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture and has contributed to the political, social and religious division in Scotland and also beyond, especially in neighbouring Northern Ireland. As a result, the fixture was recognised as having enduring appeal. - The Scottish Junior Football Association (\\"SJFA\\" for short) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term \\"junior\\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that non-league football in Scotland is not similarly integrated into its football league system. Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by three regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland's national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 188081 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season. - The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship. - Robert Stevenson \`\` Bobby '' Donnelly ( born 19 January 1987 ) is a Scottish professional footballer currently playing as a defender for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the Scottish Junior Football Association , West Region . He has previously played in the Scottish Premier League for Motherwell . - Girvan (\\"mouth of the River Girvan\\") is a burgh in Carrick, South Ayrshire, Scotland. Girvan is stituated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland. - South Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland, covering the southern part of Ayrshire. It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. South Ayrshire Council is a Conservative controlled council. The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington - located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick - being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the Firth of Clyde. - The Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region is one of three regions of the SJFA which organise their own distinct league and cup competitions.

I have been a teacher for many years and so many of my students have done nice things for me…..they are just nice people. I retired last year and was a substitute teacher this last school year. In June a teacher I had just subbed for a half day needed emergency surgery and I was asked to go in and finish her year. Good thing it was in an area I knew…English and Social at the grade 9 level. The kids were pretty good…some were a handful but most of them were very accommodating. They were also writing important provincial exams at the end of the year and were getting stressed out about it. As I was getting them ready to write their exam, I took a few moments to thank them for welcoming me into their classroom and making my job…while not easy….at least a rewarding experience. One boy who seemed to complain about everything….thanked me for taking ownership and preparing them for final exams. I had recognized that his argumentative nature was his way of dealing with stress and tried not to let it affect my teaching. That mostly worked. There was a time when I told him, quite loudly, that if he had spent his time getting ready to do assignments instead of arguing…he could have been finished days ago. He just nodded his head and got to work. It was a nice gesture that he was able to thank me for doing my job….that he recognized that some things were out of his control and to just get on with it. A life lesson that I am still learning, by the way. Every day lately, I have had something nice happen to me with my students. I am feeling blessed.

And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule.

But I had no matches, they had taken those. I looked through the bars at my jailer . He did not make eye contact with me. I called out to him \\"Have you got a light?\\" He looked at me and came over to light my cigarette. As he came close and lit the cigarette, his eyes absently locked with mine. At that moment, I smiled. I don't know why I did that. Perhaps it was nervousness, perhaps it was because, when you get very close, one to another, it is very hard not to smile. Anyway, I smiled. I know he didn't want to, but my smile went through the bars and generated a smile on his lips, too. He lit my cigarette but stayed near, looking at me directly in the eyes and continuing to smile. I kept smiling at him, now considering him as a person and not just a jailer. \\"Do you have kids?\\" he asked. \\"Yes, here, here.\\" I took out my wallet and nervously felt the pictures of my family. He, too, took out the pictures of his family and began to talk about his plans and hopes for them. My eyes were filled with tears. I said that I was scared that I'd never see my family again, never have the chance to see them grow up. Tears came to his eyes, too.

Summarize the following: There are a few main aspects of your table that you'll want to know before creating one: Title — Your title will go directly after the \\"create table\\" command, and must follow the same rules as your database's name (e.g., no spaces). Column Heading — You can determine column headings by typing different names into a set of parentheses (see the next step's example). Cell Length — When determining cell length, you'll use either \\"VARCHAR\\" (variable characters, meaning that you can type in between one and the VARCHAR's limit number of characters) or \\"CHAR\\" (requires no more and no less than the specified number of characters; for example, CHAR(1) requires one character, CHAR(3) requires three characters, and so on). Date — If you want to add a date to your chart, you'll use the \\"DATE\\" command to indicate that the column's contents will be formatted as a date. The date should be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format. Before you can input data for your chart, you'll need to create the chart's structure by typing in the following and then pressing ↵ Enter: create table name (column1 varchar(20), column2 varchar(30), column3 char(1), column4 date); For example, to create a table called \\"Pets\\" with two VARCHAR columns, a CHAR column, and a date column, you might write the following: create table Pets (Name varchar(20), Breed varchar(30), Sex char(1), DOB date); Using the \\"insert\\" command, you can enter your database's information line-by-line: insert into name values ('column1 value', 'column2 value', 'column3 value', 'column4 value'); For the \\"Pets\\" table example used previously, your line might look like this: insert into Pets values ('Fido', 'Husky', 'M', '2017-04-12'); You can enter the word NULL for a column's contents if the column is blank. If your database is relatively small, you can insert the rest of the data line-by-line by using the \\"insert\\" code. If you elect to do this, skip the next step. If you have a database which requires more lines of information than are practical to insert by hand, you can reference a text file that contains the data by using the following code: load data local infile '/path/name.txt' into table name lines terminated by 'rn'; For the \\"Pets\\" example, you would write something like the following: load data local infile 'C:/Users/name/Desktop/pets.txt' into table Pets lines terminated by 'rn'; On a Mac computer, you'll need to use the \\"lines terminated by\\" command with 'r' instead of 'rn'. Enter the show databases; command, then select your database by typing in select * from name; where \\"name\\" is the database's name.

With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: American researchers have developed a technique that may become an important tool in fighting AIDS virus from attacking its target-cells in the body's defense system.When AIDS virus enters the blood,it searches for blood cells called T4 lymphocytes .The virus connects to the outside of T4 lymphocytes.Then it forces its way inside.There it directs the cells' genetic material to produce copies of the AIDS virus.This is how AIDS spreads. Researchers think they may be able to stop AIDS from connecting to T4 ceils.When AIDS virus finds a T4 cell,it actually connects to a part of the cell called CD4 protein. Researchers want to fool the virus by putting copies or clones of the CD4 protein into the blood.This way the AIDS virus will connect to cloned protein instead of the real ones.Scientists use genetic engineering methods to make the clones.Normally a CD4 protein remains on the T4 cell at all times;the AIDS virus must go to it. In a new technique,however,the cloned CD4 protein is not connected to a cell.It floats freely,so a lot more can be put into the blood to keep the AIDS virus away from real CD4 protein on T4 cells.One report says the.AIDS virus connects to cloned protein just as effectively as it connects to real protein.That report was based on tests with blood cells grown in labs.The technique is just now beginning to be tested in animals.If successful,it may be tested in humans within a year. The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following strategies are American researchers developing to prevent the AIDS virus from attacking T4 lymphocytes in the body's defense system?

The hypothesis states that \\"Adrin told the man to run away or he would hurt him.\\" This statement suggests that Adrin may have given the man a warning or a choice before taking a harmful action against him. Now, let's consider whether the premise entails the hypothesis: - The premise only provides information about Adrin's action (using the pistol) and does not mention any communication or warning given to the man. - The hypothesis is about Adrin's possible statement or warning to the man before performing the action mentioned in the premise.

They believed that He was coming again in a very little while during their own life-time, in a few months or years, to make an end of the world and to judge the quick and the dead. And as they waited for His coming, one generation after another, and yet He did not come, a sadness fell upon them. Christ seemed to have left the world. The little while that He had promised to be away seemed to have become a very long while. Hundreds of years passed, and yet Christ did not come in glory. And, as I said, a sadness fell on all the Church. Surely, they said, this is the time of which Christ said we were to weep and lament till we saw Him again--this is the time of which He said that the bridegroom should be taken from us, and we should fast in those days. And they did fast, and weep, and lament; and their religion became a very sad and melancholy one--most sad in those who were most holy, and loved their Lord best, and longed most for His coming in glory.

A ten-year-old girl who was born with no kidneys and has endured 27 major operations is celebrating after having her final operation. Alice Skinner, from Hartlepool, was born with stumps for kidneys after they failed to develop in the womb. But after years of treatment, tests and surgery, she is now looking forward to her 11th birthday next month. Celebrating: Alice Skinner has finally had her last operation after enduring 27 in the past ten years after she was born without kidneys. Her final operation took place two weeks ago after three years of dialysis affected her legs and caused them to become bowed. Her father George, 41, said: 'There were times when we thought she wouldn’t make it. 'We see each birthday as a milestone. We never thought we would see this far. She’s a proper grown-up little lady now too.' Alice's condition affects just one baby in a. million born in the UK and she came close to death many times. When she was six months old she became the youngest person in the UK to receive dialysis. Her family then made trips three times a week to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for dialysis as she waited for a transplant. Alice just after she was diagnosed with malformed kidneys when she was only six-months-old. Both parents were unsuitable as donors and doctors were running out of veins to place her on dialysis. In April 2008, she finally had a transplant with an imperfect match as no perfect match could be found. That operation allowed her to make up for lost time by drinking Coca Cola, eating chocolate and crisps and all the other food that had previously been banned. However a year later she suffered a setback which saw her needing brain surgery after fluid build-up in her head. Her father added: 'The surgeons were really quite surprised she got through it and said, \\"We don’t know how she’s still here\\".' He continued: 'Being on dialysis for. seven years took its toll on her. It affected her calcium levels because. there was no absorption through kidneys, so her knees bowed out. 'That has just been corrected in an operation. She’s had two hinges put into both her knee caps to stretch them out. “It’s a big operation, but she was looking forward to getting it done. 'After the operation she had an. epidural for two days to make sure she had no pain and after that she. was put on morphine, but she was out of hospital within days, tottering. around the house on crutches. 'She’s had 27 operations in 10 years and that’s quite enough for anyone. Proud: Alice's father George has spoken of her battle and said there were time when he was worried she wouldn't make it through. 'We hope that’s the last big one. though - she’ll need to have the hinges out at some point, but we would. like the operations to stop now, thank you.' Despite her problems Alice has taken up table-tennis, representing Newcastle as a member of the hospital's Children’s Transplant Games Team. Last year, she travelled to Belfast for the British Transplant Games and won a silver medal. She had previously been awarded a ‘Child of Courage’ award for her health problems when she was aged three. Highlights:","completion":"- Ten-year-old Alice Skinner, born with no kidneys, recently had her final major operation after enduring 27 surgeries in her young life. - Born with kidney stumps that failed to develop in the womb, Alice faced numerous treatments, tests, and operations to maximize her chances of survival. - At six months old, she became the youngest person in the UK to receive dialysis and frequently visited the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle for treatment. - An imperfect kidney transplant in April 2008 allowed Alice to enjoy previously restricted food and drink like Coca Cola, chocolate, and crisps. - In spite of setbacks, including brain surgery for fluid buildup, Alice participated in table tennis competitions like the British Transplant Games and won a silver medal. - Alice's father, George, expressed hope that the most recent surgery would be her last major operation, highlighting her resilience and courage throughout her life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I remember well the polished old case fastened to the wall. The shiny receiver hung on the side of the box. I was too little to reach the telephone, but used to listen with great interest when my mother used to talk to it. Then I discovered that somewhere inside the wonderful device lived an amazing person-- her name was Information Please and there was nothing she did not know. Information Please could supply anybody's number. My first personal experience with Information Please came one day while my mother was visiting a neighbor. I accidentally hit my finger with a hammer. The pain was terrible, but there didn't seem to be any reason in crying because there was no one home to give sympathy. I walked around the house sucking my hurting finger, finally arriving at the stairway--the telephone! Climbing up I unhooked the receiver and held it to my ear. \\"Information Please,\\" I said. A click or two and a small clear voice spoke into my ear, \\"Information.\\" \\"I hurt my finger...\\" I cried. The tears came readily enough now that I had an audience. \\"Isn't your mother home?\\" came the question. \\"Nobody's home but me.\\" I sobbed. \\"Are you bleeding?\\" \\"No,\\" I replied. \\"I hit my finger with the hammer and it hurts.\\" \\"Can you open your icebox?\\" she asked. I said I could. \\"Then chip off a little piece of ice and hold it to your finger.\\" After that I called Information Please for everything. I asked her for help with my geography and she told me where Philadelphia was. And there was the time that Petey, our pet canary died. I called Information Please and told her the sad story. She listened, and then said the usual things grown-ups say to comfort a child. But I was Why is it that birds should sing so beautifully and bring joy to all families, only to end up as a heap of feathers, feet up on the bottom of a cage?

Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who had ten more children with his third wife? ? Bedřich Smetana, first named Friedrich Smetana, was born on 2 March 1824, in Litomyšl (German: Leitomischl), east of Prague near the traditional border between Bohemia and Moravia, then provinces of the Habsburg Empire. He was the third child, and first son, of František Smetana and his third wife Barbora Lynková. František had fathered eight children in two earlier marriages, five daughters surviving infancy; he and Barbora had ten more children, of whom seven reached adulthood. At this time, under Habsburg rule, German was the official language of Bohemia. František knew Czech but, for business and social reasons, rarely used it; and his children were ignorant of correct Czech until much later in their lives. The Smetana family came from the Hradec Králové (German: Königgrätz) region of Bohemia. František had initially learned the trade of a brewer, and had acquired moderate wealth during the Napoleonic Wars by supplying clothing and provisions to the French Army. He subsequently managed several breweries before coming to Litomyšl in 1823 as brewer to Count Waldstein, whose Renaissance castle dominates the town.The elder Smetana, although uneducated, had a natural gift for music and played in a string quartet. Bedřich was introduced to music by his father and in October 1830, at the age of six, gave his first public performance. At a concert held in Litomyšl's Philosophical Academy he played a piano arrangement of Auber's overture to La muette de Portici, to a rapturous reception. In 1831 the family moved to Jindřichův Hradec in the south of Bohemia—the region where, a generation later, Gustav Mahler grew up. Here, Smetana attended the local elementary school and later the gymnasium. He also studied violin and piano, discovering the works of Mozart and Beethoven, and began composing simple pieces, of which one, a dance (Kvapiček, or \\"Little Galop\\"), survives in sketch form.In 1835, František retired to a farm in the south-eastern region of Bohemia. There being no suitable local school, Smetana was sent to...

This was first developed to help launch STOVL aircraft take off at far higher weights than is possible with a vertical or rolling takeoff on flat decks. Originally developed by the Royal Navy, it since has been adopted by many navies for smaller carriers. A ski-jump ramp works by converting some of the forward rolling movement of the aircraft into vertical velocity and is sometimes combined with the aiming of jet thrust partly downwards. This allows heavily loaded and fueled aircraft a few more precious seconds to attain sufficient air velocity and lift to sustain normal flight. Without a ski-jump launching fully loaded and fueled aircraft such as the Harrier would not be possible on a smaller flat deck ship before either stalling out or crashing directly into the sea.\\"?

Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

Not quite an inch thick of crunchy, buttery brittle goodness with every kind of nut that you can imagine in it (I recognized pecans and cashews, but couldn't stop eating long enough to do a thorough search). The daily flavor today was a hummingbird cupcake which was topped with a delicious cream cheese icing that was exactly the right amount of sweetness with exactly the right amount of icing.

When Dunlap is killed in a private plane crash, his will calls for Brittney to receive a small stipend until she finishes college, after which she will receive only 25,000 a year for life from the estate. The rest of Dunlap's assets, totaling 70 million, are to be left to a corporate trust, unless a blood heir can be found. Brittney's brash, relatively poor classmate Maya (Leila Arcieri) suddenly claims to be Dunlap's illegitimate daughter as the result of her mother's extramarital affair. She is ordered by a judge to submit to a DNA test, the result of which proves she is Dunlap's child. At the Dunlap home, Brittney hears a noise on her way to the wine cellar but it turns out to just be rats. Suddenly Maya appears and the girls reveal they are lovers before being joined by Dr. Julian Haynes (Joe Michael Burke), who had arranged the DNA test. The trio are in cahoots, running a scam to secure and share Dunlap's fortune. Insurance investigator Terence Bridge (Isaiah Washington), investigating the circumstances of the plane crash, finds out from Dunlap's medical records that Dunlap had scarlet fever as a child, one of the side effects of which can be sterility, and asks Dr. Haynes how Dunlap could have fathered a child. Dr. Haynes gets nervous about the plot unraveling and contacts Maya. He agrees to meet her and Brittney that night at the docks, where Maya shoots him. The two girls dispose of his body in Gator Alley. After Bridge learns the entire affair was planned, he shows up at the Dunlap home and demands half the money in return for not going to the police.

Paragraph: The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there. Question: \\"How old was Bunzy when she entered the abusive relationship?\\" Answer: \\"34\\" Based on the paragraph, is this answer correct","completion":"Yes, the answer is correct. Here is the step-by-step reasoning: 1. According to the paragraph, Gladys Bunzy said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years. 2. The paragraph also mentions that Bunzy is currently 40 years old. 3. To determine when she entered the abusive relationship, we need to subtract the duration of the relationship (8 years) from her current age (40 years). 4. This gives us 40 - 8 = 32. So, Bunzy was 32 years old when she entered the abusive relationship, which means the provided answer is incorrect. The correct answer should be \\"32\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dans le premier graphique, on observe que les honoraires des avocats de la défense varient considérablement d'un procès à l'autre, allant de montants relativement faibles à des sommes beaucoup plus importantes, selon les tribunaux. Cette inégalité peut être due à divers facteurs, tels que la complexité du cas, le temps requis pour la préparation de la défense, la réputation et l'expérience des avocats concernés et parfois même des facteurs systémiques et de régulation dans le domaine de la justice. Le deuxième graphique met en lumière la répartition des frais de défense entre les différents membres de l'équipe d'avocats. Il montre que les honoraires versés aux avocats principaux représentent généralement une part importante des coûts totaux, tandis que les honoraires des avocats adjoints et des assistants juridiques sont souvent plus faibles. Cette différence peut s'expliquer par le niveau d'expertise, les responsabilités et le nombre d'heures travaillées par chaque membre de l'équipe de défense. Il est crucial de comprendre les raisons de cette variabilité des frais de défense et de rechercher des moyens de garantir un accès équitable à une défense de qualité pour toutes les parties concernées.

The New York Times asserted that her \\"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\\" and questioned whether Swift was in the midst of a \\"quarter-life crisis\\". Swift has said that she is unwilling to discuss her personal life in public, as she believes that talking about it can be \\"a career weakness\\". Rolling Stone remarks upon her polite manner: \\"If this is Swift's game face, it must be tattooed on because it never drops.\\" The magazine also takes note of her \\"ease with glad-handing\\", and The Hollywood Reporter credits her as \\"the Best People Person since Bill Clinton\\". While presenting Swift an award for her humanitarian endeavors in 2012, Michelle Obama described her as a singer who \\"has rocketed to the top of the music industry but still keeps her feet on the ground, someone who has shattered every expectation of what a 22-year-old can accomplish\\". Swift considers Michelle Obama to be a role model. Swift is one of the most followed people on social media, and is known for her friendly interactions with her fans. She has delivered holiday gifts to fans by mail and in person, dubbed \\"Swiftmas\\". She considers it her \\"responsibility\\" to be conscious of her influence on young fans, and has said that her fans are \\"the longest and best relationship I have ever had\\".Often described by the media as \\"America's Sweetheart\\", Swift insists that \\"I don't live by all these rigid, weird rules that make me feel all fenced in. I just like the way that I feel like, and that makes me feel very free\\". She refuses to take part in overly sexualized photo-shoots, although Bloomberg L.P. views her as a sex symbol. Swift was named an Icon of American Style by Vogue in 2011. In 2014 she topped People's annual best dressed list. In 2015, she was named Woman of the Year at the Elle Style Awards, and ranked first in Maxim's Hot 100... Guess a valid title for it!

In the 1986 movie Nothing in Common, Jackie Gleason's character, Max Basner, gets fired (or unemployed) from his job as a clothing salesman. The scene, shot on a boat, shows Max's despair about being out of work. I was looking for some gesture that would allow Max to show his feelings. Jackie had far more experience at everything than I did, and at first I was frightened (very much afraid). What could I possibly tell \\"The Great One\\" about acting? Out of fear I decided to direct by suggestion, and I sat down with Gleason to talk about the scene. \\"So Max is sad, right?\\" I said. Gleason nodded. \\"And he's probably still carrying his pens with his name on them --- the ones he used to hand out to his customers, right?\\" Gleason nodded. \\" So what would you want to do with the pens after you were fired?\\" He was silent for a moment. \\"Why don't I throw them overboard (or all over the boat)?\\" I stood up and turned toward the crew. \\" Hey, everybody, Jackie has a wonderful idea. Let's shoot it.\\" After filming the scene, Gleason called me over and said with a smile, \\"Garry, what kind of wonderful idea am I going to have tomorrow?\\" You and your team can discover the answers to problems together.

The Agencies Confer When they learned a second plane had struck the World Trade Center, nearly everyone in the White House told us, they immediately knew it was not an accident. The Secret Service initiated a number of security enhancements around the White House complex. The officials who issued these orders did not know that there were additional hijacked aircraft, or that one such aircraft was en route to Washington. These measures were precautionary steps taken because of the strikes in New York. The FAA and White House Teleconferences. The FAA, the White House, and the Defense Department each initiated a multiagency teleconference before 9:30. Because none of these teleconferences-at least before 10:00- included the right officials from both the FAA and Defense Department, none succeeded in meaningfully coordinating the military and FAA response to the hijackings. At about 9:20, security personnel at FAA headquarters set up a hijacking teleconference with several agencies, including the Defense Department. The NMCC officer who participated told us that the call was monitored only periodically because the information was sporadic, it was of little value, and there were other important tasks. The FAA manager of the teleconference also remembered that the military participated only briefly before the Pentagon was hit. Both individuals agreed that the teleconference played no role in coordinating a response to the attacks of 9/11. Acting Deputy Administrator Belger was frustrated to learn later in the morning that the military had not been on the call. At the White House, the video teleconference was conducted from the Situation Room by Richard Clarke, a special assistant to the president long involved in counterterrorism. Logs indicate that it began at 9:25 and included the CIA; the FBI; the departments of State, Justice, and Defense; the FAA; and the White House shelter. The FAA and CIA joined at 9:40. The first topic addressed in the White House video teleconference-at about 9:40-was the physical security of the President, the White House, and federal agencies. Immediately thereafter it was reported that a plane had hit the Pentagon. We found no evidence that video teleconference participants had any prior information that American 77 had been hijacked and was heading directly toward Washington.

Context: Zinc is more reactive than iron or steel and thus will attract almost all local oxidation until it completely corrodes away. A protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) forms as the zinc corrodes. This protection lasts even after the zinc layer is scratched but degrades through time as the zinc corrodes away. The zinc is applied electrochemically or as molten zinc by hot-dip galvanizing or spraying. Galvanization is used on chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, lightposts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Galvanization might be used even if zinc is more reactive than iron or steel because it offers a protective layer against corrosion. When zinc is applied to iron or steel, it attracts almost all local oxidation, preventing the underlying metal from corroding. This is due to the formation of a protective surface layer of oxide and carbonate (Zn5(OH)6(CO3)2) as the zinc corrodes. This protection is effective even if the zinc layer gets scratched, and it lasts until the zinc completely corrodes away. Galvanization is applied using electrochemical methods, hot-dip galvanizing, or spraying, and is commonly used in various applications such as chain-link fencing, guard rails, suspension bridges, light posts, metal roofs, heat exchangers, and car bodies to increase their durability and resistance to corrosion."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the witch cast a spell on them, Neil turned into a donkey and Matthew turned into a frog as the witch thought","completion":"it would serve them right for having stumbled upon her secret garden. The witch, known as Elyendra, believed that trespassers should be taught a lesson, one they would never forget. She was a master in the art of dark magic, having learned from the most ancient of witch covens, and punishment and vengeance were her specialties. As Neil brayed helplessly and Matthew croaked with despair, desperately trying to get help from their enchanted voices, their initial shock and panic eventually gave way to acceptance. They needed to find a way to reverse the spell. Elyendra could have certainly done so, but their hopes of convincing her were slim. Besides the fear of being met with another curse, they knew that she rarely undid her spells. Which meant that Neil the donkey and Matthew the frog had to find another solution – another magical being capable of undoing the witch's curse. For days on end, they wandered through the dense and mysterious woods, constantly wary of hidden threats and unexpected dangers. They managed to avoid some tricky situations, including a den of snakes and a pack of hungry wolves. Along their journey, they encountered magical beings such as faeries, nymphs, and even a wise old talking tree. But none of them possessed the power or willingness to undo Elyendra's powerful curse. Soon, they learned about the enigmatic forest wizard, Alaric, who lived deep within the heart of the woodland. It was said that he could undo any curse, no matter how powerful or malignant. Even witches' covens held him in high esteem, and so, their hope rekindled, the duo set off in search of him. Their journey was fraught with greater challenges and perils, but they persevered, driven by their desire to reclaim their human selves. The dark, looming trees seemed to close in on them as they ventured deeper into the dense thicket, but finally, they arrived at Alaric's dwelling – a rustic hut nestled at the base of an ancient oak. With hearts pounding in trepidation, they cautiously approached and sought permission to speak to the sage. Alaric was a benevolent man with a long, flowing beard and piercing green eyes. He listened patiently to their tale of woe, his expression solemn and wise. He pondered their story for what seemed like an eternity as they eagerly awaited his response. Finally, he agreed to help them - but only under one condition. They must retrieve the Aetherstone, a rare and powerful gem sought after by many magical beings. This gem could amplify Alaric's powers, allowing him to undo the curse placed upon Neil and Matthew. Hidden in a precarious, ancient fortress guarded by sorcerous traps and lurking creature, the Aetherstone was no simple trinket to obtain, but the enchanted duo felt they had no other choice and accepted the quest. They spent days painstakingly solving riddles, navigating treacherous paths, and overcoming fierce magical guardians. Through their struggles, Neil and Matthew forged a bond that was unbreakable - their humanity unified them even in their transformed states. Their courage and wits were tested time and time again; however, they persevered and ultimately secured the elusive Aetherstone for Alaric. Upon receiving the gem, the wizard set to work on breaking the curse. With a dramatic flourish of his staff and an incantation in an ancient language, the magical power concentrated within the Aetherstone shattered the binding spell. And just like that, Neil and Matthew resumed their human forms, their joy and relief immeasurable. Though grateful for being restored to their true selves, the duo had learned much during their trials as enchanted animals. They were humbled by their experiences and cherished the bonds that had formed between them. They learned to never take life for granted and to always appreciate the magic within their own human existence. As they bade Alaric a heartfelt farewell, they ventured back to their village in high spirits, eagerly awaiting the new lives and adventures ignited by their extraordinary ordeal. A world of enchanting possibilities stretched ahead, vowing to never forget their exceptional venture and the blessings gained through their most peculiar tale. And so, the legacy of Neil and Matthew, and their unforgettable encounter with the cruel whims of the witch Elyendra, lived on in the hearts and minds of villagers for generations—a tale whispered sagely as a testament to the strength of the human soul and the boundless power of hope, friendship, and love."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Passage:By 1959, Louis Armstrong had asked Time magazine readers: \\"Did you get that chick? She's a gasser!\\" and invited her to appear with him on national television. She appeared with Armstrong on the Timex All-Star Jazz Show hosted by Jackie Gleason on January 7, 1959. She toured the East Coast with Jack Teagarden, appeared in Chicago with Art Hodes, Roosevelt Sykes, Little Brother Montgomery, Memphis Slim, Otis Spann, Willie Dixon and others, played New York with Wilbur De Paris and his band, and appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson as a solo guest artist. Other national TV work included The Steve Allen Show, Bobby Troup's Stars of Jazz, and Alfred Hitchcock Presents. In 1961, the singer opened her own club, Sugar Hill: Home of the Blues, on San Francisco's Broadway in the North Beach district, with the idea of creating a venue for the blues in a tourist district where a wider audience could hear it.

Detective Aidan Breslin is a widower who has become emotionally distanced from his two sons, Alex and Sean, following the death of his wife three years prior to the film's events. Due to his former dental forensics expertise, Aidan receives a call regarding the contents of the tray, where it is revealed that it contained human teeth. After analyzing the teeth, Breslin is able to match them to a man who had been reported missing. Aidan is once again called to investigate the bizarre murder of a woman named Mrs. Spitz, who was discovered hanging in her bedroom, eerily displayed and strung up on a series of hooks connected to a rig; the words \\"Come and See\\" displayed prominently on the walls. According to her autopsy report, she drowned in her own blood due to a precise stabbing. They also discover that Mrs. Spitz had been pregnant and the fetus was removed. Aidan speculates that there were four attackers and that they had used a camera to record the murder. After leaving the crime-scene, Breslin comforts one of the Spitz's three daughters, their adopted Asian daughter Kristen, reassuring her that he will do his best to solve the crime.

Article: Once upon a time if we wanted to make a phone call or wait for someone to contact us, we had to sit at home or at our desks. There were public phones in the street of course, _ . And of course you had to bring a lot of coins to pay for the calls. So people didn't phone their friends as often. Mobile phones, these small pieces of electronic equipment which allow us to talk with friends and family while we are on the move, have greatly changed the way we live. Before the age of the mobile phone, our loved ones would sit around worried sick if we were late coming home. There were no quick calls to tell mum that there would be additional guests coming for dinner. We would have to depend on notes left on fridges or desks to communicate messages. But mobile phones have also had a negative effect and what people don't seem to realize is that we've lost something very valuable: our privacy. Now our friends and family can contact us wherever and whenever they want to. We can never get away from them. The way people communicate with each other is totally different now. It's difficult to have a conversation face-to-face with a friend without being disturbed every couple of minutes by the ring of their phones, ,most people don't see anything wrong in having a long conversation on their mobile phone while forgetting all about the person sitting opposite. It seems the art of real conversation may be dying. Of course, people could leave their mobile phones at home or even switch them off but no one ever does that. Why not? Because the worrying thing is we can't live without our phones. We've become communication addicts, unable to spend even a few minutes out of contact, in case we miss something 'important'.

C: People made fewer phone calls. D: People relied on notes a lot.

Which lake has colder water the bottom? Deep lake presents geothermal activity, while Shallow lake has mixing of saline water with fresh water. Deep lake had more instances of divers having problems because of thermoclines. Hint: Thermoclines, or sudden changes in temperature. Where the air temperature is higher than the water temperature, shallow water may be warmed by the air and the sunlight but deeper water remains cold resulting in a lowering of temperature as the diver descends. This temperature change may be concentrated over a small vertical interval, when it is called a thermocline.[3][4] Where cold, fresh water enters a warmer sea the fresh water may float over the denser saline water, so the temperature rises as the diver descends.[3] In lakes exposed to geothermal activity, the temperature of the deeper water may be warmer than the surface water.

What is the best way to: how to make white chocolate-peppermint bark","completion":"Making white chocolate-peppermint bark is a fun, festive, and relatively easy process perfect for holidays or simply for enjoying a delicious treat. The combination of creamy white chocolate and soothing peppermint flavors make it an irresistible dessert. To prepare the best white chocolate-peppermint bark, follow these detailed steps: Ingredients: 1. 16 ounces (450 grams) high-quality white chocolate, finely chopped 2. 1 cup (200 grams) crushed peppermint candies or candy canes (approximately 8-10 regular candy canes) 3. ½ teaspoon peppermint extract (optional, for added peppermint flavor) 4. Pinch of salt (optional, to enhance the flavors) Materials: 1. Double boiler or microwave-safe bowl 2. Silicone spatula or wooden spoon 3. Baking sheet 4. Parchment paper or silicone baking mat 5. Ziplock bag and rolling pin or a food processor (for crushing peppermints) Instructions: 1. Preparation: a. Line the baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat, ensuring that the entire surface is covered. This will prevent the white chocolate-peppermint bark from sticking to the tray. b. If you haven't already, crush the peppermint candies or candy canes. You can do this by placing them in a ziplock bag and using a rolling pin to crush them into small bits, or you can use a food processor to break them up. Reserve ¼ cup of the crushed peppermint to sprinkle on top of the chocolate bark later. 2. Melting the white chocolate: You have two options for melting the white chocolate - using a double boiler or a microwave. a. Double Boiler method: i. Fill the bottom part of a double boiler with water and bring it to a simmer. Make sure the water is not touching the top part of the boiler. ii. Place the chopped white chocolate in the top part of the double boiler, ensuring no water gets in contact with the chocolate. iii. As the chocolate melts, stir it gently using the silicone spatula or wooden spoon to help the melting process. iv. Once the chocolate is melted and smooth, remove it from the heat. b. Microwave method: i. Place the chopped white chocolate in a microwave-safe bowl. ii. Heat the chocolate in the microwave in 20-30 second intervals, stirring well between each interval. This prevents the chocolate from burning or getting too hot. Repeat until the chocolate is fully melted and smooth. 3. Flavoring and setting the bark: a. Once the white chocolate is melted, add the peppermint extract (if using) and a pinch of salt, and stir to combine. b. Gently fold in ¾ cup of the crushed peppermint candies, making sure it's evenly distributed throughout the chocolate. c. Pour the peppermint-white chocolate mixture onto the prepared baking sheet, using the silicone spatula or wooden spoon to spread it out evenly, about ¼ inch thick. d. Sprinkle the remaining ¼ cup of crushed peppermint on top of the chocolate, pressing down gently to make sure it adheres to the surface. e. Place the baking sheet in the refrigerator or a cool place for at least 30 minutes, or until the white chocolate-peppermint bark has completely set and hardened. 4. Breaking and serving the bark: a. Once the bark is cooled and hardened, remove it from the refrigerator and use your hands to break it into irregular pieces. You can also use a sharp knife to cut the bark into pieces, but it's much easier and more fun to break it by hand. b. Serve the white chocolate-peppermint bark in a dish or store it in an airtight container. It can be stored in the refrigerator or at room temperature, but keep in mind that white chocolate may soften at a warmer room temperature. Enjoy your delicious and festive white chocolate-peppermint bark, perfect for sharing with family and friends or as a homemade gift during the holiday season!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What does the monster agree to do, as long as he swears to never speak of what he saw or describe the monster's appearance to anyone?

The main dish is to be Timmy (Matthew Lawrence), a young boy whom she has captured and chained up in her pantry. To stall her from stuffing and roasting him, the boy tells her three horror stories from a book she gave him, titled Tales from the Darkside. Lot 249[edit] In the first segment, Michael McDowell adapts Arthur Conan Doyle's short story, \\"Lot No. 249\\". A graduate student named Bellingham (played by Steve Buscemi) has been cheated by two classmates, Susan (Julianne Moore), and Lee (Robert Sedgwick), who framed him for theft to ruin his chances of winning a scholarship for which they were competing. As revenge, Bellingham reanimates a mummy and uses it to murder them both. Susan's brother Andy (Christian Slater) kidnaps Bellingham, and burns the parchment and mummy. He considers killing Bellingham, but in the end cannot bring himself to commit real murder. However, Bellingham brings Susan and Lee back from the dead (having switched the reanimation parchment with a similar one) and dispatches them to Andy's dorm, where they greet the terrified Andy by saying that Bellingham sends his regards. Cat from Hell[edit] In the second tale, George A. Romero adapts a Stephen King short story of the same name. Drogan is a wealthy, wheelchair-bound old man (William Hickey) who brings in a hitman named Halston (David Johansen) for a bizarre hire: kill a black cat, which Drogan believes is murderously evil. Drogan explains that there were three other occupants of his house before the cat arrived: his sister, Amanda (Dolores Sutton), her friend Carolyn (Alice Drummond), and the family's butler, Richard Gage (Mark Margolis). Drogan claims that one by one, the cat killed the other three, and that he is next. Drogan's pharmaceutical company killed 5,000 cats while testing a new drug, and he is convinced that this black cat is here to exact cosmic revenge. Halston doesn't believe the story,...","completion":"In Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, there doesn't seem to be a specific scene in which a monster agrees to do something as long as someone swears to never speak of what he saw or describe the monster's appearance to anyone.

However, you might be thinking of \\"Lover's Vow,\\" the third story in the movie, which has a similar premise. In this story, a struggling artist named Preston (James Remar) witnesses a horrific murder committed by a monstrous gargoyle-like creature. The creature spares Preston's life on the condition that he never tells anyone about the monster or the incident. Preston complies with the creature's demand and subsequently meets a woman named Carola (Rae Dawn Chong) with whom he falls in love, marries, and starts a family. Years later, having gained success in both his personal and professional life, Preston decides to finally reveal the truth to Carola about the gruesome event involving the monster and the promise he made. Upon hearing the story, Carola is horrified and transforms into the gargoyle-like creature herself, revealing that she was the monster all along. She agonizingly tells Preston that she had to break their vow because he broke his, and their children transform into smaller creatures as well. The family of monsters then flies away, leaving a devastated Preston behind.

Given these facts, what provides food and shelter to many fish among the following options: - coral reefs - deltas - hermit crabs - ocean sand - dried coral - swamp vegetation - salt and water. - loose soil The answer is:","completion":"Coral reefs provide food and shelter to many fish among the given options. Coral reefs are underwater ecosystems that are composed of vast, diverse and colorful structures built by hard corals – tiny marine invertebrates called polyps that attach to a hard substrate and secrete calcium carbonate to form the skeleton of the reef. These reefs are often referred to as the \\"rainforests of the sea\\" due to their incredible biodiversity and productivity. Coral reefs are home to more than 25% of all marine fish species, providing essential habitat for fishes to feed, breed, and find refuge from predators. The intricate and complex structure of coral reefs offers an abundance of hiding places and feeding opportunities for fish and other marine organisms, including invertebrates such as crabs, shrimp, sea urchins, and mollusks. Deltas, swamp vegetation, and ocean sand certainly offer some habitat for marine organisms, but they do not provide the same level of complexity and support for biodiversity as coral reefs. Deltas, formed by sediment deposition from rivers, can provide some shelter for fish in coastal areas, but their ecological role is different, serving more as nursery grounds for species that spawn there. Swamp vegetation mainly provides habitats for freshwater fish and other organisms living in the brackish or freshwater areas, whereas coral reefs are exclusively marine ecosystems. Swamp vegetation is categorized as wetland ecosystems with trees and shrubs that can tolerate various degrees of waterlogging, while coral reefs occur in clear, warm, and shallow waters, typically in tropical and subtropical regions. Ocean sand and loose soil primarily provide habitats for burrowing species, such as flounders and various crustaceans. However, they lack the structural complexity that supports the vast array of marine life found on coral reefs. Dried coral, salt and water, and hermit crabs are not adequate options as they do not support a diverse array of fish and other marine organisms. Dried coral holds no value for marine life as it lacks the live corals and algal components that provide habitat, nutrition, and protection for fish. Salt and water, while essential components of marine ecosystems, do not alone provide the necessary habitat structures for marine fish. Hermit crabs are a type of marine organism themselves, rather than a provider of a habitat for other organisms. In conclusion, coral reefs are the clear choice among the options listed for providing food and shelter to many fish. Their structural complexity, productivity, and rich biodiversity make coral reefs some of the most critical and valuable ecosystems on the planet. They provide essential habitats for thousands of marine species, making them crucial for maintaining healthy and thriving ocean ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He is the son of Dale (nee Lewis), a high school admissions counselor, and Pete Wentz II, an attorney. He is of English and German descent on his father's side and Afro-Jamaican on his mother's side. He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. Apart from his musical career, Wentz has been involved in various entrepreneurial ventures. Fall Out Boy bandmate Patrick Stump says of Wentz's endeavors: \\"It scares me sometimes, watching him. The two seconds you're not with that dude he's made 30 decisions that are going to affect our band for the rest of the year.\\" Wentz's company, Clandestine Industries, distributes books, clothing, and other merchandise. On August 2, 2007, fashion company DKNY joined a partnership with Clandestine Industries. Wentz himself has served as a model on the DKNY/Clandestine promo website. In April 2007, Pete came out with his own signature Squier Precision Bass. It has a black body with a red shell pickguard and special graphics that include Wentz's own red bat/heart design on the body, plus a black bat/diamond fingerboard inlay at the 12th fret. It also features Wentz's signature on the back of the headstock. Wentz owns a very similar custom Fender bass with a purple pickguard and bat/heart. In 2008, Fender gave his son, Bronx Wentz, a three-quarter-sized modified version of his guitar. Wentz opened a nightclub in New York with his bandmates as well as members of Gym Class Heroes, The Academy Is..., and Cobra Starship; the bands' managers are also involved in the enterprise. Called Angels & Kings, the club occupies the former space on 11th Street near Avenue A that housed the Orchid Lounge. Notable guests, including Tommy Hilfiger, arrived for the grand opening on April 20, 2007. In June 2007, Wentz celebrated the opening of Angels & Kings' second location in Chicago. On December 13, 2008, Wentz, along with Travis McCoy of Gym Class Heroes, created several pieces for an art exhibit at Gallery 1988 in Los Angeles called \\"Without You, I'm Just Me.\\" The exhibit closed on December 24, 2008.

Movie title: Force 10 from Navarone Movie plot: In 1943, after their successful mission on the Greek island of Navarone, Major Keith Mallory (Robert Shaw) and Sergeant John Miller (Edward Fox) are sent to find and kill Nicolai. Originally thought to be a traitor who informed the Germans about Miller and Mallory during the Navarone mission, Nicolai is now known to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a dedicated German spy believed to have infiltrated the Yugoslav Partisans as \\"Captain Lescovar\\" (Franco Nero). To get to Yugoslavia, the two men pair with \\"Force 10\\", an American sabotage unit, led by Colonel Mike Barnsby (Harrison Ford), which has its own mission there. To maximise security, Force 10 steals a Lancaster bomber from a British air base in Termoli, Italy, rather than requisitioning one; but they are spotted by Military Police MPs before they can take off. Weaver (Carl Weathers), a US Army sergeant under arrest by the MPs, joins with Force 10 and forces his way onto the plane. Barnsby and crew successfully \\"escape\\" Termoli, only to be shot down by Luftwaffe night fighters. Only Barnsby, Mallory, Miller, Weaver, and Force 10 member Doug Reynolds (Angus MacInnes) manage to escape the crippled plane. On the ground, the survivors run across a group they believe to be their allies, Communist Yugoslav Partisans, led by Captain Drazak (Richard Kiel). Force 10's rescuers are soon revealed to be collaborationist Chetniks (nationalist Serb guerrillas) under German control. The Germans take the team into custody but do not know their mission, so Mallory and Barnsby tell the commander, Major Schroeder (Michael Byrne), that they are criminals fleeing Allied authorities. To keep Schroeder from opening Miller's suitcase, which contains his special explosives, Mallory tells him that it contains a new wonder drug called \\"penicillin\\" which will spoil if exposed to air. By the next morning, the prisoners are told that Schroeder has opened the case, finding it full of firewood. Surprised, Mallory and Barnsby improvise an excuse, \\"admitting\\" they buried the samples. Schroeder...

The main actors in Force 10 from Navarone include: - Robert Shaw as Major Keith Mallory - Edward Fox as Sergeant John Miller - Harrison Ford as Colonel Mike Barnsby - Franco Nero as Captain Lescovar/Colonel von Ingorslebon - Carl Weathers as Sergeant Weaver - Angus MacInnes as Doug Reynolds - Richard Kiel as Captain Drazak 3. What is the significance of Mallory and Miller's mission to find and kill Nicolai/Colonel von Ingorslebon? Their mission to find and kill Nicolai, who is later revealed to be Colonel von Ingorslebon, a German spy infiltrating the Yugoslav Partisans as Captain Lescovar, is crucial because it exposes a high-level threat to the Allied forces in the region. By eliminating this infiltrator, Mallory and Miller aim to reduce the intelligence leak and maintain the security of their missions and overall war effort. 4. What historical context does this movie plot take place in? The movie is set in 1943, during World War II, and it showcases the challenges faced by Allied forces in their mission to undermine Axis powers. Their fight against the Nazi-connected Yugoslav Chetniks and the German military is a representation of the conflicts that took place in Eastern Europe during this time period. Additionally, the Partisan resistance movements played a crucial role in many of these conflicts, as they supported the Allied war effort against Axis domination. 5. What are some strengths and weaknesses of the movie proposal that can help you decide about investing? Strengths: - The movie has an exciting and action-packed plot, with numerous twists and turns to keep viewers engaged. - It features a strong ensemble cast with well-known actors like Harrison Ford and Robert Shaw. - The World War II setting offers a rich historical backdrop for the story, and the mission-centric nature of the film is appealing to fans of war and action films. - It showcases complex themes such as betrayal, trust, and the unpredictable nature of war, which can resonate with audiences. Weaknesses: - The movie was released in 1978, which could make its appeal to modern audiences somewhat reliant on nostalgia or historical interest. - Some plot elements, like impersonators and switching identities, might be less appealing or considered clichéd in modern films. - The movie's use of various locations across Eastern Europe and Italy might require a substantial budget for set design, locations, and period-appropriate props. Taking these factors into consideration, analyze whether the strengths outweigh the weaknesses and if you believe investing in this film proposal aligns with your interests and expectations for the movie."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Lucifer for the following movie plot: Angyali üdvözlet, aka \\"The Annunciation\\", is a surreal account of the history of humanity as portrayed entirely by children between the ages of 8 and 12. The film begins with the biblical story as Adam (Péter Bocsor) and Eve (Júlia Mérö), are deceived by Lucifer (Eszter Gyalog) -- three very photogenic leads -- into tasting the \\"Forbidden Fruit\\". They are thus chased out of the Garden of Eden by the Angel of Death and, in a vision, sent on an existential journey through western European history.Always followed closely and influenced by the deceptively sweet, but contemptuous Lucifer, we follow Adam through The Plague, wars, Byzantium's wretched cripples, the French Revolution, the squalor of Dickensian London, and a final return to the scene of the crucifixion. Of course the picture makes a case for its premise -- that of the consequences of Original Sin -- yet does so in a very unique way. In the closing scene, Lucifer says, \\"Why did I strive to achieve greatness in man, who is...in knowlege a pygmy, in blindness a giant?\\" This reflects the somewhat nihilistic view of a nation still under the boot of Soviet communism.This rare movie may be one of the best (and only child-starred) art films ever.

Sam is groaning so loudly because Tyler is effectively massaging and relieving tension in his sore muscles. As the pressure is applied to various points of Sam's upper body, the groaning noise likely indicates a mix of pain and pleasure. The pain comes from the intensity of the pressure on his sore muscles, and the pleasure comes from the relief it provides as these tense points are loosened. It is worth noting that Tyler is attentive to the amount of pressure applied, making sure not to press too hard and cause more pain. Instead, he digs to a point just before that level of pain, which allows Sam to experience the benefits of the massage and the relief it brings. This kind of balanced approach is crucial in providing a satisfactory deep tissue massage, which is possibly the type of massage Tyler is offering. In conclusion, Sam groans loudly because the massage given by Tyler is effectively targeting his sore muscles and bringing relief.

Translate to English","completion":"However, this situation does not prevent the CHP from trying to use the AKP's religious connections during the campaign in English. The quote in Turkish is referring to a political situation in Turkey, where the CHP (Cumhuriyet Halk Partisi or the Republican People's Party) is attempting to leverage the religious affiliations of the AKP (Adalet ve Kalkınma Partisi or the Justice and Development Party) during a campaign. Both parties have different political ideologies, with the CHP having a more secular and nationalist platform, while the AKP is conservative and follows a more Islamic-oriented perspective. The aforementioned quote suggests that the CHP is trying to use the AKP's religious connections as a political tool during the campaign process, perhaps to gain an advantage. It is important to remember that Turkey is a predominantly Muslim country, with a majority of the population following Sunni Islam. Therefore, a party's stance on religion may play a role in shaping public opinion and gaining support. Politics in Turkey has always been in a state of constant flux, with various political parties in the past struggling for power and influence. As political parties engage in campaigning, they engage in numerous strategies to gain an edge over their rivals. This statement is an example of how a political party might try to exploit the religious aspect of an opposing party to further their own goals. It is worth noting that any political campaign should ideally focus on discussing tangible issues, plans, and proposals, rather than relying on religious connections or affiliations. This would allow voters to make informed decisions based on the merit of each party's platform, rather than external factors that may not be directly related to governance or public policy. In conclusion, the statement highlights the complexities of politics in Turkey, as well as the dynamic between two major political parties, CHP and AKP.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Yen was born in Guangzhou, China. His mother, Bow-sim Mark, is a Fu Style Wudangquan (internal martial arts) and Tai Chi grandmaster, while his father, Klyster Yen (Zhen Yun Long ), is a newspaper editor. When he was two years old, his family moved to Hong Kong and then to Boston when he was 11. His younger sister, Chris Yen, is also a martial artist and actress, and appeared in the 2007 film Adventures of Johnny Tao: Rock Around the Dragon. Donnie Yen was considered as one of the premiere action choreographers in the world, having been invited by Hollywood to choreograph blockbusters such as Blade II, Highlander: Endgame, and Shanghai Knights. In Asia, he is the action choreographer for most of his movies and has won multiple awards for his action choreography. Yen's most famous works include films such as Flash Point and SPL: Sha Po Lang. He has mentioned that the main differences in filmmaking in Asia and Hollywood are with regards to freedom and control. In Asia, the action choreographer takes over the scene during the fight scene. This means that for action scenes filmed in Asia, the choreographer becomes the director and is in full control over camera placements, camera angles, and the relationship between the drama and the action; therefore the main director is not needed at all. While in Hollywood, on the other hand, Yen explains that the action choreographer simply choreographs the actions with the director, who still maintains full control of such settings and camera angles. Yen's work as a choreographer won him \\"Best Action Choreography\\" awards at the 27th Hong Kong Film Awards and the 2008 and 2011 Golden Horse Film Awards. Yen was the fight choreographer for the 2010 film Legend of the Fist: The Return of Chen Zhen. For this film, Yen mentioned that he included Jeet Kune Do elements as a tribute to Bruce Lee, who played Chen Zhen in the 1972 film Fist of Fury. Furthermore, he incorporated many MMA elements in the film, coupled with the utilisation of Wing Chun. Yen also stated that the concept behind Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do is similar to that of MMA, hence the incorporation of many forms of martial arts was a necessity in the film. He won the Hong Kong Film Award for Best Action Choreography 4 times, being one of the most frequent winners of this coveted award. He has won awards for his choreography in films such as The Twins Effect, SPL: Sha Po Lang, Flash Point, and Kung Fu Jungle. Although uncredited, Donnie Yen was also action co-choreographer for Hong Kong Film Award winners such as Ip Man, Ip Man 2, and Bodyguards and Assassins.

Article: Just as the stock market rises and falls in response to what people are willing to put their money behind, we have inside ourselves an inner economy that rises and falls in response to our beliefs about what is possible. Sometimes the degree to which we are willing to challenge our belief systems determines the success of our inner economy. For example, imagine that your family of origin had a belief that musical talent was not something they possessed. As a member of that group, you would likely inherit that same belief about yourself. As a result, even if you had a great desire to create music, you might be hesitant to really get behind yourself, fearing that your investment would not pay off. Even if you had the courage to follow your passion, your inner belief that you are not inherently talented would probably be a major drawback to investing your energy in your dream. On the other hand, if you found a way to release that negative belief, a great flood of energy would pour forth, greatly increasing the likelihood of your success. How much energy we are willing to invest in the various ideas, dreams, and visions we carry within is like the money people are, or are not, willing to invest in the various products available for trade on the stock market. And in both cases, belief plays a key role in determining how willing we are to get behind something. One way to open up the possibility for greater success in our inner economies is to understand that belief is not the reliable guide we sometimes think. There are other more reliable things of success that we can put our faith in, such as passion, feeling, and sense. Some of the most successful investors in the stock market are the ones that go against the grain (to be something that one does not like doing), trusting their sense over the common opinion held by common people about what will work. In the same way, we can learn to trust our heart's desires and our sense to guide us, questioning any beliefs that stand in the way of our ability to fully invest...

Which part of the cardamom plant is used as a spice?","completion":"The part of the cardamom plant that is used as a spice are its seeds. More specifically, cardamom seeds are contained within a small, green pod, which is often referred to as the cardamom fruit, although technically it is a dried fruit rather than a true fruit. The cardamom plant, or Elettaria Cardamomum, is a member of the ginger family and is native to southern India. It's a tall, perennial plant and it grows up to 2-4 meters in humid and tropical climates. The plant has rigid and erect aromatic leaves, which forms the canopy. Underneath that canopy, near the ground, grow the small, green pods containing the seeds. It’s these seed pods that make cardamom the third most expensive spice in the world, behind saffron and vanilla. The pods are usually picked when they are nearly ripe and sun-dried to maximize their aromatic fragrance. Each pod contains several seeds and it's these seeds that hold the flavor. The whole pod can be used in cooking, or often, the seeds are removed from the pod and ground into a spice. Freshly ground cardamom seeds are more flavorful and aromatic than pre-ground cardamom powder because the essential oils in the seeds begin to dissipate as soon as the seeds are ground. In terms of their composition, cardamom seeds are high in volatile oil—a complex mixture of terpenes, esters, flavonoids and other compounds, which is what gives cardamom its distinctive smell and flavor. They also contain a significant amount of fiber and antioxidants. They are used extensively in cooking for their unique flavor and aroma. They are a common ingredient in Indian cuisine and are used in many curry dishes for flavoring. They are also an essential ingredient in garam masala, a popular spice blend in South Asia. Cardamom is also used in sweets in Middle Eastern countries and to flavor coffee and tea, especially in the Nordic countries. Additionally, cardamom has many health benefits. It is commonly used in traditional medicine due to its high antioxidant content and ability to promote digestion, among other benefits."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

You are presented with the quiz \\"What can negatively impact animal survival?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"animals require water for survival\\" and \\"where there is no water there is drought\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"Various factors can negatively impact animal survival, but based on the hints provided by your teacher, the best answer in this context would be \\"drought and lack of water.\\" Water is essential for the survival of all living organisms, including animals. It plays a vital role in various biological processes such as digestion, nutrient absorption, temperature regulation, waste elimination, and maintaining overall health. Drought conditions, characterized by a shortage of water, can severely affect animal populations in an ecosystem. During droughts, the availability of water sources becomes limited, forcing animals to travel longer distances to find water. This increased search for water can lead to exhaustion, dehydration, and sometimes death for animals unable to locate a reliable water source. Additionally, drought can lead to a decline in the quality of available water, as reduced water levels often lead to increased concentrations of pollutants, making the remaining sources of water less suitable for consumption. Drought also affects animals indirectly through its impact on food availability. As water becomes scarce, it can lead to reduced plant growth, which in turn affects herbivores that rely on plants as their primary food source. This decline in plant-based food resources can have a ripple effect across the food chain, as herbivores become less abundant, impacting the populations of predators that rely on them for sustenance. Consequently, both herbivores and predators can face severe food shortage during droughts, leading to a decline in their overall populations. Another indirect impact of drought on animals comes in the form of habitat alteration. As water-dependent habitats such as wetlands, ponds, and marshes dry up, animals that rely on these environments for shelter, breeding, and food resources can be displaced, forcing them to either adapt to new habitats or face potential extinction. This change in habitat can also lead to increased competition for limited resources, further impacting animal survival rates. In conclusion, the best answer to the question, \\"What can negatively impact animal survival?\\" would be \\"drought and lack of water,\\" based on the hints provided by your teacher. Drought conditions can lead to a multitude of direct and indirect impacts on animal populations, including decreased water and food availability, habitat alteration, and increased competition for limited resources, ultimately threatening their survival."},{"prompt":"Question: Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question.

What do our dreams signify? What do seeing a dead person in our dreams mean?","completion":"Though the two questions have some overlap in their inquiry about dreams, they do not have the exact same meaning. Each question is seeking different levels of understanding and specificity about the relationship between dreams and the appearance of deceased loved ones. Question 1: What does it mean when a dead relative visits you in your dreams? This question is specifically focused on the meaning or significance behind seeing a deceased relative in one's dream. It is seeking interpretation or explanation as to why this might occur. Answer: When a dead relative visits you in your dreams, it can have various meanings depending on the context of the dream and your individual beliefs. Common interpretations can include: 1. Unresolved feelings: When we lose someone close to us, it's natural to experience emotions such as grief, guilt, or longing. These feelings might manifest in dreams where the deceased family member appears, serving as an unconscious reminder of the emotional work that still needs to be done. 2. Comfort and healing: Some people believe that the appearance of deceased loved ones in our dreams can serve as a comforting presence, helping us to move on and recover by providing reassurance, advice, or support. 3. Spiritual communication: In certain spiritual beliefs, it's thought that our dreams can be a medium for communication with the deceased or even a method for them to convey important messages. 4. Symbolism: In some cases, the dead relative may represent a personal characteristic or aspect of your life that is significant to you. Their presence might be a way for your subconscious to communicate a deeper message or insight. Question 2: What do our dreams signify? What do seeing a dead person in our dreams mean? This question is broader and encompasses not only the specific meaning behind seeing deceased loved ones, but also the general significance of dreams as a whole. Answer: Dreams can signify many different things depending on the content and context of the dream as well as the dreamer's personal beliefs and life experiences. The appearance of a dead person in a dream is just one type of experience that individuals might encounter. Dreams can be interpreted through various lenses: 1. Psychological perspective: Some psychologists, such as Sigmund Freud and Carl Jung, assert that dreams offer insight into our unconscious mind, revealing repressed thoughts, desires, or feelings. The symbols and scenarios that we encounter in our dreams can reflect deeper psychological processes, helping us to understand and resolve complex emotions. 2. Neurobiological perspective: Dreams are thought to be a byproduct of our brain processing memories and emotions during the stages of sleep, particularly during REM sleep. Some researchers believe that dreams serve a housekeeping function, consolidating and integrating our cognitive experiences from the day. 3. Cultural and spiritual perspective: Dreams often have cultural or spiritual significance, and interpretations can vary widely across different belief systems. Some cultures might view dreaming of deceased loved ones as a visitation or a sign of spiritual guidance, while others may interpret it as a simple reflection of an individual's emotional state. Ultimately, the meaning of a dream is subjective and can vary from person to person. The significance of seeing a dead person in a dream depends on an individual's personal experiences, beliefs, cultural background, and emotions surrounding the loss of their loved ones."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Charles Sumner.

Q:I know that the answer to the question \\"What countries did Portugal once control?\\" is in \\"Portugal's colonial history has long since been a cornerstone of its national identity, as has its geographic position at the south-western corner of Europe, looking out into the Atlantic Ocean. It was one of the last western colonial European powers to give up its overseas territories (among them Angola and Mozambique in 1975), turning over the administration of Macau to the People's Republic of China at the end of 1999. Consequently, it has both influenced and been influenced by cultures from former colonies or dependencies, resulting in immigration from these former territories for both economic and/or personal reasons. Portugal, long a country of emigration (the vast majority of Brazilians have Portuguese ancestry), has now become a country of net immigration, and not just from the last Indian (Portuguese until 1961), African (Portuguese until 1975), and Far East Asian (Portuguese until 1999) overseas territories. An estimated 800,000 Portuguese returned to Portugal as the country's African possessions gained independence in 1975.

However, his well-ordered life takes a sudden turn when he gets involved in a life-altering car accident. Forcing Jerome to confront the fragility of life, he embarks on a journey of self-discovery, redefining his priorities, and learning the importance of empathy, compassion, and love. Plot: Act One: Jerome, a meticulous, high-achieving entrepreneur, spends most of his time working at his marketing agency, barely making time for his loyal and patient wife, Lauren, and their two loving kids. Though he is hardworking, Jerome is emotionally distant and prioritizes career growth over personal relationships. On a foggy evening, Jerome is driving home after a successful business pitch and receives a heartwarming text from Lauren informing him about their kids' achievements in school. Distracted, Jerome takes his eyes off the road for a brief second, and suddenly, a devastating car accident occurs involving multiple vehicles. Act Two: Jerome wakes up in the hospital, severely injured and unsure of the damage done to the other people involved in the accident. As he begins his physical rehabilitation, Jerome is confronted with the stories of those affected by the crash, including a single mother left paralyzed, a young couple that lost their unborn child, and a grieving son mourning the death of his elderly father. These encounters leave Jerome deeply affected and help him recognize the value of life beyond his career ambitions. With Lauren's unwavering support, Jerome starts working on his emotional growth, repairing the relationships he had neglected and learning the importance of empathy and compassion. Simultaneously, he uses his resources and business acumen to help those affected by the accident, such as fundraising for medical expenses and starting a foundation for road safety. Act Three: As Jerome pushes himself to become a better version of himself, the community witnesses his transformation and begins to rally around the changed man. Moreover, he slowly overcomes his injuries and regains his mobility, deepening his appreciation for the gift of life. In a twist of fate, one of the companies Jerome fundraised for during his post-accident journey offers to buy his marketing agency, providing him an opportunity to continue his personal growth and focus on what truly matters: his family, newfound friendships, and helping others. In the end, Jerome and Lauren stand together watching their children play, cherishing the profound lessons that had arisen from the darkness, bound by love, understanding, and hope for the future. \\"The Unintended Journey\\" is a heartfelt drama that centers on a unique story about the life-altering effects of a car accident.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Ryan Giggs at 40: the goals, the statistics and the durability On 5 May 1991, the 17-year-old Giggs made his first league start for Manchester United against Manchester City and was later credited with the game's only goal, his first for the senior team. Here is an extract from Paul Wilson's Observer report: To play your first full game for Manchester United before a packed house against City is thrilling enough. To do so at the age of 17 is all the more romantic. But scoring the only goal of the game is almost too good to be true. And it was. 0 Red cards in his club career. He was sent off in a 2001 World Cup qualifier for Wales against Norway. 1 Goal of the season, his match-winner in the FA Cup semifinal against Arsenal in 1999. 1 PFA Player of the year award, for the 2008-09 season. 1 OBE for services to football, awarded in 2007. 1 Honorary degree, a master of arts from Salford university for contributions to football and charity work in developing countries. 2 Champions League winner's medals, in 1999 and 2008. 2 PFA young player of the year awards. 3 BBC Sports Personality of the Year awards, including two from BBC Wales. 4 FA Cups: 1994, 1996, 1999 and 2004. 4 League Cups: 1992, 2006, 2009 and 2010. 6 Times included in the PFA team of the year. 10 Goals against Tottenham and Middlesbrough, the opposition he has scored most frequently against. 13 English league titles, a record. 21 The only player to have appeared and scored in all 21 Premier League campaigns so far. 22 The 22nd person to receive the freedom of the City of Salford in January 2010. 35 Trophies won. He is the most decorated player in English football history. 37 Oldest player to score in the Champions League at 37 years, 289 days – against Benfica in September 2011. 50 Games against Arsenal, the opposition he has faced most frequently. 148 Champions League games played. 168 Goals for Manchester United. 666 League appearances, a Manchester United record. 952 Manchester United appearances, the most in the club's history. As chosen by Jacob Steinberg earlier this year … 1) Tottenham 1-1 Manchester United, 19 September 1992 The quality lies as much in Giggs's lightning speed as it does in the simplicity of the goal. Count the touches. One. Two. Three. Goal! One to take the ball past Dean Austin after his slip, one to nutmeg Jason Cundy, one to zip round Ian Walker in the Tottenham goal and one to fire the ball into the empty net. Breathtaking. Giggs was 18. 2) QPR 2-3 Manchester United, 5 February 1994 This goal is remarkably similar to the one against Tottenham, as Giggs seizes on a loose touch from Ray Wilkins before driving towards the QPR area. First he struts past a ludicrous lunge from Darren Peacock and then switches left, his change of direction leaving one QPR defender flat on his backside. Giggs then rifles a superb shot past Jan Stejsdal into the bottom right corner. As he wheels away to celebrate, QPR's area is full of defenders piled in a heap after slipping and sliding in their attempts to stop the flying winger. 3) Leeds 0-2 Manchester United, 27 April 1994 Earlier in the season Leeds had held Manchester United to a 0-0 draw at Old Trafford, Gary Kelly marking Giggs out of the game. Ahead of the return match there were suggestions that Kelly would do a number on Giggs again. Not so. United are already 1-0 up when Giggs picks up possession on the left touchline. Faced by Kelly and Gary McAllister, his options are sparse. Then, a shake of the hips fools both and the No11 is away. A perfect one-two with Mark Hughes on the edge of Leeds' area lets Giggs stride through before finding the top corner virtually to seal the title for United. 4) Manchester City 2-3 Manchester United, 6 April 1996 Going into the Manchester derby at Maine Road, United were three points ahead of Kevin Keegan's Newcastle at the top having played a game more. Twice United took the lead in the match , twice Manchester City equalised, with Newcastle winning. Then on 77 minutes Eric Cantona slips a pass through to Giggs on the left. Instead of challenging him Keith Curle waves Giggs through, like a waiter ushering a customer into a restaurant. Giggs shows it does not always pay to be this polite and the surprise factor in his early, rising shot was enough to deceive Eike Immel. 5) Manchester United 3-2 Juventus, 1 October 1997 United had played Juventus twice in the previous season and had been swatted aside in both matches but the Italians' sheen of invincibility vanished here. This match signalled United's coming of age in Europe. As they lead 2-1 in the dying moments Teddy Sheringham's cute pass sends Giggs haring into the area and from a seemingly impossible angle the ferocity of his shot is enough to beat Angelo Peruzzi at his near post and render Zinedine Zidane's even later free-kick irrelevant. 6) Manchester United 3-3 Barcelona, 16 September 1998 Giggs generally does not get enough credit for his heading ability. Although a header from the edge of the area against Coventry City caught the eye, there was an element of luck about that goal. This one, against a finer side and in a stunning match, was better, a goal that showcased United's pace and menace on the counter. It also contained a collector's item as David Beckham beats a full-back, Sergi, before whipping in a sublime cross for Giggs to head in at the far post. 7) Arsenal 1-2 Manchester United, 14 April 1999 Ferguson coined the phrase \\"twisted blood\\" for this goal. The most iconic moment of Giggs's career, not only for its brilliance, but also for the baring of his astonishingly hairy chest. It tends to go unnoticed that Giggs starts this FA Cup semi-final replay on the bench, coming on only after 61 minutes. But what a substitution. With United down to 10 men in extra-time after Roy Keane's red card, Giggs strikes. From the halfway line Giggs motors towards goal and, with an ageing Arsenal defence terrified of bringing him down, slaloms past Lee Dixon and Martin Keown and crashes an unstoppable shot over David Seaman. Cue the rug. 8) Juventus 0-3 Manchester United, 2003 A few weeks before this game Giggs had somehow missed a glaring open goal as United lost in the FA Cup against Arsenal. His form had been poor and he was increasingly becoming a target for fans' ire at Old Trafford. This goal changed all that. As with many of the goals on this list, a loose pass, this time from Antonio Conte, gives Giggs – seemingly always in the right place at the right time – possession. Unusually, after going on a diagonal run towards the right of Juventus's area, he does not change direction. Instead he simply places the ball clinically past Gianluigi Buffon with his right foot, just to show it is not always for standing on. 9) Manchester United 1-2 Chelsea, 26 January 2005 If Giggs was all about explosive solo runs in his early days, the latter stages of his career have been more about conjuring moments of subtle genius. United are trailing to Frank Lampard's first-half goal when Gary Neville spots a run from Giggs down the inside-right channel. Neville lofts the ball towards him and Giggs, having noted Petr Cech edge of his line and without a preliminary touch, gloriously and acrobatically lobs the goalkeeper with the outside of his left boot. 10) Tottenham 1-3 Manchester United 12 September 2009 Until David Beckham turned up, Giggs was United's first-choice free-kick taker. When Beckham left in 2003, it was assumed he would regain responsibility. And then Cristiano Ronaldo turned up. It was not until Ronaldo left in 2009 that Giggs reminded us of his deadliness with the dead ball at White Hart Lane. From a central position 25 yards from goal Giggs's free-kick is perfect, curling beautifully into the top right corner of Carlo Cudicini's goal. Speaking in 2012, Giggs explained that practising yoga has kept him in the game for so long and that, with age, he has had to change the way he thinks on the pitch: \\"The yoga has definitely helped me. It helps me train every day because it gives me the flexibility and the strength not only to play the game but to train as well. I rarely miss a training session even [if I do] a little less than the younger players I still go out and train. [When you get to my age] you have to change the way of thinking. I was a quick player when I was younger, now I am not so quick. [You have to] use your experience, use your intelligence on the pitch, to adapt your game and change your game, as I have done.\\" Summary:","completion":"Ryan Giggs, a former Manchester United player, had an illustrious career with significant achievements throughout his time at the club. He made his first league start at the age of 17 and scored his first goal for the senior team in a game against Manchester City. Some of his impressive statistics include 0 red cards in club career, 1 goal of the season, 1 PFA Player of the year award, 2 Champions League winner's medals, and a record 13 English league titles. In total, Giggs won 35 trophies, making him the most decorated player in English football history.

Tito's space journey began on April 28, 2001, as he launched aboard the Russian Soyuz TM-32 spacecraft, alongside two professional astronauts, Russian commander Talgat Musabayev and Kazakh flight engineer Yuri Baturin. The trio embarked on a mission known as ISS EP-1, which targeted the Russian-built ISS modules as its destination. Dennis Tito spent eight days aboard the International Space Station, during which he participated in various scientific experiments and experienced daily life in a weightless environment. Tito's space adventure concluded on May 6, 2001, as he returned to Earth with the crew of the Soyuz TM-31 spacecraft. The historic event marked a turning point in the development of space tourism, proving that it was indeed possible for private citizens to journey beyond Earth's atmosphere. Dennis Tito's excursion set the stage for future space tourism opportunities, paving the way for other private citizens to follow in his footsteps. In the years following Tito's groundbreaking space voyage, a handful of other individuals have purchased trips to the International Space Station through the Russian space program—each paying millions of dollars for the experience. While the cost remains prohibitive for most people, several private companies, including SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic, are actively working on developing more accessible and affordable options for space tourism. To this day, Dennis Tito's voyage to the International Space Station is remembered as a significant milestone not only for space exploration and tourism but also for ushering in a new era where outer space is increasingly becoming accessible to private individuals with the passion and resources to make their dreams come true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Tell Riley they wish they hadn't B: relax C: Tell Riley how much they appreciate it The answer to this question is:","completion":"C: Tell Riley how much they appreciate it According to the context provided, Riley and Jan were lost in the woods, and Riley used their survival skills to save Jan's life, which ultimately led to them making it home safely. Given this situation, it is evident that Jan would want to express their gratitude and appreciation to Riley for their actions. Choosing answer A, \\"Tell Riley they wish they hadn't,\\" does not make sense in this context, as it implies that Jan would not be grateful for Riley's life-saving actions. Considering that they made it home safely due to Riley's efforts, this is an unlikely response. Answer B, \\"Relax,\\" could potentially be a choice if it were accompanied by an expression of appreciation to Riley. However, on its own, it does not directly address the significant role Riley played in their survival and safe return. Thus, it does not directly answer the question. On the other hand, answer C, \\"Tell Riley how much they appreciate it,\\" is the most logical and fitting response to the question. It acknowledges the important part Riley played in their ordeal and shows that Jan is grateful for their efforts. By expressing their appreciation, Jan is recognizing the value of these survival skills and the selflessness with which Riley acted in ensuring their safety.

In his company he was known as Office Desk, because when he was working he always sat behind his well-used piece of conference table standing in a hard to notice corner in the software specialists' room. Christopher wasn't a wide person, and so his piece of conference table didn't have to be too big either, which also practically solved office space problems in the 0-1 Computer firm.

Meanwhile, three farmers are attempting to remove an ominous stone column from a field. Two of the farmers head home. A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt. Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes. This experience apparently destroys O'Brien's sanity. Afterwards, Howard inquires about the church's parish records. Coot says he can arrange to have Howard look at them. Later, a man arrives at the home of locals Dennis and Jenny. He discovers a clearly traumatized Jenny. Police arrive. Rawhead drags Dennis's dead body through the forest and comes upon a trailer park.

Turning Yoga Into Art Robert Sturman, an artist from Santa Monica, Calif., has traveled around the world painting and photographing landscapes, cityscapes, musicians, athletes and even a surfing rabbi. But it is the study of yoga that has triggered one of the most creative periods of his career, resulting in a series of stunning portraits that capture the beauty and poetry of asana, the repertory of postures included in the practice of yoga. Recently, Mr. Sturman’s stunning photos of Tao Porchon Lynch, a 93-year-old yoga master pictured in a red flowing gown, have been making the rounds on Facebook and other Web sites, bringing added attention to his work, which is featured in the slide show above. (Ms. Lynch can be seen in Slides 5 and 6.) I recently spoke with Mr. Sturman about how he got started, his favorite yoga pose and photographing yoga at ground zero. Here’s our conversation. How did you begin photographing yoga postures? This started in 2003, when I started to get a practice in yoga. I wanted to really go deep into it to make a personal transformation, but I noticed everything around me was so beautiful, and I started to make art of it. Yoga offered me an opportunity to change my life, but it was also something that was so beautiful to study, the poetry of asana. It started growing from being able to photograph people on the beach to being invited to a penitentiary with yoga programs to do yoga asana imagery there. How do you find your models? They are people who teach or who have a devoted practice. They are interested in catching their moment of mastery on film. They find me. I find them. It’s like a movement where we all know each other. It’s like Paris at the turn of the century. What is it about yoga that appeals to you as a subject for art? It’s the closest thing I’ve ever seen that really shows humanity on its best behavior, of people aspiring to touch something bigger than themselves. They do it in a very pure, longing type of way. It embodies not only the joy of existence, but there is an element of embracing the suffering. When someone is very deep into the asana and reaching out with their hands, in the midst of nature or wherever we are, there is something extremely human about it. I think that’s what moves people more than anything. That’s what moves me. Is there a particular pose you most like to photograph, or does it depend on your subject or location? I’m not as interested in certain poses — there are various arm balances that come across as showing off. I like a pose called a dancer’s pose. It’s where someone is grabbing the back of their leg and pulling it forward and reaching. There are certain poses like that that are so elegant. What is the story behind the young woman in a red dress whom you photographed in New York City? Last summer I was in New York. I was in a cafe and met a girl carrying a yoga mat, and she had a red dress on. She recognized me from Facebook. I asked her where she was going to practice. We walked throughout the day and made the most wonderful art. For the last pose, she grabbed her leg and lifted it so high it looks like a teardrop. The background was the World Trade Center site. She was just the ultimate model. I haven’t seen her since. It was beautiful. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the work of Robert Sturman, an artist who has been capturing the beauty and poetry of yoga postures through his stunning photographs. Starting his yoga practice in 2003, Sturman began combining his artistic talent with his fascination for the practice, leading to a series of portraits featuring devoted yoga practitioners. His photographs have gained attention, particularly his images of 93-year-old yoga master Tao Porchon Lynch. Sturman finds yoga to be an expression of humanity at its best, and he captures moments when individuals are reaching out for something profound in their practice. His favorite pose to photograph is the dancer's pose due to its elegance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

A:","completion":"This review would likely decrease the chances of buying the product for several reasons. The reviewer's use of capitalization, the mention of an \\"unfinished idea,\\" and their overall dissatisfaction all contribute to a negative impression of the product. These factors are important to consider when evaluating the credibility and usefulness of a review. Firstly, the all-caps writing style of the reviewer implies a strong negative emotion towards the product, as this conveys a sense of urgency and frustration. This may be interpreted by potential buyers as a warning to stay away from the product, especially if the review is genuine and not a result of a competitor's attempt to sabotage the product's reputation. Secondly, the mention of an \\"unfinished idea\\" in the book suggests that the content may not be fully developed or polished. The reviewer's statement that the information could be condensed to \\"ten pages at most in a bike magazine\\" implies that there is little substance or value in the book. This may signify a lack of depth or comprehensiveness in the content, which would be a deterrent for potential buyers who are seeking quality information they can rely on. Lastly, the reviewer's questioning of the author's credentials with the \\"Dr.\\" in Mr. Frazier's name indicates a lack of trust or confidence in the author's expertise and authority on the subject matter. Potential buyers might be wary of purchasing a book from an author whose qualifications are being questioned, as this could affect the accuracy and reliability of the information presented.

North Carolina Spanish explorers traveling inland in the 16th century met Mississippian culture people at Joara, a regional chiefdom near present-day Morganton. Records of Hernando de Soto attested to his meeting with them in 1540. In 1567 Captain Juan Pardo led an expedition to claim the area for the Spanish colony and to establish another route to protect silver mines in Mexico. Pardo made a winter base at Joara, which he renamed Cuenca. His expedition built Fort San Juan and left a contingent of 30 men there, while Pardo traveled further, and built and garrisoned five other forts. He returned by a different route to Santa Elena on Parris Island, South Carolina, then a center of Spanish Florida. In the spring of 1568, natives killed all but one of the soldiers and burned the six forts in the interior, including the one at Fort San Juan. Although the Spanish never returned to the interior, this effort marked the first European attempt at colonization of the interior of what became the United States. A 16th-century journal by Pardo's scribe Bandera and archaeological findings since 1986 at Joara have confirmed the settlement.

Article: Secret White House tapes reveal that LBJ knew about Nixon's 'treason' - but never reported it Tapes reveal that Johnson knew about plan by Nixon to thwart Vietnam War peace talks Nixon won 1968 election, and would serve as president until resigning in 1974 Ultimately decided not to say anything about it due to national security concerns President Lyndon Johnson knew of a plan by Richard Nixon to disrupt Vietnam War peace talks through 'treason,' but ultimately decided not to speak out about it, White House recordings have revealed. The tapes, dating back to Johnson's last months in office between May 1968 and January 1969, show that Johnson was onto Nixon, who at the time was the Republican nominee for president. According to the tapes, Johnson learned through FBI wiretaps that Nixon had played a role in getting South Vietnam to withdraw from peace talks in Paris that would effectively end the Vietnam War, and was therefore guilty of treason. Staying mum: President Lyndon Johnson, left, knew of a plan by Richard Nixon, right, to disrupt Vietnam War peace talks through 'treason,' but ultimately decided not to speak out about it Johnson found out that Nixon had reached out to Anna Chennault, one of his senior campaign officials, to convince South Vietnam Ambassador Bui Diem to pull out of peace talks until after the election, according to the BBC . Accusations of Nixon’s influence in the peace conference have been reported before, but the tapes provide a look at how the situation was handled by Johnson. Without an end to the Vietnam War by Election Day, Nixon was voted into the White House. Johnson could be heard saying on one particular recording that Nixon, another fan of White House audio recordings who would resign the presidency in 1974, had 'blood on his hands.' During a conversation with Senator Everett Dirksen of Illinois, Johnson, referring to people close to Nixon, and said, 'This is treason.' Dirksen was the Republican leader in the Senate. War: In one recording, Johnson could be heard saying that Nixon has 'blood on his hands' after his interference in the Vietnam War peace talks In a call to Sen Richard Russell of Georgia, Johnson says: 'We have found that our friend, the Republican nominee, our California friend, has been playing on the outskirts with our enemies and our friends both, he has been doing it through rather subterranean sources.' But despite Johnson's knowledge, it does not appear that he did a thing about it. Johnson opted to take the secret of the scandal to his grave, fearing that exposing Nixon would also reveal he had bugged the South Vietnam's ambassador's phone, and cause a national security mess. The tapes also shed light on Johnson's desire to run for another term, asking Chicago Mayor Richard Daley if the Democratic party would get behind him if he announced he would run again. President: Without an end to the Vietnam War by Election Day, Nixon was voted into the White House. He would later resign from the presidency in 1974 But his bid to crash that year's Democratic convention in the Windy City was thwarted when the Secret Service informed Johnson that his safety could be in jeopardy due to anti-war protesters. News of the Johnson recordings comes about a month after the 36th president’s love letters to Claudia Alta Taylor, the woman who would later become his wife, were revealed. The correspondence between the 26-year-old future president and the woman the world would come to know as Lady Bird are available for public review for the first time on Valentine's Day - at the LBJ Presidential Library at the University of Texas at Austin. A few of the letters were previously released but not the entire collection, which were also posted online. To sir with love: Love letters between Lyndon Johnson and his future wife were displayed at the LBJ Presidential Library at the University of Texas in Austin beginning last month ||||| Declassified tapes of President Lyndon Johnson's telephone calls provide a fresh insight into his world. Among the revelations - he planned a dramatic entry into the 1968 Democratic Convention to re-join the presidential race. And he caught Richard Nixon sabotaging the Vietnam peace talks... but said nothing. After the Watergate scandal taught Richard Nixon the consequences of recording White House conversations none of his successors has dared to do it. But Nixon wasn't the first. He got the idea from his predecessor Lyndon Johnson, who felt there was an obligation to allow historians to eventually eavesdrop on his presidency. \\"They will provide history with the bark off,\\" Johnson told his wife, Lady Bird. The final batch of tapes released by the LBJ library covers 1968, and allows us to hear Johnson's private conversations as his Democratic Party tore itself apart over the question of Vietnam. Charles Wheeler Charles Wheeler was the BBC's Washington correspondent from 1965 to 1973 He learned in 1994 that LBJ had evidence of Richard Nixon's sabotage of the Vietnam peace talks, and interviewed key Johnson staff Wheeler died in 2008, the same year the LBJ tapes were declassified David Taylor was his Washington-based producer for many years Archive on 4: Wheeler - The final word The 1968 convention, held in Chicago, was a complete shambles. Tens of thousands of anti-war protesters clashed with Mayor Richard Daley's police, determined to force the party to reject Johnson's Vietnam war strategy. As they taunted the police with cries of \\"The whole world is watching!\\" one man in particular was watching very closely. Lyndon Baines Johnson was at his ranch in Texas, having announced five months earlier that he wouldn't seek a second term. The president was appalled at the violence and although many of his staff sided with the students, and told the president the police were responsible for \\"disgusting abuse of police power,\\" Johnson picked up the phone, ordered the dictabelt machine to start recording and congratulated Mayor Daley for his handling of the protest. The president feared the convention delegates were about to reject his war policy and his chosen successor, Hubert Humphrey. So he placed a series of calls to his staff at the convention to outline an astonishing plan. He planned to leave Texas and fly into Chicago. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lyndon Johnson discusses with an aide if Chicago's Mayor Richard Daley can help him make a comeback at the convention He would then enter the convention and announce he was putting his name forward as a candidate for a second term. It would have transformed the 1968 election. His advisers were sworn to secrecy and even Lady Bird did not know what her husband was considering. On the White House tapes we learn that Johnson wanted to know from Daley how many delegates would support his candidacy. LBJ only wanted to get back into the race if Daley could guarantee the party would fall in line behind him. They also discussed whether the president's helicopter, Marine One, could land on top of the Hilton Hotel to avoid the anti-war protesters. Daley assured him enough delegates would support his nomination but the plan was shelved after the Secret Service warned the president they could not guarantee his safety. The idea that Johnson might have been the candidate, and not Hubert Humphrey, is just one of the many secrets contained on the White House tapes. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lyndon B Johnson: 'Our friend, the Republican nominee... has been playing... with our enemies and our allies' They also shed light on a scandal that, if it had been known at the time, would have sunk the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee, Richard Nixon. By the time of the election in November 1968, LBJ had evidence Nixon had sabotaged the Vietnam war peace talks - or, as he put it, that Nixon was guilty of treason and had \\"blood on his hands\\". The BBC's former Washington correspondent Charles Wheeler learned of this in 1994 and conducted a series of interviews with key Johnson staff, such as defence secretary Clark Clifford, and national security adviser Walt Rostow. We now know... After the Viet Cong's Tet offensive, White House doves persuaded Johnson to end the war Johnson loathed Senator Bobby Kennedy but the tapes show he was genuinely devastated by his assassination He feared vice-president Hubert Humphrey would go soft on Vietnam if elected president The BBC's Charles Wheeler would have been under FBI surveillance when he met administration officials in 1968 In 1971 Nixon made huge efforts to find a file containing everything Johnson knew in 1968 about Nixon's skulduggery But by the time the tapes were declassified in 2008 all the main protagonists had died, including Wheeler. Now, for the first time, the whole story can be told. It begins in the summer of 1968. Nixon feared a breakthrough at the Paris Peace talks designed to find a negotiated settlement to the Vietnam war, and he knew this would derail his campaign. He therefore set up a clandestine back-channel involving Anna Chennault, a senior campaign adviser. At a July meeting in Nixon's New York apartment, the South Vietnamese ambassador was told Chennault represented Nixon and spoke for the campaign. If any message needed to be passed to the South Vietnamese president, Nguyen Van Thieu, it would come via Chennault. In late October 1968 there were major concessions from Hanoi which promised to allow meaningful talks to get underway in Paris - concessions that would justify Johnson calling for a complete bombing halt of North Vietnam. This was exactly what Nixon feared. Image caption The Paris peace talks may have ended years earlier, if it had not been for Nixon's subterfuge Chennault was despatched to the South Vietnamese embassy with a clear message: the South Vietnamese government should withdraw from the talks, refuse to deal with Johnson, and if Nixon was elected, they would get a much better deal. So on the eve of his planned announcement of a halt to the bombing, Johnson learned the South Vietnamese were pulling out. He was also told why. The FBI had bugged the ambassador's phone and a transcripts of Anna Chennault's calls were sent to the White House. In one conversation she tells the ambassador to \\"just hang on through election\\". Johnson was told by Defence Secretary Clifford that the interference was illegal and threatened the chance for peace. Image caption Nixon went on to become president and eventually signed a Vietnam peace deal in 1973 In a series of remarkable White House recordings we can hear Johnson's reaction to the news. In one call to Senator Richard Russell he says: \\"We have found that our friend, the Republican nominee, our California friend, has been playing on the outskirts with our enemies and our friends both, he has been doing it through rather subterranean sources. Mrs Chennault is warning the South Vietnamese not to get pulled into this Johnson move.\\" He orders the Nixon campaign to be placed under FBI surveillance and demands to know if Nixon is personally involved. When he became convinced it was being orchestrated by the Republican candidate, the president called Senator Everett Dirksen, the Republican leader in the Senate to get a message to Nixon. The president knew what was going on, Nixon should back off and the subterfuge amounted to treason. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Lyndon B Johnson: How can we survive as a nation and face lies from the press? Publicly Nixon was suggesting he had no idea why the South Vietnamese withdrew from the talks. He even offered to travel to Saigon to get them back to the negotiating table. Johnson felt it was the ultimate expression of political hypocrisy but in calls recorded with Clifford they express the fear that going public would require revealing the FBI were bugging the ambassador's phone and the National Security Agency (NSA) was intercepting his communications with Saigon. So they decided to say nothing. The president did let Humphrey know and gave him enough information to sink his opponent. But by then, a few days from the election, Humphrey had been told he had closed the gap with Nixon and would win the presidency. So Humphrey decided it would be too disruptive to the country to accuse the Republicans of treason, if the Democrats were going to win anyway. Nixon ended his campaign by suggesting the administration war policy was in shambles. They couldn't even get the South Vietnamese to the negotiating table. He won by less than 1% of the popular vote. Once in office he escalated the war into Laos and Cambodia, with the loss of an additional 22,000 American lives - quite apart from the lives of the Laotians, Cambodians and Vietnamese caught up in the new offensives - before finally settling for a peace agreement in 1973 that was within grasp in 1968. The White House tapes, combined with Wheeler's interviews with key White House personnel, provide an unprecedented insight into how Johnson handled a series of crises that rocked his presidency. Sadly, we will never have that sort of insight again.

Question: Where might a person go if they need urgent care for a wound? Choices: - body - injury - patient - emergency room - hospital The rationale to choose \\"emergency room\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"An emergency room (ER) is the most appropriate choice for a person in need of urgent care for a wound, when compared to other options mentioned. The rationale for choosing \\"emergency room\\" as the answer is explained through the following points: 1. Expertise and timely intervention: Emergency rooms are designed to handle a wide range of medical issues requiring immediate attention, including injuries or wounds. Medical professionals in the ER have the necessary expertise and are trained to assess, diagnose, and treat urgent medical conditions promptly. ER staff are adept at handling various types of wounds, whether caused by accidents, traumas, or other incidents. 2. Availability of necessary equipment and technology: Hospitals have well-equipped emergency rooms with advanced diagnostic and treatment tools. If necessary, doctors in the ER can perform imaging tests or other diagnostics to evaluate the severity of the wound, identify infections, or evaluate for other complications. The necessary equipment for wound management, including suturing materials, wound dressings, and sterilization tools, is readily available. 3. Access to specialized care: The emergency department often has a diverse team of specialized healthcare providers, including surgeons and other specialists, who can be rapidly consulted if the wound requires specialized care. This multidisciplinary approach helps ensure that patients receive the appropriate care for their condition. 4. Continuous monitoring and management: In an emergency room, patients with severe wounds can be closely monitored for any changes in their condition. This enables healthcare providers to detect and manage any possible complications or infections that may arise. Additionally, patients can be promptly admitted to the hospital if more extensive or longer-term care is necessary. 5. Coordinated follow-up care: After receiving initial treatment in the ER, the patient's care can be seamlessly coordinated with their primary care physician, specialists, or other healthcare professionals. This ensures that patients receive the necessary follow-up care to aid in the recovery process and prevent complications. In contrast, the other options mentioned may not be appropriate or helpful for someone in need of urgent care for a wound. \\"Body\\" and \\"injury\\" are not specific places where a person could seek medical attention but rather refer to the site and cause of the wound, respectively. \\"Patient\\" refers to the individual receiving care, and thus, is not a place where a person can visit for urgent care. Lastly, while a general \\"hospital\\" can provide care for an individual with a wound, an emergency room within a hospital is best suited to handling urgent wound care. In conclusion, the emergency room is the ideal choice for a person seeking urgent care for a wound, due to the availability of expert care, equipment, technology, specialized support, and continuous monitoring, as well as the ease of coordinating follow-up care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Twelve Tasks of Asterix Movie plot: After a group of legionaries is once again beaten up by the gauls, they imagine: \\"With such huge strength, they can't be human... they must be gods\\". Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German. Cilindric turns out to be an unexpectedly diminutive man wearing a Judo gi but he quickly beats Obelix with a \\"fighting technique he learnt in a distant land\\". Asterix defeats Cilindric by tricking him into giving a lesson and asking for demonstrations that eventually end up with Cilindric's own arms and legs tied in knots.4. Cross a lake. The problem being that in the middle of the lake is the \\"Isle of Pleasure\\", a paradise inhabited by beautiful Sirens. Both Asterix and Obelix are enchanted and drawn to the island, but Obelix comes to his senses quickly after discovering that there are no wild boars on the island, has an incandescent argument with the Sirens, and storms off declaring that they can't call it the Isle of Pleasure if they don't serve wild boars, calling Asterix to follow...","completion":"Asterix ties Cilindric's arms and legs in knots."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. This is some data: AIDAstella, shipLaidDown, 2008-12-17; AIDAstella, length, 253260.0 (millimetres). Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The data provided offers specific information about a particular ship, the AIDAstella. The key points presented are related to the ship's 'Laid Down' date and its length. Let's dive deeper into these aspects and provide a comprehensive understanding of this data: 1. Ship Name: AIDAstella The ship in question is named AIDAstella, which is a part of the AIDA Cruises fleet. AIDA Cruises is a German cruise line that predominantly operates in the German-speaking market. The AIDAstella is a passenger cruise ship that offers various amenities and activities for its guests, such as dining and entertainment options, recreational facilities, and numerous types of accommodation. As a cruise ship, the primary purpose of AIDAstella is to provide a relaxing and enjoyable vacation experience for its passengers while traveling to different destinations. 2. Ship Laid Down Date: 2008-12-17 The term \\"Laid Down\\" refers to a significant milestone in a ship's construction process. It's the point in time when the keel, which is the backbone of a vessel, is first put in place by joining together the first steel plates. The keel forms the structural basis of the ship and determines the overall shape and strength of the vessel. The provided data states that AIDAstella's Laid Down date is December 17, 2008. This indicates that the construction of the ship began on this date, following the initial design and planning stages. From this point on, various sections of the ship would have been progressively assembled until the ship reached completion. Typically, a ship's construction process could last anywhere from a few months to a few years, depending on the size and complexity of the vessel. 3. Ship Length: 253,260 millimetres (approximately 253.26 meters) The length of the AIDAstella is provided in millimetres, where one millimetre is equal to 0.001 meters. With a given length of 253,260 millimetres, the ship's length can be converted to meters by dividing the number by 1,000, resulting in a length of approximately 253.26 meters. Having a length of around 253.26 meters, the AIDAstella is considered a relatively large cruise ship, although not the largest in the industry. The ship's length plays a crucial role in determining its overall size, capacity, and maneuverability. Larger ships tend to provide more room for passenger amenities, accommodations, and on-board entertainment activities. Additionally, they may have a higher passenger capacity, which can result in more business for the cruise line. However, larger ships may face certain restrictions in accessing some ports due to their size, and they can be more challenging to maneuver in tight spaces or under specific weather conditions. In conclusion, the data provided gives a brief overview of the AIDAstella cruise ship, highlighting its Laid Down date and length. The ship began construction on December 17, 2008, and measures approximately 253.26 meters in length, which signifies its scale in terms of size and overall capacity within the AIDA Cruises fleet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: when slavery abolished Suggested answer: In 1787 Congress prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory . Should I validate this answer? Choices: +No +Yes The answer is:","completion":"No, you should not validate this answer as it is not entirely accurate or comprehensive. While it is true that in 1787, Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance which prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, it did not abolish slavery entirely in the United States. The process of abolishing slavery took many years, and it occurred at different times in different countries. In the context of the United States, the most significant step towards abolishing slavery was the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, which outlawed slavery throughout the entire nation. Providing a more accurate and detailed answer for the question would be as follows: The abolition of slavery in the United States was a gradual process that took place over many years. Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance in 1787, which prohibited slavery in the Northwest Territory, but it did not apply to the entire nation. The British Empire abolished slavery in 1833 with the passage of the Slavery Abolition Act. In the United States, President Abraham Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was issued in 1863, which declared that all slaves in Confederate states were to be set free. However, the complete abolition of slavery in the United States was formally achieved with the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Constitution in 1865, which outlawed slavery throughout the entire nation. Hence, validating only the part about the Northwest Ordinance as the answer would not provide an accurate and comprehensive understanding of when slavery was abolished."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This takes place within the story of the Israelites' Exodus after they escaped Egypt and reached Mt. Sinai (Exodus 19:1). The Book of Exodus narrates how Moses led the Israelites in building the Tabernacle (Exodus 35--40) based on God's instructions (Exodus 25--31). Then in Leviticus, God tells the Israelites and their priests how to make offerings in the Tabernacle and how to conduct themselves while camped around the holy tent sanctuary. Leviticus takes place during the month or month-and-a-half between the completion of the Tabernacle (Exodus 40:17) and the Israelites' departure from Sinai (Numbers 1:1, 10:11).

In the process of exterminating the rats, Willard saves them and finds as he feeds and plays with them that he can train the animals, by feeding them, and setting himself in their instincts as a rescuer. He baits the rats onto a pillar in the center of a well, and removes the wood bridge that they crossed.

Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to this question would be a description. The origin of the U.S. Army sergeant's stripes can be traced back to the early days of the American military, during the Revolutionary War. The stripes on a sergeant's uniform are meant to symbolize rank and authority and have evolved over time, both in appearance and meaning. During the Revolutionary War, the rank of sergeant was already an important part of military hierarchy. Soldiers holding this rank were expected to manage enlisted men and carry out the orders of their commanding officers, among other duties. At this time, sergeants wore a visible symbol of their rank: chevrons. Chevrons are inverted V-shaped stripes sewn onto the sleeves or shoulders of uniforms, and they indicated not only a sergeant's rank but also his unit and branch of service. The earliest known use of chevrons dates back to the 17th century in the British military. The design was adopted by the United States military during its infancy. Originally, sergeants were identified by a single chevron worn on the right sleeve, positioned just above the elbow. As time passed and the military evolved, so did the usage and design of chevrons. By the time of the Civil War, sergeants in the U.S. Army wore three chevrons pointing upward on both sleeves. The widespread use of this design conferred a sense of unity and standardization across the military ranks. However, it was not until the early 20th century that the current design of the sergeant's stripes emerged. In 1902, the U.S. Army introduced a new uniform that featured a redesigned rank insignia system. This uniform specification included new rank insignia for enlisted soldiers and noncommissioned officers (NCOs), like sergeants. The new design standardized the arrangement and number of chevrons for each rank, with lower-ranking sergeants wearing fewer stripes than those holding higher ranks. For example, a sergeant would wear three stripes, while a staff sergeant would wear three stripes and a rocker, and a first sergeant would wear three stripes and a diamond. From that point forward, the sergeant's stripes in the U.S. Army have largely remained consistent in design. Today, these stripes are used to denote rank and responsibilities, as well as to serve as a symbol of pride and accomplishment for the soldiers who wear them. The stripes worn today can be traced back to the early days of the American military, embodying a rich history of tradition, evolution, and service."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? Hint: According to current definitions, all planets must revolve around stars; thus, any potential \\"rogue planets\\" are excluded. In the Solar System, all the planets orbit the Sun in the same direction as the Sun rotates (counter-clockwise as seen from above the Sun's north pole). At least one extrasolar planet, WASP-17b, has been found to orbit in the opposite direction to its star's rotation. The period of one revolution of a planet's orbit is known as its sidereal period or year. A planet's year depends on its distance from its star; the farther a planet is from its star, not only the longer the distance it must travel, but also the slower its speed, because it is less affected by its star's gravity. No planet's orbit is perfectly circular, and hence the distance of each varies over the course of its year. The closest approach to its star is called its periastron (perihelion in the Solar System), whereas its farthest separation from the star is called its apastron (aphelion). As a planet approaches periastron, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, just as a falling object on Earth accelerates as it falls; as the planet reaches apastron, its speed decreases, just as an object thrown upwards on Earth slows down as it reaches the apex of its trajectory.Each planet's orbit is delineated by a set of elements: A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph, Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth. This can be explained by understanding various factors that contribute to a planet's orbit, including their distance from the Sun, sidereal period, and orbital elements. Neptune, being the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system, has a larger orbit compared to Earth. The distance a planet must travel to complete one revolution around the Sun, otherwise known as its orbit, depends on its distance from the Sun. The farther a planet is from the Sun, the longer its orbit. Furthermore, a planet's year or sidereal period depends on its distance from its star. Since Neptune is farther from the Sun than Earth, it not only has to travel a longer distance but also does so at a slower speed. This is because Neptune is less affected by the Sun's gravity compared to Earth. Additionally, no planet's orbit is perfectly circular, meaning the distance each planet is from the Sun varies throughout its year. The point of closest approach to the Sun is called perihelion, while the farthest separation is called aphelion. As a planet approaches perihelion, its speed increases as it trades gravitational potential energy for kinetic energy, similar to a falling object on Earth. Conversely, as a planet reaches aphelion, its speed decreases, much like an object thrown upwards on Earth slowing down at its peak trajectory. Taking into account these factors and characteristics of planetary orbits, it is clear that Neptune would travel a longer distance than Earth due to its greater distance from the Sun, larger orbit, and slower speed influenced by the Sun's gravitational pull."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The review might read as follows: Title: \\"Extremely Disappointing Dining Experience\\" I had been looking forward to trying out this highly recommended restaurant for quite some time, but unfortunately, my experience was far from enjoyable. There were several issues that I encountered during my visit, which left me feeling dissatisfied and regretful about my decision to dine here. Firstly, upon arrival, the hostess was unfriendly and uncommunicative. As our first point of contact, her unprofessional demeanor set a poor tone for the night. It took her nearly 15 minutes to seat us, despite having a reservation and plenty of empty tables available. This was only the beginning of the slow service we would experience throughout our meal. Once seated, it took a considerable amount of time for our server to acknowledge our presence and take our drink orders. The server seemed overwhelmed and displayed little enthusiasm or knowledge about the menu options. This was further highlighted when we asked for recommendations and were met with unhelpful and generic responses. When our drinks finally arrived, they were lukewarm, and it was clear that the bartender had not given them much attention. This theme of mediocrity continued with our appetizers, which were not only bland but also improperly cooked. The calamari was chewy and rubbery, while the bruschetta tasted stale and lacked the freshness I’d expect from such a simple dish. Our main courses were equally disappointing. The steak I ordered was supposed to be medium-rare, but it arrived well-done and devoid of any seasoning. My dining companion opted for the pasta dish, which was swimming in a watery sauce that had seemingly been haphazardly poured over the noodles. Throughout our meal, the service remained slow and inattentive. On several occasions, we had to actively flag down our server for refills on water and bread, and our dirty dishes from previous courses took an uncomfortably long time to be cleared away. Lastly, the ambiance of the restaurant was quite unappealing. The lighting was uneven and overly bright in some areas, while the noise level made it difficult to carry on a conversation. This, combined with the uncomfortable seating, made it challenging to enjoy any aspect of our visit. Overall, our dining experience at this restaurant was a significant letdown. Both the food quality and service were well below par, and the environment did not offer any redeeming qualities. It's unfortunate that the restaurant did not live up to its hype, and I won't be returning or recommending it to family or friends."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: You are given a new situation: A scientist is analyzing two different sounds, one from a deer and one from a zebra, with a device that allows her to see the sound waves of each noise. While looking at the results, she sees that the sound waves for the deer are more closely packed together, but the zebra's sound has very spread out waves. and a hint : Look at the police car in Figure below . The sound waves from its siren travel outward in all directions. Because the car is racing forward (toward the right), the sound waves get bunched up in front of the car and spread out behind it. As the car approaches the person on the right (position B), the sound waves get closer and closer together. In other words, they have a higher frequency. This makes the siren sound higher in pitch. After the car speeds by the person on the left (position A), the sound waves get more and more spread out, so they have a lower frequency. This makes the siren sound lower in pitch. A change in the frequency of sound waves, relative to a stationary listener, when the source of the sound waves is moving is called the Doppler effect . You’ve probably experienced the Doppler effect yourself. The next time a vehicle with a siren races by, listen for the change in pitch. For an online animation of the Doppler effect, go to the URL below. Please answer this question : Which animal's sound has a higher pitch? A:","completion":"Given the hint provided on the Doppler effect, let's think step-by-step and justify our conclusion: 1. The hint explains the Doppler effect, which refers to the change in frequency of sound waves relative to a stationary listener when the source of the sound waves is moving. 2. In the hint, when the sound waves get bunched up and have a higher frequency, it results in a higher pitch. 3. In the given situation, the deer's sound waves are more closely packed together compared to the zebra's sound waves. Based on these steps, we can conclude that the deer's sound has a higher pitch due to the more closely packed sound waves, which indicates a higher frequency.

He didn’t seem remotely fazed by what he was telling me at all. There he was, spreading jelly on his toast as he told me about all the women he had cheated on his wife with. He told me about how it had started with a secretary (talk about cliches!) and then graduated to trysts in motels with girls off Tinder all with the same amount of casualness as someone describing how to make an omelette!

I stumbled upon \\"Masters of Horror\\" which contained \\"Pro-Life\\" and \\"Right to Die\\". They seemed OK, same-old cheesy Horror crap, but I was interested for some reason. It said about Pro-Life on the case about being a classic, a return to form for John Carpenter (I loved his \\"The Thing\\", so I thought this would be good) and all that. So I turned it on thinking it would be something great and interesting, I was very wrong... It started off casual, just a girl running through a Forest, scared of something. A car stops and picks her up (just so being the people she needed to see, amazing?) They take her back to some Clinic and examine her, at the sametime all this is happening her Father appears at the gates and they don't allow him in, he isn't aloud near the area. Most likely from something he would of done in the past, but you don't know of any of this at the moment. He really does not want his Daughter in this place, an Abortion center. He is very strongly against such acts, believing it's sickening and not what \\"God\\" would want. He \\"supports\\" what I heard is called \\"Pro-Life\\". Acting against Abortions and going to extremes to allow the Babies to be born, they are sick. They don't like the Life of an unborn being taken, yet they've killed Humans in the past to allow the Birth? Justice is only a figment of the mind. Anyway, back on track, after the girl is examined they find out shes pregnant, but far ahead than what she should be. She is only a few weeks pregnant, but is months ahead. She keeps telling them they wont understand her, and that she wants an Abortion and all, but finally tells the truth that she was raped by a Demon from Hell, and that her Father wants this baby (but believes \\"God\\" wants this baby, not who truly does). He gets his 3 Sons (they arm themselves with Pistols and Shotguns), and begin to make they're way into the Clinic (shooting down anyone who won't co-operate). The head of the Clinic, who must of had trouble with them in the past, is well prepared this time. Ends up killing one the Fathers Sons, but in the end gets shot a few times (wearing a bullet proof jacket). The Father then performs what he believes is done to the Women. He cuts a hole, where the Vagina would be if he we're a Female, and sticks some sort of sucking thing up there and sucks out all this blood. Whilst all this is happening, the girl gives birth to some Demonic baby with many legs, and some Demon raises from beneath the Earth (not in the same room) and starts looking for its child. The Father sees this later on, and starts questioning why this happened, he did what he was told to do, and doesn't understand why it's like this. The Demon had killed both of his Sons earlier, and now goes for Father... Whilst the girl kills the baby, and the Demon carries it away (not in the same scene).

I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local Suncoast, which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks (including its sequel \\"Witchcraft XI\\"). So basically I paid the rock bottom price of 2.50 for this movie, if you do the math. I can't exactly say I was ripped off. I have a thing for trashy horror movies, but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name. The budget couldn't be over 1,000 (though it appears as if they spent a total of 1.50). I know it's a low-budget film, but that's no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork. The film \\"Blood Cult,\\" though not very good, was made for an extremely low budget and still had fairly good camerawork and acting. The acting in this movie is the definition of \\"effortless,\\" especially from that muscular guy with the Texas accent. Everyone is pretty much reading their lines off the page. You can take that figuratively or literally. I wouldn't be surprised if the script was off-camera as they were performing. I said before that I've never seen a bad English actor. This movie has quite a few bad ones. And though English movies aren't always good, they always seem to have at least a level of sophistication, which is why I don't see why any Englishman, or Englishwoman, would volunteer to do a home-video-style schlock flick like this. Did Merchant Ivory put a hold on their casting calls? Usually, I think people are too hard on directors and actors. Even some of the worst movies in Hollywood have some level of professionalism in the directing, acting and cinematography departments. Even when you watch a movie like \\"Glitter\\" you can't honestly say it looks like a third-grader shot those scenes (though a third-grader could've written the script). I've seen home movies that are shot better than \\"Witchcraft X,\\" and that's no exaggeration whatsoever. Even the gore is minimal since the filmmakers only had money to buy some fake blood on sale at Party City. Not a single effort was put into making this movie--let's just sum it up like that.

Given the question: Given the background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. and the situation: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Answer the following question: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Mardine? The answer is:","completion":"The electron shielding is lower in Mardine as compared to Sampline. As Timmy observed, Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine, meaning that Sampline is in a lower (higher atomic number) period and has more electron shells. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where the inner electrons of an atom shield the outer electrons from feeling the full force of the positively charged nucleus. This occurs because the inner electrons have a repulsive force on the outer electrons that helps to counterbalance the nucleus's attractive force. In the case of Mardine and Sampline, since they are in the same column of the periodic table, they have the same number of valence electrons. However, because Sampline is further down the periodic table, it has more electron shells or energy levels. This means there are more inner electrons in Sampline that can contribute to electron shielding, leading to a higher electron shielding effect in Sampline. As a result, when comparing Mardine and Sampline, electron shielding is higher in Sampline due to a larger number of inner electrons and energy levels. Conversely, this implies that electron shielding is lower in Mardine. This also correlates with the general trend of decreasing electronegativity down a column in the periodic table, as a higher electron shielding effect in larger atoms results in weaker attraction of outer electrons to the nucleus."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which parcel of land didn't have an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers? Hint: Soil is well developed in the forest as suggested by the thick humus layers, rich diversity of large trees and animals that live there. In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers.

Summarize this article: Last October seven island sites were granted dark sky status by an international body which recognises the best locations around the world. The government now wants to build on that number with a view to attracting astronomers from all over the planet. The Milky Way must be clearly visible to qualify as a dark sky site. The chairman of the Isle of Man Astronomical Society, Howard Parkin said: \\"Sites must be clear of light pollution, provide good sightlines of the sky and have good public access.\\". \\"All sites must have the approval of the relevant landowner,\\" he added. Mr Parkin is working with the government on the plan and believes the island could have dozens of suitable locations. The island's seven sites mean it already has the largest concentration of dark sky sites in Britain. The areas already recognised by the Dark Sky Association include Smeale Nature Reserve, Niarbyl and The Sound. Other areas that have been awarded the status are Port Soderick Brooghs, Axnfell Plantation Fort Island and Sulby Reservoir Car Park. The classification is given to promote astronomy and energy efficiency. A tourism spokesman said the development of specialist niche markets to attract high-spending visitors is a cornerstone of their current strategy. According to government figures visitor spending increased by more than 5% in 2012 to Â£103m, with spending by leisure visitors up by 14% to Â£47.7m. Mr Parkin added: \\"The beauty of the island is that it has very little light pollution. There are no motorways or large built up areas, so as a consequence you only have to drive a little way to find a dark sky site and enjoy the splendour of the night sky. \\"We are the only place which has seven locations in one area. The Isles Scilly have got five nominated sites but we already have seven approved and to be quite honest we could have 27.

Answer the following question: Given the below context: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

Am I missing something? Just because I want to be a vegetarian doesn't mean I don't want to know how many calories or fat there is in a recipe. Does this product review convey a negative or positive sentiment? Answer:","completion":"The product review you provided appears to convey a negative sentiment. I will elaborate on the reasons for this conclusion and discuss the possible factors contributing to the reviewer's disappointment. Firstly, the title suggests that the reviewer is willing to change their rating if they can obtain the desired information, meaning that their current rating is likely to be less satisfactory. This statement indicates that the reviewer is not satisfied with the product at the moment and has a concern that is not addressed. The main issue expressed in the review revolves around the lack of nutritional information for the recipes provided in the book. The reviewer seems to be implying that this is a vital aspect for them when choosing or following a recipe, as they specifically mention the absence of calorie and fat content details. This suggests that the reviewer might have specific dietary requirements or preferences, and therefore needs to be aware of such nutritional elements to make an informed decision. Moreover, the reviewer points out that just because they want to be a vegetarian, it doesn't imply that they should be unaware of the nutritional content of their meals. This further reinforces the idea that the reviewer values complete information related to the recipes and feels disappointed that the book does not cater to this need. Additionally, the reviewer's choice of phrasing in the text, such as \\"is it me or\\" and \\"am I missing something,\\" indicates frustration and confusion. These expressions display their annoyance at not finding the expected nutritional information and hint at a possible sense of uncertainty as to whether they have overlooked any relevant information contained in the book. Taking all these factors into account, it can be concluded that the product review certainly conveys a negative sentiment. The reviewer appears to be dissatisfied with the lack of nutritional information, which they consider a crucial aspect when following a vegetarian diet. Their tone and choice of words further depict a sense of frustration and disappointment, which overall results in a negative impression of the product."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: [a]. World. [b]. Sports. [c]. Business. [d]. Science/Tech.","completion":"This topic is about: [c]. Business. The statement made by Lee Scott, the CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., highlights a critical concern in the business landscape. Wal-Mart, headquartered in Bentonville, Arkansas, is a multinational retail giant commonly known for its chain of hypermarkets, discount department stores, and grocery stores. However, being entangled in multiple lawsuits can have far-reaching implications on the company's financial health, reputation, and long-term sustainability. Legal battles in the corporate world can be incredibly expensive, even for global powerhouses like Wal-Mart. The financial burden of lawsuits can be significant, taking into account the legal fees, penalties, settlements, and the possible need to adapt or change the company's policies and processes. Such challenges might not only affect Wal-Mart's bottom line but can also impact the overall market perception, investor confidence, and customer loyalty. The statement issued by the CEO highlights that Wal-Mart is not immune to external pressure. It is a reminder for the company to recognize the growing risks and act accordingly. Ignoring the potential fallout of these lawsuits can be detrimental to the company's expansion and innovation efforts, as well as hampering their ability to remain a global leader in the retail sector. There is also the fact that Wal-Mart is a major employer with over 2 million employees across its global operations. Any negative impact on the business, be it reputational or financial, has the potential to affect the livelihoods of these employees as well. A weakened financial position could lead to cost-cutting measures such as layoffs, wage stagnation, or reduced employee benefits. Wal-Mart should take these risks seriously and proactively strategize to mitigate potential damages posed by the lawsuits. Failure to do so may result in decreased market share, loss of public trust, and reduced competitive advantage. Effective corporate governance, compliance, and ethical practices must be a top priority for businesses like Wal-Mart, especially as they continue to evolve and grow in the dynamic and intricate global market. In conclusion, the comments made by Lee Scott, the CEO of Wal-Mart Stores Inc., is about the business domain. The reference to the potentially costly lawsuits signifies a realization of the damage that they could pose to the company's overall health. The topic emphasizes the need for businesses to remain vigilant and actively address their legal liabilities in order to maintain a strong, sustainable, and competitive footing in the market."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Within the Cape Evans hut an inscription by Richards on the wall near his bunk, listing the names of those lost, can still be read, but the generally deteriorating condition of the huts has caused concern.The Aurora survived for less than a year after her final return from the Ross Sea. Shackleton had sold her for £10,000, and her new role was as a coal-carrier between Australia and South America. She disappeared in the Pacific Ocean, on or about 2 January 1918, having either foundered in a storm or been sunk by an enemy raider. Aboard her was James Paton of the Ross Sea ship's party, who was still serving as her boatswain. Ernest Wild was also a victim of the First World War. He died of typhoid in Malta, on 10 March 1918, while serving with the Royal Navy in the Mediterranean.On 4 July 1923, Joyce and Richards were awarded Albert Medals by George V for their bravery and life-saving efforts during the second depot-laying journey.

How do their relationships evolve throughout the film, and what does their evolution reveal about the human condition in a resource-diminished world?

Can Straker's ruthless leadership and desperate measures to recapture Corlie be justified in this post-apocalyptic world? And, critically, how does the betrayal of the Clearwater mechanic/fabricator Rusty pivot the plot's progression and demonstrate the far-reaching consequences of survival instincts?

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the first name of the person that historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437? The identity of the donor has not been established, although a number of suggestions have been advanced over the last 200 years. Harbison suggests the work's small scale indicates that it functioned as a portable altarpiece rather than as a private devotional work, and thus was commissioned by or for a member of the clergy. Other art historians have argued that the donor may have been a Genoese merchant. This belief has been fed by the triptych's similarity to Giovanni Mazone's Virgin and Child altarpiece in Pontremoli, Tuscany, which may place it in the Italian region of Liguria at latest by the end of the 15th century. Damaged coats of arms on the inner frames have been linked to the Giustiniani family, known for establishing trade links with Bruges in the 14th and 15th centuries. If not commissioned by that family, historical record place the work at least in their possession by the end of the century. In the early 1800s, Frances Weale attempted to place Michele Giustiniani as the donor, however later historical research has been unable to verify his presence in Bruges around 1437, and he seems to have returned to Italy by 1430.Mid-twentieth century technical examination revealed the Giustiniani coats of arms may have been painted over an earlier heraldic design, perhaps as early as the 15th century, whose signifiance and history is now lost. Dhanens theorises that a member of the Giustiniani family may have established other associations with St. Michael and St. Catherine, advancing that they were a member of the Italian Rapondi family, whose trading house in Paris was named after St. Catherine. Their daughter, also named Catherine, married the Italian merchant Michel Burlamacchi (Bollemard in Flemish) from Lucca, who was active in Bruges. From this Dhanens theorises the piece was commissioned as a wedding gift for the couple.

Question: What was different about executions in Missouri after 1919? Context: Around 1890, a political movement developed in the United States to mandate private executions. Several states enacted laws which required executions to be conducted within a \\"wall\\" or \\"enclosure\\" to \\"exclude public view.\\" For example, in 1919, the Missouri legislature adopted a statute (L.1919, p. 781) which required, \\"the sentence of death should be executed within the county jail, if convenient, and otherwise within an enclosure near the jail.\\" The Missouri law permitted the local sheriff to distribute passes to individuals (usually local citizens) whom he believed should witness the hanging, but the sheriffs – for various reasons – sometimes denied passes to individuals who wanted to watch. Missouri executions conducted after 1919 were not \\"public\\" because they were conducted behind closed walls, and the general public was not permitted to attend. The answer to this question is:","completion":"After 1919, executions in Missouri were different because they were no longer public and were conducted behind closed walls or within enclosures. The general public was not allowed to attend these executions, as the local sheriff would distribute passes to selected individuals to witness the hanging."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: When was the last time your family sat down together to have a dinner? The speed at which we live today no longer allows for slow eating habits. Most people work long hours. There is lots of fast food and eating out is now on the increase. Often, food is eaten in front of the television in silence, or a child eats alone in front of the computer. When I was a child, every evening around the same time, one of the children would be asked to set the table, and then we'd go and wash our hands: before the meal. This was the time of day when we would talk about our day at school. But now things have changed a lot. A family environment plays an important role for children in learning to communicate with others and understanding table manners, such as waiting for others to finish before leaving the table and not speaking with a mouth full of food. Parents' likes and dislikes of a certain food will also influence a child's own likes and dislikes. Studies have shown that children who often eat with their families have better results at school than children who eat with their families less than twice a week. Regular meal times give children the chance to discuss their problems with family members. They can also learn to respect others around the table. Talking to your children over dinner is the best way of having their-trust. Children learn good eating habits from their parents at a very young age. Family meals are important.

Based on the premise \\"My poor Emily. \\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Emily has something lucky happened to Emily.\\" is true?","completion":"In order to assess the validity of the hypothesis \\"Emily has something lucky happened to Emily\\" based on the premise \\"My poor Emily,\\" it is essential to first examine the meaning of the premise and any possible implications. A detailed analysis is provided below to help understand the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. At first glance, the premise \\"My poor Emily\\" appears to express pity or sympathy towards a person named Emily. The word \\"poor\\" in this context suggests that Emily might be experiencing a misfortune or an unlucky event. Therefore, this statement seems to indicate that something unfavorable or distressing has occurred to Emily, leading the speaker to sympathize with her. Given this interpretation of the premise, it is important to take a closer look at the hypothesis. The hypothesis \\"Emily has something lucky happened to Emily\\" suggests that a fortunate or beneficial event has occurred in Emily's life. Contrary to the implication in the premise, the hypothesis posits a positive outcome for Emily. Considering the apparent discrepancy between the premise and the hypothesis, it seems that the two statements contradict each other. Since the premise insinuates that Emily is experiencing something unfortunate and the hypothesis implies a lucky event for her, it is challenging to reconcile these opposing ideas. Furthermore, it is crucial to consider the possibility of alternative interpretations for the premise. For instance, the term \\"poor\\" could be used metaphorically to describe Emily's character or emotional state. In this case, the premise might be underscoring Emily's vulnerability, sorrowful disposition, or humble nature, making it ambiguous whether something lucky or unlucky has indeed happened to her. If this is the interpretation, then drawing conclusions about the hypothesis may not be possible based on the information provided by the premise alone. To sum up, the premise \\"My poor Emily\\" does not seem to support the hypothesis \\"Emily has something lucky happened to Emily.\\" Instead, the premise alludes to something unfortunate in Emily's life, seemingly contradicting the hypothesis. While alternative interpretations of the premise may add some ambiguity to the relationship between the two statements, based on the available information and initial analysis, the hypothesis does not seem to be true in light of the premise provided. However, as with any analysis of language and context, it is important to be cautious about drawing definitive conclusions or making assumptions without further information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: Former first minister Rhodri Morgan has accused BBC Wales of a \\"breach of faith\\" following the corporation's decision to relocate its headquarters to Cardiff city centre. Article:","completion":"Title: Former First Minister Rhodri Morgan Accuses BBC Wales of \\"Breach of Faith\\" Over Headquarters Relocation Introduction: Former first minister Rhodri Morgan has recently leveled serious accusations against BBC Wales, calling their decision to relocate their headquarters to Cardiff city centre a \\"breach of faith\\". Morgan asserts that the corporation's move undermines the initial agreement made between the government and the established broadcaster. In this article, we delve into the details of this controversy and analyze the implications of this move for both parties. Background: BBC Wales, one of the oldest and most renowned news broadcasting channels in the region, had previously agreed with the Welsh government to construct its headquarters within the designated district as part of the ongoing efforts to stimulate growth and development in the area. This decision was seen as a long-term commitment by both parties to encourage local businesses and generate employment opportunities in the locale. The Accusations: Former first minister Rhodri Morgan, who has been a critical advocate of BBC Wales' presence and support for the city's development, took to various media platforms to express his dissatisfaction and disappointment with the corporation's decision. According to Morgan, the BBC's move to relocate its headquarters to Cardiff city centre constitutes a breach of faith, particularly as the decision seems to disregard the initial plans to use the prestigious channel as a catalyst for growth in the designated district. Morgan also urges the Welsh government and BBC Wales to seriously reevaluate and reconsider the implications of this move. He emphasizes the importance of collaboration and trust between both parties, especially when it comes to the preservation of Welsh heritage and the promotion of the nation's values at large. The Response: BBC Wales has yet to issue an official response to the accusations brought forward by Morgan. However, this development has ignited a conversation surrounding the broadcaster's commitment to its local audience and the communities it serves. As public opinion begins to sway, it is expected that BBC Wales will need to address these concerns and provide clarity on its future plans. Conclusion: The controversy surrounding BBC Wales' relocation of its headquarters to Cardiff city centre raises critical questions about the relationship between the media and local government. Making a commitment to stimulate growth in a designated area and then seemingly reneging on that commitment can negatively impact public trust and, ultimately, the reputation of both parties involved. As the story unfolds, we wait with anticipation and hope that BBC Wales will take the necessary steps to restore faith in their organization and make amends, where possible, for any breaches of trust with their community."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Step 2: Apply these findings to the new situation In the new situation, plant A was not exposed to drought, while plant B was repeatedly exposed to drought conditions. Step 3: Determine which plant would change the regulation of their stomata Based on the background article's findings, the plants exposed to drought were the ones that changed their regulation of stomata to better adapt to water scarcity.

Please answer the following question: Here's a question: The park had a refuse and littering problem, so they added another what? Here are possible answers to this question: - tip - park officer - incinerator - dump - wastebasket I believe the correct choice is \\"wastebasket\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"wastebasket,\\" and there are several reasons to support this answer. 1. Context: In the context of a park experiencing a refuse and littering problem, the best and most practical solution would be to address the root cause of the issue, which likely stems from a lack of waste disposal options for visitors. Adding more wastebaskets throughout the park would provide a convenient and accessible means for individuals to dispose of their trash properly, which could help alleviate the littering problem. 2. Public Health and Aesthetics: A clean and well-maintained park encourages more visitors and provides a safe environment for various recreational activities. By providing additional wastebaskets, the park administrators can maintain a cleaner and more attractive public space, thus promoting the overall health and well-being of the community. 3. Environmental Impact: Adding more wastebaskets encourages proper waste disposal and can prevent trash from ending up in waterways, habitats, or other areas where it could harm wildlife and contaminate natural resources. This minimizes the environmental impact of litter, which in turn contributes to the preservation of the park's ecosystem. 4. Cost-Effectiveness: Installing additional wastebaskets is more cost-effective than the other options listed. For example, hiring more park officers or building an incinerator come with considerable expense and operational costs. On the other hand, wastebaskets are relatively inexpensive and easy to maintain. 5. Practicality and Public Perception: Some of the other options, such as adding a dump or incinerator, could entail negative consequences in terms of public perception, environmental impact, and general feasibility. These options may not only address the littering problem ineffectively but also could bring about unwanted side effects like pollution, odor, or detracting from the park's natural beauty. In contrast, increasing the number of wastebaskets offers a practical approach that can be widely supported by park visitors and the community. In conclusion, the correct choice for addressing the refuse and littering problem at the park is to add more wastebaskets. This approach directly addresses the root cause of the issue, provides an accessible and environmentally friendly solution, and offers a cost-effective means of preserving public health and well-being. Ultimately, increasing the number of wastebaskets can help maintain an attractive and enjoyable space for people to connect with nature and engage in recreational activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In many ways, airplanes are a retailer's dream come true. They serve a captive -- often bored -- audience who have proven their income is disposable enough to afford air travel. It's no wonder that in the last few years, airlines have adapted an increasingly sophisticated approach to parting customers from their money. \\"By nature, airlines are mass transit operators, and they didn't necessarily have any retail savviness when they first started to unbundle -- it was very much low-hanging fruits, like chocolate bars and Pringles up and down the aisle,\\" says Dan Thompson, senior vice president of global strategy at GuestLogix, a provider of in-flight retail solutions. \\"Now, there's a new sense of maturity in retail strategies with airlines,\\" he adds. Lately, carriers have replaced mass market beers with craft brews, standard chips with locally sourced gourmet goodies, and added ticketed events to the retail roster. In 2011, AirBaltic even experimented with selling cars on board their flights, becoming the first carrier to do so. \\"We think of flight as a travel megastore; we expect to make money for the products that we offer,\\" says Jannis Vanags, AirBaltic's vice president for communications. In many ways, the Latvian carrier has been a trailblazer when it comes to its retail offerings. Vanags claims it was the first airline to introduce bicycle rentals, and the first to accept Bitcoin as a form of payment. It was also one of the first airlines to allow non-passengers to make surprise purchases (think roses and champagne) for their friends in the air. Currently, customers can also buy AirBaltic-branded shoes on the flight. \\"Some things have been batted around in terms of thinking outside the box, in terms of 'how wacky can we get?' and in a sense, the sky is the limit -- excuse the pun -- for what you can sell on board,\\" says Thompson. Mainly, though, he notes that it's the tried-and-true that entice customers the most. \\"Really, passengers will spend on something that enhances their trip, and means something to them because of the experience they're in at the moment. It's hard to imagine them going on board and buying a sofa that will be delivered back to their apartment.\\" The odd factor. For many years, airlines left the quirkier retail offering to SkyMall, the quarterly in-flight catalog available on almost all domestic flights in the United States. An old business model (the company is nearing its 25th anniversary), SkyMall has recently had to contend with the more aggressive retail strategies employed by many airlines, as well as distracting new technology; iPhones in the air mean travelers are less dependent on the catalog for entertainment. The company, which has made a name for itself by proffering off-kilter items (the garden yeti and remote-control R2D2 robot are long-standing best-sellers), has recently started to adapt its business model, putting even more focus on quirky products. SkyMall is also in the process of launching a mobile app. \\"One of the larger shifts in the last several years is we've become extremely product-centric,\\" says Darin Geiger, SkyMall's director of merchandizing. \\"We want to be proactive in finding what's new and unique. To that end, we've been going to a lot more trade shows, searching the globe for those new products.\\" Some of its biggest sellers, notes Geiger, are sports paraphernalia and pet products. Though he says SkyMall's customer base appreciates functionality, it's some of the stranger and more original products that capture the imagination. \\"First, we look at products that are new to market, or solve problems. Then, we look for those social-media type products that our marketing team can have a lot of fun with,\\" he adds. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

More restrictively, it is writing considered as an art form, or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage. Its Latin root \\"literatura\\"/\\"litteratura\\" (derived itself from \\"littera\\": \\"letter\\" or \\"handwriting\\") was used to refer to all written accounts, though contemporary definitions extend the term to include texts that are spoken or sung (oral literature). Literature can be classified according to whether it is fiction or non-fiction and whether it is poetry or prose; it can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the novel, short story or drama; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain aesthetic features or expectations (genre). - A comic strip is a sequence of drawings arranged in interrelated panels to display brief humor or form a narrative, often serialized, with text in balloons and captions. Traditionally, throughout the 20th century and into the 21st, these have been published in newspapers and magazines, with horizontal strips printed in black-and-white in daily newspapers, while Sunday newspapers offered longer sequences in special color comics sections. With the development of the internet, they began to appear online as web comics.

Scholars have posited a pre-history as far back as the Lascaux cave paintings. By the mid-20th century, comics flourished particularly in the United States, western Europe (especially in France and Belgium), and Japan. The history of European comics is often traced to Rodolphe Töpffer's cartoon strips of the 1830s, and became popular following the success in the 1930s of strips and books such as \\"The Adventures of Tintin\\". American comics emerged as a mass medium in the early 20th century with the advent of newspaper comic strips; magazine-style comic books followed in the 1930s, in which the superhero genre became prominent after Superman appeared in 1938. Histories of Japanese comics and cartooning (\\"\\") propose origins as early as the 12th century. Modern comic strips emerged in Japan in the early 20th century, and the output of comics magazines and books rapidly expanded in the post-World War II era with the popularity of cartoonists such as Osamu Tezuka. had a lowbrow reputation for much of its history, but towards the end of the 20th century began to find greater acceptance with the public and in academia. - The Pulitzer Prize is an award for achievements in newspaper, magazine and online journalism, literature, and musical composition in the United States.

There is a local election in Troy's city and he is researching the two candidates running for mayor. Troy is a strong environmentalist who believes, above all else, that taking care of the Earth is the number one priority in anything. In his research he decides to read the environmental proposals of each candidate. Mark Hampton, one candidate, has a proposal that he says will strongly boost the city's economy by opening more industrial factories, but these will increase the carbon dioxide put into the atmosphere. Jeffrey Lindell, the other candidate, says that he wants to begin implementing solar panel farms to generate electricity to cut down on the carbon emissions the city produces. Hint: Current Situation : Currently the heating effect of extra greenhouse gases (since the start of the industrial revolution) is equal to about . Thus the recent period has recorded parallel increases in concentration of carbon dioxide and average global temperature. As more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere the temperature will increase further. There are certain effects of a warmer Earth (discussed more in optional section), which could accelerate the process, even if no more greenhouse gases are put into the atmosphere (an unlikely prospect for the foreseeable future).

Instead, she picked a different filling for her sandwich, like cheese and ham, which are made from milk and meat from a pig. When they reached the park, they found a nice, grassy spot under a big tree to sit down and eat their sandwiches. The tree had lots of leaves that provided shade to protect them from the sun while they ate. Maria happily took a big bite of her mushroom sandwich and enjoyed the taste very much. She thought it was yum-yum-yummy! On the other hand, Rachel happily ate her cheese and ham sandwich, which she found mouth-watering delicious.

Theodor Seuss Geisel ( ( listen); March 2, 1904 - September 24, 1991) was an American author, political cartoonist, poet, animator, book publisher, and artist, best known for authoring more than 60 children's books under the pen name Doctor Seuss (abbreviated Dr. Seuss) (). His work includes several of the most popular children's books of all time, selling over 600 million copies and being translated into more than 20 languages by the time of his death. Geisel adopted the name \\"Dr. Seuss\\" as an undergraduate at Dartmouth College and a graduate student at the University of Oxford. He left Oxford in 1927 to begin his career as an illustrator and cartoonist for Vanity Fair, Life, and various other publications. Geisel was born and raised in Springfield, Massachusetts, the son of Henrietta (nee Seuss) and Theodor Robert Geisel. His father managed the family brewery and was later appointed to supervise Springfield's public park system by Mayor John A. Denison after the brewery closed because of Prohibition. Mulberry Street in Springfield, made famous in Dr. Seuss' first children's book And to Think That I Saw It on Mulberry Street, is less than a mile southwest of his boyhood home on Fairfield Street. Geisel was raised a Lutheran. He enrolled at Springfield Central High School in 1917 and graduated in 1921. He took an art class as a freshman and later became manager of the school soccer team. Geisel attended Dartmouth College, graduating in 1925. At Dartmouth, he joined the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity and the humor magazine Dartmouth Jack-O-Lantern, eventually rising to the rank of editor-in-chief. While at Dartmouth, he was caught drinking gin with nine friends in his room. At the time, the possession and consumption of alcohol was illegal under Prohibition laws, which remained in place between 1920 and 1933. As a result of this infraction, Dean Craven Laycock insisted that Geisel resign from all extracurricular activities, including the college humor magazine. To continue work on the Jack-O-Lantern without the administration's knowledge, Geisel began signing his work with the pen name \\"Seuss\\". He was encouraged in his writing by professor of rhetoric W. Benfield Pressey, whom he described as his \\"big inspiration for writing\\" at Dartmouth. Upon graduating from Dartmouth, he entered Lincoln College, Oxford, intending to earn a PhD in English literature. At Oxford, he met Helen Palmer, who encouraged him to give up becoming an English teacher in favor of pursuing drawing as a career. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: Did anything particularly important happen during his early years?","completion":"Yes, something important did happen in Theodor Seuss Geisel's early years. When he was at Dartmouth College, he was caught drinking gin with his friends which was against the law at that time. Because of this, he had to resign from his school activities, including working on the school humor magazine. But he didn't want to stop doing what he loved, so he started using the pen name \\"Seuss\\" to keep working on the magazine without anyone knowing. This is how he first came up with the name \\"Dr. Seuss\\", which he later used to write his famous children's books."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Questions: The shark realized it was in northern california, where was it likely? Options: - sea world - tropical waters - tomales bay - aquarium - great oceans Answer:","completion":"The shark realized it was in Northern California, so based on common sense, it was most likely in Tomales Bay. This answer is most in line with common sense because Tomales Bay is a natural location in Northern California where sharks can be found. Let's analyze other options to explain why they might be less suitable: - Sea World: Although it's true that some sharks are kept in captivity, Sea World is located in San Diego, Southern California, not Northern California. Therefore, this option does not fit the given information. - Tropical Waters: Northern California does not have tropical waters, as it is located along the west coast of North America and has a temperate coastal climate. Tropical waters are typically found much further south, such as in Central and South America, closer to the equator. - Aquarium: While it's possible that a shark could be in an aquarium, this option is less likely than Tomales Bay because the question specifies that the shark was in Northern California. There are numerous aquariums in Northern California, but without more specific information, it's hard to conclude that this is the most common sense answer. The given context makes it seem that the shark is in its natural habitat. - Great Oceans: This option is too vague and does not provide any specific location to associate with Northern California. Oceans are vast, and simply stating \\"great oceans\\" does not give any useful information regarding the question. In conclusion, the option that aligns with common sense and best answers the question is \\"Tomales Bay.\\" This bay is located in Northern California and is a natural environment where sharks might be found.

My dad, the first one, ended up just being a shot gun wedding. He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas. They were married for 5 years and she was just as miserable those 5 years. He was mean, he lied about everything, he was addicted to porn and stole from his job. He was controlling and wouldn’t let anyone else handle money. It was a rough house to grow up in and hard on my mom as she tried to keep me from the abuse. Eventually he cheated on her with one of her best friends and she kicked him out. I didn’t even notice he was gone for a week because he was so absent in my life. He apologized, turned into the man she first met and they tried again. He again cheated on her and she left him again, that time for good. They ended up finalizing the divorce a year later. I remember her telling me that she confronted him about his change of character and he had told her “Everyone puts on an act at first.” As if it was a normal thing. He had depression and I believe he wanted everyone to be just as miserable as he was. After they got divorced he had on and off again relationships, got a girl pregnant and got married, then she divorced him. He lived with his cousin for a while.

He says that \\"most reptiles have good eyesight and a keen sense of smell\\" and \\"geckos are, in fact, reptiles\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? A:","completion":"Based on the teacher's hints, the best answer to the question \\"What has good eyesight and a keen sense of smell?\\" would be: A: Gecko The teacher mentioned that most reptiles have good eyesight and a keen sense of smell, and further specified that geckos are, in fact, reptiles. This hints that a gecko would exhibit those characteristics, making \\"gecko\\" the most suitable answer for the question given the information provided. Geckos are small lizards that belong to the infraorder Gekkota, which consists of more than 1600 species of geckos found all over the world. These nocturnal animals have a range of adaptations that enable them to thrive in various environments, including the ability to climb walls and ceilings, and the possession of a unique type of vocal communication, not commonly found in other lizards. Their eyesight is one of the most remarkable features of geckos. Nocturnal geckos have large eyes with elliptical pupils, which optimize their vision in low light conditions. Their eyes are up to 350 times more sensitive to light than human eyes, allowing them to detect even the faintest of movements, especially during nighttime when they are most active. In addition to their excellent eyesight, geckos also possess an acute sense of smell. Most reptiles rely on their sense of smell to find food, locate mates, and avoid predators, among other functions. Geckos have a keen olfactory system that includes organs such as the Jacobson's organ (vomeronasal organ) and the main olfactory epithelium. The Jacobson's organ is responsible for detecting pheromones, chemical signals produced by other individuals of the same species, which play a crucial role in communication and social interactions. The main olfactory epithelium helps detect airborne molecules of odorants in the environment. Considering their good eyesight and keen sense of smell, geckos are efficient hunters and are able to quickly locate and capture prey, such as insects and small invertebrates. These characteristics prove to be essential for their survival in the wild, making the gecko the most fitting answer to the quiz question based on the teacher's hints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Many of you who have listened to Stuart on Bad Voltage, seen him speak, worked with him, or socialized with him will know him for his larger than life personality. He is funny, warm, and passionate about his family, friends, and technology. He is opinionated, and many of you will know him for the amusing, insightful, and tremendously articulate way in which he expresses his views. He is remarkably talented and has an incredible level of insight and perspective. He is not just a brilliant programmer and software architect, but he has a deft knowledge and understanding of people, how they work together, and the driving forces behind human interaction. What I have always admired is that while bombastic in his views, he is always open to fresh ideas and new perspectives. For him life is a journey and new ways of looking at the road are truly thrilling for him.

Sauvage snaps out of his stupor just long enough to join Clarence Bowden (Julian D. Christopher), his former commanding officer, to work as a bodyguard for former World Heavyweight boxing champion and now successful businessman Wayne Barclay (Raz Adoti). It appears that the release of notorious rap mogul Terrell Singletery (Viv Leacock) from prison has caused Barclay's worried sister Tamara (Vivica A. Fox) to take pro-active action by hiring Bowden and Sauvage, as Singletery has made threats in the past about doing away with the one man responsible for his incarceration Barclay himself. The first night of bodyguard work does not go well for Sauvage and Bowden, as Bowden gets killed during an assassination attempt on Barclay by a Hummer full of Uzi-carrying gangbangers sent by Singletery. It is up to Sauvage to continue the fight, which means bringing in a reinforcement in his friend Casey Bledsoe (Mark Griffin), and training some new recruits not of his choosing. Intending to give back to the streets that taught him toughness, Barclay insists that Sauvage compose his team of bodyguards by hiring people from Barclay's gym.

Hint: A major use for petroleum products is fuel for cars, trucks, airplanes, trains, and other vehicles. The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up.

WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: When you’re married to a narcissist, self-care should be a #1 priority. It’s important for you to take part in activities that make you feel good about yourself and connect you with positive people. Narcissists often try to isolate you from other people, which may make it hard to maintain your relationships. You may also find that it is hard to keep up with your interests because you are trying to keep the peace at home. Think about some activities that you have put off since becoming married, or have been dying to try out. Sign up for a class, a Meetup, or check a book out from the library to learn more about a specific interest. You might learn a language, start crafting, become a writer, or start taking kickboxing. Do something you love, just for you. To ensure that your time away doesn’t create a sore spot for your attention-hungry spouse, check in often while you’re engaging in hobbies. You might say, “I’m at my writing course, dear. Is there something I can get for you when I’m headed home?” or “I’m enjoying kickboxing, but I sure miss your handsome face.” Marriage to a narcissistic spouse can feel like everything is about your partner while nothing is about you. Combat feelings of inadequacy by giving yourself permission to be a little selfish and set some goals you have been secretly harboring. To make sure you achieve them, make them SMART goals—that is, specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound. Have you always wanted to go back to school? Make a list of steps you must take to reach this goal. Your list might include researching universities, deciding on a major, taking entrance exams, and getting letters of recommendation. Just because your spouse isn’t attending to your emotional needs doesn’t mean no one can. Find a trusted friend or confidant to share your feelings and experiences with. Spend time with people who value who you are as a person and give as much as they take. You can reach out to an existing friend by saying, “Hey, Randy, some things have been happening in my marriage and I could really use someone to talk to. Can I trust you to keep this between us?” If you don’t have a trusted person to talk to, try attending a support group for loved ones of narcissists. In such groups, you can connect with people who are going through similar experiences and learn how they cope. Although it can make your marriage more fulfilling if your spouse gets treatment, it can also be helpful if you see a professional as well. Years of belittling, criticizing, and being put in second place can take a toll on your self-esteem, leading to anxiety and depression. Research a therapist in your area who has experience working with the spouses of narcissists. Interviews several professionals before selecting one you feel comfortable with. Seeing a therapist can also help you learn more about the disorder affecting your spouse and learn more skills about how to cope with it in your marriage. You may be completely against divorce, but you should reconsider your decision if your spouse starts to abuse you. Although many narcissists never become violent, it can happen. Speak with a professional to develop an action plan to follow in times of crisis. Even if your spouse never physically abuses you, narcissistic abuse still involves emotional and mental abuse that can have lasting consequences to your well-being. Talk to your therapist to weigh the pros and cons of leaving your marriage, especially if you have children because this behavior can be learned.

Iraqi security and volunteer forces have broken the siege of Amerli and have entered the town, retired Gen. Khaled al-Amerli, an Amerli resident and member of its self-defense force, told CNN on Sunday. Iraqi state TV also reported that the siege had been broken. The news prompted a wave of celebrations across the town, which had been besieged by fighters from the terror group ISIS. Residents waved the Iraqi flag and fired celebratory shots into the air, al-Amerli said. \\"Today is a day of victory for Iraq and the resilient people of Amerli,\\" the retired general said. The breakthrough came after the United States said it carried out airstrikes and dropped humanitarian aid in Amerli to protect an ethnic minority that one official said faced the threat of an \\"imminent massacre.\\" Amerli is home to many of Iraq's Shiite Turkmen. ISIS has called the","completion":"Shiite Turkmen \\"apostates\\" and has targeted them along with other ethnic and religious minorities in their brutal campaign to establish a caliphate in Iraq and Syria. The siege of Amerli, which lasted over two months, left the town's inhabitants facing severe shortages of food, water, and medical supplies, prompting international concern and calls for action to prevent a humanitarian catastrophe. In addition to the dire humanitarian conditions, the residents of Amerli lived in constant fear of being overrun by ISIS and subjected to their brutal rule. The liberation of Amerli was a combined effort of Iraqi security forces, Shiite and Sunni volunteer fighters, Kurdish Peshmerga forces, and airstrikes from the United States and other coalition partners. The operation to break the siege of Amerli was a demonstration of the importance of unity among Iraq's different factions in their fight against the common enemy of ISIS. The involvement of various forces also underscored the urgent need for an inclusive government in Baghdad that can effectively address and represent the interests of all Iraqis, regardless of their ethnic or religious background. The successful cooperation between different factions in liberating Amerli is not only significant for the town itself but also serves as a potential model for future operations against ISIS. The unity of these forces in facing a common enemy serves as a warning to the terror group that its brutal tactics may not be enough to divide Iraqis, and it also sends a message to the international community that Iraq is willing to come together across sectarian lines in the fight against terrorism. However, the liberation of Amerli is just one small victory in the broader fight against ISIS. Though the breaking of the siege lifted immediate threats to the town's inhabitants, many challenges remain in fully eradicating the terror group's presence in Iraq and the region. To ensure long-term stability and prevent the reemergence of ISIS or similar extremist forces, integrated military operations must be complemented by comprehensive political and social efforts. These efforts should include reconstruction, reconciliation, and economic development for liberated areas, as well as strengthening local and national institutions and fostering tolerance and inclusivity within Iraqi society. The sentence about ISIS calling the Shiite Turkmen \\"apostates\\" highlights the terror group's attempts to use religious and ethnic divisions to further their goals. The liberation of Amerli, however, presents the opportunity for a counter-narrative that emphasizes unity and resilience among Iraq's diverse communities. Efforts must be sustained to build on this momentum, support the people of Amerli and other affected areas, and continue to push back against ISIS's narrative of hate and division. In the process, Iraq can slowly move closer to a brighter and more peaceful future."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Write highlights for this article: A soldier who survived the Battle of Rorke’s Drift against 4,000 Zulus only to be forgotten on its Roll of Honour has finally been hailed a war hero – thanks to a 130-year-old sketch. Private David Jenkins was among the 150 soldiers who fought in the heroic defence of the small South African missionary outpost in 1879, which was immortalised by the film Zulu starring Michael Caine. Such was the bravery shown by the heavily outnumbered troops that after the battle 11 Victoria Crosses were awarded. Hero: Geoff Rees, great grandson of Private David Jenkins, recognised him in this sketch by Lady Elizabeth Butler. He had fought valiantly in the heroic defence of Rorke's Drift in 1879. However, Private Jenkins’s name was somehow left out of the Roll of Honour, and for more than 130 years his descendants have tried in vain to have his heroism recognised. But they had no proof – until spotting a sketch of a ‘Private Jenkins’ by a Victorian war artist that was being used to illustrate a competition run by the National Army Museum. The Battle of Rorke’s Drift had been nominated as one of Britain’s greatest battles, and the image chosen to represent it was a pencil sketch by Lady Elizabeth Butler of Private Jenkins. Private David Jenkins' family was determined he should be recognised as one of the soldiers who took part in the historic battle. His great-grandson Geoff Rees recognised the face instantly and was able to prove to historians that his relative was a long-forgotten war hero. The artist had been commissioned by Queen Victoria to commemorate the battle in her painting The Defence of Rorke’s Drift. Mr Rees said: ‘Lady Elizabeth Butler visited the survivors who returned to Portsmouth in the autumn of 1879 and she was treated to a re-enactment of the battle. ‘She famously used real models who were actually there to paint her war scenes.’ Each soldier who survived the battle had also been given a Bible to commemorate their role. Private Jenkins’s Bible was handed over to the museum’s historians as added proof that he had fought at Rorke’s Drift. Private David Jenkins of 1st Battalion, 24th (2nd Warwickshire) Regiment of Foot, has now been reinstated in the battle’s Roll of Honour. A spokesman for the National Army Museum said: ‘When his great-grandson contacted us with irrefutable evidence proving David Jenkins’s presence at the battle and his identity in the museum’s sketch book, we set the record straight.’ Pt Jenkins appears in the bottom left hand side of this picture painted by Lady Elizabeth Butler, titled The Defence of Rorke's Drift. Geoff Rees, Pvt Jenkins' great grandson, said that another Jenkins was at Rorke's Drift but the sketch could not be him because he was killed in battle. Mr Rees, 52, from Swansea, said he was incredibly proud of his great-grandfather’s part in history. He added: ‘It’s nice that the history books have finally been corrected to recognise his role. ‘What I find most inspiring about the battle is that it was won by ordinary men who fought so heroically for one another. 'How exposed must they have felt, yet they defended the outpost to a man over a nightmarish 12-hour period.’ Highlights:","completion":"1.

However, it is essential to consider several factors before determining whether mitosis would be helped more, less, or not affected in such an environment. Firstly, let us review the process of mitosis: 1. Prophase: The chromosomes become visible, and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell, forming spindle fibers. 2. Metaphase: The chromosomes line up in the center of the cell along the metaphase plate. Spindle fibers attach to the kinetochores of each chromatid. 3. Anaphase: The sister chromatids separate, and the spindle fibers contract, pulling the chromatids to opposite poles. 4. Telophase: The chromosomes gather at opposite poles, and two new nuclear membranes form. The cell membranes begin to pinch. 5. Cytokinesis: The cell membranes pinch in completely, and the cell divides into two individual cells (daughter cells). There are several factors in open fields far from cities that can potentially affect mitosis: 1. Exposure to natural light: The presence of ample amounts of sunlight in open fields could promote the generation of vitamins and hormones, which play a vital role in cellular growth and repair. Sunlight also acts as a natural source of energy for autotrophs, helping them through the process of photosynthesis. Improved cell growth and general health of an organism can positively influence the rate and efficiency of mitosis. 2. Lower pollution levels: Being far from cities, open fields are generally less dense in pollutants, such as harmful chemicals and particulate matter. These substances can negatively affect cell function and division. A decrease in pollution can thus help minimize cellular stress and damage, supporting mitosis to proceed normally. 3. Greater diversity of species: The more natural habitat of open fields can provide an environment for a more diverse range of species, including both plants and animals. This biodiversity can lead to a better balance of nutrients and resources for each organism, promoting their overall growth and health. Improved organismal health can lead to more effective cell division and better functioning of mitosis. 4. Temperature and humidity: Open fields can also be characterized by varying temperature and humidity levels. The optimal conditions for mitosis depend on the type of organisms and their specific biological requirements. Some organisms may benefit from a more tolerant environment, while others may struggle and experience decreased efficiency in mitosis. In summary, the effects of open fields far from cities on mitosis largely depend on the specific organisms and their environmental requirements. For some, improved exposure to sunlight, lower pollution levels, and greater biodiversity might have a positive effect on mitosis, thus aligning with option A: more. However, it is crucial to consider that different organisms have unique environmental needs, and optimal conditions for mitosis may vary significantly from one species to another. Consequently, the overall effect of open fields on mitosis may not apply uniformly to all organisms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Continue writing the next sentence. How to do push ups if you can't now Start with wall push ups. Stand three to four feet away from a wall and face the wall. Lean toward the wall and place your hands shoulder-width apart.","completion":"From here, lower your body towards the wall by bending your elbows, keeping your feet flat on the ground and your body straight from head to toe. Push your body away from the wall by straightening your elbows and return to the initial position. This exercise works your chest, shoulders, and arms - the same muscles which are targeted in regular push-ups. If wall push-ups become easy and manageable, you can progress to knee push-ups or box push-ups. To perform knee push-ups, start by kneeling on the floor. Your knees and feet should be together with your body in a straight line from your head to your knees. Place your hands on the floor at a distance slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Slowly lower your body by bending your elbows until your chest is an inch from the ground. Push your body up and straighten your arms, lifting your body off the floor. Box push-ups, alternatively, involve using an elevated surface like a box or a bench. They require a little bit more strength compared to knee push-ups, but can be much easier than full push-ups. Start by positioning your hands shoulder-width apart on the surface of the box or bench. Move your feet back and come up onto your toes so that your body forms a straight line from your head to your heels. Lower your body towards the bench by bending your elbows, pausing when your chest nearly touches the surface, then push your body up until your arms are extended. Finally, when you're comfortable with knee or box push-ups, you can move into doing a standard push-up, where you begin in a high plank with your palms flat, hands shoulder-width apart, shoulders stacked directly above your wrists, feet hip-width apart, and core engaged. Lower your body until your chest nearly touches the floor and then push yourself back up. Remember, it's absolutely key to maintain good form over the course of these exercises. Your body should be in a straight line from your head to your heels in all these variations. With consistent practice and gradual progression, you will find your strength improving over time and push-ups becoming more doable and even enjoyable to perform. Just like any form of exercise, it's essential to warm up prior to your workout, and cool down and stretch after. Also, listen to your body. If the exercise feels too challenging or you feel pain, take a rest or modify the movement. Fitness is a journey and it's important to celebrate progress, no matter how small it might seem. Your consistency and determination to succeed will get you to your ultimate goal of completing full push-ups."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

In battle day one group A territory had 5 °C temperature. In battle day two group A territory had 22 °C temperature. In battle day three group A territory had low air humidity. In battle day four group A territory had high air humidity. In which battle day group A would have more openings in their nest thatch, battle day three or battle day four? Answer:","completion":"Battle day four. Acromyrmex heyeri ants are known to adjust their nest thatch openings according to the environmental conditions. They do this to regulate the air exchange, temperature, and humidity for the optimal growth of their fungus gardens, as well as for the welfare of the ants in their colony. On battle day three, group A experienced low air humidity. When the air is dry, these ants tend to close off some of the openings in their nest thatch, as it helps to maintain necessary humidity levels inside the nest. On battle day four, group A experienced high air humidity. When the air is humid, Acromyrmex heyeri ants respond by opening up more of the nest thatch openings. They do this to enhance airflow and air exchange, which allows moisture to escape from the nest and prevents excessive humidity from building up inside. Therefore, on battle day four, group A would have more openings in their nest thatch due to the high air humidity, making it the optimal time for the rival group to attack."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Early localized stage (within 3-30 days of a tick bite): - Erythema migrans: A characteristic red, circular rash with a bull's-eye appearance around the site of the tick bite. - Flu-like symptoms: Fever, chills, fatigue, body aches, headache, and swollen lymph nodes. 2. Early disseminated stage (weeks to months after infection): - Additional erythema migrans rashes on other parts of the body - Severe headaches and neck stiffness - Arthritis: Severe joint pain and swelling, particularly in the knees and other large joints - Neurological problems: Bell's palsy (facial muscle weakness), numbness or pain in limbs, impaired muscle movement, and meningitis (inflammation of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord) - Heart-related issues: Irregular heartbeat, palpitations, dizziness, or shortness of breath, due to Lyme carditis - Eye inflammation and vision changes 3. Late disseminated stage (months to years after infection): - Chronic Lyme arthritis: Persistent and intermittent swelling and pain in joints - Post-treatment Lyme disease syndrome (PTLDS): A lingering condition with fatigue, muscle aches, joint pain, and difficulty concentrating or sleeping. - Neurological complications: Cognitive decline, memory problems, mood changes, and sleep disturbances - Rarely, liver or spleen enlargement and autoimmune disorders It is important to consult a healthcare professional if you suspect Lyme disease or experience any of its symptoms. Early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics can help prevent the progression of the disease and reduce the risk of long-term complications. However, if you are post-treatment and continue to experience symptoms, it is essential to discuss these with your doctor, as they may require further evaluation and management."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: suppose less heat available happens, how will it affect higher temperature used. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect","completion":"If less heat is available in the process, it will have the following effects on the steps: 1. Salt water is contained in a factory or plant - No effect. This step remains the same since it does not rely on heat. 2. The water is boiled to a very high temperature - Less effect. With less heat available, it might be challenging to achieve the desired high temperature for boiling, which may lead to slower evaporation or less efficient separation. 3. The salt becomes separated from the water - Less effect. If the water does not reach the required high temperature, the salt separation process may get affected and might be slower or less effective. 4. The salt is removed - No effect. The actual removal of salt may not be affected by heat, but a lower separation efficiency in the previous step might lead to the removal of smaller quantities of salt. 5. The water is able to be drank at this point - Less effect. If the temperature is not high enough for efficient salt separation, the resulting water might still contain some salt, making the water not entirely safe for consumption. In summary, the perturbation of less heat available will have less effect on the higher temperature used and the salt separation process in general. The second effect mentioned, which is the salt becoming separated from the water, will also experience a less effect due to this perturbation."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Here, 251 + 1113 = 1364, So our equation becomes: -66*r + 1364 = -128*r Step 2: Rearrange the equation to keep terms of r on one side and constant on the other. So, add 66*r on both sides: -66*r + 66*r + 1364 = -128*r + 66*r This simplifies to: 1364 = -128*r + 66*r Step 3: Combine like terms again on the right side. Here, -128*r + 66*r = -62*r, hence, our simplified equation now is: 1364 = -62*r Step 4: Divide by -62 on both sides to isolate r: 1364/-62 = -62*r/-62 So, r = 1364/-62 = -22 So the solution to the equation is r = -22."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: What is Hickok playing when he is shot and killed?

It's the most spoken first language in the European Union and one of the world's major languages. Compared to English, German language sentences often put the verb at the end, allowing for long, complex sentences with nested clauses. It's known for its power to form compound words and express complex concepts and nuances. The German language has multiple dialects, and the German you learn can often depend on the region of the country where teaching material comes from. In the sentence given, the translation is done sentence by sentence, retaining the meaning of the original. However, it's important to consider that during translation, some phrases may not have exact counterparts in German - or in any language for that matter. Consequently, a degree of restructuring or rephrasing is occasionally necessary to maintain the intended meaning. It's also crucial to remember that the phrasing and structuring of sentences in German can often be different from English. This impacts the order in which the words are arranged. The phrase also includes the specific term \\"X Window System,\\" which is an important detail to retain in the German translation. This particular term is a computer software system and a key part of many graphical user interfaces. As a named system, the term should be left as it is in English as its direct translation may not be recognizable in German, which could potentially lead to confusion. This is often the case with specific terminology, brand names, and other unique or specialized phrases. These elements all contribute to bridging the language barrier between English and German, allowing speakers of different languages to communicate effectively and accurately. It demonstrates the skill required in translation and the importance of maintaining the integrity of the original content to ensure its correct interpretation in the translated language."},{"prompt":"Q: Question: what is metal music about?

Please answer the following question: Process: - Prophase is the first and longest stage of mitosis - In this stage the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In prophase the chromosomes become visible and the centrioles separate and move to opposite poles of the cell - In metaphase the chromosomes line up across the center of the cell and become connected to the spindle fiber at their centromere - In anaphase the sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart - During telophase the chromosomes gather at opposite ends of the cell and lose their distinct rod-like shapes - Two new nuclear membranes then form around each of the two regions of DNA and the spindle fibers disappear. Question: suppose mitosis will fail on the cell happens, how will it affect HURTING mitosis to proceed normally. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"I will start by breaking down the process of mitosis and identifying how a failure in the process can affect the normal progression of mitosis. Then, I will discuss the second effect mentioned and analyze the influence of the perturbation. Step 1: Analyze the process of mitosis - Prophase: Chromosomes become visible, and centrioles separate and move to opposite poles. - Metaphase: Chromosomes line up in the cell center and connect to spindle fibers at their centromere. - Anaphase: Sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart. - Telophase: Chromosomes gather at opposite ends, lose their distinct shapes, and new nuclear membranes form around DNA regions while spindle fibers disappear. Step 2: Identify possible failure points in mitosis - Failure during prophase can prevent the proper separation of centrioles and chromosome condensation. - Failure during metaphase can inhibit the correct alignment of chromosomes in the center of the cell. - Failure during anaphase can result in sister chromatids not separating properly. - Failure during telophase can hinder the formation of new nuclear membranes and the disappearance of spindle fibers. Step 3: Analyze the second effect mentioned The second effect mentioned is chromosome alignment during metaphase, where chromosomes line up in the center of the cell and connect to spindle fibers at their centromere. Step 4: Evaluate the influence of perturbation in each stage of mitosis on the second effect mentioned - Failure in prophase: LESS effect. Improper separation of centrioles and chromosome condensation could result in chromosomes not being correctly positioned during metaphase. - Failure in metaphase: MORE effect. A direct failure in chromosome alignment during metaphase would significantly impact the normal progression of mitosis, with chromosomes unable to connect to spindle fibers properly. - Failure in anaphase: NO effect. An issue during anaphase would not directly influence the chromosome alignment during metaphase as it occurs afterward. - Failure in telophase: NO effect. A failure during telophase would also not influence chromosome alignment during metaphase, as it occurs at a later stage of mitosis. In conclusion, a perturbation or failure during metaphase of mitosis would have the most significant effect on the second effect mentioned, which is chromosome alignment during metaphase. Failures in other stages of mitosis would have less or no effect on this particular aspect."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Vallon for the following movie plot: This article's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (June 2012) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The main narrative is set in a mythical land where, about 300 years before, two princes named Lock and Delphus fought for their father's throne. Although, Lock killed Delphus in single combat, their father's kingdom of Vallon was torn into rival nations, Lockland and Delphi. The story flashes forward from this prologue to the eve of Lockland's destruction, when the castle is besieged and the crown prince killed by invading Delphites. Against the counsel of the prince's sister Amelia (Amber Benson), their father, the Locklander king, turns to his chief sorcerer Armand (Larry Drake) in despair. The sorcerer convinces the king to give him a handful of his blood with which to animate a stone statue of a gryphon, a flying beast that is the totem of Lockland. Using the blood to bind the gryphon to him, Armand first orders it to break the Delphite siege, then betrays his king and calls it back to attack the Locklanders in a coup. It is seen that the sorcerer suffers the physical effects of any attack against the gryphon, but regenerates almost immediately due to his bond with the beast. Princess Amelia escapes during the takeover and pursues the retreating Locklanders, led the Delphite prince Seth (Jonathan LaPaglia), who had been in the vanguard of the besieging forces. Having inherited the gift of magical visions from his parents, the prince is advised by his mother Cassandra (Sarah Douglas), a sorceress, to seek an artifact called the Draconian Pike, the only weapon that can kill the gryphon. His mother warns him that he must retrieve the two halves of the pike and reassemble it to kill the gryphon before a solar eclipse occurs in two weeks, or Armand will be able to enact a ritual that makes himself and the beast immortal.

Paragraph: Do not look for the Danteum in the Eternal City. In true Dantean form, politics stood in the way of its construction in 1938. Ironically this literature-inspired building can itself most easily be found in book form. Reading this book I remembered Goethe's quote about frozen music. Did Terragni try to freeze Dante's medieval miracle of song? Certainly a cold-poem seems artistically repulsive. Unflattering comparisons to the lake of Cocytus spring to mind too. While I cannot read Italian, I can read some German. After locating the original quotation I discovered that 'frozen' is a problematic (though common) translation of Goethe's original 'erstarrte.' The verb 'erstarren' more properly means 'to solidify' or 'to stiffen.' This suggests a chemical reaction in which the art does not necessarily chill in the transformation. Nor can simple thawing yield the original work. Like a chemical reaction it requires an artistic catalyst, a muse. Indeed the Danteum is not a physical translation of the Poem. Terragni thought it inappropriate to translate the Comedy literally into a non-literary work. The Danteum would not be a stage set, rather Terragni generated his design from the Comedy's structure, not its finishes.

The bands varied in size, depending on the number of insurgents available in the locality. Peasant haufen divided along territorial lines, whereas those of the landsknecht drew men from a variety of territories. Some bands could number about 4,000; others, such as the peasant force at Frankenhausen, could gather 8,000. The Alsatian peasants who took to the field at the Battle of Zabern numbered 18,000. Haufen were formed from companies, typically 500 men per company, subdivided into platoons of 10 to 15 peasants each. Like the landsknechts, the peasant bands used similar titles: Oberster feldhauptmann, or supreme commander, similar to a colonel, and lieutenants, or leutinger. Each company was commanded by a captain and had its own fähnrich, or ensign, who carried the company's standard . The companies also had a sergeant or feldweibel, and squadron leaders called rottmeister, or masters of the rotte. Officers were usually elected, particularly the supreme commander and the leutinger. The peasant army was governed by a so-called ring, in which peasants gathered in a circle to debate tactics, troop movements, alliances, and the distribution of spoils. The ring was the decision-making body. In addition to this democratic construct, each band had a hierarchy of leaders including a supreme commander and a marshal , who maintained law and order. Other roles included lieutenants, captains, standard-bearers, master gunner, wagon-fort master, train master, four watch-masters, four sergeant-majors to arrange the order of battle, a weibel for each company, two quartermasters, farriers, quartermasters for the horses, a communications officer and a pillage master.

Poverty in America: Millions of families too broke for bank accounts Travis Dove / for NBC News Kim James outside the Dove House, a half-way house in Durham, NC that helped her recover from poverty and addiction. James has since been able to start banking again through the Self Help Credit Union. By Bob Sullivan, Columnist, NBC News Sabino Fuentes-Sanchez hid 25,000 all around his house because he didn't trust banks. Lasonia Christon receives her Wal-Mart salary on a pre-paid debit card. Kim James was homeless for most of the past decade in part because she had no place to save money. There are plenty of reasons people still live all-cash lives, but the sheer number who do it might surprise you. At a time when the majority of Americans use online banking, and some even deposit checks using their cellphone cameras, roughly eight percent of America's 115 million households don’t have a checking or savings account, according to census data compiled by the FDIC. The numbers are far higher among minorities: More than 20 percent of African-Americans and Hispanics are essentially left out of the American banking system. Frozen in the cash-only past, they face myriad “kick-them-while-they-are-down” situations where getting money costs money. Banks typically charge 6 to cash checks. Want to secure an apartment? Fee-based money orders are the only option. Without credit cards, they must turn to triple-digit interest rate payday loans for emergencies. Lasonia Christon of Jackson, Miss., tries to avoid getting paid in checks, but when her state tax refund for 231 arrived recently, she had to pay 7 to cash it at a nearby convenience store. Christon works at Wal-Mart. Her paychecks are deposited onto a prepaid debit card -- an improvement over old-fashioned paper paychecks, which led to high check-cashing fees. It’s hardly a good substitute for direct deposit, however. One cash withdrawal per period is free, but others cost 2. She can avoid the fee by shopping at Wal-Mart and getting cash back at checkout. She is among the 60 percent of unbanked Americans who previously had a checking account. Christon used to share one with her sister, but It cost her dearly. \\"There was an overdraft here and an overdraft there, and it just didn't work out,\\" she said. Travis Dove / for NBC News Kim James at the Dove House, a half-way house in Durham, NC that helped her get back on her feet after struggles with poverty and addiction. Fuentes-Sanchez made a fairly good living working for a tree removal company in Lumber Bridge, N.C., for about 10 years. But he was skeptical of banks, and when he tried to open an account, he was surprised by the cost. \\"Instead of making money, I would have to pay fees,\\" he said, through a translator. \\"(So) we used to keep money in the house. We were always trying to look for ways to hide the money in the house and keep it safe.\\" At one time, Fuentes-Sanchez had 25,000 stashed in different places throughout the house – his Latino community had been plagued by house burglaries because neighbors did the same. When his wife got cancer, her treatments devoured all their savings. Down to their last 500, and before she passed away, she convinced him to open a bank account at Latino Community Credit Union, which was opened in part to help stem the burglary problem. “She managed the money,\\" and was disciplined enough to avoid spending it, said Fuentes-Sanchez, 37, who now raises five children alone. \\"(I) sometimes see something and I am tempted to buy it ... Now the money is in the bank.” Saving -- putting money out of temptation's reach -- is the core concept of consumer banking. But the importance of participating in the financial system has stretched far beyond the quaint notion of interest, said Jennifer Tescher, CEO of the Center for Financial Services Innovation, who is generally regarded as the person responsible for popularizing the term unbanked. \\"A bank account in a way has become like a passport or a driver's license,\\" said Tesch. \\"It's a kind of access device.\\" James, 55, has been in and out of homelessness for several years. She now lives at a half-way house called Dove House in Durham, N.C., and figured she could never move into her own apartment unless she could stash away the money needed for a security deposit. Without a savings account, that was a challenge. \\"Cash in hand is cash spent, my mother always said,\\" she said. Two years ago, she met Duke University student Janet Xiao, who was part of a group named the Community Empowerment Fund, which visited Dove House offering life skills training, including a class on personal finance where she nudged women to open a bank account. James was reluctant. \\"It's really demoralizing to open up an account and have it sitting in there with no money in it,\\" Xiao said. “I think most folks want to take one step at a time, and get a job first. Also, there is this fear of being charged fees you don't understand.” When James got a part-time job in January, she finally took up Xiao’s offer of help. The two set up an account with the Self-Help Credit Union on Xiao’s laptop right at the Dove House kitchen table. \\"She even put the first 5 in there for me,\\" James said. After depositing her first paycheck in person at Self-Help, Xiao said, James did a little dance. “Now whenever I get even 10 or 20, I go to the bank and deposit it,” James said. Within a few months, she put together enough to pay her security deposit and first’s month’s rent. As soon as she saves enough for a bed, she’ll move in. Travis Dove / for NBC News James has been able to start banking again through the Self Help Credit Union, and has saved enough to pay a security deposit and the first month's rent for her own apartment.. 'Saving for the future' Self-Help is part of a growing set of financial companies called Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs). Supported by the U.S. Treasury Department, their mission is to help the unbanked get into the financial system. ”You make sure people are getting products and services they need,” said Mark Pinsky ,CEO of the Opportunity Finance Network, which helps fund CDFIs. “Banks may be the best place, they may not, but we don't want to just leave them vulnerable to the predators out there.” Christon has recently been persuaded to open an account in a different way. Her 3-year-old twins’ day-care facility was recently visited by representatives of the Mississippi College Savings Account program, who helped her open a small account for the children. She then realized she needed her own savings account. \\"I want to be a good role model for them, so they can learn about savings,\\" she said. \\"I know I need to be better and show them about saving for the future.\\" NBCLatino's Sandra Lilley contributed to this story.

In Malaysia, Powell met with Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad, who has led the country since 1981. The Malaysian foreign minister, Syed Hamid Albar, later told local reporters that Powell had proposed that American and Malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in Malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities. His brief stop in Malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the United States has often criticized. The United States once distanced itself from Mahathir for strong-arm tactics with political rivals, and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants, including some who may be linked to al-Qaida, without trial.

Ignoring a question means that the person has either consciously or unconsciously decided not to address the query posed to them. There could be a variety of reasons why someone would choose to ignore a question, some of which include: 1. Lack of knowledge: The person may not have the necessary information or expertise to answer the question, so they decide to ignore it in an attempt to avoid revealing their lack of knowledge on the subject. 2. Insufficient interest: Sometimes, a person may not find the question engaging enough, or they may not be interested in the topic being discussed. In such cases, the individual might not feel inclined to respond and therefore opts to ignore the question. 3. Overwhelmed or distracted: People may have their attention divided among several things, making it difficult for them to focus on the question at hand. In this case, they might either unintentionally or intentionally ignore it. 4. A desire to avoid confrontation: If the question asked is controversial or causes discomfort, a person may choose to ignore it to avoid engaging in a potentially heated discussion. 5. Prioritizing other questions or tasks: In some situations, a person might receive multiple questions or have various tasks to attend to, forcing them to prioritize specific issues over others. As a result, certain questions might end up being ignored. 6. Dislike or disrespect towards the questioner: If there is animosity or negative feelings between the person being asked and the person posing the question, the individual might choose to ignore it as a way of disregarding the questioner. 7. Emotional reasons: A person might not answer a question because it evokes strong emotions, such as anger, sadness, or embarrassment. In these cases, the person may not be emotionally ready to address the topic and will decide to ignore it. In summary, when someone does not reply to a question, it is most suitable to say they are ignoring the question.

(CNN) -- Horror-meister, Stephen King calls George Pelecanos \\"perhaps the greatest living American crime writer.\\" His stories are set in Pelecanos' hometown of Washington, D.C., but this is not the side of the U.S. capitol that you see portrayed on TV with white marble monuments, lawyers and lobbyists. Pelecanos is more interested in working families struggling to get by, the racial tensions in its ethnic neighborhoods and the low-lifes on the edges. His crime-writing peers call Pelecanos the \\"undisputed poet\\" of Washington's gritty side. The best-selling and award-winning author is out this week with his 17th and latest novel, \\"The Cut.\\" It's the first in a new series featuring Iraq war veteran and private investigator Spero Lucas. When he's not working for a Washington defense attorney, Lucas recovers stolen property for a 40% cut. Now, a high-profile crime boss hires Lucas to find out who's been stealing from him, and it could turn out to be Lucas' biggest payday or an untimely end. While Pelecanos made his bones in the noir tradition, there's a definite \\"Western\\" feel to \\"The Cut.\\" The new novel takes place in a morally gray and often violent world. It's peppered with pitch-perfect dialogue and captures the sights, sounds and taste of Washington in rich detail. In short, Pelecanos reads like the real deal. Pelecanos knows a thing or two about capturing the authenticity of urban America with an ethnically and socially diverse cast. In addition to his success as a novelist, Pelecanos is a producer and writer for HBO's New Orleans-set, \\"Treme.\\" He was previously a producer and Emmy-nominated writer on the hit series \\"The Wire\\" and the miniseries \\"The Pacific.\\" Read an excerpt from \\"The Cut\\" CNN recently spoke to Pelecanos about his new novel.

Steven struggles with their children's bad behavior while Dennis enjoys their children as","completion":"much as he can. Both Steven and Dennis are loving parents, but their different approaches to parenting often cause friction in their relationship. Their children, Emma and Ryan, are twins, aged seven. They have an uncanny ability to push their parents' buttons, making both of them question their capabilities as parents. The family lives in a quaint suburban town that most would see as picture perfect. But behind its polished exterior, the family's life is characterized by a tangle of love, conflict, laughter, and tears. Emma is an outspoken, strong-willed girl who loves art and is passionate about protecting the environment. Ryan, on the other hand, is more introverted, with a keen interest in math and science. He is often content to spend hours alone, conducting experiments and solving puzzles. Their different personalities often lead to clashes, as well as moments of beautiful harmony, much to the bewilderment and occasional frustration of their parents. One summer evening, Steven returns home from work, exhausted after a long day at the office. As he walks through the door, he is greeted by the sound of Emma and Ryan bickering, their voices carrying through the open windows. Dennis, who is cooking dinner in the kitchen, cheerfully shouts, \\"Welcome home, honey!\\" over the noise. Steven sighs and rubs his temples as he trudges up the stairs to confront the kids. He finds them in the playroom, arguing over who gets to use the easel. \\"Guys, calm down,\\" he pleads, his voice laden with fatigue. \\"I've had a long day, and I need some peace and quiet.\\" The twins pout and glance at each other before begrudgingly stopping their argument. Emma sheepishly hands Ryan the paintbrush, and they both silently continue painting. Later, during dinner, Dennis notices the tension in the air. \\"Come on, lighten up!\\" he suggests, playfully tossing a bread roll at Steven, who catches it, albeit with a half-hearted smile. \\"We should have some fun as a family this weekend. Let's plan a camping trip!\\" Emma and Ryan immediately perk up, momentarily forgetting their earlier squabbles. \\"Yes! Can we roast marshmallows and tell scary stories by the fire?\\" Emma asks, excitement filling her voice. \\"And maybe we can explore the woods and look for insects and interesting rocks!\\" Ryan chimes in, his eyes sparkling with curiosity. For a moment, Steven hesitates, considering their endless to-do list and his mounting work stress. But seeing the excitement in his children's eyes, he relents and agrees to the trip. On Friday, the family sets off on their camping adventure, filled with a mix of anticipation and nervous energy. They drive to a beautiful location deep in the forest, with towering trees, a mirrored lake, and the distant sounds of wildlife echoing throughout the clearing. After setting up camp, they spend the day swimming in the lake and hiking through the lush forest, the children marveling at the wonders of nature. As night falls, they gather around the campfire, roasting marshmallows and sharing ghost stories. Ryan and Emma listen with wide, astonished eyes, caught in the thrall of their parents' chilling tales. For the first time in a long while, Steven and Dennis are genuinely enjoying themselves, momentarily forgetting the stressors of their everyday lives. When they finally crawl into their tents, something magical happens. In the shared silence, with only the gentle susurrus of the wind and the distant hoots of owls to accompany them, Steven and Dennis slowly begin to open up to each other. They speak candidly about their fears and insecurities surrounding parenthood and their relationship. In the vulnerability of that moment, they find themselves growing closer, rediscovering a connection that had been partially worn away by the strain of daily life. The next morning, the family awakes to the serene beauty of the forest. As they pack up and head home, they know that their camping trip has left a lasting impact on them. For Steven and Dennis, the experience has served as a reminder of the joy, laughter, and harmony that can be found amidst the challenges of raising children. As they drive away, the sun casting long, dappled shadows across their faces and the smell of damp earth and fresh pine lingering in their nostrils, they share a knowing glance. They are more determined than ever to face the ups and downs of parenthood as a team, seeking solace in their love for their children, and in their love for each other. Emma and Ryan, in the backseat, gaze contentedly at the receding forest, their differences momentarily forgotten and a newfound appreciation for their unique personalities and strengths beginning to take root. And although their bickering will inevitably return, the camping trip will remain as a cherished memory, a testament to the powerful bond that can be nurtured from the most trying of situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Your body just went through a lot of changes during and immediately following pregnancy. These physical, mental, and emotional changes can all cause strain. Your body is recovering from carrying a heavy growing fetus and your digestive system is recovering from the physical changes of pregnancy. These can increase the chance of constipation which aggravates hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids after pregnancy and delivery are commonly caused by pushing during labor. You may notice blood on the toilet paper or in the toilet after having a bowel movement. This is the most common symptom. Hemorrhoids can also be itchy and painful. You may feel an external hemorrhoid when cleaning yourself. It will be a tender swelling around the anal opening. You won’t usually feel internal hemorrhoids, but they can bulge through the anal opening. If your hemorrhoid is larger than the size of a quarter, seek medical attention as this could signal a more serious condition. A physician can diagnose internal or external hemorrhoids by performing a rectal exam. If rectal bleeding is not caused by a hemorrhoid, your doctor will probably recommend a more extensive test called a sigmoidoscopy or a colonoscopy because one of the symptoms of colon cancer is rectal bleeding. Stand with your back facing a large floor length or bathroom mirror. Bend over slightly while turning your head to face the mirror. Look closely at your anus to see if there are any lumps or if there's a swollen mass. These may be hemorrhoids. Alternatively, you can sit with your legs open and use a lighted mirror to look for hemorrhoids. The lumps or mass may be the same color as your skin tone or they might appear darker red. If you're using home treatments, hemorrhoids will usually resolve within a week or two. If they don't, call your doctor or midwife. Occasionally for external hemorrhoids and more often for internal hemorrhoids, you may still need medical intervention. The most common medical treatments are: Ligation: tying a rubber band around the base of the hemorrhoid to cut off blood flow Injection of a chemical solution: to shrink the hemorrhoid Cauterization: burning the hemorrhoid Hemorrhoidectomy: surgical removal of the hemorrhoid Summary:","completion":"After having a baby, your body goes through many changes which can cause strain. You might get something called hemorrhoids, which are swollen and sometimes sore bumps around the place where you poop.

If they are really big or don't go away, you should see a doctor.

Here is an article: was briefly evacuated Tuesday evening after officials received a bomb threat called in from a telephone booth, in the second such alert at the monument in two weeks. The warning came as French officials have been on alert for possible terror attacks on crowded targets. Police closed off the immediate surroundings of the tower, France's most visited monument, blocking off traffic. Officers pulled red-and-white police tape across a bridge leading over the Seine River to the monument. Dozens of officers stood guard in the area. Bomb experts combed through the 324-meter (1,063-foot) tower and found nothing unusual, the Paris police headquarters said. Tourists were let back inside about two hours after the structure was emptied. Jean Dupeu, a 74-year-old Paris retiree, had planned to go to dinner in the tower but found himself looking for another restaurant. \\"It's surely a bad joke,\\" he said of the threat, adding, \\"Now is not a good time.\\" National Police Chief Frederic Pechenard said last week that authorities suspect al-Qaeda's North African branch of plotting a bomb attack on a crowded location in France. His warning came after al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, or AQIM, claimed responsibility for the Sept. 16 abduction of five French nationals and two Africans in northern Niger. The French parliament voted this month to ban burqa-style Islamic veils in France, a subject that has prompted warnings by AQIM. Counterterrorism officials say that is just one of several factors contributing to the heightened threat. At the Eiffel Tower, an anonymous caller using a phone booth in a nearby neighborhood called in a warning to firefighters, the Paris police headquarters said. The company that runs the monument asked police to evacuate it. Police responded to a similar false alert at the tower on Sept. 14, also following a phone threat. On Monday, the bustling Saint Lazare train station in Paris was briefly evacuated and searched. As soon as the latest bomb alert ended, huge lines of eager tourists immediately formed under the tower. Mike Yore, 43, of Orlando, Florida, was among those waiting in line who had no idea the 121-year-old iron monument had even been evacuated. \\"There's no bomb that can blow this thing up,\\" he said.

A large group of construction workers and animal handlers offload a large container, the creature within unseen. During the process, the animal attempts to escape, an act which leads to a mass panic, and the death of one of the workers.The story jumps forward to an Amber mine in the Dominican Republic, where we learn that miners extracting amber are involved with a genetic-engineering company called InGen. We also learn that the death of the worker seen earlier has raised serious concerns about the safety of the island, according to Donald Gennaro, an InGen representative, and that the owner of the island is now seeking top scientific experts in the field to help endorse the park.At a paleontological excavation in Montana we are introduced to Dr. Alan Grant, and his assistant Ellie Sattler, as they slowly uncover the fossilized remains of a Velociraptor, perhaps nature's most lethal and cunning predator to date, a beautiful specimen evolved to kill. Part of Grant's research experiments with a new radiological device that shoots a probe into the dirt which bounces an image of an uncovered raptor skeleton back to a computer screen. Grant is hesitant about the new technology but seems fascinated with the image it produces without having to dig. He is also a follower of a long-held theory among paleontologists that dinosaurs evolved more from birds than reptiles.The dig is cut short by the sudden appearance of Grant and Sattler's main sponsor, the elderly and eccentric billionaire, John Hammond. He invites them over to endorse his latest project, a remote island resort, where he claims that their \\"unique biological attractions\\" are \\"guaranteed to drive children out their minds!\\"Grant and Sattler are accompanied by two other characters -- the equally eccentric chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm, and the lawyer, Donald Genarro, who represents Hammond's investors.

Answer the following question: The answer to the question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died? is inside the article: If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to..., can you guess it ?

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Imagine putting some bacteria in the freezer and taking them out millions of years later to find that they are still alive. That would be similar to what happened recently, when scientists brought eight-million-year-old bacteria back to life -- simply by thawing them out. The ancient bacteria were found frozen in the world's oldest known tracts of ice, the glaciers of Antarctica. Professor Bidle and his colleagues found and revived two samples of bacteria from the glacial ice. The first was a hundred thousand years old, and the second was around eight million years old. The eight-million-year-old bacteria were alive. But their genes were seriously damaged from long exposure to cosmic ( ) radiation, which is higher at the earth's poles. Most of the bacteria in the samples probably blew over from African deserts, said Paul Falkowski, a scientist at prefix = st1 /RutgersUniversity. Once the bacteria landed on the glacier's snowy surface, they combined with the snow to form ice. \\"These ices are actually gene banks,\\" he added. As glaciers and ice caps melt as a result of increasing global warming, large amounts of bacterial genetic material might be washed into the ocean. These bacteria might get incorporated into today's bacteria in the ocean, or living bacteria from the ice might also grow and have an important effect on the ecosystem. \\"How that's going to play out, we don't know,\\" Bidle said.

Stewart commented that the song was \\"the only public statement that [Beyoncé and Jay-Z had] ever made about marriage\\", and that while in the studio recording the song Beyoncé had remained tightlipped, even to the point of removing her wedding band. Beyoncé's marriage inspired Nash to compose a song about an issue that affected many people's relationships: the fear or unwillingness of men to commit.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who moved to London on completing his seven-year indenture? is inside the article: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century.

Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther, 49, turned up Monday afternoon in Boone, a town in the Blue Ridge Mountains roughly 90 miles from her Salisbury home, nearly a week after she went missing. Bradshaw-Crowther, who has a vascular condition that requires C-section births, is now receiving “much needed” treatment in a hospital, her brother Drew Bradshaw wrote on Facebook Tuesday night. “While it is unfortunate, we no longer expect a new addition to our family and ask for your continued prayers,” Bradshaw said. Carrie Bradshaw-Crowther, 49, went missing from her home in Salisbury, N.C., last week on the morning of her C-section appointment. Her disappearance touched off a major search and massive outpouring of support for her family. “We respect the HIPPAA laws and we feel that releasing any more information should be in Carrie’s discretion after she has the opportunity to heal,” he added. Her absence on the day of the procedure sparked a massive search and outpouring for the family, who worried that she might go into labor and pass away while she was in flight. Bradshaw-Crowther has a severe form of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic says can lead to dangerous breakages in a person’s blood vessels, intestines or uterus. On Tuesday, the family just wanted to express gratitude for police and hospital staff and the people who showed support and spread notice of the woman’s disappearance, Bradshaw said in his Facebook statement. “The compassion shown by so many people, many who do not know Carrie, is the same compassion we know Carrie shows to others daily,” he wrote. “She is, and has always been a very loving person whose family is her world, and without hesitation, she puts herself second to anyone in need.” Steve Frank/GoBlueRidge.net The Watauga County Sheriff’s Office in Boone, N.C., located Bradshaw-Crowther on Monday afternoon about 90 miles from her hometown in Salisbury.

Please answer the following question: Use information from the paragraph to answer the question. Question: If you subtracted more citric acid from orange juice the acid levels would decrease or increase? Paragraph : A stronger acid produces a greater concentration of ions than a weaker acid. Answer:","completion":"If you subtracted more citric acid from orange juice, the acid levels would decrease. To understand this, let's first break down the information provided in the paragraph about acids. An acid is a chemical compound that donates a hydrogen ion (H+) when dissolved in water. Stronger acids produce a greater concentration of ions (specifically H+ ions) than weaker acids when they are dissolved in water. The strength of an acid is typically measured by its pH value, with lower pH values indicating stronger acids and higher pH values indicating weaker acids. Now, let's consider our scenario of subtracting citric acid from orange juice. Citric acid is the predominant acid in orange juice, and it contributes to the juice's acidity and tartness. When you remove citric acid from the juice, you are effectively reducing the overall concentration of ions (H+ ions) present in the liquid. As a result, you are decreasing the acidity of the juice. This process will result in a higher pH value, indicating that the juice has become less acidic. In conclusion, when you subtract more citric acid from orange juice, the acid levels will decrease as the concentration of H+ ions will be reduced, ultimately leading to a weaker overall acidity in the orange juice."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The promotion at the factory promised to his father was taken away at the last moment. The garden his mother worked in nearly every day never produced anything more than the most meager of weeds since Chan's birth. It was often sunny in the little Chinese village, but there was an almost constant gloom over their house, as if a rogue cloud were blocking the sun only over their property. And his parents, of course, blamed Chan for everything. He was small for his age, and usually quiet. He liked to listen to people instead of talking, filling himself with stories. He was a good boy and always did as he was told, and could see the good in his parents, even if others couldn't. Every so often, his mother would allow him a sweet, or his father would bring home an origami folding kit. They didn't like to show it to others, but his parents could be kind. Chan was patient and knew they would love him eventually. He was digging one day between the fence and the west side of the house for grubs to feed to his pet chameleon, Rainbow. It was a warm July day not long after his tenth birthday. He often went there because it was cool and damp from the shade of the trees, and the worms seemed to like it there. He never took more than he needed, then he thanked the grubs for sacrificing their lives so that Rainbow could remain living and being his pet. Chan was very kind-hearted when it came to grubs.

The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil. and the situation: Two gardeners started their planting season at the same time. Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest. Answer the following question: Which gardener had more mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system? A:","completion":"Bill, the gardener who used mycorrhizal fungi compost for his garden, had more mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant's root system. This is because the mycorrhizal fungi form a symbiotic association with the roots of the plants and allow their mycelia to grow either directly into or around the root cells. This increased surface area improves the plants' ability to absorb water and mineral nutrients from the soil, which can lead to better overall plant growth and a more abundant harvest. On the other hand, Hank, who used regular topsoil, did not provide his plants with the benefits of mycorrhizal fungi, and thus his plants' root systems likely had a smaller surface area and potentially less efficient nutrient uptake."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\\" In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, \\"Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.\\"When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia \\"How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?\\" Dylan replied, \\"Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do.\\"In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing.

A new report recounts in chilling detail how the Boston bombing suspects were hoping to add to their arsenal when they allegedly murdered young police officer Sean A. Collier with five gunshots. Collier, 27, was about to start a new job with the Somerville Police Department when he was killed. Friends and family described him as born to be a police officer. Police believe the Boston bombing suspects shot Sean Collier five times before attempting to steal his gun. The Boston Red Sox line up during a tribute to victims of the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath, as an image of Collier is displayed on the scoreboard. 'He came to see me a couple of months ago and he said, ‘Chief, I have. a chance to get on the Somerville Police,'' MIT Police Chief John. DiFava told the Boston Globe. 'I said, ‘Sean, you owe me nothing. You’ve done a fine job for. me. I would never stand in the way of someone trying to do better for. themselves.’' On the night Collier died, he was on duty near Kendall Square in Cambridge. DiFava had ordered extra campus security in the wake of the bombings. Collier joined the MIT force in early 2012 and was reaching the end of a 3 to 11:15 p.m. shift. By 9:30 p.m. he was on routine patrol, parked in the corner of Vassar and Main streets. Collier, who's lifelong dream was to be a cop, was set to join the Somerville Policed Department. Police still have questions about why the suspects were at MIT and what attracted them to attack Collier. The spot gave him a vantage point to. see where drivers might commonly make an illegal shortcut through campus. to avoid a red light. DiFava said he'd pulled his car next to Collier's to see how he was doing. 'Just making sure everybody behaves,' Collier replied. The two men talked for a few minutes before DiFava pulled away. Half an hour after the DiFava got home, the deputy chief called him. Robert Rogers, left, puts his hand on his stepbrother, Andrew Collier, after delivering the eulogy at a memorial service for Collier. Collier was appointed to the Somerville Police Department posthumously to honor his sacrifice. 'He said Sean Collier has been shot,' the DiFava remembered. 'From the time I saw him to the time he was dead, it was probably about an hour.' Since then, law enforcement has called what happened to Collier an assassination. Surveillance camera video shows the two suspects creeping up on Collier's squad car from behind. He was shot five time, police said. Two of those rounds were to the head. 'He didn't stand a chance,' DiFava said. Scroll down for video.

Friends, family and law enforcement officials gather outside the Church for the funeral of Officer Sean Collier who was shot dead by the Boston Marathon bombing suspects. Grief: A mourner walks out of St Patrick's Church following Sean Collier's funeral in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The suspects allegedly tried to take Collier's gun but were unable to unlock it. 'The retention holster does its job well, so perhaps they didn’t get. the gun because of that holster,’' DiFava said. 'Maybe that’s. what thwarted them from getting the gun, because the gun was not removed. from the holster.' It's still uncertain why the Tsarnaevs were at MIT or what attracted them to Collier.

Zheng He (Chinese: Zheng He ; 1371-1433 or 1435) was a Chinese mariner, explorer, diplomat, fleet admiral, and court eunuch during China's early Ming dynasty. He was originally born as Ma He in a Muslim family, later adopted the conferred surname Zheng from Emperor Yongle. Zheng commanded expeditionary voyages to Southeast Asia, South Asia, Western Asia, and East Africa from 1405 to 1433. His larger ships stretched 120 meters or more in length. Ma He was captured by the Ming armies at Yunnan in 1381. General Fu Youde saw Ma He on a road and approached him in order to inquire about the location of the Mongol pretender. Ma He responded defiantly by saying that the Mongol pretender had jumped into a lake. Afterwards, the general took him prisoner. He was castrated before being placed in servitude of the Prince of Yan at age 10, although another source indicates the castration occurred in 1385. Ma was sent to serve in the household of Zhu Di, the Prince of Yan, who later became the Yongle Emperor. Zhu Di was eleven years older than Ma. Since 1380, the prince had been governing Beiping (later Beijing), which was located near the northern frontier where the hostile Mongol tribes were situated. Ma would spend his early life as a soldier on the northern frontier. He often participated in Zhu Di's military campaigns against the Mongols. On 2 March 1390, Ma accompanied the Prince when he commanded his first expedition, which was a great victory as the Mongol commander Naghachu surrendered as soon as he realized he had fallen for a deception. Eventually, he would gain the confidence and trust of the prince. Ma was also known as \\"san bao\\" during the time of service in the household of the Prince of Yan. This name was a reference to the Three Jewels (San Bao , triratna) in Buddhism. There is also document saying his name could be San Bao (lit. \\"Three Protections\\", also pronounced san bao). Ma received a proper education while at Beiping, which he would not have had if he had been placed in the imperial capital Nanjing, as the Hongwu Emperor did not trust eunuchs and believed that it was better to keep them illiterate. Meanwhile, the Hongwu Emperor purged and exterminated many of the original Ming leadership and gave his enfeoffed sons more military authority, especially those in the north like the Prince of Yan. Did he have any children?","completion":"No, Zheng He did not have any children. He was castrated when he was young, which means he had a surgery that removed certain parts of his body and made him unable to have children. This was done to him before he became a servant and later a trusted advisor in the court of the Yongle Emperor. So, even though Zheng He was an important explorer and admiral, he did not have a family of his own with children."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this sentence, the spaces have been added to separate the words, making it easier to read and understand. The sentence talks about two distinct events: 1. Charles moving to Oxford: The historical context of this could be referring to the time when King Charles I of England moved his royal court to Oxford during the English Civil War in the 17th century. Oxford then became his primary base, serving as a center of administration, governance, and military planning. 2. Parliament forming a treaty with the Scots: This could be referring to the \\"Solemn League and Covenant,\\" a treaty established in 1643 between the English Parliament and the Scottish Covenanters during the English Civil War. The treaty aimed at securing Scottish military support against King Charles I in exchange for religious and political concessions, including the establishment of Presbyterianism as the official religion of the Church of England. At the time, the English Civil War had been raging since 1642 and was primarily driven by religious and political differences between King Charles I and the English Parliament. The additional Scottish support provided to the Parliamentarians helped tip the balance in their favor against the Royalists, who were loyal to the King. Thus, the complete and edited sentence now reads: \\"Charles had moved to Oxford while the parliament had formed a treaty with the Scots.\\" The sentence conveys two crucial events during the English Civil War, illustrating how Charles sought to counter the growing power of the Parliamentarians and the strategic alliances they formed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(CNN) -- Judging by the hysterical reaction in some quarters, to President Obama's handshake with Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, or his bow to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah, you would think that America's national security rested solely on body language not sound policy. The presidential handshake between Barack Obama and Hugo Chavez spurred many comments. But just for the record, let's not forget that President George W. Bush kissed and held hands with the same Abdullah after 9/11, while also looking deep into the soul of Vladimir Putin. And a generation earlier, egged on by British Prime Minister \\"Iron Lady\\" Margaret Thatcher, President \\"Tear Down That Wall\\" Ronald Reagan, decided that indeed Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev was a man he could do business with: the business of ending the Cold War. While Obama has not managed in 100 days to defeat Islamic militants, usher in a Middle East peace treaty or disarm North Korea, on these and other issues he has laid down some important groundwork. Most importantly, the global polls following his first overseas trip show he has begun restoring America's name and reputation, key ingredients to successful policy making. Even before stepping onto foreign soil, Obama began by ordering the infamous Guantanamo Bay detention center closed, thus returning the United States to upholding the very same rule of law it preaches to other nations. He also has stated over and over again that \\"America does not torture,\\" thus returning the United States to leading on human rights, not cherry-picking them. To those such as former Vice President Dick Cheney who claim this will make America more vulnerable, even some former Bush administration officials now concede that rigorous but patient above-board interrogation has proven to yield better, more reliable intelligence than a rush to the waterboard. Obama has kept a campaign pledge and given a fixed date for ending the unpopular U.S. war in Iraq. \\"Let me say this as plainly as I can: By August 31, 2010, our combat mission in Iraq will end,\\" he announced. Yet the perils are clear. Hundreds of Iraqi civilians have been killed in Baghdad and other cities in a surge of sectarian violence since January. The Obama administration and U.S. military leaders are playing it down, blaming the suicide bombings on a few militant cells. That brings back memories of Cheney and former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld blaming a \\"handful of dead-enders\\" as the original insurgency was getting into full swing. Much work still needs to be done to stabilize Iraq militarily and politically. Drawing down in Iraq means surging in Afghanistan, which along with Pakistan is still viewed as the central front on terror. \\"If the Afghanistan government falls to the Taliban or allows al-Qaeda to go unchallenged,\\" Obama said in March, \\"that country will again be a base for terrorists.\\" So he has ordered 21,000 new U.S. troops there by summer. But for all the talk of more boots on the ground, negotiating with moderate Taliban and beefing up Afghan security forces, danger will persist unless the Afghan people see more of a peace dividend. As Obama himself recognizes, \\"There will be no lasting peace unless we expand spheres of opportunity for the people of Afghanistan and Pakistan.\\" Watch highlights from Obama's first 100 days ». Dire poverty still stalks the land and people desperate to feed their families will lay an IED for cash if they cannot farm or find a decent paying job. Although the Taliban had less than 8 percent support in Afghanistan at the end of 2007, according to an ABC poll, Afghan public opinion is turning against the U.S.-led coalition partly because of the rising number of civilian casualties as the U.S. military hunts down terrorists with airstrikes. The same is happening in Pakistan. When unmanned drones and other airstrikes target militants but cost many civilian lives, it turns people against the United States. One month ago, President Obama unveiled an Afghan-Pakistan strategy for stabilizing the region, and yet things have gotten so much worse in the weeks since that now he, British officials and other world leaders openly fear the Talibanization of nuclear-armed Pakistan. A furious Pakistan government accuses the United States of sowing panic among the people and insists it's in full control of its country and its nuclear arsenal. But it is hard to overdramatize the danger as this U.S. ally concedes land and appeases the Taliban, then watches as it reneges on a so-called \\"peace deal\\" and rolls ever closer to the capital, Islamabad. On May 6 and 7, Obama will be meeting in Washington with the presidents of Pakistan and Afghanistan. In the fight to deny the militants a tipping point momentum, the military tells me 2009 will be crucial. As for Iran, which even two years ago candidate Obama said would be directly engaged by his administration, there is nothing formal yet between the two sides. After 30 years of enmity, President Obama offered Iran \\"the promise of a new beginning\\" in a Persian New Year video message, and since then has clearly signaled the United States was over regime-change. The Iranian government and leadership have responded in kind, saying they are ready to engage with America if the administration is really committed to changing its Iran policy. However, much of this good will has been over the airwaves and direct or back-channel talks have yet to start. Into this vacuum are stepping all the sundry pro- and anti-Iran interest groups, experts, analysts and nations, with their often-conflicting advice and sometimes confused understanding. Yet it is widely acknowledged that a strategic realignment with Iran would benefit U.S. and regional security and stability. The new Israeli government wants to see no such thing, and wants people to believe it will bomb Iran's nuclear facilities, a belief it fosters with background briefings to journalists in the United States and presumably elsewhere. In an ironic twist, Israel's Arab neighbors are bringing their dire warnings about Iran to the White House. Meantime, Obama has named a new Middle East Peace envoy, former Sen. George Mitchell, signaling he wants to take negotiations out of the deep freeze and committing to the two-state solution for Israelis and Palestinians. Trouble is new Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not signed on to the two-state solution and is trying to fend off this pressure, even suggesting Israel won't engage with the Palestinians until the United States takes care of Iran. Last week, Obama told Jordan's King Abdullah at the White House, \\"My hope would be that over the next several months you start seeing gestures of good faith on all sides.\\" He added, \\"We can't talk forever; at some point, steps have to be taken so that people can see progress on the ground.\\" The president has invited the leaders of Israel, Egypt and the Palestinian Authority to the White House in coming weeks. iReport.com: Grade Obama's first 100 days. The second hundred days in foreign policy will be filled with mini-summits at the White House and major summits abroad -- Russia in July and China sometime later. With all this activity, Obama is clearly shifting the United States away from the \\"isolate and punish\\" policy of his predecessor. He is signaling that clearheaded meetings to discuss issues of mutual concern are better than hiding your head in the sand and hoping they'll go away. So amid the frothing and fulminating over Fidel, Hugo and Mahmoud, remember Nixon went to China. Write highlights for this article.","completion":"This article talks about President Obama's actions during his first 100 days in office and how he made efforts to improve America's reputation around the world.

To provide more context, the Majik Mijits was a collaboration between Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane, both legendary musicians in their own rights. Steve Marriott was best known for his work with the bands Small Faces and Humble Pie, while Ronnie Lane was a member of Small Faces and later the Faces, alongside Rod Stewart and Ron Wood. Their friendship and professional connection had a long history, and the formation of Majik Mijits was a noteworthy event for fans of both artists when they reunited in 1981. When they reformed as the \\"Majik Mijits,\\" they recorded the album \\"The Legendary Majik Mijits.\\" This collaborative effort took place at a one-off concert held at the Bridgehouse pub in East London, and it featured a lineup of talented musicians such as Jim Leverton, Mick Green, Mick Weaver, Dave Hynes, and Sam Brown. The album itself contains a blend of music styles, ranging from classic rock to soul and reflecting the combined talents and tastes of Marriott and Lane. Despite the initial recordings, the album was not released at the time due to lack of record company interest. However, it was eventually released posthumously after both Marriott's and Lane's deaths, providing fans with a glimpse into their unique collaborations. In conclusion, The Legendary Majik Mijits reformed under the name \\"Majik Mijits\\" about 38 years ago (assuming that it is 2021 now). This collaboration between Steve Marriott and Ronnie Lane was a significant event for both artists and their fans and has left a lasting impact on their legacies.

Movie title: Pain & Gain Context: The film opens with Daniel Lugo (Mark Wahlberg) running from large numbers of heavily armed policemen, only to be hit by a police cruiser. Then the story goes back in time a few months. Lugo is a schemer and recently released convict, who served time for Medicare fraud. Sun Gym owner John Mese (Rob Corddry) hires him to increase membership and make the gym more fitness based. Lugo triples the gym's membership within three months and befriends trainer Adrian Doorbal (Anthony Mackie). Doorbal, a bodybuilder, uses steroids, which render him impotent. Lugo soon lusts after the earnings and lifestyle achieved by a new gym member he begins to train: Victor Kershaw (Tony Shalhoub), who Lugo believes is a crook. Inspired by motivational speaker Johnny Wu (Ken Jeong), Lugo decides to be a \\"doer\\" and hatches a plan to extort Kershaw for his assets by kidnapping and torturing him.Lugo recruits accomplices Doorbal and Paul Doyle (Dwayne Johnson), a recently released cocaine-addicted convict who has turned to religion. Though Doyle is reluctant to join the team, he soon caves in after a violent altercation with his priest. This \\"Sun Gym gang\\" unsuccessfully attempts to kidnap Kershaw at home, but incapacitate him with a taser outside his deli and take him to a small warehouse he owns (which is stocked with sex toys). The kidnappers disguise their voices, but Kershaw identifies Lugo from his distinctive cologne. The scheme goes as planned otherwise: Kershaw makes calls, under duress, to provide fake explanations for his disappearance, gets his family to move out of state, and signs the documents which transfer his assets to Lugo. Lugo even bribes John Mese to notarize documents in Kershaw's absence, by presenting documents signed by Kershaw and using Kershaw's money to sponsor the Sun Gym.The Sun Gym gang is able to collect Kershaw's money and assets, but they realize releasing him is a bad idea. Therefore, Lugo concocts a plan to kill Kershaw by forcing him to drink liquor and crash his BMW, making it look like a drunken... A:","completion":"In the movie Pain & Gain, Adrian Doorbal, played by Anthony Mackie, is rendered impotent primarily due to his use of anabolic steroids. Steroids are synthetic substances that resemble the male hormone testosterone, which is commonly used by athletes and bodybuilders to improve performance and enhance muscle growth. However, the abuse of anabolic steroids can cause a range of side effects, including impotence. Impotence, or erectile dysfunction, refers to the inability to achieve or maintain an erection sufficient for sexual intercourse. This condition can be caused by various factors, including physical and psychological problems. In Doorbal's case, the use of anabolic steroids is the main cause of his impotence. Steroids can lead to impotence by disrupting the normal hormonal balance in the body. When a person takes anabolic steroids, their body interprets the increased levels of synthetic hormones as a sign to stop producing testosterone, which is essential for maintaining normal sexual function. The suppression of natural testosterone production can lead to testicular shrinkage, decreased sperm production, and impotence. Furthermore, the use of anabolic steroids has also been associated with additional side effects that may have a negative impact on a person's sexual health, including reduced libido, mood swings, anxiety, and depression. These psychological side effects can further exacerbate the issue of impotence. In summary, Adrian Doorbal's impotence in the movie Pain & Gain can be attributed to his misuse of anabolic steroids. The physical and psychological side effects of steroids combined to contribute to Doorbal's inability to maintain an erection, which plays a significant role in his character's overall storyline and motivations throughout the film."},{"prompt":"Given the question: - imagesize is 200px - death place is woodland hills , california , u.s. - caption is from 1948 -rrb- the trailer for '' the search '' -lrb- - birth name is wendell reid corey - death date is 8 november 1968 - spouse is alice wiley -lrb- 1939-1968 -rrb- -lrb- his death -rrb- - office is santa monica city council - term end is november 8 , 1968 - birth date is 20 march 1914 - term start is 1965 - occupation is actor/politician - image is wendell corey in the search trailer.jpg - birth place is dracut , massachusetts , u.s. - religion is congregationalist - yearsactive is 1942 -- 68 Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"Yes, both questions are inquiring about the same information. The first question, \\"What is the dark web?\\" is written in correct English, while the second question, \\"Wat is the dark web?\\" seems like a typo. Regardless, both intend to gather information about the dark web. Now, let me provide you with a detailed answer about the dark web. The dark web is a part of the internet that is not indexed by traditional search engines and requires the use of specific software, configurations, or authorization to access. It is a subset of a larger part of the internet called the deep web, which consists of all the web pages, files, and documents that are not indexed by standard search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo. The difference between the dark web and the deep web is that the dark web is intentionally hidden and used for a variety of purposes, both legal and illegal. The dark web is often associated with illegal activities such as the sale of drugs, weapons, fake documents, counterfeit currency, and other illicit goods and services. It is also known to host forums for hacking, cybercrime, and other forms of computer-based illegal activities. The anonymity provided by the dark web attracts people who want to partake in these activities without being traced or monitored. One of the reasons the dark web remains hidden and anonymous is because it operates on specific networks that grant users increased security and privacy. The most well-known of these networks is the Tor network. Tor, or The Onion Router, is a free, open-source software that allows users to browse the internet without revealing their identity or location. It does this by routing data through multiple layers of encryption and a series of volunteer-operated relays, making it difficult to trace the source of the data. Despite its notorious reputation, the dark web is not exclusively used for illegal activities. It also serves as a platform for whistleblowers, journalists, and individuals living under oppressive regimes to communicate and share information without the fear of surveillance or retribution. Legal websites also operate on the dark web, including libraries, forums for discussing privacy concerns, and secure email services. In conclusion, the dark web is a part of the internet that is intentionally hidden from standard search engines, and it requires specific software or configurations to access. While it is known for hosting illegal activities, it also has legitimate uses for privacy-seeking individuals.

Please answer the following question: Two sexually active men are currently at the doctor getting checked for sexually transmitted diseases. Before performing the actual tests, the doctor takes a brief physical examination of the men. The doctor notices that Jake's heart is beating irregularly and his arm appears to have a rash on it. While examining Scully, the doctor takes note of how yellow Scully's eyes are, and Scully also reports to the doctor that he has been throwing up lately. After the physical, the doctor has the men both pee into a cup so that he can run a standard STD test for them. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Does Scully have a higher or lower chance than Jake of contracting liver cancer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the limited information provided in the paragraph, it can be inferred that Scully has a higher risk of contracting liver cancer compared to Jake. Liver cancer is typically secondary to a different health condition affecting the liver such as hepatitis or cirrhosis. Verging away from the sexual health context of their visit, there are several indicative signs concerning Scully's overall health that could indicate a possible liver issue, a condition that could potentially increase the risk of developing liver cancer. First, Scully's yellow eyes suggest that he might be suffering from jaundice, a condition characterized by the yellowing of skin and whites of the eyes due to high bilirubin levels in the bloodstream. This condition generally results from liver diseases, particularly cirrhosis and hepatitis, which are also leading causes of liver cancer. Second, Scully reports that he has been vomiting lately. Vomiting can be a symptom of several illnesses, but when coupled with jaundice, can indicate a liver condition. It is specifically a symptom of liver cancer when it occurs with nausea. However, this information should be treated cautiously as it is based on limited data. Symptoms alone are not definitive proof of liver cancer or any other condition, and these symptoms can be indicative of a number of other health issues that aren't related to liver disease or liver cancer. Moreover, it is impossible to determine the exact risk of contracting liver cancer without taking into account several other factors such as BMI, alcohol consumption, family history of liver diseases or liver cancer, age, race, gender, and exposure to certain carcinogens. As for Jake, his irregular heartbeat and the rash on his arm mentioned in the paragraph are not typically associated with liver cancer, so assuming no other factors, it can be argued that his risk of liver cancer may be less than Scully's based on the provided information. However, all of the above should be thoroughly investigated by their healthcare provider who can provide a comprehensive examination, request further appropriate tests, and provide expert diagnostic conclusion. The above answer should not replace professional medical advice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

She claimed that a razor had fallen into the bath and cut the boy's feet. But expert concluded that the wounds must have been made deliberately. Judge told court it was a 'cry for help' and suspended sentence because 'you love your son'","completion":"Title: A Mother's Cry for Help: Rachael Thompson's Case Sheds Light on the Complex World of Maternal Mental Health In today's fast-paced society, new parents are constantly facing challenges. While many parents strive to provide the best for their children, some may find themselves on the verge of despair – often undiagnosed and untreated. This heart-wrenching tale of a mother who went to the extreme illuminates the pressing need for attention on maternal mental health and support systems. Rachael Thompson, a 40-year-old mother, narrowly escaped jail time after she appeared at Plymouth Crown Court on charges arising from the attempted harm of her four-month-old son. In a bizarre and horrifying turn of events, Thompson had sliced across each heel of her infant using a sharp razor blade – causing deep and painful lacerations. While her actions were incredibly damaging, it was her delay in seeking professional help that raised even more red flags. The hospital staff became increasingly suspicious when it was revealed that Thompson had only sought medical assistance for the baby two days after inflicting the injuries. The desperate mother defended her actions by claiming a razor had accidentally fallen into the baby's bath, causing the injuries to his feet. However, it was evident to the medical experts who examined the child that the wounds had been made deliberately. The case that unfolded in the courtroom tells a story of a mother who was undoubtedly struggling under immense pressure. In delivering the verdict, the presiding judge recognized the calculated nature of the injuries inflicted, but ultimately concluded that Thompson's actions were a \\"cry for help.\\" The judge suspended her sentence, acknowledging that the mother did, in fact, love her son. The case of Rachael Thompson is a stark reminder that maternal mental health issues may often manifest in ways that are difficult to understand. It is essential to identify and provide support to mothers who are in desperate need of help, not only for the physical and emotional well-being of their children but for their own recovery as well. Society must be vigilant in its efforts to prevent incidents like this from happening with an emphasis on early recognition and intervention. As we discuss the importance of maternal mental health, it is crucial to consider the following points: 1. Awareness and education: It is vital to raise awareness about the challenges faced by new parents, specifically emphasizing the need to address mental health concerns. Educating the general public, healthcare professionals, and new parents themselves is essential to ensure the early detection and treatment of these issues. 2. Comprehensive support systems: By developing an extensive support network, mothers experiencing difficulties will have access to the appropriate resources. Family, friends, and healthcare professionals play crucial roles in identifying signs of distress and facilitating the required support. 3. Encouraging open communication: Mothers who feel mentally and emotionally overwhelmed should be encouraged to share their feelings and concerns with trusted individuals. A judgment-free environment will ensure that they can seek help without fear of stigmatization or condemnation. 4. Monitoring healthcare practitioner advice: Healthcare providers must be vigilant in their assessments and recommendations for new parents. Appropriate mental health screenings should be included regularly in postpartum appointments to ensure early detection and intervention. As we continue to raise awareness about the importance of maternal mental health, society must strive to protect children from the devastating effects of untreated mental health issues. Furthermore, we must endeavor to provide the required support to parents like Rachael Thompson, who are caught in this intricate world of overwhelming challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, we see that we have j in two places: \\"457 * j\\" and \\"-122 * j.\\" But we want to find the value of j that makes the whole equation true. So what we can do is combine those j's together!

So, we can rewrite the equation like this, with just one j: 335 * j = 4020 Now we have a simpler equation to solve! We want to find the value of j, so we need to know how many times we can fit 335 into 4020. To find this out, we can divide 4020 by 335: 4020 ÷ 335 If you do the math, you will find out that j is 12!

Heads up: Bristol City's Korey Smith (left) and Leyton Orient's Lloyd James go up for a header. But strikes from Billy Knott and Mason Bennett sealed an impressive away win Phil Parkinson's men. Bradford are now second behind Fleetwood after Doncaster’s stoppage-time equaliser meant Preston, for whom Joe Garner signed a new contract earlier on Tuesday, were held to a 1-1 draw which slipped them down the table. Chris Humphrey looked to have secured the points for the Lilywhites but Nathan Tyson struck a last-gasp leveller. Stand-in striker Matt Done scored a hat-trick for Rochdale in the evening’s high-scoring affair as Crewe were hammered 5-2.

Article: Nowadays the problem of the generation gap is becoming more and more serious. Poor relationship between parents and their children are very common. Whether we like it or not, our parents are responsible for us at least until we're out of high school. So rather than get upset about that fact, maybe we should focus on some ways to make our relationship better. The best way, in my opinion, is to learn to really communicate with my parents. When I find myself arguing with my mom and dad, I try to stop. If I can manage to stop myself from talking, I usually find that I can calm down quickly. I guess I'm usually acting out of emotion rather than logic . But if I can stop arguing for a minute, it seems that my opinion changes and I start to realize that I'm a bit childish. Emotionally I may still be upset, but logically I understand that yelling and fighting surely won't make things better. Once I've stopped arguing, I look at my parents in the eye. You'd be amazed at how much easier it is to communicate with your parents when you've actually looking at them. Looking away doesn't do much of anything except for giving them the impression that I'm not listening or that I don't care. It's much easier to see things eye to eye when you're physically seeing them eye to eye. Finally, I listen to what they're saying (or at least I try). Communication can't happen unless both sides hear and listen to each other. There is nothing wrong with my hearing, but that doesn't mean I always listen to the sounds that people are making. When I argue with my parents, I can physically hear what they're saying without mentally listening to it. Whether I admit it or not, my parents' experience can actually help them give me some pretty sound advice at times. I don't always agree with them, but I think it's safe to say that it has truly helped our relationship in the long run. Question: Which of the following advice is NOT mentioned in the passage?

The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. A team consists of 6 field players and one goalkeeper in the water at any one time. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles. In addition to this, teams may have substitute field players and substitute goalkeepers who are not in the water. Water polo is typically played in an all-deep pool 7 feet deep and players require stamina and endurance to play the game. - Claes Arne Borg ( 18 August 1901 -- 7 November 1987 ) was a Swedish swimmer .

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 5973*b - 450944 = 203*b - 98974 for b.","completion":"Alright, let me explain this like a story for you. So, we have a math problem that looks like this: 5973 * b - 450944 = 203 * b - 98974 Now, let's imagine that there are two bags full of building blocks. One bag has 5973 blocks and the other has 203 blocks. We want to see how many blocks (\\"b\\") in total there should be in each bag so that when we compare the difference between the bags, we find the same number of blocks. First, let's move the smaller number of blocks (203 * b) to the left side. We do this by subtracting '203 * b' from both sides like this: 5973 * b - 203 * b - 450944 = -98974 Now, we can combine the two bags of blocks on the left side, like putting all the blocks together in one bag. So, we get: (5973 - 203) * b - 450944 = -98974 This simplifies to: 5770 * b - 450944 = -98974 Now, let's move the extra '-450944' blocks from the left side to the right side so we can see how many blocks must be in each bag. We can do this by adding '450944' to both sides: 5770 * b = 351970 Now, we just need to find out how many blocks (\\"b\\") are in the big bag. To do this, we can divide both sides by the number of blocks on the left side (5770): b = 351970 / 5770 And the final number of blocks (\\"b\\") that we find is: b = 61 So, the solution to this problem is: b = 61"},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: how many spanish speaking people are there in the us I found the following answer on Google: Also west of Louisiana Territory was Spanish between 1763 - 1800 (year of the French recovery of territory), after the French and Indian War .

Article: Animal experts in Croatia say a bear has learned how to trick people to let him in by knocking at the door.

''We jumped out of the window as he came in through the door and went into the kitchen to take some food for the first time.\\" Mum Nevenka Loknar told a reporter from a local newspaper. \\"I opened the door and saw him standing there and I didn't believe my eyes at first, then I ran for it as he walked in as if _ was the most normal- thing in the world.\\" Bears are a common thing in the woods around here, but no one has ever heard of a bear that knocks at the door.
