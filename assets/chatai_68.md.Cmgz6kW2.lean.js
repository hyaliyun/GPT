Between 9:00 pm and 10:00 pm the guards enacted a strategy whereby the police officers, backed by the bayonets of the soldiers, advanced to the crowd and arrested each a man, who was then taken into the station, disarmed, and held there. The strategy was largely successful, and by 11:00 pm the area around the station was mostly cleared, though sporadic gunfire could be heard throughout the night. Between 165 and 200 were detained in total, and the most violent of the captives were removed and taken to the police station. The news reported that four, including one police officer, were injured in the exchange, and several who resisted arrest were beaten severely.At the foundry near the Carey Street Bridge, a crowd of more than 100 gathered and threatened to set fire to the area. A contingent of the 5th under Captain Lipscomb arrived, and a volley fired over the heads of the crowd was sufficient to dissuade the crowd. An unsuccessful attempt was also made to burn a B&O transportation barge at Fell's Point. The news reported that 16 were arrested in a confrontation between citizens and the police at Lee and Eutaw, and that during the night, three separate attempts were made to set fire the 6th Regiment armory, but all were frustrated by the remaining garrison there.Just before midnight, 120–135 marines arrived at the station and reported to the governor, who ordered them to set about capturing the leaders of the mob.

Write highlights for this article: One of the most difficult parts of a trial, especially in front of a jury, is accurately describing the crime scene. A number of courtrooms have begun projecting 3D images of scenes onto walls - but these can only reveal a limited amount of information. To take criminal courtroom reconstructions to the next level, experts have created a 3D immersive system that virtually transports people inside the scene using an Oculus Rift headset. The setup uses an Oculus Rift headset (d), the OptiTrack optical tracker (e), laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. The computer system is shown at (a), (b) is the Oculus USB connector, and (c) is a wall-mounted tracker. It has been dubbed 'forensic holodeck' after the environment simulator used in sci-fi show Star Trek. The low-cost setup uses an Oculus Rift headset, the OptiTrack optical tracker, a laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. It also uses gaming software called Unity 3D. This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail - similar to Star Trek’s hologram setup. ‘In Switzerland, scenes are routinely reconstructed by combining 3D laser scans of the scene to post-mortem surface scans and medical images, such as CT and MRI,’ explained lead researcher Lars Ebert from the from the Institute of Forensic Medicine in Zurich. To demonstrate the system, the researchers chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe (pictured). The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings. The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room. The low-cost setup uses an Oculus Rift headset, the OptiTrack optical tracker, a laser scanner from Geomagic and Autodesk 3DS Max software to create the final reconstructions. This creates an immersive world in which the jury, judges and other members of the court can explore and see in 3D high-resolution detail. Oculus Rift is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time, allowing for calculation of the scene with the correct perspective. Oculus Rift (pictured) is worn on the head and measures the orientation of the wearer in real time. The headset consists of a screen that is split in half, delivering half the 1280 x 800 pixel resolution for each eye. In the front of the screen, two plastic lenses help create a diagonal viewing angle of 110-degrees. The Rift is then connected to the PC using a HDMI cable, and a USB transfers information about the head orientation to a computer. Head orientation is measured using a combination of gyros, accelerometers, and magnetometers. When used for gaming, the headset doesn’t typically need to use positional information of the head is usually not required. To overcome this problem for the forensic holodeck system, the researchers added an optical tracker to measure the user position. This meant they could freely move inside the virtual scene. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting in an internet cafe. The scene was recorded by a surveillance camera, and the team then used a laser to scan the surroundings. The aim was to show how close bullet trajectories came to injuring people in the room. ‘The purpose of these reconstructions is to create a visualisation of an event to make it possible for a state attorney or judge to properly assess a situation based on the bullet trajectories, visibility, speed and distance.’ Mr Ebert continued, however, that although the data used for these reconstructions are high resolution, and allow for a spatially correct display of the scene, they typically use a 3D reconstruction on a 2D display. This reduces the amount of spatial information available. The technology is similar to the fictional holodeck in Star Trek (pictured with Deanna Troi played by Marina Sirtis left and Jonathan Frakes as William Riker right). Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. And although 3D screens partially solve this problem, estimating distances is still difficult because the perceived depth depends on the size of the display. Mr Ebert believes his Oculus Rift system is a solution to this. To demonstrate the system, the researchers recently chose to reconstruct a shooting. During the incident in an internet cafe, a known drug dealer was approached by policemen and women in civilian clothes as well as in uniform for the purpose of arresting him. A Holographic Environment Simulator, or holodeck for short, was a form of holotechnology designed and used by Starfleet in Star Trek. Holodecks were installed on starships, space stations, and at Starfleet institutions for entertainment, training, and investigative purposes. A typical holodeck consisted of a room with a hologrid containing so-called omnidirectional holographic diodes. Holographic projections could be shown by manipulating photons contained within force fields. It was also used in an episode of The Next Generation, called A Matter of Perspective, to recreate the events leading up to a space station explosion for forensic investigations. Source: Memory Alpha. Despite being surrounded, the man was able to get up from his chair and draw a handgun. One of the policemen managed to grab onto the arm bearing the gun while the others attempted to take cover. In the course of the struggle, seven gunshots were fired and one of the bullets hit a policeman on his hand. The entire scene was recorded by a surveillance camera in one of the top corners of the room, and these recordings were used to reconstruct the sequence of events. The team then used a laser to scan the surroundings, and used to this to pinpoint the final position of the projectiles. This, along with the camera footage, were used to reconstruct every bullet fired. The aim of the reconstruction was to show how close the bullet trajectories came to severely injuring one of the people in the room. 'During a police congress, we were able to demonstrate the system,' continued the researchers. 'The comments by the police officers involved in the presented incident were promising.' Further work will be carried out to make the technology more accurate before it is used widely in courtrooms. 'The forensic holodeck: an immersive display for forensic crime scene reconstructions' was published in the Springer journal Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology.","completion":"A team of experts has developed a 3D immersive system that virtually transports members of the jury, as well as other members of the court, inside a crime scene using an Oculus Rift headset.

Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"What are hosted, but don't usually kill their host?\\" with the following options: - ferns - deadly viruses - insects - tapeworms - bacteria - orchids - deadly diseases - white blood cells Answer:","completion":"Among the given options, tapeworms are the ones that are hosted but don't usually kill their host. Tapeworms are internal parasites of vertebrates, including humans. They belong to a class of flatworms called Cestoda. As a parasite, they rely on their hosts for their survival and thrive within the host's body, particularly in the digestive system. Unlike some parasites that have the potential to kill their host, most tapeworms do not cause immediate or severe harm to their host. They attach themselves to the intestinal wall and absorb nutrients from the host's digested food. Usually, the host's body can still function adequately despite the presence of a tapeworm. However, it is essential to note that tapeworms can still cause health problems and discomfort, especially when their population grows unchecked or if they migrate to other parts of the body. Possible symptoms and complications associated with tapeworm infestations include abdominal pain, nausea, diarrhea, weight loss, malnutrition, and even neurological issues in rare cases where the worm spreads to the brain. While other options listed like bacteria and white blood cells can be found within specific hosts, they do not fit the criteria as accurately as tapeworms do. Bacteria can be both beneficial and harmful to hosts, depending on the type, and white blood cells are not parasites but part of the host's immune system, defending against infections and foreign substances. Deadly viruses, deadly diseases, and some insects can be harmful and potentially lethal to their hosts, making them unsuitable options. Neither ferns nor orchids fit the description as they are plants and not hosted by living organisms in the same sense as parasites. While some species of orchids have specialized relationships with fungi, they are not parasites on hosts to the degree that tapeworms are."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is humiliated in front of his father, Buck Cluck (Garry Marshall) and the entire town when, after telling everyone a piece of the sky 'shaped like a stop sign' had hit him on the head, he is unable to find it. All the residents assume an acorn must have fallen on him, and Chicken Little becomes a laughing stock. One year later, Little is still being ridiculed for the incident and is bullied at school by Foxy Loxy (Amy Sedaris) and her band of cronies. His friends Abby Mallard (Joan Cusack), Runt of the Litter (Steve Zahn) and Fish Out of Water (Dan Molina) advise him to talk about his feelings with his father, but Little is more concerned with restoring his reputation outright. Following a bust-up with Foxy, his father is called in, and Little overhears the school principal stating that Buck had been the school baseball star in his youth. Determined to rekindle his relationship with his father, Chicken Little signs onto the baseball team. In the final inning of the big Oakey Oaks pennant game, with all the other players injured, he is called up to bat, and manages to hit an inside-the-park home run. Despite some confusion, the umpire ultimately declares the game won; Little is hailed as a hero for winning the pennant. Later that evening, Chicken Little prepares to go to a victory party being thrown for him by Abby, Runt and Fish, but another 'piece of the sky' identical to the one he had been hit by the previous year falls through his bedroom window. Not wanting to bring the matter up with him again, Little hides the sky piece from his father and examines it more closely, discovering it to be a bizarre panel-like device designed to blend in...

I visited the restaurant last weekend with high hopes after reading so many positive reviews, only to be thoroughly let down right from the start. Upon arrival, my friends and I were left waiting at the entrance for a solid 15 minutes before someone finally acknowledged our existence. We tried to be understanding, thinking it might be a busy night, but it was only the first of many issues we encountered during our meal. Once at our table, we were shocked at the dismal state of cleanliness. Not only were the table and chairs covered with food stains and crumbs, but the menus were sticky, tattered, and appeared to have not been replaced in ages. Frankly, it was both unhygienic and unappetizing. As we tried to look past these facts, our first encounter with the waiter was far from pleasant. He was inattentive, disinterested, and overall incredibly rude, venturing nowhere near a simple smile. It felt as if asking him questions about the menu options and ingredients was an inconvenience. The dining experience continued to deteriorate as we ordered our appetizers. When the dishes finally arrived, after a prolonged wait, what we received was a far cry from what the menu promised. My friend, who has an intense shrimp allergy, was shell-shocked to find shrimp in her ceviche despite the menu advertising otherwise. We informed the waiter of this grave oversight, and he offered no apology, merely shrugging it off and taking the dish away. When we finally started on our main courses, the quality of the food left much to be desired. My steak was significantly overcooked, arriving closer to well-done than the medium-rare I had requested, while another friend's fish was undercooked and not seasoned. The portion sizes were abysmal too, with one meal barely offering enough food to satisfy an appetizer. Throughout the entire meal, we overheard another table nearby sharing similar complaints, highlighting that this was not an isolated experience. The last nail in the coffin was the exorbitant bill, which we honestly felt insulted to pay after such a disappointing and subpar experience. To rub salt in the wound, the waiter took his sweet time to process the payment, ending the evening on yet another sour note. In conclusion, I highly discourage anyone from visiting this restaurant. Poor service, unclean dining areas, and a substandard culinary experience make it a waste of both time and hard-earned money. I hope that the management takes heed of the criticisms shared here and in other reviews, and I implore them to address these issues to improve the overall guest experience promptly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this paragraph, the man is demonstrating how to walk across and navigate a slackline. So, the next logical action for him in this story is to stand on the slackline and balance himself, as mentioned in option C. Now, let's see why other options are incorrect: A. This option talks about traversing a low brick fence, which is not related to the slackline demonstration in the paragraph. B. The man is already walking across the slackline, so it doesn't make sense for him to walk slowly across it again. D. This option is a bit confusing and doesn't follow the logical flow of the paragraph. Also, it doesn't explain any new action, just a different way to walk on the slackline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the following question: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests. Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Answer:","completion":"Forest A, the tropical forest in Brazil, would experience higher rates of chemical weathering. This is due to the following reasons: 1. Elevated temperatures: Tropical forests have higher temperatures, which increase the rate of chemical reactions, thus accelerating the weathering process. 2. Higher insolation: With more sunlight absorption, the overall energy available for various processes, including chemical weathering, is increased. 3. Increased rainfall: Tropical forests receive a larger amount of rainfall compared to temperate forests. Higher rainfall leads to a higher volume of water interacting with the soil, which promotes chemical weathering. 4. Faster decomposition: The warm and moist conditions in tropical forests lead to higher rates of organic matter decomposition, creating a more chemically active environment. 5. Less podzolization: Tropical forests have little to no podzolization, resulting in soil layers that do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts. This allows for a more uniform environment for chemical weathering to occur. Hence, considering these factors, Forest A (the tropical forest in Brazil) would have higher rates of chemical weathering than Forest B (the temperate forest in Germany)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Feeling justified, angry, bitter, and resentful often stops people from forgiveness. Holding on to negative thoughts and feelings doesn’t help you feel better or encourage you to let go. Consciously free yourself from these feelings by not harboring negativity toward other people. While this may not happen all at once, let go little by little. Forgiveness doesn’t mean you forget what happened or pretend like they didn’t hurt you. Remember that forgiveness is more for you than it is for anyone else. Write a letter to a person without the intention of giving it to them. Write down the situation and why it upset you, then write that you forgive them. Symbolically release your hurt and pain by burning the letter or tearing it up. Empathy is a way to relate to other people. Instead of focusing on yourself, you focus on what another person is thinking and feeling so that you can understand them better. Place more focus on understanding the experiences of others to build empathy. For example, imagine what it would be like to live somebody else’s life - with all of their circumstances - and how that would make you feel. You’ll undoubtedly meet people you disagree with or don’t get along with. Instead of digging your heels in further to defend your own thoughts and opinions, hear theirs out. Listen closely and seek to understand other people. Spend less time explaining yourself and more time gaining an understanding of someone else. Your ego will tell you to defend yourself or that the other person’s viewpoint is invalid or stupid. Push these thoughts aside and seek to understand the differences more. If you think that you always know best for other people, recognize that this is part of your ego. Even if you disagree with someone, don’t feel the need to tell them what to do or give them advice.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force . - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities. Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'conflict' with 'world war i'. Answer:","completion":"The entity that has the relation 'conflict' with 'World War I' is the Central Powers, which consisted of Germany, Austria-Hungary, the Ottoman Empire, and Bulgaria.

A significant number of people don't think the government is capable of handling health insurance effectively, and they believe private companies could do a better job. Person A: Really? What makes them think that the government couldn't handle it? Person B: There are several reasons behind this mindset. For one, some people are concerned that the bureaucracy involved in government-provided health insurance would make the process slow and inefficient. They worry that a national health insurance program could become bogged down in red tape and lead to delays in care and increased costs. Person A: That's an interesting perspective. I can see why they might have those concerns. What about individuals who argue private companies are superior at managing health insurance? Person B: Well, proponents of private health insurance argue that competition among insurance companies acts as a driving force for innovation and efficiency.

The popular Japanese manga provides us with an escape from reality into a world of fantasy, adventure and romance.With much less text and pictures running for pages, it fits perfectly into today's fast, throwing away city lifestyle. But Tsai Chih-chung,a famous Taiwanese illustrator , doesn't agree.He believes cartoons can be a bridge connecting traditional Chinese culture and wisdom with the modern world in a much wittier and more acceptable way. He has interpreted Lao Zi, Confucius, Mencius,Zhuang Zi and Sun Zi and made their works accessible to a global audience. He has also produced two books about Zen , introducing oriental philosophy. His cartoons are humorous yet full of wisdom and are admired as an easy way to learn Chinese classics. After avoiding the public for ten years, Tsai made a comeback in late April with seven new works. But does his age, 61, work as a gap between him and his young readers? Tsai doesn't think so. The topics he has covered range from philosophy in a time of individuality to the learning and memorizing techniques used at school. \\"Every child is a genius and has the potential beyond his own imagination, \\" he said.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well. and the situation: Jacob is an avid street car racer who is driving in his sleek black Mustang. He comes to a red light and sees the car next to him is an expensive looking Honda Civic, owned by a man named Alejandro. Jacob and Alejandro agree to race, and when the light turns green they both slam their feet on the gas pedal and take off. Jacob's car arrives at the light pole down the street from the light sooner than Alejandro's car, and he wins the race. Answer the following question: Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated slower? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower. To better understand the reason behind this, let's dissect the given situation and analyze the concepts involving acceleration. As mentioned in the background information, acceleration is a measure of how quickly an object's velocity changes. It accounts for speed and direction, and it can involve changes in either or both of these aspects. In the situation described, both Jacob and Alejandro agreed to race their cars, starting from a red light. When the light turned green, they both hit the gas pedal and began racing each other until they reached a designated point - a light pole down the street. Jacob's car arrived at the light pole earlier than Alejandro's, which means he reached their agreed endpoint faster than Alejandro did. Since both drivers started their race under the same circumstances (same starting point and time), we can compare their speeds and accelerations as follows: 1. Both cars started from a stand-still position, meaning their initial velocities were equal (0 m/s). 2. They raced on the same path, so external influences like inclines or wind resistance can be assumed to be equal in impact. 3. Jacob reached the light pole ahead of Alejandro, indicating his car achieved a higher top speed and/or had a higher acceleration. Given these factors, it is safe to conclude that Jacob's car accelerated faster than Alejandro's car. This conclusion is supported by the fact that Jacob reached the end point sooner, confirming that his car's acceleration was more rapid. Faster acceleration allows a car to increase its velocity more quickly, and in this particular case enabled Jacob to win the race. Consequently, Alejandro's car must have accelerated slower than Jacob's, resulting in a lower final velocity and longer time required to reach the light pole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Title: Experiment in Terror Movie plot: A psychotic killer, Garland \\"Red\\" Lynch, uses a campaign of terror to force San Francisco bank teller Kelly Sherwood to steal 100,000 from the bank for him. Despite his threat to kill her or her teenaged sister Toby if she goes to the police, Sherwood contacts the San Francisco office of the FBI, where agent John Ripley takes charge of the case. Ripley interviews a woman who implies that she's involved in some way in a serious crime, but before she can give Ripley the details, Lynch murders her. Sherwood continues to be terrorized with phone calls, an asthmatic condition making the unseen Lynch's voice all the more sinister. The FBI identifies the criminal, noting that Red Lynch has a record of convictions for statutory rape, forgery, criminal assault, armed robbery, and murder. They track down his girlfriend, Lisa Soong, whose 6-year-old son has just had a hip replaced. Lynch is paying all the hospital bills. Because of this, Lisa refuses to believe that Lynch is a criminal and will not cooperate with the investigation. Ripley nevertheless manages to get some information about \\"Uncle Red\\" from the boy. Lynch finally gives Sherwood a time and date to steal the money, and just to make sure that she does, he kidnaps her sister Toby and holds her captive. The climax is a chase through Candlestick Park after a nighttime baseball game between the San Francisco Giants and Los Angeles Dodgers. Ripley and his men ultimately surround Lynch on the infield of the stadium where he is shot and killed.

Article: Imagine picking apples on Christmas or going skating on May Day. What about going for a swim on Thanksgiving? Without Leap Day ,which takes place every four years, that could happen. Our calendar is normally 365 days long. It was created to match the cycles of the seasons. But Roman ruler Julius Caesar noticed a problem: The earth doesn't circle the sun in exactly 365 days. It actually cakes 365 and one-quarter days. He figured out that the extra part of a day would cause the calendar to grow apart from the seasons over time. Over 100 years, the seasons would shift about 24 days. Spring would start on April 13 instead of March 20. Caesar used math to figure out a way to stop the calendar from shifting. He decided to add an extra day to the month of February every four years. His idea helped keep the seasons and calendar matched up. Even so, it still wasn't perfect--his calendar was adding too many days. In 1582, Pope Gregory XIII worked on Caesar's idea. His calendar, called the Gregorian calendar, declares that every year that is equally divided by 400 is a leap year. Turn-of-the-century years, or years ending in \\"00\\", would not be leap years unless they could be divided equally by 400. These complicated equations help keep the calendar in balance with the orbit of the earth. Today, we still use the Gregorian calendar. In about 3,000 years, the calendar will be only one day out of step with the seasons, It's still not perfect, but mathematicians decided it was as close as we could get.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Answer the following question: Information: - The Battle of Britain (German: \\"die Luftschlacht um England\\", literally \\"Air battle for England\\") was a combat of the Second World War, when the Royal Air Force (RAF) defended the United Kingdom (UK) against the German Air Force (Luftwaffe) attacks from the end of June 1940. It is described as the first major campaign fought entirely by air forces. The British officially recognise its duration as from 10 July until 31 October 1940 that overlaps with the period of large-scale night attacks known as the Blitz, while German historians do not accept this subdivision and regard it as a campaign lasting from July 1940 to June 1941. - The Central Powers , consisting of Germany, , the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria hence also known as the Quadruple Alliance was one of the two main factions during World War I (191418). It faced and was defeated by the Allied Powers that had formed around the Triple Entente, after which it was dissolved. - Air Vice Marshal Sir Charles Alexander Holcombe Longcroft KCB , CMG , DSO , AFC ( 13 May 1883 -- 20 February 1958 ) was a pilot and squadron commander in the Royal Flying Corps who went on to become a senior commander in the Royal Air Force . - The Royal Air Force (RAF) is the United Kingdom's aerial warfare force. Formed towards the end of the First World War on 1 April 1918, it is the oldest independent air force in the world. Following victory over the Central Powers in 1918 the RAF emerged as, at the time, the largest air force in the world. Since its formation, the RAF has taken a significant role in British military history, in particular, playing a large part in the Second World War where it fought its most famous campaign, the Battle of Britain. - The Royal Flying Corps (RFC) was the air arm of the British Army before and during the First World War, until it merged with the Royal Naval Air Service on 1 April 1918 to form the Royal Air Force. During the early part of the war, the RFC supported the British Army by artillery co-operation and photographic reconnaissance. This work gradually led RFC pilots into aerial battles with German pilots and later in the war included the strafing of enemy infantry and emplacements, the bombing of German military airfields and later the strategic bombing of German industrial and transportation facilities.

This article: English jeweller and naturalist William Bullock and his son travelled to Mexico soon after its independence, spending six months in 1823 collecting archeological artifacts and many bird and fish species new to science. The bird specimens were given to naturalist William John Swainson, their countryman, to formally describe, which he did in 1827. Among these was the red warbler, which was assigned to the genus Setophaga, as Setophaga rubra. Over the next half century, other authorities moved it to Cardellina, with the red-faced warbler, and to the widespread tropical warbler genus Basileuterus, as well as to the Old World warbler genus Sylvia and the Old World tit genus Parus. In 1873, English naturalists Philip Lutley Sclater and Osbert Salvin moved the species to the genus Ergaticus, where it remained for more than a century.The red warbler forms a superspecies with the pink-headed warbler of Chiapas and Guatemala. Despite their disjunct ranges and considerably different plumages, the two have sometimes been considered conspecific. Conversely, it has also been suggested that the red warbler should be split into a northern gray-eared species (C. melanauris) and a southern white-eared species (C. rubra). A comprehensive 2010 paper by Irby Lovette and colleagues analysing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of the New World warblers found that the red and pink-headed warblers are each others' closest relative and that their common ancestor diverged from a lineage that gave rise to the red-faced warbler. The authors recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina, a suggestion which has been adopted by the International Ornithologists' Union (IOC).There are three subspecies, which differ slightly in appearance: C. r. rubra, described by Swainson in 1827, has white ear patches and is found from southern Jalisco and southern Hidalgo to Oaxaca. contains an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who, along with their colleagues, recommended moving the red and pink-headed warblers to the genus Cardellina?, what is it ?

First, let's simplify the numbers that don't have 's' next to them. So our equation looks like this: 5081 * s + (26287 - 16103 + 45768) = -45668 Now let's add the numbers in the parentheses: 26287 - 16103 + 45768 = 10194 + 45768 = 55962 So our equation is now: 5081 * s + 55962 = -45668 Now, we want to bring the number 55962 to the other side of the equation so that we only have 's' to solve for. We can do this by subtracting 55962 from both sides of the equation: 5081 * s + 55962 - 55962 = -45668 - 55962 Now, we're just left with: 5081 * s = -101630 To solve for 's', we need to divide both sides of the equation by 5081: s = -101630 / 5081 When we do the division, we get: s ≈ -20 So, the answer is s is about -20."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Research the app. Before writing a review, it's important to have a clear understanding of the app in question. In this case, the app is \\"com.achep.acdisplay.\\" A quick search reveals that AcDisplay is an app that offers features such as displaying notifications on the lock screen and turning on the screen automatically when a new notification arrives. Step 2: Identify issues experienced with the app. In order to write a 1-star review, I will focus on creating a scenario where the user experiences multiple problems with the app, which justifies the low rating. Issues can include bugs, poor functionality, battery drain, and unresponsiveness, among others. Step 3: Write the review & keep it realistic. Now that I have gathered information on the app and decided which issues to include, I will write a realistic review that a frustrated user might leave. I will include specific details and mention the app's features to make the review convincing. Review: Title: Frustratingly Unreliable and Draining I had high hopes for AcDisplay to improve my lock screen experience, but it has been nothing but a headache. The app claims to offer a convenient way to view notifications on the lock screen, but half the time it just doesn't work. My screen either doesn't turn on at all or lights up with significant delays when new notifications arrive. Additionally, the app seems to drain my battery at an alarming rate, even when I'm not actively using my phone. My battery life has been reduced by almost half since I started using AcDisplay. Worst of all, the actual functionality of displaying notifications is unreliable. Notifications disappear randomly or don't even show up at all on the lock screen. I am also unable to interact with them or dismiss them, which is highly inconvenient. I've tried reaching out to the support team, but they seem unresponsive, leaving me to struggle with these issues on my own. I can't recommend this app to anyone. Save yourself the frustration and avoid AcDisplay!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

You are also given a question about the story that requires an understanding of the relationship described in the background paragraph and the story. You need to come up with an answer to the given question; the answer will be a span from either the question or the story. In order to correctly answer the given question, you need to understand the relationship mentioned in the background paragraph and should be able to use it to understand that in the story. Your answer can not consist of any word that is not mentioned in any of these: the background paragraph, the story, or the question. You can directly copy and paste a span from the story or the question while answering the given question. Problem:Background Paragraph: As new changes in the DNA sequence are constantly being generated in a population's gene pool (changing the population's allele frequencies), some of these changes will be beneficial and result in traits that allow adaptation and survival. Natural selection causes evolution of a species as these beneficial traits become more common within a population. Evolution can occur within a species without completely resulting in a new species. Therefore, evolution and speciation are not the same. Story: Over time a species of bird has changed a lot. Originally the climate the bird lived in changed so they adapted and more of them were seen to have heavy down feathers for warmth. Later down the line it got warmer, some of the birds stayed in the warmer area and adapted to it growing thinner feathers. Some of the others decided to migrate to colder areas instead. More time passed and the birds in the warmer area eventually evolved into a very dangerous creature with sharp talons to defend itself from predators.

I’ve unwittingly embarrassed my daughter by stopping by my daughter’s place too often to drop things off, I guess. I guess I embarrassed my daughter when she was living with her boyfriend by stopping by with healthy food and favorites groceries and other things I thought she needed and might like. The boyfriend always told me the groceries were a help. My daughter complained she already had too many clothes and if I tried to surprise her with something new. I think my husband and I embarrass our daughter now practically no matter what we do just because we’re parents and maybe because we’re older in our 60’s and too happy to see her and too eager to please and we inadvertently treat our daughter like she is still a kid although she will be 22. I’ve never had a deliberate favorite thing to do except maybe by accident when I used to share too many photos of the cats when I used to be on FB? Parents can’t help but embarrass their children beyond a certain age maybe? I can picture if we had an in the ground pool and my husband and I were continually doing silly moves and cannon ball jumping in I think or even simply lazing around in ridiculous color and style too teeny bathing suits for our age that too would embarrass my daughter. When push comes to shove parents like myself don’t have to be too inventive or think much to come up with things they might do that embarrass their kids.

He was known for his meticulous and accurate translations, which have been instrumental in helping Western audiences understand and appreciate Japanese culture and literature for several decades. Born on August 18, 1944, in Nashville, Tennessee, Wilson pursued a degree in political science at Dartmouth College before moving to Japan in 1966, where he studied Japanese language, history, and martial arts. Upon returning to the United States, he continued his studies at the Monterey Institute of Foreign Studies and completed a graduate course in Japanese history at the University of Hawaii. Wilson’s career in translation began with a focus on literary works, such as \\"Tales of Heike,\\" \\"The Book of Five Rings,\\" and \\"The Tale of Genji.\\" Over time, he expanded his focus to include historical samurai texts, and in doing so, contributed significantly to the understanding and appreciation of Japanese samurai culture in Western countries. Among his published translations are \\"Hagakure: The Book of the Samurai\\" and \\"The Lone Samurai: The Life of Miyamoto Musashi.\\" Wilson received various awards for his work, including the 2005 Donald Keene Center Prize for the promotion of Japanese culture, the 2008 Japan-United States Friendship Commission Translation Award, and the Order of the Rising Sun, a prestigious Japanese honor that is given to those who have made significant contributions to the promotion of Japanese culture around the world. Wilson passed away on June 16, 2019, but his work continues to be celebrated and appreciated by scholars and readers interested in Japanese literature and culture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: In 1975, Pink Floyd bought a three-storey group of church halls at 35 Britannia Row in Islington and began converting the building into a recording studio and storage space. In 1976, they recorded their tenth album, Animals, in their newly finished 24-track studio. The concept of Animals originated with Waters, loosely based on George Orwell's political fable, Animal Farm. The album's lyrics described different classes of society as dogs, pigs, and sheep. Hipgnosis received credit for the packaging of Animals; however, Waters designed the final concept, choosing an image of the ageing Battersea Power Station, over which they superimposed an image of a pig.The division of royalties was a source of conflict between band members, who earned royalties on a per-song basis. Although Gilmour was largely responsible for \\"Dogs\\", which took up almost the entire first side of the album, he received less than Waters, who contributed the much shorter two-part \\"Pigs on the Wing\\". Wright commented: \\"It was partly my fault because I didn't push my material ... but Dave did have something to offer, and only managed to get a couple of things on there.\\" Mason recalled: \\"Roger was in full flow with the ideas, but he was really keeping Dave down, and frustrating him deliberately.\\" Gilmour, distracted by the birth of his first child, contributed little else toward the album. Similarly, neither Mason nor Wright contributed much toward Animals; Wright had marital problems, and his relationship with Waters was also suffering. Animals is the first Pink Floyd album that does not include a writing credit for Wright, who commented: \\"Animals ... wasn't a fun record to make ... this was when Roger really started to believe that he was the sole writer for the band ... that it was only because of him that [we] were still going ... when he started to develop his ego trips, the person he would have his conflicts with would be me.\\"Released in January 1977, the album peaked on the UK chart at number two, and the US chart at number three.

Make use of the article to answer the questions. (TIME.com) -- Two of Emily Cunningham's three children have food allergies. And protecting her kids is taking toll on the family budget. When she was nine months old, Cunningham's four-year-old daughter Elena ate a spoonful of yogurt and broke out in hives. Elena is allergic to eggs, tree nuts, dairy and peanuts, and even brief contact with one of the these hard-to-avoid items is all it takes to set off a potentially life-threatening immune reaction. Cunningham's eight-month-old son Wyatt has a bad dairy allergy too. In order to keep their kids safe and healthy, Emily Cunningham, a stay-at-home mother from Charlotte, North Carolina who writes the AllergenMenuMom blog, and her husband keep a completely allergy-free home, buying only food products that are free of any trace of their children's triggers. But that protection comes at a high price. Between breathing medications and epipens of epinephrine, a drug used to treat anaphylactic shock, the Cunninghams spend about 1,000 a month to safeguard their children from their allergies, and that's before the grocery bill. Emily estimates her family spends 80 a month just on rice milk.

It is generally any structurally enclosed interment space or burial chamber, of varying sizes. - Amenmesse (also Amenmesses or Amenmose) was the fifth ruler of the Nineteenth Dynasty in Ancient Egypt, possibly the son of Merneptah and Queen Takhat. Others consider him to be one of the innumerable sons of Ramesses II. Very little is known about this king, who ruled Egypt for only three to four years. Various Egyptologists date his reign between 1202 BC1199 BC or 1203 BC1200 BC with others giving an accession date of 1200 BC. Amenmesse means \\"born of or fashioned by Amun\\" in Egyptian.

It is one of six civilizations to arise independently. Egyptian civilization followed prehistoric Egypt and coalesced around 3150 BC (according to conventional Egyptian chronology) with the political unification of Upper and Lower Egypt under the first pharaoh Narmer (commonly referred to as Menes). The history of ancient Egypt occurred in a series of stable kingdoms, separated by periods of relative instability known as Intermediate Periods: the Old Kingdom of the Early Bronze Age, the Middle Kingdom of the Middle Bronze Age and the New Kingdom of the Late Bronze Age. - Egypt (; ', , \\"Kimi\\"), officially the Arab Republic of Egypt, is a transcontinental country spanning the northeast corner of Africa and southwest corner of Asia by a land bridge formed by the Sinai Peninsula.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? To make a burrito,","completion":"Sure, I'd be happy to guide you through the steps of making a burrito. Here's a basic plan and some justification for each step : 1. Gather Ingredients: Burritos have highly customizable ingredient lists. Common ingredients can include tortillas, cooked rice, beans, proteins (like chicken, beef, or tofu), vegetables (like lettuce, tomatoes, and peppers), and condiments (like salsa, guacamole, and cheese). Gathering everything together before you start makes the assembly process easier and more efficient. Also, by having everything in one place you reduce the chance of missing an ingredient in the process. 2. Prepare Ingredients: Cook your protein and potentially some of the vegetables until they're fully done. Rice and beans typically need to be cooked in advance too. This is done to not only ensure proper cooking but also to make the final assembly process easier. 3. Warm the tortilla: This is important because warming a tortilla makes it more pliable and less prone to tearing. Also, it enhances the taste of the tortilla. You can do this in a microwave for about 15 seconds or over a stove top for a few seconds on each side. 4. Assemble the burrito: Lay the tortilla flat. Add a base layer of the cooked rice. Add the cooked proteins and your choice of vegetables, beans and condiments. The reason for layering it in such way is so that the mix of these flavors come together perfectly with every bite. 5. Fold the Burrito: First, fold up the bottom of the tortilla to cover over the filling. Then, fold the left and right sides in towards the middle. Finally, roll up the burrito. Carefully fold and roll the burrito to encase all the ingredients securely. 6. Optional Final Step - Heat the Burrito: Some people like to heat the assembled burrito on a panini press, in a pan on the stove, or in a microwave to add a little crunch to the tortilla and to fully meld the flavors. By following these basic steps, you'll be able to make a delicious burrito. This task breaks down not only the assembly but also the preparation of ingredients to ensure the most flavorful result.

Given the question: Background: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \\"fungus roots\\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant’s root system. The larger surface area improves water and mineral nutrient absorption from the soil.

Q:And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event.

(II). it is not possible to tell. (III). no. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, it is possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis. In order to break down this response, let's first take a look at the premise and the hypothesis separately. Premise: \\"To do so, we perform a variety of oversight, insight, foresight and adjudicatory functions spanning everything the federal government does or is thinking about doing anywhere in the world.\\" The premise states that there are four different functions (oversight, insight, foresight, and adjudicatory) being carried out, which cover all the activities and thoughts of the federal government on a global scale. Hypothesis: \\"We view and analyze everything the federal government does or is thinking about doing anywhere in the world.\\" The hypothesis is claiming that all activities and thoughts of the federal government worldwide are viewed and analyzed. Now, let's compare the hypothesis to the premise. Both the premise and hypothesis involve actions that encompass \\"everything the federal government does or is thinking about doing anywhere in the world.\\" It is clear that the scope of both statements is the same in this regard. Moreover, the premise's four functions (oversight, insight, foresight, and adjudicatory) can be broadly understood to include the actions of \\"viewing\\" and \\"analyzing\\" as stated in the hypothesis. For example, oversight usually involves monitoring and reviewing activities, so \\"viewing\\" and \\"analyzing\\" would be part of the oversight function. Similarly, insight and foresight would require analyzing and understanding government actions and plans to provide useful and informed predictions. Adjudicatory functions also entail analysis and evaluation of various activities to make judgments. Given these relationships between the actions mentioned in the premise and the hypothesis, it is reasonable to conclude that if the premise is true, then the hypothesis should also hold true. Thus, the answer to this question is option (I) yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Here is a goal: hands How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"The goal \\"hands\\" is quite ambiguous. It could either mean obtaining an object that resembles hands or improving one's hand skills. I will be providing a detailed plan of action for both interpretations below. 1. Obtaining an object that resembles hands: A) Identifying the purpose - Determine the function of these hands (for example, are they for a robotic arm, prosthetic device, or just a decorative item?) - Understand the required features (Should they be fully functional, or do they just need to be aesthetically pleasing?) B) Research - Look up information on appropriate materials, mechanisms, and technologies that cater to the functions outlined earlier. - Compare various designs, identify pros and cons, and read user reviews if available. - Estimate the cost of the intended project. C) Acquisition - There are three main ways to acquire the desired hands: purchase, DIY, or 3D printing. i) Purchase: Find reliable vendors or manufacturers who sell the desired hands following the specifications and budget. ii) DIY: Gather necessary materials, tools, and components. Learn how to assemble the parts through tutorials, workshops, or online resources. iii) 3D printing: Seek out 3D printing services or buy a 3D printer to create the hands. Find or create an appropriate design file for the 3D model, acquire the necessary printing materials and follow the given guidelines for printing. D) Assembly and Integration - Assemble the hands, following any necessary documentation or tutorial videos. - Integrate the obtained hands with the intended system (robotic arm, prosthetic, etc.) - Perform preliminary tests to ensure both aesthetics and functionality. E) Maintenance - Keep a record of any wear and tear or breakdowns. - Schedule regular maintenance to ensure longevity and functionality. - Replace or repair any broken or worn-out components as needed. 2. Improving one's hand skills: A) Identify Hand Skills - Determine which specific hand skills need improvement, such as dexterity, strength, coordination. B) Set Specific Objectives - Establish clear goals for each identified skill, such as “I want to improve my hand's strength to lift a certain weight” or “I want to improve my dexterity for playing piano.” C) Research Exercises and Techniques - Look up exercises that target specific hand muscles to improve strength, dexterity, and coordination. - Investigate ergonomics and grasp techniques appropriate for the desired skills. - Look into therapies and rehabilitation programs designed to improve hand function. D) Create a Training Plan - Draft a comprehensive schedule that includes the researched exercises and techniques. - Set aside dedicated practice time every day/week to ensure consistency and effectiveness. E) Track Progress and Modify - Monitor progress regularly using objective measurements, such as the ease of performing targeted tasks, lifting weights, or playing musical instruments. - Modify the training plan based on the achieved progress, incorporating new exercises, techniques or increasing practice time if necessary. F) Seek Professional Assistance - If progress is slow or stagnant, consider seeking guidance from professionals such as occupational therapists, physical therapists, or specialized trainers. - These experts can help identify roadblocks and recommend customized solutions tailored to individual needs. By following these plans of action for either interpretation of the goal \\"hands,\\" you will be well on your way to accomplishing your desired objective."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Can we draw the following conclusion? the cereal tasted fresh","completion":"Based on the information provided, we cannot draw the conclusion that the cereal tasted fresh. In contrast, the details suggest that the cereal was, in fact, stale. Here is a summary of the events that led to this conclusion: 1. Tom was going to have some cereal and poured it out. The sound it made was unusual, which indicated there could be something wrong with the cereal. 2. He tasted a bit of the cereal and realized that it was stale. The taste of stale cereal is typically characterized by a loss of crispiness and a change in flavor, often becoming less palatable. 3. Tom further discovered a hole in the bag, which likely allowed air to enter and cause the cereal to become stale. This can occur due to improper storage or damage to the packaging during transportation and handling. 4. As a result, Tom discarded the stale cereal and got a new box. This action suggests that he did not find the cereal to be fresh or suitable for consumption. In conclusion, the information provided in the story does not support the idea that the cereal tasted fresh. Instead, the cereal was discovered to be stale, presumably due to the presence of a hole in the bag that allowed air to infiltrate and compromise the quality of the cereal."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 1: oh i just read for escape well i mean it's Sentence 2: I read to escape from issues at my house. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"To determine if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we need to examine both their meanings and the relationship between them. Sentence 1: \\"oh i just read for escape well i mean it's\\" This sentence is vague and incomplete, making it difficult to fully understand the context. It seems like the speaker is attempting to explain that they read for the purpose of escaping from something, but the sentence is cut off and lacks explicit information. The sentence appears to be casual and conversational. Sentence 2: \\"I read to escape from issues at my house.\\" This sentence is clear and complete. It provides a specific reason for why the speaker reads. They precisely state that they read to escape from issues at home and inform us about the context for their reading habit. To answer the question if the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence, we may reason as follows: 1. Both sentences do share the concept of \\"reading for escape.\\" However, the first sentence does not specify what the speaker is trying to escape from. 2. The second sentence provides a clear context of escaping from issues at the speaker's house. Given these observations, we can conclude that the second sentence is not directly entailed by the first sentence. The first sentence is too vague and lacks the specific context provided in the second sentence. However, there is a connection between both sentences regarding reading as a means of escape. To establish entailment between the two sentences, the first sentence would need to provide more information on what the speaker is trying to escape from, such as explicitly mentioning \\"issues at my house.\\""},{"prompt":"The country of Hinland reduced taxation hoping it would mean more money for government spending.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where did the man who died on April 27, 1992 become professor of composition in 1966? Olivier Eugène Prosper Charles Messiaen (French: [ɔlivje mɛsjɑ̃]; December 10, 1908 – April 27, 1992) was a French composer, organist, and ornithologist, one of the major composers of the 20th century. His music is rhythmically complex; harmonically and melodically he employs a system he called modes of limited transposition, which he abstracted from the systems of material generated by his early compositions and improvisations. He wrote music for chamber ensembles and orchestra, vocal music, as well as for solo organ and piano, and also experimented with the use of novel electronic instruments developed in Europe during his lifetime. He travelled widely and wrote works inspired by diverse influences ranging from Japanese music, the landscape of Bryce Canyon in Utah and the life of St. Francis of Assisi. He said he perceived colours when he heard certain musical chords (a phenomenon known as synaesthesia in its literal manifestation); combinations of these colours, he said, were important in his compositional process. For a short period Messiaen experimented with the parametrisation associated with \\"total serialism\\", in which field he is often cited as an innovator. His style absorbed many global musical influences such as Indonesian gamelan (tuned percussion often features prominently in his orchestral works). Messiaen entered the Paris Conservatoire at the age of 11 and was taught by Paul Dukas, Maurice Emmanuel, Charles-Marie Widor and Marcel Dupré, among others. He was appointed organist at the Église de la Sainte-Trinité, Paris, in 1931, a post held until his death. He taught at the Schola Cantorum de Paris during the 1930s. On the fall of France in 1940, Messiaen was made a prisoner of war, during which time he composed his Quatuor pour la fin du temps (\\"Quartet for the end of time\\") for the four available instruments—piano, violin, cello and clarinet. The piece was first performed by Messiaen and fellow prisoners for an audience of inmates and prison guards. He was appointed professor of harmony soon...

After a period of unrest with repeated violent clashes such as the Züriputsch of 1839, civil war (the Sonderbundskrieg) broke out in 1847 when some Catholic cantons tried to set up a separate alliance (the Sonderbund). The war lasted for less than a month, causing fewer than 100 casualties, most of which were through friendly fire. Yet however minor the Sonderbundskrieg appears compared with other European riots and wars in the 19th century, it nevertheless had a major impact on both the psychology and the society of the Swiss and of Switzerland. Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". How big was the impact the Sonderbundskrieg had on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland?","completion":"The Sonderbundskrieg, despite being a relatively short and low-casualty conflict, had a significant impact on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland. While the war itself may not have been as devastating as other European conflicts during the 19th century, it is crucial to understand the long-lasting effects and transformations it had on the country and its people. The Sonderbundskrieg highlighted the divisions within Switzerland, particularly along religious lines (Protestant vs. Catholic). It led to a sense of urgency to fix these divisions to create a unified nation. The insecurity and fear caused by the conflict had a considerable effect on the Swiss people's mentality, pushing them towards seeking stability and unity. As a result, the Tagsatzung (the then central governing body) was replaced by the modern Swiss federal state, under the new Swiss Federal Constitution in 1848. This marks a crucial turning point in Swiss history and is considered the beginning of modern Switzerland. The new constitution established a more centralized government and ensured equal rights and representation for all cantons, irrespective of their religious majority. This new structure diminished the power of the church in politics and helped reduce tensions between the cantons. The society of Switzerland saw an increase in cooperation and mutual understanding among cantons after the Sonderbundskrieg. The resolution to unify and utilize diplomacy allowed Switzerland to maintain its neutral stance in European politics. By strengthening its domestic ties and focusing on national priorities, Switzerland was able to transform itself into a stable, successful, and prosperous nation. In conclusion, the impact of the Sonderbundskrieg on the psychology and society of the Swiss and Switzerland was substantial. It led to the creation of a unified and stable federal state, the reduction of religious tension in politics, and the establishment of Switzerland's neutral stance in international matters.

It seemed like an odd sensation, bothersome and profoundly distracting. She knew it was crucial for her to give her all to this task, but her mind kept wandering. Caroline couldn't help but feel that something was amiss, and she couldn't shake the nagging sensation that she was being watched. Angelo, her project partner, seemed to be doing just fine. He was inherently focused and dedicated to the project, almost unnaturally so. Seeing how engrossed Angelo was, Caroline couldn't help but feel slightly frustrated by her own inadequacy in concentrating. She sought his guidance, hoping he could offer some words of wisdom. Instead, Angelo remained distant, ignoring her attempts at seeking help and advice. He buried himself in the work at hand, leaving Caroline to flounder on her own. As she tried to refocus her mind on the project, Caroline would sometimes catch herself daydreaming about the peculiar set of circumstances that surrounded them. The project they were working on was funded by an enigmatic company, with very specific instructions on timing and logistics. They were stationed in a small town, where the locals seemed to hold a variety of secrets. One of the most mysterious figures in town was Jobe Smith. An eccentric individual, Jobe lived in a garden shed located on the property of the local parish, the shed owned by the priest of the town. Jobe had struck a unique deal with the priest, who offered him shelter in return for performing maintenance and upkeep on the property. Rumors about Jobe's peculiar past swirled around town, creating an air of mystique and intrigue. In the midst of all the whispers, it was difficult not to notice that Jobe was tied to another notable character in town, McKeen's brother. The brother was a jack-of-all-trades, requiring someone with equally diverse skills to assist him with various odd jobs that were too time-consuming or laborious to handle on his own. With his murky past and his resourceful demeanour, Jobe seemed to be the perfect fit for this role. He would often be seen at McKeen's brother's side, working together with him on tasks ranging from plumbing to landscaping. As the work on the project carried on, Caroline and Angelo began to feel the pressure mounting. Struggling to find a sense of balance between her frustration and concern, Caroline tried to focus on the tasks at hand. Unknown to them, however, their progress was closely monitored by an unseen party. The project director, employed by a mysterious agency known as The Shop, had vested interests in seeing the project through to completion. Tasked with keeping tabs on the experiment, the agency operated mere ghosts, providing Caroline with an unexpectedly substantial reason for her unnerving feelings of being watched. As Caroline and Angelo continue to work on the project, the presence of The Shop looms large above them, unseen but influential. The vibrant characters of Jobe Smith and McKeen's brother provide texture to a small town with secrets tucked away within its walls. In this remote corner of the world, the individual private struggles of Caroline and Angelo become entwined with the larger machinations of shadowy organizations and enigmatic figures, ultimately weaving a tale that highlights the complexity of human experiences and the mysterious nature of the world around us."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the person who finished the decade on a critical high note? is inside the article: In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack—\\"Night After Night\\", and \\"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \\"The Usual\\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \\"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \\"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois. Michael Gray wrote that the album was: \\"Attentively written, vocally distinctive, musically warm, and uncompromisingly professional, this cohesive whole is the nearest thing to a great Bob Dylan album in the 1980s.\\" The track \\"Most of the Time\\", a lost love composition, was later prominently featured in the film High Fidelity, while \\"What Was It You Wanted?\\" has been interpreted both as a..., can you guess it ?

Some plants open their leaves during the day. It is during these hours the plant can collect sunlight. At night, the plant closes its leaves to prevent water loss. Many plants respond to the change in the length of the day. As days grow shorter, some plants respond by going dormant. Dormant is when a plant suspends its growth. It does this in order to survive. Shorter days signal the coming of winter. Winter in most areas means extreme cold. It is also very dry in the winter months. As winter approaches, some plants respond by their leaves changing color.

There are lots of places to walk on the tops of the hills, miles of grassland with no people, just sheep and birds. Edward, who had just come out of hospital, could not walk as far as be used to. However this meant that we walked in the mornings, and then stopped at a cafe for lunch each day, before returning to the place we live. Edward and I slept in front of the fire all afternoon, while the ladies went for another walk. Very pleasant! I have taken lots of photos from the place we live, across the valley below us, of the morning sunrise, and the mist in the valley. Also, in England, the old steam powered trains are very popular. I have taken many photos of the train and from it. Yesterday we had the first snow of this winter. It is very early (we usually expect snow in January). It rained all day, then snowed in the evening. Today we have bright sunshine! Both Jenny and I are well I don't know if I told you, in the last e-mail, that Jenny is now working in a hotel.

His experiences as a graphic designer with Toronto's Grip Ltd. honed his draughtsmanship. Although he began painting and drawing at an early age, it was only in 1912, when he was well into his thirties, that he began to paint seriously. His first trips to Algonquin Park inspired him to follow the lead of fellow artists in producing oil sketches of natural scenes on small, rectangular panels for easy portability while travelling. Between 1912 and his death in 1917, Thomson produced hundreds of these small sketches, many of which are now considered works in their own right, and are mostly found in the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa, the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg and the Tom Thomson Art Gallery in Owen Sound.Thomson produced nearly all of his works between 1912 and 1917. Most of his large canvases were completed in his most productive period, from late 1916 to early 1917. The patronage of James MacCallum enabled Thomson's transition from graphic designer to professional painter. Although the Group of Seven was not founded until after his death, his work was sympathetic to that of group members A. Y. Jackson, Frederick Varley, and Arthur Lismer. These artists shared an appreciation for rugged, unkempt natural scenery, and all used broad brush strokes and a liberal application of paint to capture the beauty and colour of the Ontario landscape. Thomson's art also bears some stylistic resemblance to the work of European post-impressionists such as Vincent van Gogh.

Can we draw the following conclusion? Peter was in a lot of pain","completion":"To draw the conclusion that Peter was in a lot of pain, let's examine the information provided step-by-step: 1. Peter cut the tip of his finger with a sharp blade. - This action typically causes pain, especially if the cut is deep or severe. 2. The manager sent Peter to get medical help. - The manager's decision suggests that the injury was significant enough to seek professional attention. This could also indicate that Peter might have been in pain. 3. Peter saw a doctor who tended to Peter's wound. - This step shows that Peter's injury needed medical treatment, which implies that the cut could have been painful. 4. Peter was back to work within a few days. - This statement suggests that the injury was not severe enough to keep Peter away from work for an extended period. However, it does not provide direct information about the level of pain experienced by Peter. Based on these steps, although it is reasonable to believe that Peter might have experienced pain due to the cut, it is not possible to definitively conclude that Peter was in \\"a lot of pain\\" as we do not have specific details about the severity of the cut or the level of pain he actually experienced."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Republican Oklahoma lawmakers urge Obama impeachment over bathroom directive A group of Republican Oklahoma lawmakers introduced a resolution Thursday urging the state’s congressional delegation to start an effort to impeach President Obama over the White House’s directive to allow transgender students to use the bathroom of their gender identity. The Obama administration issued the recommendation to all public schools last week that transgender students must be allowed to use the bathroom of their choosing. The directive has caused fury among lawmakers across the nation. Reuters reported the bill introduced in Oklahoma calls on the state’s members of the House of Representatives to file articles of impeachment against Obama, Attorney General Loretta Lynch, Secretary of Education John B. King and several others. Lawmakers on Friday also introduced a separate measure that would allow students to use religious grounds to have separate but equal bathrooms to segregate them from transgender students. According to The Oklahoman, a state Senate committee approved a measure to grant religious accommodations for students who object to the transgender bathroom order. The bill now goes to the full Senate for consideration. John Bennett, a Republican state representative, said in a statement that the White House’s policy on transgender bathroom usage was “biblically wrong,” and a violation of state sovereignty. According to Reuters, advocates for Obama’s impeachment said that the president has “overstepped his constitutional authority.” However, supporters of the transgender bathroom guidelines called the impeachment resolution a promotion of fear mongering. \\"In a time when our state is facing an unprecedented economic crisis, our lawmakers should be focused on righting the ship rather than stigmatizing transgender youth,\\" Troy Stevenson, executive director of the LGBT advocacy group Freedom Oklahoma, told Reuters in a statement. The measure was introduced hours after Gov. Mary Fallin vetoed a bill that would have criminalized abortion procedures. Click for more from Reuters. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about a group of lawmakers in Oklahoma who are upset with President Obama because he suggested that transgender students should be allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. These lawmakers think this goes against their beliefs and that President Obama does not have the power to make such decisions. So, they want to start a process called impeachment, which is like a big time-out for the president. However, other people believe that these lawmakers should focus on fixing the problems in their state instead of trying to punish the president."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mummy 's Shroud is set in 1920 and tells the story of a team of archaeologists who come across the lost tomb of the boy Pharaoh Kah-To-Bey . The story begins with a flash back sequence to Ancient Egypt and we see the story of how Prem , a manservant of Kah-To-Bey , spirited away the boy when his father was killed in a palace coup and took him into the desert for protection . Unfortunately , the boy dies and is buried . The story then moves forward to 1920 and shows the expedition led by scientist Sir Basil Walden and business man Stanley Preston finding the tomb . They ignore the dire warning issued to them by Hasmid , a local Bedouin about the consequences for those that violate the tombs of Ancient Egypt and remove the bodies and the sacred shroud . Sir Basil is bitten by a snake just after finding the tomb . He recovers , but has a relapse after arriving back in Cairo . Preston takes advantage of this and commits him to an insane asylum , to take credit for finding the tomb and Prince 's mummy himself . Meanwhile , after being placed in the Cairo Museum , the mummy of Prem is revived when Hasmid chants the sacred oath on the shroud . The mummy then proceeds to go on a murderous rampage to kill off the members of the expedition , beginning with Sir Basil after he escapes from the asylum . One by one , those who assisted in removing the contents of the tomb to Cairo are eliminated by such grisly means as strangulation , being thrown out of windows , and having photographic acid thrown in their face .

Given the context: What will happen to Sasha? Possible answers: have to leave the building, regret the behavior and arguments, get a bonus for their job The answer to this question is:","completion":"Since Sasha resigned after experiencing negative situations in Casey's office, it is likely that a few different things will happen. Firstly, Sasha will have to leave the building as they have decided to resign from their job, which means they are no longer an employee of the company. This also implies that they will need to return any company property and be prepared to move on from that work environment. It's possible that Sasha might feel some regret for any arguments or behavior that contributed to their decision to resign. However, this would depend on the specific circumstances and whether Sasha feels that their resignation was justified due to the unsuitable work environment. Lastly, regarding bonuses, it is generally unlikely for an employee to receive a bonus upon resignation, as bonuses are typically given based on performance or as an incentive to retain employees. It's essential to consider the company's policies on bonuses and the specific terms of Sasha's employment agreement. If Sasha has already earned a bonus, they may be entitled to receive it, but it will depend on the specific situations and contractual agreements in place. To summarize, Sasha will have to leave the building as they have resigned, may feel some regret for any arguments or behavior that contributed to their decision, but it is unlikely that they will receive a bonus for their job upon resignation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: The black-and-white aerial footage shows a line of purported Taliban insurgents slowly walking along a path in a lightly forested desert in Afghanistan's western Farah province.

Video shows U.S. airpower (MQ-9s) in support,\\" declared a short message accompanying the video, which was posted on the official account of the U.S. military in Afghanistan. Subsequent footage showed more Taliban scrambling, in an unsuccessful attempt to avoid the airstrikes. The Pentagon footage was released Wednesday, as U.S., NATO and Afghan government forces were locked in a fierce battle with the Taliban for control of the capital of Farah, which borders Iran. The tweet was unusually graphic. While the U.S. military often releases footage of buildings or vehicles being destroyed, it does not as frequently distribute videos that show individuals being bombed.

Milo, a charming and mysterious young man, takes up residence in an abandoned mansion at the edge of town. Almost instantaneously, whispers of suspicion and intrigue circulate amongst the townspeople who are both unnerved and captivated by Milo's enigmatic presence. As the town's folk become increasingly curious about their new inhabitant, local journalist, Crystal Evans (played by Emma Watson), begins searching for the truth behind Milo's past. Crystal, driven by her instincts and thirst for a great story, finds herself digging deeper into the town's history and soon realizes that Milo is not a mere mortal, but a vampire. Despite this shocking discovery, she senses that Milo is not like the malevolent vampires from the horror stories. Reluctant to the nature of his existence, Milo wants to rid himself of his vampiric curse. Crystal decides to help Milo on his quest for redemption, diving into ancient mythologies and seeking out some of the world's oldest and most powerful supernatural beings. As they journey together, their attempt to alter Milo's fate takes them through a perilous path, encountering various other mythical creatures and adversaries who are intrigued by the prospect of a vampire seeking transformation. Along the way, Crystal and Milo develop feelings for each other, raising the stakes and emphasizing the importance of their mission. In the climax of the film, Crystal and Milo confront an ancient sorcerer (played by Benedict Cumberbatch) who wields the power to restore Milo's humanity. The sorcerer presents a series of difficult challenges and moral dilemmas that test the true depth of their love, courage, and determination in undoing the curse. After successfully defeating the sorcerer and proving their worth, Milo's vampiric curse is lifted, allowing him to live as a human once more. Victorious in their quest, Crystal and Milo return to Willow's End where their love story begins anew, free from the shadow of Milo's dark past.

Perez, U.S. assistant attorney general heading the Justice Department's civil rights division, as his nominee for the next secretary of the Department of Labor, according to a White House official. A former federal prosecutor and an official in his home state of Maryland, Perez was sworn into his current post in October 2009. CNN's Jessica Yellin reported earlier this month that Obama would name Perez to the Cabinet position. If approved, he would take the position recently held by Hilda L. Solis, a former congresswoman who resigned in January. In a letter to colleagues announcing her departure, Solis said she'd \\"taken our mission to heart.\\" \\"As the daughter of parents who worked in factories, paid their union dues and achieved their goal of a middle class life, and as the first Latina to head a major federal agency, it has been an incredible honor to serve,\\" she wrote. Perez, who is himself Hispanic, and his office have been active in several high-profile cases in recent years. They include:. -- In 2010, Perez launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the controversial sheriff's hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations. The Justice Department determined that Arpaio had engaged in \\"pattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against Latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized\\" his department's activities. Arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a \\"witch hunt\\" provoked by the Obama administration's disfavor of the state's controversial immigration law. -- In October 2010, Perez filed a legal brief in response to a lawsuit brought by local landowners trying to prevent the construction of a mosque in Murfreesboro, Tennessee. In the friend-of-the court brief, Perez argued that practicing Islam is a freedom protected under the First Amendment of the Constitution. -- Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican lawmakers and became the target of a Justice Department Inspector General's report that slapped the department's voting rights section for having a lack of professionalism and pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically. The case stemmed from a complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who stood outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick. Though civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were filed by the Bush Administration, they were dropped against three of four defendants after President Obama came in to office. Republicans called foul -- accusing the department's political leadership of getting involved in the decision. Though Perez had not yet been confirmed when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision. Horowitz was not satisfied with Perez's account of the situation, saying in his report that Perez should have tried to get more information before testifying. Perez was not accused of any wrongdoing, but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the Inspector General described as a dysfunctional department with persistent ideological polarization spanning two administrations. Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland's Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. This office is charged with \\"safeguarding workers, protecting consumers, providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce,\\" according to its website. Perez also was on the Montgomery County Council from 2002 to 2006. He had earlier spent 12 years as an attorney in the Justice Department's civil rights division, rising to become deputy assistant attorney general during the 1990s. Perez also worked for late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of President Bill Clinton's administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department's civil rights office.

Q:Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union. Since Fidel and Raul Castro led a guerrilla movement that overthrew a dictatorship and took over the country in 1959, the name Castro has been...

The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention.

On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which is not directly related to the concept of a stable state or homeostasis.

Please answer the following question: Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which area, Texas or Seattle, will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire? Robert was watching the local news when he saw a report about a wildfire. The report stated that there was a brush fire in the southwest part of Texas, where it was currently daytime. When he switched the channel, he saw another report about a different wildfire. This one was a forest fire in the northwest part of Seattle, where it was currently nighttime. Hint: Wildfire intensity increases during daytime hours. For example, burn rates of smoldering logs are up to five times greater during the day because of lower humidity, increased temperatures, and increased wind speeds. Sunlight warms the ground during the day and causes air currents to travel uphill, and downhill during the night as the land cools. Wildfires are fanned by these winds and often follow the air currents over hills and through valleys. United States wildfire operations revolve around a 24-hour fire day that begins at 10:00 a.m. because of the predictable increase in intensity resulting from the daytime warmth. A:","completion":"A: Texas will have higher wind speeds at the time of the fire.

Please answer the following question: Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it? What type of law defines \\"states\\", and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone? Answer:","completion":"To comprehend the law that defines \\"states\\" or nations and their role in an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ), we should refer to international law, more specifically, the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). The concept of an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) was formally introduced in international law within the third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS III) held between 1973 and 1982. UNCLOS has been ratified by 167 countries and the European Union, making it a widely accepted international treaty governing maritime law, including the definition and role of \\"states\\" in relation to EEZs. The provisions concerning the Exclusive Economic Zone are found in Part V of the UNCLOS, from articles 55 to 75 and annexes, regulating the specific legal regime applicable. Under these provisions, the EEZ is an area beyond and adjacent to the territorial sea, subject to the specific legal regime established in UNCLOS, under which the rights and jurisdiction of the coastal state and the rights and freedoms of other states are governed by the relevant provisions of this convention. In an EEZ, a coastal state assumes special rights regarding the exploration and use of marine resources, both living and non-living, in the water column and on and under the seabed. However, the state’s jurisdiction is limited mainly to resource management; other countries retain freedom of navigation and overflight, among others, but they must comply with the laws and regulations enacted by the coastal state. The EEZ of a state extends up to 200 nautical miles from its shores. Where there is an overlap of EEZs between states, such as with opposite or adjacent states, the delimitation is generally achieved by agreement on the basis of international law. The principle of balancing relevant considerations, which includes both geographical (proximity) and non-geographical (e.g., relative dependence on the sea, desirability of avoiding cut-off effects) factors, is often used. In the absence of agreement, the boundary line generally follows the median line, equidistant from the nearest points on the baselines from which the territorial seas of each state are measured. The development of the UNCLOS, particularly the EEZ components, has notably expanded state sovereignty from a narrow coastal strip to much larger offshore areas. This expansion is balanced by the responsibilities of coastal states, which are mandated to ensure the protection and preservation of the maritime environment and conservation of species. Overall, UNCLOS effectively regulates the delineation and role of states and their interactions in Exclusive Economic Zones, granting generous sovereign rights to coastal states while simultaneously upholding the principles of freedom on the seas, cooperation, dispute settlement, and environmental preservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Premise: \\"The American people.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" true?","completion":"To evaluate the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" based on the premise \\"The American people,\\" we should first understand the meaning and context of both terms and compare them to determine if they correspond to each other. \\"The American people\\" refers to individuals or residents who live in or belong to the United States of America. This term is often used in political and social contexts to address the collective population of the nation. It emphasizes the shared identity and values among the diverse groups of people that make up the country. In some instances, the term can also encompass broader aspects of culture, history, and experiences unique to the U.S. \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" primarily denotes individuals who possess American citizenship. These people are either born in the United States, born to American parents outside of the country, or have gone through a process of naturalization. U.S. citizens have rights and responsibilities under the U.S. Constitution and laws, including the right to vote, the right to run for public office, protection under U.S. law, and other obligations such as paying taxes and serving on juries. Comparing these two terms, one can see both similarities and distinctions. In terms of similarities, both \\"The American people\\" and \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" refer to individuals who belong to or identify with the United States. They share a connection to the country and its culture, values, and institutions. The terms may frequently overlap in everyday language, as many people who live in the United States are, in fact, citizens of the country. However, there are differences between these terms that are important to consider. \\"The American people\\" is a broader, more inclusive term that can encompass not just citizens but also lawful permanent residents (also known as green card holders), temporary visa holders, refugees, and even undocumented immigrants living in the U.S. These groups may fully participate in American life and contribute to the country's cultural, economic, and social fabric without having official citizenship status. On the other hand, \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" is a more specific term, focusing on individuals who hold American citizenship and are legally recognized as nationals of the United States. While this group constitutes a significant portion of the American population, it does not encompass the entirety of the diverse individuals who call the United States their home. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"The citizens of the U.S.\\" can be considered partially true based on the premise \\"The American people,\\" as there is significant overlap between the two groups. However, it is worth noting that the terms are not completely synonymous, as \\"The American people\\" is a broader and more inclusive term that can encompass residents who are not legal citizens of the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Born in Dallas, Texas, into a family of Mexican ancestry, Trevino was raised by his mother, Juanita Trevino, and his grandfather, Joe Trevino, a gravedigger. Trevino never knew his father, Joseph Trevino, who left when his son was small. Trevino's childhood consisted of attending school occasionally and working to earn money for the family. At age 5, he started working in the cotton fields. Throughout his career, Trevino was seen as approachable and humorous, and was frequently quoted by the press. Late in his career, he remarked, \\"I played the tour in 1967 and told jokes and nobody laughed. Then I won the Open the next year, told the same jokes, and everybody laughed like hell.\\" At the beginning of Trevino's 1971 U.S. Open playoff against Jack Nicklaus, he threw a rubber snake that his daughter had put in his bag as a joke, at Nicklaus, who later admitted that he asked Trevino to throw it to him so he could see it. Trevino grabbed the rubbery object and playfully tossed it at Nicklaus, getting a scream from a nearby woman and a hearty laugh from Nicklaus. Trevino shot a 68 to defeat Nicklaus by three strokes. During one tournament, Tony Jacklin, paired with Trevino, said: \\"Lee, I don't want to talk today.\\" Trevino retorted: \\"I don't want you to talk. I just want you to listen.\\" After he was struck by lightning at the 1975 Western Open, Trevino was asked by a reporter what he would do if he were out on the course and it began to storm again. Trevino answered he would take out his 1 iron and point it to the sky, \\"because not even God can hit the 1-iron.\\" Trevino said later in an interview with David Feherty that he must have tempted God the week before by staying outside during a lightning delay to entertain the crowds, saying \\"I deserved to get hit...God can hit a 1-iron.\\" Trevino said: \\"I've been hit by lightning and been in the Marine Corps for four years. I've traveled the world and been about everywhere you can imagine.

Step 1: Assessing the Situation To kick off their joint operation, Australia and New Zealand are conducting thorough assessments of the Solomon Islands' current state. This involves analyzing crime rates, identifying areas most susceptible to violence and social unrest, and evaluating the weaknesses of existing law enforcement structures. Step 2: Providing Appropriate Aid Following the assessment, both countries will collaborate to supply the Solomon Islands with the necessary resources and support. This includes financial aid, personnel, equipment, and training for local law enforcement agencies. The primary aim is to empower these agencies by enabling them to effectively combat crime and maintain public order. Step 3: Strengthening Legal Institutions In order to promote long-term stability, Australia and New Zealand will work towards bolstering the Solomon Islands' legal framework. This involves assisting in the drafting of new laws, providing guidance on effective implementation, and collaborating to enhance the capacity of courts and other legal institutions. Step 4: Fostering Community Engagement A crucial aspect of restoring law and order involves engaging the local communities themselves. This includes open dialogues, awareness campaigns, and education programs that target the root causes of crime and social unrest. Encouraging community participation creates a sense of shared responsibility and gives locals a greater stake in their nation's future. Step 5: Monitoring and Evaluation Finally, Australia and New Zealand will constantly monitor the effectiveness of their joint efforts and make necessary adjustments to maximize their impact. The long-term success of this intervention hinges on continuous evaluation, learning, and adaptation to evolving circumstances within the Solomon Islands.

Using four-leaf clover laced holy water Jacob manages to banish the Leprechaun, summoning demonic hands which drag him underground, but soon after drops dead of injuries inflicted by the Leprechaun during the fight.One year later two down on their luck friends Emily Woodrow (Tangi Miller) and Lisa Duncan (Sherrie Jackson) have their fortune told when the clairvoyant Esmeralda (Donzaleigh Abernathy) who warns them that they will attain great wealth soon, but it must be denied as it will come at a great price and summon a terrible evil. While having a barbecue at the abandoned youth center construction site with Lisa, their stoner friend Jamie Davis (Page Kennedy) and her ex-boyfriend turned drug dealer Rory Jackson (Laz Alonso) Emily falls through a hole and discovers the Leprechaun's gold in an old tunnel where it was hidden by Father Jacob. Splitting up the gold (which is produced in a never ending amount by the chest it was contained in) evenly the quartet of friends use it to fulfill their fantasies, unaware that by taking the gold they have released the Leprechaun, who begins stalking the group (killing a guest who takes one of his coins at a party held by Jamie, prompting the police to temporarily arrest him). At the salon where Emily works the Leprechaun sneaks in and, after killing a regular customer, Doria, on the massage table by breaking her neck, attacks Emily, who barely escapes...

Summarize this article: Rita Maze, left, was abducted Sept. 6 at a rest stop near Wolf Creek and was found dead in the trunk of her car early Sept. 7. Her daughter, Rochelle Maze, right, said, \\"My mom touched every person she made contact with.\\" (Photo: Courtesy photo) Trapped in the trunk of her car on a terrifying trip from Montana to Washington, a kidnapped Rita Maze was able to make contact with her husband and daughter before she died. The Great Falls woman told her family at 10:25 p.m. Tuesday that “a large man in a black hoodie” hit her on the head and put her into a trunk of a car at a rest stop near Wolf Creek on Tuesday morning. She wasn’t even sure if she was in her car or not. Husband, Bob Maze, and daughter, Rochelle Maze, had police on the other line as they spoke to Maze in what would be her final hours. They relayed what she told them to police, but the information came too late. The Spokane County Sheriff’s Office discovered the 47-year-old’s body Wednesday in the trunk of her vehicle near the Spokane International Airport, 325 miles west of Wolf Creek, Lewis and Clark County Sheriff Leo Dutton said. Bob and Rochelle called Helena police about 8:20 p.m. Tuesday, saying that Maze was missing and that they suspected foul play. Bob had spoken to his wife at 11:25 a.m., and the family believes she was abducted a short time later. Buy Photo The northbound rest area at mile marker 222 on I-15, south of Wolf Creek is the possible site where Rita Maze was kidnapped on Tuesday, Sept. 6. Authorities searched this site, and the rest stop north of Wolf Creek for possible evidence. Based on what Maze told her family, authorities believe this rest stop was the scene of the crime. (Photo: TRIBUNE PHOTO/RION SANDERS) By 12:30 a.m. Wednesday, police had located her body. The cause of death has not been released. “She traveled with a gun, and she knew he had her gun, and she was terrified,” Rochelle said. “He kept her in the trunk for 12 hours.” Rochelle said her mom was hysterical, and she was hard to understand. She didn’t even know if there was more than one kidnapper. The conversation was only 10 minutes long. “I told her that I loved her,” Rochelle said fighting for every word through her tears. “That’s the last thing she heard.” The phone went dead or they lost a signal and were unable to reach each other again. “We do know that Rita was in Helena visiting her relatives earlier that day,” Dutton said. “She fueled up and was headed back to Great Falls and stopped at a rest area, which she thought was south of Craig some place,” Dutton said. Investigators believe the abduction occurred at a rest stop near Wolf Creek, which is south of Craig, Dutton said. Authorities searched for clues at two rest stops on Interstate 15 Wednesday, one on either side of Wolf Creek. Based on what Maze was able to relay to police, they believe the crime occurred at the more rustic rest stop, south of Wolf Creek, Dutton said. Wolf Creek is about 50 miles south of Great Falls on I-15. Helena police put out an attempt to locate the vehicle nationwide, and a license plate reader spotted the vehicle in Post Falls, Idaho, east of Spokane, Dutton said. Authorities were able to find the car by locating Maze’s cell phone. Dutton said there is a person of interest in the case and that authorities are looking at a surveillance video from a convenience store. Because of the interstate travel involved, the FBI is assisting in the investigation. FBI media spokesperson Sandra Barker said the federal law enforcement agency was working in conjunction with the Lewis and Clark County Sheriff’s Office but would not confirm FBI agents were investigating a specific person of interest connected to the murder. Investigators say the body of Rita Maze from Great Falls was found in the trunk of this car in Spokane after she was abducted at a rest stop in Wolf Creek. (Photo: KHQ Right Now photo) Maze’s body was in her car found in a parking lot in an industrial area in the 7600 block of West Geiger Boulevard, which is west of Spokane. “We had received some information that the car may be over here in our area,” said Deputy Mark Gregory of the Spokane County Sheriff’s Office. “So basically one of the agencies started pinging the cell phone, which helped us get an area to search and locate the vehicle.” Spokane County Sheriff’s Office major crimes detectives and Spokane County Forensics personnel were called to the scene to continue the investigative process, Gregory said. Maze worked for years as an aide, a crosswalk attendant and a head cook in Great Falls Public Schools. She was the “lunch lady” at Morningside from 2005 to 2009. “My mom touched every person she made contact with,” said Rochelle. “She considered herself a lifetime member of PTA with Bill Salonen.” “She, one, had such a positive presence,” said Bill Salonen, former principal at Morningside. Salonen said he had an expectation that if you served food or cleaned classrooms that you’d do more than that — you would also make connections with kids. “And really, Rita was the epitome of that,” Salonen said. “I could really trust that she was really going to take care of kids and build that trust.” After leaving Morningside, Maze worked at Peres Food Basket, then later worked for two years at B/E Aerospace. She decided to take some time off to spend time with family. “She loved her grandkids so much,” Rochelle said. Her granddaughters, Addyson, 4, and Carly, 1, are her son Michael’s children. Michael, a sergeant in the Air Force, is stationed in Germany. “Growing up, my mom was an amazing mom,” Rochelle said. She was the mom in the pool with the kids, taking them to picnics at parks. “She was fun loving and had an infectious smile and was goofy and a child at heart,” she said. “And she had fun all the time.” Read or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/2cChDEL ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

First, make sure you have everything you need: an iron, an ironing board, a clean and dry piece of clothing with a sleeve, and the patch you want to attach. 2. Now, lay the clothing with the sleeve flat on the ironing board so that you can easily work with it. 3. Place the patch on the sleeve where you want it to be. Make sure it is in the right position and straight. 4. Turn the iron on and set it to the right temperature for your clothing material. Give it a little time to get warm. 5. Carefully place a thin cloth, like a soft dishtowel, over the patch to protect it, but make sure you can still see its edges. 6. Gently press the iron down on the cloth and patch, moving it slowly around the edges and over the entire patch. Do this for about 20-30 seconds or as the patch instructions say. 7. Lift the iron and check if the patch has stuck to the sleeve. If it hasn't, press the iron on it again for a few more seconds. 8. Once the patch is nicely stuck to the sleeve, let the clothing cool down. And there you have it! You've successfully ironed a patch onto a sleeve. Remember to be extra careful when using the iron because it can be very hot, and always ask for help from a grown-up if you need it."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: Mr Duncan Smith, who quit days after the 2016 Budget, is urging the PM to postpone a plan to raise the income tax threshold to fund the move. In 2015, cuts to the Universal Credit \\"work allowance\\" were announced - reducing the amount people could earn before benefit payments were withdrawn. A government spokesperson said there were \\"no plans\\" to reverse the cuts. Universal Credit's single payment replaces six current benefits, including Jobseeker's Allowance (JSA) and Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). Mr Duncan Smith drove its introduction under the coalition government, although it was beset by delays, IT problems and an entire \\"reset\\" of the system, and was the subject of tensions between the Treasury and the DWP. He argues the cuts to work allowance cost people up to Â£1,000 as they move off benefits into work. Now a backbencher, he chairs the Centre for Social Justice which is making the call to reverse the cuts made by former chancellor George Osborne - who was sacked by Mrs May when she became prime minister in July. The CSJ is pointing to Mrs May's own words in her first speech as PM, in which she promised those who were \\"just managing\\" that \\"when it comes to taxes, we'll prioritise not the wealthy, but you\\". Mr Duncan Smith argued that higher earners would benefit most from raising the income tax threshold - something the government has pledged to do by 2020 - and said the money should be spent on those who were \\"just about managing\\" instead. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the former minister said: \\"One of the key elements as you cross into work, the work allowances, those were all reduced. The problem with that is it means it is more difficult to get people into work and keep them in work. \\"We want to get people into work, we want them to progress through work, but most importantly, we want to make sure work always pays.\\" He said raising the tax threshold for everyone would mean about 25p in every pound would end up with the lowest paid, while reversing the Universal Credit cuts was \\"a more direct way of delivering on Theresa May's statement, which was strong and powerful, to help those who try\\". The CSJ argues that Â£3.4bn cut from the Universal Credit budget by Mr Osborne would cost people up to Â£1,000 as they \\"transitioned\\" from Universal Credit into work, thereby undermining incentives to take a job and move off benefits. The government says Universal Credit work allowances have been simplified and people are getting extra help to move into work, as well as benefitting from increased tax allowances, childcare support and the National Living Wage. A spokesman for the DWP said: \\"There are no plans to revisit the work allowance changes announced in the budget last year. \\"Universal Credit is transforming lives with claimants moving into work faster and staying in work longer than under the old system.\\" Mr Duncan Smith also defended his work at the DWP, following the new film by Ken Loach, 'I, Daniel Blake', which tells the story of a joiner in north east England on benefits. Mr Loach appeared on BBC's Question Time on Thursday, criticising the system that tells \\"the most vulnerable people\\" that their poverty \\"is their own fault.\\" Mr Duncan Smith said he had \\"high regard\\" for Mr Loach but added: \\"Whilst on the one level this was a human story, full of pathos and difficulties, I think is the film has taken the very worst of anything that can ever happen to anybody and said 'this is life how it is lived'. I don't believe that \\"Also, his portrayal of job centre staff was unfair. Yes, you will always get one of two, but the vast, vast, vast majority are there to work and help people. This idea that everybody is out to crunch you has really hurt a lot of job centre staff.\\" Summary:","completion":"A former minister, Mr. Duncan Smith, wants the UK Prime Minister to delay a plan that raises income tax in order to help people with their jobs. He says that a plan from 2015 made things hard for people who wanted to work. The government says they won't change those decisions and that they are already helping lots of people with their jobs. A movie about problems with the system was talked about, but Mr. Duncan Smith thinks the movie shows the worst side of things and is not fair to the people who help with jobs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She had always thought that the Deadlands, a vast expanse of desolate and desecrated terrain, was nothing more than a place filled with the vengeful spirits of the deceased and ancient curses. However, Famine's words painted a picture of the Deadlands that was far different from the one Angelique had imagined. Intrigued by this newfound information, she asked Famine, \\"What is it like living in a cemetery? Aren't you afraid of the dead? And how do you manage to survive in such harsh conditions?\\" Famine chuckled softly, a smile creeping up on his face as he said, \\"Living in a cemetery is not as terrifying as you might think. Yes, it is home to the dead, but the spirits residing there are mostly harmless in nature. They have grown accustomed to our presence, so we coexist in relative peace. It's just like having unseen neighbors.\\" He continued, \\"The biggest challenge in the Deadlands is the environment. The lack of vegetation and water sources makes it difficult to find food and sustain ourselves. My family and I have developed unique ways to adapt to our surroundings. For example, we have learned to cultivate hardy plants that can survive in the arid conditions and created a system to collect rainwater during the scarce rainy season. In fact, living in the Deadlands has taught us the value of resourcefulness and working together as a family to overcome the challenges we face.\\" As Angelique listened to Famine's story, she couldn't help but feel a strange sense of fascination and respect. The life they led was undoubtedly tough and, in many ways, completely alien to her. Growing up in a bustling city, she had never experienced anything remotely similar to the kind of existence Famine and his family had carved out for themselves in the Deadlands. Looking at the cart again, Angelique now understood why the items it carried were so varied and peculiar. Famine and his family must have spent their lives collecting and repurposing whatever they could find in order to survive. Even the book she was holding must have been a precious resource to them. Handing the book back to Famine, Angelique found herself saying, \\"Your life sounds truly incredible. Thank you for sharing your story with me. I've learned that there is more to the Deadlands than I ever could have imagined.\\" Famine nodded, gently taking the book from her and placing it back in the cart. \\"Life in the Deadlands can be harsh, but it has also given me a deeper appreciation for the world around me and brought my family closer together. Every place, even the seemingly barren Deadlands, harbors secrets and wonders waiting to be discovered.\\" As Angelique and Famine continued their conversation, she felt her curiosity grow. She wanted to know more about the Deadlands and the fascinating way of life that Famine and his family had developed in order to thrive in the most inhospitable of terrains.

Despite the backlash, Daschle has stood his ground, defending the basis of his remarks. Step 1: Context of Daschle's Remarks Before delving into Daschle's defense, it's essential to provide context for his comments. At a panel discussion, he expressed concerns about the ongoing conflict in Iraq and questioned the U.S. government's approach towards the issue. Step 2: Criticism Received Following Daschle's remarks, he faced considerable backlash from his political opponents who accused him of undermining the government's efforts in Iraq. Some even claimed that his statements could potentially demoralize American troops stationed in the region. Step 3: Daschle's Defense In response to the criticism, Daschle defended his right to voice concerns about government policy, arguing that dissent and debate are fundamental components of a healthy democracy. He pointed out that questioning the government's actions does not equate to a lack of support for American troops risking their lives in Iraq. Instead, it demonstrates a vested interest in ensuring they are not placed in harm's way without adequate justification. Step 4: Reiteration of Key Concerns As part of his defense, Daschle reiterated his key concerns regarding Iraq, such as the lack of a clear exit strategy, the continued violence that plagues the region, and the drain on U.S. resources and manpower. He also addressed the potential long-term consequences of the conflict on both American soldiers' morale and the reputation of the United States as a whole. Step 5: Call to Action Daschle concluded his defense by emphasizing the need for a thorough debate on the Iraq issue, without fear of being labeled unpatriotic. He called for open discussions among lawmakers, military experts, and the general public, highlighting the importance of evaluating the government's approach and course of action in Iraq. Summary: Despite facing significant backlash for his critical comments on the situation in Iraq, former Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle remains resolute in defending his position. He maintains that questioning government policy is crucial to preserving a healthy democracy, and calls for open discussions to ensure the best possible outcome for American troops and the nation as a whole."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

As the can heats up, it may explode. The kinetic-molecular theory explains why. The air inside the rigid can of soup is given more kinetic energy by the heat coming from the campfire. The kinetic energy causes the air molecules to move faster and they impact the container walls more frequently and with more force. The increase in pressure inside may eventually exceed the strength of the can and it will explode. An additional factor is that the soup may begin boiling which will then aid even more gas and more pressure to the inside of the can.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Alien Trespass Context: It was a summer night in 1957 in the quiet California desert town of Mojave. Local astronomer Ted Lewis (Eric McCormack) is making a special anniversary dinner for his wife Lana (Jody Thompson). A local diner waitress, Tammy (Jenni Baird) is in her trailer painting a horse scene while Dick (Andrew Dunbar) and Penny (Sarah Smyth) are necking at lovers lane. All are watching the light show from the annual August Perseid meteor showers when suddenly there is a blinding light and crash into the butte just outside of town. Ted attempts to investigate but Lana prevails in keeping him home at least until she falls asleep and he can sneak out to the crash site. In the meantime we see a gruesome alien creature (The Ghota) leaving the spaceship to slip away into the night. Soon after, a tall alien in a silvery metallic suit (Urp) appears from the ship. When Ted arrives at the butte he does not discover a smoking red-hot meteorite but rather a flying saucer imbedded in the hillside with its ramp down. He cautiously enters the saucer and is snatched up by the mysterious silver alien.Townspeople soon start disappearing everywhere and the only remnant at the scene is a puddle of gurgling mud. Ted Lewis, having been body snatched by Urp, is now on the trail of the murderous Ghota. Urp, is actually a galactic Federal Marshal from another planet who was transporting the Ghota when his saucer crashed landed and the Ghota escaped. He needs to find and recapture the creature before it begins to divide or it will multiply exponentially until all life is consumed on planet Earth. After unsuccessfully trying to convince Lana to help him find the Ghota, Urp meets Tammy on the highway when she offers him a lift. Urp tries his best to convince Tammy of his plight and to help him track down the Ghota. But when they stop at an old derelicts cabin and find only a mud puddle of human remains, Tammy can take no more of the crazy talk and circumstances and leaves him in a huff.The teens, Dick & Penny, are on their own track encountering...

Does the sentence \\"Whereas most popular styles are usually written in song forms, classical music is noted for its development of highly sophisticated musical forms, like the concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera.\\" answer the question \\"The concerto, symphony, sonata and opera are examples of what type of musical forms?\\"","completion":"Yes, the given sentence does answer the question, \\"The concerto, symphony, sonata and opera are examples of what type of musical forms?\\" However, to provide a comprehensive and detailed explanation, we can further elaborate on the topic. The sentence states that, unlike most popular styles of music that are written in relatively simpler song forms, classical music is known for developing more complex and sophisticated musical forms. These sophisticated forms include the concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera. The concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera are examples of advanced classical music forms, each having distinct characteristics and structures: 1. Concerto: A concerto is a musical composition typically featuring a solo instrument accompanied by an orchestra. The solo instrument can be a violin, piano, or any other instrument, and the piece is usually composed of three movements – fast, slow, and fast. This form highlights the virtuosity and expressive capabilities of the soloist, as well as the contrasting textures between the soloist and the orchestra. 2. Symphony: A symphony is a large-scale orchestral composition, typically consisting of four movements that follow a specific structure. The first movement is usually fast and in sonata form, the second movement is slow and lyrical, the third movement is a dance-like minuet or scherzo, and the fourth movement is fast and energetic, often using a rondo or sonata form. The symphony allows composers to express a variety of emotions and ideas, showcasing the full potential of the orchestra. 3. Sonata: A sonata is a musical composition for a solo instrument (usually a keyboard instrument such as the piano) or for a solo instrument accompanied by a keyboard. It generally has three or four movements, structured similarly to symphonies. The sonata form plays a crucial role in the first movement, where the exposition, development, and recapitulation sections create a narrative arc that explores different themes and harmonic areas. 4. Opera: Opera is a dramatic art form that combines music, singing, acting, and sometimes dance to tell a story set to a musical score. Operas can vary in size and style, with compositions ranging from small chamber works to grand, full-scale productions. They are typically sung throughout, with solo vocal lines called arias, and other elements such as recitatives (a narrative style of singing), choruses, and orchestral interludes. Opera allows composers and performers to bring together various elements of drama and music to create a powerful and emotional storytelling medium. In conclusion, the given sentence answers the question by identifying the concerto, symphony, sonata, and opera as examples of sophisticated classical music forms. These forms represent the complexity and depth of classical music, setting it apart from more popular and simpler song forms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 1: Identify the subjects of the sentences Sentence 1: The black and white dog Sentence 2: A black man and his dog Both sentences involve a dog, which makes them somewhat similar. However, the first sentence specifically focuses on a black and white dog, while the second sentence involves a black man and his dog, with no mention of the dog's color. Based on this, the subject similarity is moderate. Step 2: Identify the actions of the subjects Sentence 1: The dog is swimming Sentence 2: (Implied) The black man and his dog are at the beach The actions are not directly mentioned in Sentence 2, but it can be assumed that the man and his dog are at the beach doing some activity. The actions depicted in each sentence are therefore not very similar. Step 3: Identify the locations Sentence 1: The river Sentence 2: The beach Both river and beach are natural bodies of water, making them somewhat similar. However, they're distinct water bodies with different characteristics. Based on these factors, I would rate the similarity between these sentences as a 2. The presence of a dog in both sentences makes them related, and the natural water bodies add a degree of similarity.

Title: The Italian Job Movie plot: John Bridger, a professional safecracker, has assembled a team to steal 35 million dollars worth of gold bullion from a safe held by Italian gangsters in Venice that had stolen it weeks earlier. The team includes Charlie Croker, a professional thief; Lyle, or Napster, a computer expert; Handsome Rob, their wheelman; Steve, their inside man; and Left Ear, their explosives expert. They successfully complete the theft by stealing the actual safe and stealing the gold from it after the safe lands underwater while the gangsters are occupied with a decoy led by Rob and Napster. After leaving the city, the team agrees to split up the gold and part ways once they return to the United States. However, Steve turns on them: in the Alps near Austrian border, he and his own men intercept their van on a bridge and take the gold. When John confronts him, Steve kills him. Rob drives the van into the lake off a bridge, where they keep themselves alive using oxygen tanks from the heist. Steve assumes they are dead and leaves with the gold. A year later, Charlie and the others have returned to the States and have located Steve under his new false identity, changing his last name to Frizelli, moving to Los Angeles and laundering the gold for money. Charlie goes to Philadelphia and meets with Stella Bridger, John's estranged daughter and also a skilled private safecracker working for the police, who is furious with him, believing that Charlie was responsible for the death of her father, but Charlie instead convinces her to help get revenge on Steve by helping with the heist to steal back the gold.

Answer the question: When observing reactants and their particles, Shane increases the temperature they're exposed to, noting that they now move faster or slower? A:","completion":"When observing reactants and their particles, as Shane increases the temperature they're exposed to, he would notice that they now move faster. The reason behind this phenomenon lies in the basic understanding of the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles present in the system. The kinetic energy is directly proportional to temperature. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases. This relationship can be expressed mathematically using the following formula: Kinetic energy (KE) = (1/2) * mass (m) * velocity^2 (v^2) Here, mass is the mass of a particle, and velocity is its speed. Temperature affects the kinetic energy of particles by increasing the velocity at which the particles move. As the temperature increases, the kinetic energy of the particles also increases, causing them to move faster. The faster-moving particles have more energy available to overcome the activation energy barrier, which is the minimum energy required to initiate a chemical reaction. In the context of chemical reactions, the increase in particle velocity (and, consequently, kinetic energy) has the following effects: 1. Increased collision frequency: Faster-moving particles collide more frequently with each other, thereby increasing the likelihood of reactions occurring between the reactants. 2. Enhanced reaction rate: As the number of collisions between reactant particles increases, the overall reaction rate also increases. This is because more of these collisions have the necessary energy to overcome the activation energy barrier, leading to a more significant number of successful reactions per unit of time. 3. Broader distribution of energy: At higher temperatures, the distribution of molecular energies becomes broader, resulting in a greater number of molecules possessing energy equal to or higher than the activation energy required for the reaction to occur. Therefore, when Shane increases the temperature of the reactants and observes their particles, he would see that they now move faster due to the increase in kinetic energy from the temperature rise. This would lead to more frequent collisions, a higher reaction rate, and a greater proportion of molecules with sufficient energy to participate in the reaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What happens if you trip while playing basketball? - sweat - dribbling - hurt yourself - fall down - make baskets The best answer is","completion":"If you trip while playing basketball, there could be several outcomes based on what aspect of the game you are referring to or the situation at the time of the trip: 1. Sweat: Tripping while playing could be a result of sweating a lot, as your hands might get slipped and you could lose balance. And the sweat drops on the floor could also make the floor slippery, leading to tripping incidents. This is why players often wipe their shoes and officials pause the game to wipe the floor in professional basketball games. 2. Dribbling: If you trip while dribbling the ball, this could result in you losing control of the ball. Additionally, your dribbling might be considered as a travel or double dribble, depending on how you've interacted with the ball during your fall, both are considered violations in the game and will result in loss of ball possession. 3. Hurt Yourself: Depending on how you fall, you could potentially hurt yourself. Injuries could range from minor ones, like scratches or bruises, to more serious injuries, like sprained ankles, knee injuries or even fractures. This is why it's always recommended to maintain good physical health, balance, and coordination to minimize the risk of falling or tripping during the game. 4. Fall Down: If you trip, naturally, you would fall down. This could disrupt the flow of the game, and depending on the force or the manner of the fall, it could potentially lead to serious injuries as mentioned above. 5. Make Baskets: If you're attempting a shot or a layup and trip in the process, it could affect the success of your shot. If you trip before you've released the ball, chances are your shot will fall short or go wayward. If the ball was already in the air when you tripped, it could still potentially be a successful basket. However, if your trip is due to a foul by an opposing player while shooting, you can get free throw attempts. In any case, tripping during a basketball game is considered a natural part of the sport, since it involves a lot of movements, quick turns, jumps, but is certainly something that players try to avoid for uninterrupted game play and for safety reasons."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The frame is the metal or carbon-fiber body of the bike, and, unlike the handlebars or seat (known as a \\"saddle\\"), it is not adjustable. Thus, buying the proper frame is the most important thing you can do when shopping for a bike. There is a variety of frames available on the market, but the frame shape generally changes based on the type of riding the bike is made for. Know, however, that there are as many different frame configurations as there are bike makers, each with \\"specialized\\" functions. However, the general shape of the bike helps determine its function more often than not: Road bikes are most often used by commuters, fitness, and racing fitness riding. The frames are usually large, isosceles (all sides the same length) triangles with a top bar, or top tube, that is parallel to the ground. Racing bikes usually have smaller frames, while touring or commuter bikes often have larger frames. Road bike frame sizes are measured in centimeters. Mountain bikes have a lower center of gravity to keep you on balance riding over roots, rocks, and mud on the trail. The center triangle is more compact, with the top tube sometimes angling down, away from the handlebars. Mountain bike frame sizes are measured in inches. Hybrid bikes combine features of road and mountain bikes. You can use these for both street riding and casual trail riding. These frames are usually measured in centimeters. Cruiser bikes have odd, sideways S-shaped or curved frames that allow you to sit nearly upright while riding. The handlebars are high above the seat and the pedals slightly in front of you so that you comfortably cruise around town. Sometimes called \\"city bikes\\" or \\"commuter bikes,\\" these are made for short distances. Fitting these bikes is less about measurements than pure comfort on a test ride. Kids bikes have smaller frames similar to mountain bikes, helping them keep their balance with a lower center of gravity. They are very adjustable to compensate for quickly growing kids. They are usually measured by wheel size. Stand with your feet 6 inches apart, then measure from the inside of your foot up to your crotch, where your leg meets your waist. Think of the seam on the inside of a pair of jeans. You need to measure the distance from the bottom of your foot to where your seat should be. If you are sizing a mountain bike, measure in inches. If you are sizing a road bike, measure in centimeters. For the most precise measurement: Take a thick, hardcover book and \\"sit\\" on the spine as if it was your bike seat. Still standing, measure to the top of the book from the floor. Multiply your inseam measurement, in centimeters, by .67 to get your suggested seat tube (bar reaching from seat to pedals) length. The seat tube is usually, though not always, measured from the top of the tube to the center point of the crankshaft. Know that this measurement is simply a starting point -- you will likely need to make specific adjustments later on. Multiply your inseam (in inches) by .67, then subtract 4\\" from the answer to get the length of your top tube. Use the top-tube for your measurement when possible if you are a mountain biker, as seat tube (pedals to seat) measurements are tricky and change from manufacturer to manufacturer. For example, if you have a 33 inch inseam, you would need a 17.5\\" top tube (17.75\\" tubes are hard to find):33\\" x .67 = 21.75\\" 21.75\\" - 4\\" = 17.75 Some mountain bikers prefer to measure by seat tube length, like road bikers. If your bike shop gives frame size by seat tube length, take your inseam and multiply it by .185. The resulting number is the recommended distance between your seat and the middle of the crankshaft, which is the circular piece the pedal rotates on. Most kid bikes are adjustable, accommodating random growth spurts so you don't need to buy a new bike every year. That said, a child's bike should still fit them so they can put their feet flat on the ground while they’re sitting on the saddle. For a child's inseam of 12-17 inches: 12-inch wheels For a child's inseam of 18-22 inches: 16-inch wheels For a child's inseam of 22-25 inches: 20-inch wheels The height of the seat is easily modified on a bike to fit you, and the right size frame will feel wrong if the seat isn't high enough. You want to have it raised so that, on the bottom of your pedal stroke (one foot is at the lowest point), your knee is slightly bent, not straight. Have a friend or someone at the bike shop hold the bike in place while you get on. Pedal backward, stopping with one foot at the very bottom of the pedal's rotation, and adjust your seat height so that it is slightly bent. It is very rare that the last person who tested the bike needed the same seat height as you, so you must adjust this before knowing if the frame is the wrong size. Make sure you are not shifting or dropping your hips with each pedal stroke, as this will make your foot drop lower than it should and result in an improper fit. Straddle the top tube of the bike with your feet shoulder width apart. Grab the stem that connects to the handlebars with one hand and the seat with the other hand. Pull the frame up against your pelvic bone. Have a friend measure the distance between the ground and the wheels. A road bike should only have 1–2 in (2.5–5.1 cm) of space between the wheels and ground. If not, then you need a bigger frame. A mountain bike should have 3–4 in (7.6–10.2 cm) of space beneath the tires. If it’s any more or less, change the frame size. Everyone's body is a little different, and the proportions of your arms, legs, and torso might mean you need a different frame to feel comfortable. Use your inseam measurements to get a starting frame size, then go to a local bike shop and test it out. Then test out a size bigger and size smaller. If you are in between sizes that both feel comfortable, think about your riding style: Smaller bikes are generally lighter and a bit more maneuverable. However, this difference is negligible, and you might not be able to adjust the bike a size if you find yourself uncomfortable later on. Many mountain bikers and racers opt for the smaller frame. Larger bikes can make you reach a bit too far, but you can often raise and lower the handlebars to a greater degree, allowing you better customization options if you decide you need a better fit further down the road. Many road bikers chose the larger bike for a more comfortable fit. Most bicycle stores will help you determine the best size for your comfort and needs. They will take measurements for you and let you test out different types of bikes. If you don't want to size your bike yourself, this is a quick and easy option. Everyone is different, so if you don't feel comfortable riding a bike the \\"should\\" fit you, you need to get it re-sized. Test a few different frame sizes before buying, and feel free to play with the seat and handlebars until you find your sweet spot. Rent a few bikes before buying so that you can get 2-3 days of riding in. Talk to you local bike staff, even if you might buy a bike online. Let them know about any specific issues you've had and possible reasons. Summary:","completion":"1. Identify the type of bike you need (road, mountain, hybrid, cruiser, kids) based on your intended usage. 2. Measure your inseam in centimeters or inches, depending on the type of bike you're purchasing. 3. Calculate your suggested seat tube or top tube length using the formulas provided. 4. For kids' bikes, match the child's inseam to the appropriate wheel size. 5. Adjust the seat height so that your knee is slightly bent when the pedal is at the lowest point. 6. Check the clearance between the top tube and your crotch when straddling the bike (1-2 inches for road bikes and 3-4 inches for mountain bikes). 7. Test different frame sizes, considering whether you prefer a smaller or larger frame. 8. Consult with bicycle store staff for personalized recommendations and assistance. 9. Test ride several bikes and sizes before making a final decision, and consider renting a bike to get more experience on it. 10. Always prioritize comfort and personal preferences when selecting a bike frame size."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write an article based on this \\"(Close): Wall Street closed higher on Thursday after being under duress this week through uncertainty about the UK referendum.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Wall Street Makes a Comeback amidst Brexit Uncertainty and Market Struggles Introduction Following a turbulent week due to uncertainty about the outcome of the UK referendum, Wall Street showed signs of recovery on Thursday. With investors eagerly watching, the stock market appeared to bounce back, demonstrating the resilience and ability to rebound amid the plethora of factors that influence market behavior. The positive trend can be attributed to a number of global developments, market analysis, and speculation regarding the anticipated referendum results. Global Developments Shaping Wall Street Economic and political uncertainties have been pervasive during the week leading up to the UK referendum. Investors have been paying close attention to the potential implications of the Brexit decision, as the event has a significant bearing on global economic stability. The heightened tensions and fear of a global recession have led to volatile market fluctuations, particularly in the European and US stock markets. Recent polls have suggested that the 'Remain' campaign appears to be gaining momentum, offering a glimmer of hope that the UK may choose to stay a part of the European Union. This has had a positive impact on market sentiment, giving Wall Street a much-needed boost in morale. The result is a more optimistic outlook from investors, generating increased interest in stocks and driving the market upward. Another significant development that has played a crucial role in the shifting market trend is the Federal Reserve's decision to maintain interest rates at current levels, instead of increasing them as planned earlier. This, along with the prospect of the UK remaining in the EU, injected a dose of confidence into the financial market, making it more appealing for investors. Market Analysis and Expert Opinions In the midst of market volatility, expert opinions and analysis become increasingly influential in shaping investor behavior. Prior to Wall Street's strong performance on Thursday, several experts had speculated that the tumultuous environment was a temporary phase and would not lead to long-term damage to the stock market. This optimistic prediction, along with improving global circumstances, has contributed to the turnaround witnessed in the market's performance. Furthermore, the resilience of the US economy has played a pivotal role in the market's recovery. Ongoing economic growth and a robust labor market have helped alleviate the concerns surrounding Brexit to a certain extent. Moreover, the economic fundamentals have led to confidence in the long-term potential of the market despite short-term fluctuations. Looking Ahead While Thursday's market surge can be seen as a positive turnaround in the right direction, the outcome of the UK referendum is still uncertain. Market analysts have maintained a cautious approach, reminding investors that a victory for the 'Leave' campaign could trigger a wave of selling and potentially send financial markets into a spiral. Nonetheless, Wall Street's ability to bounce back under pressure demonstrates its resilience and indicates that further global developments will continue to shape its performance. In the coming days and weeks, Wall Street will likely remain under intense scrutiny, as experts and investors alike assess the ongoing impact of the UK referendum result on global stocks and the economy at large. Conclusion Wall Street's positive closing on Thursday serves as a reminder of the market's ability to adapt and respond to changing global circumstances. Despite the stress it faced due to Brexit woes, it managed to demonstrate encouraging signs of recovery and resilience. Even as uncertainty lingers over the UK referendum's outcome, investors can take comfort in the fact that the stock market has a history of weathering turbulent times, and with the right mix of events, analysis, and speculation, will continue to remain a key player in the global financial sphere."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In late 2011, factory-gate prices for crystalline-silicon photovoltaic modules dropped below the 1.00/W mark. The 1.00/W installed cost, is often regarded in the PV industry as marking the achievement of grid parity for PV. These reductions have taken many stakeholders, including industry analysts, by surprise, and perceptions of current solar power economics often lags behind reality.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Science fiction (often shortened to SF, sci-fi or scifi) is a genre of speculative fiction, typically dealing with imaginative concepts such as futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. Science fiction often explores the potential consequences of scientific and other innovations, and has been called a \\"literature of ideas.\\" It usually avoids the supernatural, and unlike the related genre of fantasy, historically science fiction stories were intended to have a grounding in science-based fact or theory at the time the story was created, but this connection is now limited to hard science fiction. - Amazing Stories is an American science fiction magazine launched in April 1926 by Hugo Gernsback's Experimenter Publishing. It was the first magazine devoted solely to science fiction. Science fiction stories had made regular appearances in other magazines, including some published by Gernsback, but \\"Amazing\\" helped define and launch a new genre of pulp fiction. - Hugo Gernsback (August 16, 1884 August 19, 1967), born Hugo Gernsbacher, was a Luxembourgish-American inventor, writer, editor, and magazine publisher, best known for publications including the first science fiction magazine. His contributions to the genre as publisher were so significant that, along with the novelists H. G. Wells and Jules Verne, he is sometimes called \\"The Father of Science Fiction\\". In his honour, annual awards presented at the World Science Fiction Convention are named the \\"Hugos\\". - Lloyd Arthur Eshbach (June 20, 1910 October 29, 2003) was an American science fiction fan, publisher and writer, secular and religious publisher, and minister. - Experimenter Publishing was an American media company founded by Hugo Gernsback in 1915. The first magazine was \\"The Electrical Experimenter\\" (19131931) and the most notable magazines were \\"Radio News\\" (19191985) and \\"Amazing Stories\\" (19262005). Their radio station, WRNY, began broadcasting experimental television in 1928. In early 1929 the company was forced into bankruptcy and the Gernsback brothers lost control of Experimenter Publishing. The magazines did not miss an issue and were quickly sold to another publisher. The Gernsbacks promptly started new magazines to compete with their former ones. - Edward Elmer Smith (also E. E. Smith, E. E. Smith, Ph.D., E. E. \\"Doc\\" Smith, Doc Smith, \\"Skylark\\" Smith, orto his familyTed; May 2, 1890 August 31, 1965) was an American food engineer (specializing in doughnut and pastry mixes) and an early science-fiction author, best known for the \\"Lensman\\" and \\"Skylark\\" series. He is sometimes called the father of space opera. - Time travel is the concept of movement (such as by a human) between certain points in time, analogous to movement between different points in space, typically using a hypothetical device known as a time machine, in the form of a vehicle or of a portal connecting distant points in time. Time travel is a recognized concept in philosophy and fiction, but traveling to an arbitrary point in time has a very limited support in theoretical physics, and usually only in conjunction with quantum mechanics or wormholes, also known as Einstein-Rosen bridges. In a more narrow sense, one-way time travel into the future via time dilation is a well-understood phenomenon within the frameworks of special relativity and general relativity, but advancing a large amount of time is not feasible with current technology. The concept was touched upon in various earlier works of fiction, but was popularized by H. G. Wells' 1895 novel \\"The Time Machine\\", which moved the concept of time travel into the public imagination, and it remains a popular subject in science fiction. - Skylark Three is a science fiction novel by author Edward E. Smith , Ph.D. , the second in his Skylark series . Originally serialized through the Amazing Stories magazine in 1930 , it was first collected in book form in 1948 by Fantasy Press . - Fantasy Press was an American publishing house specialising in fantasy and science fiction titles. Established in 1946 by Lloyd Arthur Eshbach in Reading, Pennsylvania, it was most notable for publishing the works of authors such as Robert A. Heinlein and E. E. Smith. One of its more notable offerings was the Lensman series.

Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What was the nickname of Avril Coleridge-Taylor's father?","completion":"Samuel Coleridge-Taylor, Avril Coleridge-Taylor's father, was a notable and influential British composer, conductor, and music professor during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. He is best known for his choral and orchestral works, including the highly successful and frequently performed \\"Hiawatha's Wedding Feast\\" from his cantata trilogy \\"The Song of Hiawatha.\\" His music is often characterized by its inclusion of African and African-American cultural themes, as a reflection of his heritage and identity. Samuel Coleridge-Taylor was affectionately nicknamed \\"The Black Mahler\\" or \\"The African Mahler.\\" This moniker was derived from his comparison to the widely renowned Austrian composer Gustav Mahler. The nickname is a testament to Samuel Coleridge-Taylor's tremendous talent, skill, and impact on classical music, as Gustav Mahler is viewed as one of the most preeminent composers in the history of Western classical music. Samuel's daughter, Avril Coleridge-Taylor, followed in her father's footsteps and pursued a career in music. She became an accomplished pianist, composer, and conductor, and went on to teach at the Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music and Dance in London, the same institution where her father also taught. Avril Coleridge-Taylor played a significant role in preserving her father's musical legacy and promoting his works after his untimely death in 1912.

I read this background article the other day: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. I am facing a new situation today: Archimedes was a great scientist. He was also a great inventor of machines. He once said that if he could stand somewhere, he could move the earth with his machine. Hearing that, king of Sicily called Archimedes and his fellow scientist Ptolemy to come up with great inventions. Archimedes, as everyone expected, came up with a great machine. But Ptolemy couldn't do much in such a limited time. So, his device was not a machine. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Whose device would have less distance for applied force, Archimedes or Ptolemy? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to consider the fundamental concept of machines: they make work easier by altering the force, distance, or direction of the applied force, while not changing the amount of work done. In the given situation, Archimedes has designed a great machine, while Ptolemy's device is not considered a machine. Since machines alter the force or distance required to achieve the same work, we can deduce that Archimedes' machine should either increase the force and decrease the distance, or decrease the force and increase the distance over which the force is applied. On the other hand, Ptolemy's device is not a machine, which means it does not have the ability to redistribute force, distance, or direction. Consequently, Ptolemy's device would require more direct effort, implying that he would need to apply more force over a longer distance to accomplish the same work as Archimedes' machine. Given this information, we can conclude that Archimedes' device would likely have less distance for applied force compared to Ptolemy's device. This is because Archimedes' machine should be designed to increase efficiency by either decreasing the distance while increasing the force or vice versa. In contrast, Ptolemy's device, as it is not a machine, would not provide the same level of efficiency and would therefore require more effort (force and distance) to achieve the same work."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

NEIL CAVUTO, HOST OF \\"YOUR WORLD\\": All right, we are just getting word now that the U.S. has evacuated all personnel from Benghazi to Tripoli. The Tripoli embassy itself reduced to emergency staffing only, in light of the killing of our ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, as they try to get to the bottom of what happened here in a state that seems to be just a mess right now. Kentucky Republican Senator Rand Paul. Senator, the growing debate is whether that state deserves any more money from us. What do you say? SEN. RAND PAUL, R-KY.: Not one penny. I wouldn't send them a penny until they can guarantee that our embassy can be protected, until they've turned over who committed this atrocity. I want to know where the RPGs came from. We got rocket-propelled grenades used here. They didn't make them in Libya. I want to know if they came from another government or if they were left over from Qaddafi. And I want to know who did this and I want them turned over to our FBI. But it's inexcusable. In our country, if an embassy were attacked of any country, we would defend that embassy. We would should thousands of troops there immediately. Apparently, there were warnings in Egypt and they said the mobs coming. But they didn't send soldiers. They just said the mobs coming, get ready. It's inexcusable. CAVUTO: You have also expressed doing the same that is USA aid to Pakistan, if in fact they end up arresting or worse this doctor who helped identify the whereabouts of Usama bin Laden in his compound, where we ultimately succeeded in gunning him down. So is there something going on in the entire region -- we talk about Egypt as well -- that we should just go slow on just pouring money, good money after bad here? You know, we had something called the Arab spring. And I am not sure what the conclusion of the Arab spring is and I';m not sure if we are better or worse off. Democracy in the Middle East is sometimes bringing people into power who really don't like America. We have given billions upon billions of dollars to these countries. And my question is, if you want to be an ally of America, act like it. But if you're not going to act like an ally of ours and you are going to disparage us, if you're going to kill our ambassador, should we be giving you any taxpayer money? Not to mention the fact that we don't have any money and we've got to borrow it from China to send it to Libya, to send it to Egypt, to send it to Pakistan. And these countries disrespect us and then they put our friends in jail, Dr. Afridi. So, I'm still fighting this on the floor. I am filibustering all legislation right now. I'm objecting to any legislation in the Senate. And I'll do everything I can to stop any votes from occurring until we vote on this, because the American people are sick and tired of sending their money to two-bit tinhorn dictators who don't like us.

Article: The relationship between genes can be measured by comparing the sequence alignment of their DNA.:7.6 The degree of sequence similarity between homologous genes is called conserved sequence. Most changes to a gene's sequence do not affect its function and so genes accumulate mutations over time by neutral molecular evolution. Additionally, any selection on a gene will cause its sequence to diverge at a different rate. Genes under stabilizing selection are constrained and so change more slowly whereas genes under directional selection change sequence more rapidly. The sequence differences between genes can be used for phylogenetic analyses to study how those genes have evolved and how the organisms they come from are related. Now answer this question: What does comparing the sequence alignment of genes' DNA measure?","completion":"Comparing the sequence alignment of genes' DNA measures the relationship between genes.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: A simple piece of clothesline hangs between some environmentally friendly Americans and their neighbors. On one side stand those who see clothes dryers as a waste of energy and a major polluter of the environment.As a result, they are turning to clotheslines as part of the \\"what-I-can-do environmentalism.\\" On the other side are people who are against drying clothes outside, arguing that clotheslines are unpleasant to look at.They have persuaded Homeowners Associations (HOAs) access the U.S.to ban outdoor clotheslines, because clothesline drying also tends to lower home value in the neighborhood. This has led to a Right-to-Dry Movement that is calling for laws to be passed to protect people's right to use clotheslines.So far, only three states have laws to protect clothesline.Right-to-Dry supporters argue that there should be more. Matt Reck, 37, is the kind of eco-conscious person who feeds his trees with bathwater and reuses water drops from his air conditioners to water plants.His family also uses a clothesline.But on July 9, 2007, the HOA in Wake Forest, North Carolina, told him that a dissatisfied neighbor had telephoned them about his clothesline.The Recks paid no attention to the warning and still dried their clothes on a line in the yard.\\"Many people say they are environmentally friendly but they don't take matters into their own hands,\\" says Reck.The local HOA has decided not to take any action, unless more neighbors come to them. North Carolina lawmakers are saying that banning clotheslines is not the right thing to do.But HOAs and housing businesses believe that clothesline drying reminds people of poor neighborhoods.They worry that if buyers think their future neighbors can't even afford dryers, housing prices will fall. Environmentalists say such worries are not necessary, and in view of global warming, that idea needs to change.As they say, \\"The clothesline is beautiful.Hanging clothes outside should be encouraged.We all have to do at least something to slow down the process of global warming.\\" Question: Who are in favor of clothesline drying?

Here are the steps to solve for w: Step 1: Let's start by isolating the term with w on one side of the equation by adding 6 to both sides of the equation. We do this to cancel out the -6 on the right side. -48 + 6 = 14w - 6 + 6 This simplifies to: -42 = 14w. Step 2: Next, to isolate w, we will divide both sides of the equation by 14. (-42) / 14 = 14w / 14 This simplifies to: w = -42 / 14 Step 3: Simplify the right side of the equation to get the value of w. w = -3 So, the solution to the equation is w = -3.

John wanted to revisit Aristotle's theory of tetrapods. To that end, he chose two tetrapods, tetA and tetB. An adult tetA was heavier than an adult tetB. Moreover, a tetA had longer gestation period than tetB. He needed to figure out how their characteristics fit Aristotle's theory. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB? Hint: From the data he collected and documented, Aristotle inferred quite a number of rules relating the life-history features of the live-bearing tetrapods (terrestrial placental mammals) that he studied. Among these correct predictions are the following. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass, so that an elephant has fewer young (usually just one) per brood than a mouse. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass, so that elephants live longer than mice, have a longer period of gestation, and are heavier. As a final example, fecundity decreases with lifespan, so long-lived kinds like elephants have fewer young in total than short-lived kinds like mice.","completion":"To determine which tetrapod would have more offsprings in their lifetime, tetA or tetB, we need to consider Aristotle's theory based on the information provided: 1. Brood size decreases with (adult) body mass. 2. Lifespan increases with gestation period, and also with body mass. 3. Fecundity decreases with lifespan. Now let's analyze the information given: - An adult tetA is heavier than an adult tetB. - A tetA has a longer gestation period than tetB. Considering these factors, we can infer that: 1. Since tetA is heavier, it likely has a smaller brood size compared to tetB (according to rule 1). 2. TetA has a longer gestation period, which means it could have a longer lifespan compared to tetB (according to rule 2). 3. If tetA has a longer lifespan, its fecundity (number of offsprings) would be lower compared to tetB (according to rule 3). Based on Aristotle's theory and the information provided, it can be concluded that tetB would have more offsprings in their lifetime compared to tetA."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Another possible benefit of aggregation is to protect against predation by group anti-predator behavior. Many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, thus reducing the fitness of an individual living in smaller groups. One striking example of such shared vigilance is exhibited by meerkats. Meanwhile, other species move in synchrony to confuse and avoid predators such as schools of sardines and flocks of starlings. The confusion effect that this herding behavior would have on predators will be more effective when more individuals are present.Cooperative feeding I am facing a new situation today: In the sub-Saharan African country of Nigeria, there are two main species that tend to travel in groups. The antelope tend to travel in groups in high numbers, and thus exhibit a high density. Meanwhile, the bison tend to travel in groups of small numbers, and therefore exhibit low density. Both the antelope and the bison have natural predators that exist in Nigeria. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Individuals from which species, the antelope or the bison, will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the characteristics of the antelope and bison populations in Nigeria, it can be inferred that individuals from the bison species will have higher rates of predator vigilance behavior. The background article discusses the benefits of aggregation in terms of protection against predation. It mentions that many species exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior per individual at lower density. In the context of the new situation in Nigeria, the antelope travel in groups of high numbers, exhibiting a high density, while the bison travel in smaller groups, exhibiting low density. Since the bison have a lower density, it can be inferred that they are likely to exhibit higher per-individual rates of predator vigilance behavior. This increased vigilance might result in less time and energy spent on foraging, potentially reducing the fitness of an individual bison living in smaller groups. On the other hand, the antelope, which travel in larger groups with higher density, might benefit from the confusion effect mentioned in the background article. With more individuals present in the group, their herding behavior can create confusion for predators and enhance the group's overall anti-predator defense. The higher density might also allow the antelope to spend more time on foraging and reduce the per-individual vigilance behavior necessary for detecting and avoiding predators. In conclusion, individuals from the bison species, with their smaller group sizes and lower density, are likely to exhibit higher rates of predator vigilance behavior compared to the antelope individuals that tend to travel in larger groups with higher density in Nigeria."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: Starting next month, Marines at Camp Pendleton and other bases will be subject to random Breathalyzer tests twice a year under what is billed as the toughest anti-drinking policy in the U.S. military. An order issued last week by Lt. Gen. R.E. Milstead Jr., deputy commandant for manpower and reserve affairs, calls for any Marine or sailor who tests positive at .01% or higher to be referred for counseling. Any Marine or sailor who tests .04% or higher will be referred to medical personnel to determine their fitness for duty. Milstead's order notes that while the new order \\"is primarily for deterrence and education,\\" nothing precludes commanders from handing out punishment. Each unit will have a staff non-commissioned officer to act as the alcohol screening program coordinator. In California, a driver with .08% blood alcohol is considered drunk, and his or her driver's license is immediately suspended. A single drink can lead to a positive test of .01%. In September, a study by the U.S. Institute of Medicine, sponsored by the Department of Defense, found that binge drinking among military personnel in all branches has increased. In 1998, 35% of personnel admitted to binge drinking in the previous year. In 2008, the last year for which statistics were available, that figure had risen to 47%. Noting that \\"alcohol has long been part of military culture,\\" the study's authors, including professors from USC and UC San Francisco, called for better leadership from the top of the chain of command in curbing excess drinking. Among the recommendations was \\"routine screening for excessive alcohol consumption.\\" ALSO: L.A. Now Live: NASA debunks Dec. 21 'end of the world' fears Northridge shooting victim’s family angry suspect wasn't in prison L.A. gun buyback day next week: Mayor, LAPD announce locations -- Tony Perry in San Diego ||||| The Marine Corps‘ new on-duty standard for drinking alcohol is so strict that less than one drink at lunch would trigger a “positive” and get a warrior in hot water. The Washington Times reported earlier this week that the Corps sent a Dec. 12 message to commanders officially beginning mandatory breath tests for all 197,000 Marines twice each year. A reading of just .01 percent subjects a Marine to counseling. A Marine who registers a .04 must be examined by medical staff for fitness for duty. The Corps is the first among the Army, Air Force and Navy to begin random mandatory testing of all personnel. The Army leaves test decisions up to a commander and prohibits a blood alcohol content (BAC) at .05 percent or higher. The Air Force also instructs commanders to order alcohol tests when appropriate but has no compulsory program. The Navy said last March it plans to conduct mandatory breath tests. A spokeswoman says the program will not start until next year. Overall, this makes the new Corps anti-alcohol testing the military’s strictest. The Marine memo calls a “positive test result” a reading of .01 or greater, which results in automatic “screening and treatment as appropriate.” “I think it’s outrageously low,” said Neal Puckett, a defense attorney and retired Marine Corps judge advocate. “Guess it’s zero tolerance for alcohol just like the zero tolerance for drugs.” “No one would be impaired at a 0.01 alcohol concentration,” said Bruce Goldberger, a University of Florida professor and a renowned forensic toxicologist, to The Times. For an average-size man of 150 pounds, one drink would register a .02 reading, Mr. Goldberger said. For an average woman, he said, a single drink would result in a .03. “So if you look at a scenario where someone in the Marine Corps goes to a bar and drinks two drinks, that would give him a BAC of a .04,” he said. “It would take him about two to three hours to clear the alcohol in the bloodstream.” “It’s possible if a Marine goes to a bar and is drinking a substantial amount of alcohol over the course of an evening, and he gets himself to a BAC of 1.5 or 2.0, if they are tested first thing in the morning when they report to duty, they may still have some alcohol in their blood and test positive,” he added. Mr. Goldberger, who is director of toxicology at the university’s Department of Pathology, said various breath testers, often referred to as “Breathalyzers,” are reliable and accurate. He said any Marine picked for a random test who has recently gargled with mouthwash should be given 20 minutes or so to let the alcohol disappear before blowing into the machine. A reading of .01 “is very low,” he said, meaning the Marine Corps must ensure that the breath testers it uses can discern a “negative” score from a minimal reading. Mr. Goldberger said the “industry standard” is generally .02 for employees, a less strict measurement than the Corps‘. Marine spokeswoman Maj. Shawn Haney told The Times that the Corps conducted pilot random testing from May to October at three locations, including the Marine Barracks in Washington, D.C. Of 797 Marines tested, 99.99 passed, she said. A Corps statement said: “Breathalyzer testing will enable commanders to test 100 percent of the Marines in their unit in order to take appropriate actions related to the health and safety of Marines such as training, education and referral to substance abuse counseling.” The Marine Corps did not respond to a question from The Times on why it chose .01 as a “positive” reading requiring corrective action. Army regulations say an on-duty soldier with .05 BAC or more is subject to discipline under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and can receive a less-than-honorable discharge. Commanders may set limits below .05 and bar alcohol consumption altogether on deployment. “Someone who blows a .05 while on duty could potentially be not fit for duty since there are effects of alcohol even at low levels,” said Mr. Goldberger, who was a key defense witness in the acquittal of former Major League pitcher Roger Clemens on charges he lied about taking performance enhancing drugs. A blood-alcohol content of .08 — which means eight one-hundredths of 1 percent of the blood by volume is alcohol — is the U.S. standard for drunkenness while driving. Concentration, reasoning, depth perception and other skills can be impaired by a blood-alcohol content lower than .08. The armed forces for years have required mandatory drug testing. The services have wrestled with the idea of doing to same for alcohol given the belief that domestic violence and sexual assaults are often rooted in excessive drinking. In September, in a study requested by the Pentagon, the Institute of Medicine, part of the National Academy of Sciences, concluded drug and alcohol abuse by military personnel constitutes a “public health crisis” and “both are detrimental to force readiness and psychological fitness.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"Starting next month, the Marines at some US bases will have random breathalyzer tests twice a year. This new rule is the toughest anti-drinking policy in the US military. If a Marine or sailor tests positive at .01% or higher, they will be referred for counseling. If they test .04% or higher, they will be referred to medical personnel to check their fitness for duty. In the US, an alcohol level of .08% in a driver's blood is considered drunk, and their driver's license is taken away. Binge drinking among military personnel in all branches has increased, so this new rule is to help reduce excess drinking and keep people safe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The French have always wanted to know what it means to be a French­man. Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

Owen's review of the Origin in the April 1860 Edinburgh Review bitterly attacked Huxley, Hooker and Darwin, but also signalled acceptance of a kind of evolution as a teleological plan in a continuous \\"ordained becoming\\", with new species appearing by natural birth. Others that rejected natural selection, but supported \\"creation by birth\\", included the Duke of Argyll who explained beauty in plumage by design. Since 1858, Huxley had emphasised anatomical similarities between apes and humans, contesting Owen's view that humans were a separate sub-class. Their disagreement over human origins came to the fore at the British Association for the Advancement of Science meeting featuring the legendary 1860 Oxford evolution debate. In two years of acrimonious public dispute that Charles Kingsley satirised as the \\"Great Hippocampus Question\\" and parodied in The Water-Babies as the \\"great hippopotamus test\\", Huxley showed that Owen was incorrect in asserting that ape brains lacked a structure present in human brains. Others, including Charles Lyell and Alfred Russel Wallace, thought that humans shared a common ancestor with apes, but higher mental faculties could not have evolved through a purely material process.

After this, the lands of the Susquehanna valley were under the nominal control of the Iroquois, who encouraged displaced tribes from the east to settle there, including the Shawnee and Lenape (or Delaware).On November 5, 1768, the British acquired land, known in Pennsylvania as the New Purchase, from the Iroquois in the Treaty of Fort Stanwix; this included what is now Ricketts Glen State Park.

Answer the following question: SEOUL — The U.S. and South Korea remain united in pursing a diplomatic solution to end the North Korean nuclear threat, but their national security priorities may differ over what would be the role of the U.S. military in Korea after a denuclearization deal is reached. “That is going to be the moment of truth, so to speak, when the United States and South Korea will have to agree on what kind of security alliance we want to maintain moving forword,” said Go Myong-Hyun, a North Korea analyst at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday revived the June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, eight days after canceling it. Trump said he was convinced of Kim’s commitment to denuclearization by the renewed diplomatic talks that included a visit to Washington by Kim Yong Chol, the North’s former intelligence chief, who carried a letter from the North Korean leader. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has been influential in facilitating the U.S.-North Korea summit, in getting Kim to agree to the broad goal of denuclearization, and in urging Trump to stay committed to the diplomatic process to resolve differences with North Korea. President Trump seems to be leaning now towards Moon’s approach versus the more confrontational stance advocated by some of his security team in demanding that North Korea unilaterally and completely disarm before any concessions are granted. Friday Trump downplayed expectations for a major breakthrough at the summit, saying it will be the beginning of a process. He also backed away from his “maximum pressure” approach that stressed tough sanctions and the threat of military force, focusing instead on brokering an agreement to end the North’s nuclear program for economic aid and security guarantees that could include a peace treaty to replace the armistice that ended the Korean War in 1953.

Mexico's president === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"C. South Korean president Moon Jae-in"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is the solution? Solve 0 = -3847*r + 3826*r - 231 for r.","completion":"Sure, let's solve this equation step by step. First, we need to combine the terms that contain 'r' in them. We have -3847*r and +3826*r. If you take away 3826*r from -3847*r, you will get -21*r. So, the equation now is: 0 = -21*r - 231 Then, let's put the 231 onto the left side of the equation to have only 'r' left on the right side. To do that, we need to add 231 to both sides of the equation, which will cancel out the -231 on the right side. The equation now becomes: 231 = -21*r Now, we need to get 'r' by itself. To do that, we should divide each side by -21. So if we divide 231 by -21, we get 'r' equals to -11. So the solution for r in your equation is -11! And if you put -11 back into the original equation, you'll find that it makes the equation work, so -11 is the correct answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

During the Blitz, Charlie, Carrie, and Paul are evacuated from London to Pepperinge Eye, where they are placed in the reluctant care of Miss Eglantine Price, who agrees to the arrangement temporarily. The three children attempt to run back to London, but after observing Miss Price attempting to fly on a broomstick, they change their minds. Miss Price reveals she is learning witchcraft through a correspondence school with hopes of using her spells in the British war effort, and offers the children a transportation spell in exchange for their silence. She casts the spell on a bedknob, and adds only Paul can work the spell, since he's the one who handed it to her. Later, Miss Price receives a letter from her school announcing its closure, thus preventing her from learning the final spell. She convinces Paul to use the enchanted bed to return the group to London, and locate Professor Emelius Browne. They discover Browne is actually a charismatic showman who created the course from an old book, and is surprised to learn the spells actually work for Miss Price.

They knew they would need a different amount of clay for each one, so they thought carefully about how much they should use. They decided to use 1 pound of clay for the vase and 2 pounds of clay for the bowl. This would make sure that the bowl was bigger than the vase, you see. Sally started to work on the vase. She took her 1 pound of clay and shaped it into a tall, skinny shape. She then made pretty patterns on the vase with little clay flowers and leaves. This way, when the real flowers were put in the vase, it would look extra beautiful. Bob, on the other hand, started working on the bowl with his 2 pounds of clay. He wanted the bowl to be wide and deep enough to hold lots of delicious fruits, like apples and oranges. He shaped the clay into a round shape with a nice flat bottom, and he added some cute clay animals around the edge, like bunnies and squirrels, just for fun. When Sally and Bob were finished with their creations, they let the vase and bowl dry under the sun. After the clay dried up, they painted both the vase and bowl with bright, beautiful colors that would make anyone feel happy when they looked at them. Finally, their vase and bowl were finished, and they put them on display in their village market.

Kissinger was particularly concerned about the expansion of Soviet influence in the Indian Subcontinent as a result of a treaty of friendship recently signed by India and the USSR, and sought to demonstrate to the People's Republic of China (Pakistan's ally and an enemy of both India and the USSR) the value of a tacit alliance with the United States. Kissinger sneered at people who \\"bleed\\" for \\"the dying Bengalis\\" and ignored the first telegram from the United States consul general in East Pakistan, Archer K. Blood, and 20 members of his staff, which informed the US that their allies West Pakistan were undertaking, in Blood's words, \\"a selective genocide\\". In the second, more famous, Blood Telegram the word genocide was again used to describe the events, and further that with its continuing support for West Pakistan the US government had \\"evidenced [...] moral bankruptcy\\". As a direct response to the dissent against US policy Kissinger and Nixon ended Archer Blood's tenure as United States consul general in East Pakistan and put him to work in the State Department's Personnel Office. Henry Kissinger had also come under fire for private comments he made to Nixon during the Bangladesh-Pakistan War in which he described Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi as a \\"bitch\\" and a \\"witch\\". He also said \\"The Indians are bastards\\", shortly before the war. Kissinger has since expressed his regret over the comments. What happened to him during the Bangladesh war?","completion":"During the Bangladesh war, Henry Kissinger, a very important man in the United States government, was helping and supporting a country called Pakistan. He was worried about another big country, the USSR, becoming too powerful in that area. He didn't listen to people who told him about the bad things happening to the Bengali people in East Pakistan. Some people were very upset with him for the decisions he made and the words he used about other leaders. Later, he said he was sorry for those words."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia . Options: A The participants were divided into two groups. B The participants had some problems in falling asleep. C Twelve adults and children were invited to take part in it. D The participants'brain waves were examined during their nap. Answer: D The participants'brain waves were examined during their nap.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" true if \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\"?","completion":"The premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" is not directly related to or true based on the statement \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\" Let's examine the two statements more closely to understand why. 1. \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\": This statement implies that there are two artists working together to create some form of artwork on a table. The artwork being created is likely smaller in scale, considering it is being made on a table. The type of artwork, medium used, and the identities of the artists are not specified in this statement. 2. \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house\\": This statement describes a single artist who is in the process of painting a mural on the exterior of a house. A mural is a large-scale artwork that covers a wall or other large surfaces. This statement specifies that the artwork being created is a painting and provides a clear image of the setting (a house). However, similar to the first statement, the identity of the artist and the nature of the mural are not provided. There are several key differences between these two statements: A. Number of artists involved: The first statement involves two artists working on a piece, while the second statement describes a single artist painting a mural. Their relationship, if any, is not specified. B. The type of artwork being created: The first statement does not specify the kind of artwork being produced, while the second statement mentions a painting specifically. C. Setting: The first statement describes a table as the surface on which the artwork is being created, while the second statement introduces a house as the location where the painting is taking place. D. Scale: Although not explicitly mentioned, we can reasonably deduce that the first artwork is smaller, given that it's being created on a table, while the second artwork takes up significantly more space due to being a mural on a house. To conclude, the two statements describe different scenarios that are not directly linked or related. Therefore, the premise \\"2 artists creating a new piece on a table\\" cannot be considered true based on the statement \\"An artist is painting a mural on a house.\\" They are separate, independent scenarios involving different numbers of artists, types of artwork, and settings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? When you’re performing and nervous, it’s natural to get a bit quieter. Before you perform, practice your songs until you can sing them without even thinking about it. Knowing you're prepared can give you the confidence you need to sing loudly and clearly. It may even calm your nerves. Be sure to select songs that work with your vocal range. If you're unsure whether a song will work with your range, ask your vocal coach for feedback. While breathing exercises will strengthen your muscles and open up your lungs for full breaths, avoid taking deep breaths and holding them. When you're nervous about singing, just try to breathe normally. Stay relaxed so you're not creating tension. Practice your breathing before you begin singing. Do something simple like count your breaths in and out. For example, breathe in for five counts and release for five counts. Continue doing this until you're calm and ready to sing. Remind yourself why you want to sing. Chances are, if you keep your mind on your love for singing, you'll overcome your anxiety and be able to sing loudly and clearly. To help you focus, consider closing your eyes and paying attention to the words of the sing. Really let your emotions come through the music and worry less about your fears. If you close your eyes, remember not to tilt your chin upward, which can make it harder to sing loudly. One of the most helpful things you can do to sing louder, is to find a vocal teacher. A voice coach can give you valuable feedback on your singing technique. It will also be useful to have someone to tell you if you are, in fact, singing louder than before. Listen to your teacher's suggestions for improvement and remember that your teacher is there to help you become a better singer. Find a vocal teacher who specializes in a genre of singing that you want to do.

The first day of school was already proving to be an exciting adventure, and our hearts raced with anticipation as we spotted our names in the same classroom.

Our shared nervous energy transformed into a shared excitement as we chatted animatedly about the new school year ahead.

Her kind and welcoming demeanor made us feel an instant connection to her. Once we settled in and the bell rang, Ms. Carlson asked us to stand and introduce ourselves to our classmates as an icebreaker. We were relieved to identify other familiar faces in the room, which helped ease our anxiety. Hearing a little about each of our classmates and their summer adventures revealed more similarities between our peers than we had thought possible.

Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process you described, which outlines the progression of an earthquake, is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This comprehensive explanation of the process, including the missing first step, is provided below: 1. Accumulation of stress and strain in the Earth's crust: The Earth's lithosphere is composed of a series of tectonic plates that are constantly moving due to processes such as subduction, rifting, and continental collision. As these plates interact with one another along their boundaries, stress accumulates within the Earth's crust. This stress is stored as potential energy, with the rocks in the crust becoming increasingly strained and deformed as the forces continue to act upon them. Over time, this strain builds up to a point where the rocks can no longer withstand the tectonic forces. 2. The energy causes the fault lines to give way: Once the stress within the rocks has reached a critical level, the rocks can no longer maintain their strained state and they rupture, giving way along pre-existing fault lines or forming new ones in the process. This sudden release of stored energy takes the form of seismic waves that propagate through the Earth's crust, leading to the occurrence of an earthquake. 3. The Earth's plates move: As the fractures along the fault lines widen, the tectonic plates shift along the fault plane, accommodating the movement that was prevented by the now-ruptured rocks. This movement can take the form of vertical, horizontal, or even diagonal displacement, depending on the type of fault and the specific tectonic forces acting on the region. 4. The energy radiates outward from the fault in all directions: As the seismic waves generated by the rupture of the fault lines propagate through the Earth's crust, they spread out in all directions from the earthquake's source, also known as the hypocenter or focus. There are two types of seismic waves: body waves, which travel through the Earth's interior, and surface waves, which propagate along the surface of the Earth. 5. The seismic waves shake the Earth as they move through it: As the seismic waves propagate through the Earth's crust, they cause the ground to shake and vibrate, resulting in the familiar shaking and often destructive effects of an earthquake. The intensity of shaking experienced at any given location depends on several factors, including the distance from the hypocenter, the type of seismic waves, the nature of the underlying geological materials, and local site conditions. Additionally, the release of energy at the fault can also generate secondary hazards, such as landslides, tsunamis, and ground liquefaction, all of which can compound the overall impact of an earthquake. In summary, the missing first step is the accumulation of stress and strain within the Earth's crust due to tectonic forces. This stress buildup eventually leads to rock failure and rupture, initiating the sequence of events that ultimately result in an earthquake and its associated shaking and secondary hazards."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

BA, KLM, Easyjet, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Eastern Airways have cancelled services on Tuesday, and some flights over the Atlantic were delayed. The threat of further disruption led US President Barack Obama to fly out of the Republic of Ireland a day early to get to London for a state visit. Ash from another Icelandic volcano led to huge disruption in Europe last year. Air Force One Mr Obama had been due to fly to the UK on Tuesday morning, but White House deputy press secretary Josh Earnest said the decision to bring his arrival forward had been taken \\"due to a recent change in the trajectory in the plume of volcanic ash\\". The Met Office forecasts the ash cloud will reach northern and western Scotland overnight, and will clip northern parts of Northern Ireland early on Tuesday. None of England is likely to be affected. A Met Office spokesman said it was difficult to forecast the cloud's direction beyond that because weather systems were changing so rapidly. A number of airlines are choosing not to fly through Scottish airspace on Tuesday: British Airways is not operating any flights between London and Scotland until 1400 BST KLM cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as some to Newcastle EasyJet cancelled flights to and from Edinburgh, Glasgow, Inverness and Aberdeen scheduled for between 0500 and 0900 BST Flybe cancelled flights to and from Aberdeen and Inverness Aer Lingus cancelled a number of its flights between the Republic of Ireland and Edinburgh, Glasgow and Aberdeen Glasgow-based Loganair has cancelled 36 flights. Only inter-island routes in Orkney are unaffected Eastern Airways will not be operating any services in or out of Scottish airspace Transport Secretary Philip Hammond told BBC Two's Newsnight that \\"most, if not all, flights into and out of Glasgow and Edinburgh and airports to the north will be stopped\\" on Tuesday morning. But he said services should resume from Glasgow and Edinburgh by about lunchtime, and in other airports by Wednesday morning. Any disruption later in the week should be \\"limited\\", he added. Earlier, Mr Hammond said there had already been \\"modest delays\\" to flights, particularly those crossing the Atlantic. \\"Clearly, this is a natural phenomenon which we cannot control, but the UK is now much better prepared to deal with an ash eruption than last year.\\" A spokesman for Edinburgh Airport said it was anticipating disruption to many services on Tuesday. In a statement on Monday evening, he said: \\"Only Ryanair is intending to operate a full service from Edinburgh Airport. Passengers should not travel to the airport without checking with their airline first regarding the status of their flight.\\" Andrew Haines, chief executive of the Civil Aviation Authority, said he hoped to avoid a repeat of last year's travel chaos, but he admitted it was still unclear how badly flights would be affected. \\"We know so much more about the volcanoes. We have an improved model. \\"We have better measuring equipment and we have better relationships with airlines so it should be much better but we're still at the hands of both the weather and the volcano; those are the two uncertainties.\\" Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Andrew Haines, of the CAA, said UK aviation had \\"learned a great deal\\" Champions League finalists Barcelona are already considering bringing forward their flight to London ahead of Saturday's final at Wembley against Manchester United. The Catalan club had originally planned to travel on Thursday. \\"Let's see what they [the experts] tell us and if they say we shouldn't risk it we'll travel tomorrow or the day after,\\" said Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola. During last April's six-day shutdown only a handful of flights took off or landed in the UK. Thousands of Britons found themselves stranded overseas forcing many to make long and expensive journeys home by land. Airlines estimated the shutdown cost them 1.7bn (£1.1bn). The CAA said ash levels would now be graded as low, medium or high, and airlines would be notified if levels reached medium or high. Airlines would then consider whether to fly, according to risk assessments already carried out, the CAA added. The Foreign Office is advising passengers to remain in regular contact with their travel agent or airline for the latest news on the status of flights and bookings. The Grimsvotn volcano in Vatnajokull National Park began erupting on Saturday with ash rising to 20km (12 miles) but, although still active, is now not as powerful with a plume of 13km (8 miles). Iceland's airspace has been closed for a period as a result. Ash from the volcano, which is 60 miles (97km) from the nearest human settlements, has settled over farmland and livestock, causing difficulties for some farmers and tourists have been evacuated from the country's main national parks. The Grimsvotn volcano lies beneath the ice of the uninhabited Vatnajokull glacier in south-east Iceland. The latest eruption is its most powerful eruption in 100 years. Experts say this eruption is on a different scale to the one last year and ash particles are larger and, as a result, fall to the ground more quickly. ||||| The spread of dense ash from the erupting Iceland volcano could force the cancellation of up to 500 commercial flights in Northern Ireland, Scotland and parts of Scandinavia, the European air traffic agency said Tuesday.

A dense ash cloud from an Icelandic volcano blew toward Scotland, causing... (Associated Press) Between 200 and 250 flights had already been canceled, said Brian Flynn, head of network operations at Eurocontrol. There are just over 30,000 flights within Europe on average every day at this time of the year. Ash from the Grimsvotn volcano already forced President Barack Obama to shorten a visit to Ireland, and has raised fears of a repeat of huge travel disruptions in Europe last year when ash from the Eyjafjalljokull volcano stranded millions of passengers. Flynn said he did not expect Obama's European tour to be further affected and authorities have said they don't expect the kind of massive grounding of flights that followed last year's eruption. They say procedures have been improved since then and the cloud is currently not expected to move over continental Europe. The British Civil Aviation Authority said strong winds over Scotland was making it hard to predict the direction in which the ash would move, but air traffic controllers said it would reach airports in Scotland, northern England and Northern Ireland on Tuesday afternoon. British Airways suspended all its flights for Tuesday morning between London and Scotland, while Dutch carrier KLM and Easyjet canceled flights to and from Scotland and northern England at the same time. Three domestic airlines also announced flight disruptions. National Air Traffic Services, the agency that controls air traffic over Britain and the eastern Atlantic, said airports will remain open but flights will be affected between 1:00 p.m. (1200GMT) and 7 p.m. (1800GMT) local time. NATS said in a statement that the ash will affect airports in Londonderry in Northern Ireland, Glasgow, Edinburgh and Prestwick in Scotland, and Newcastle, Carlisle, Durham Tees Valley and Cumbernauld in northern England. It advised passengers to check with their airlines before travelling. Budget airline Ryanair said it did not believe there was a need to cancel all flights between Ireland and Scotland, and said it would meet with regulators Tuesday morning to discuss the issue. Norwegian airport operator Avinor said the ash cloud that swept over southwestern Norway earlier Tuesday has now moved away from the coast and no longer affects the airports in Stavanger and Karmoey. However, it said the ash is expected to return to southern Norway in the afternoon. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"Flights in and out of Scotland have been cancelled as a volcanic ash cloud from Iceland's Grimsvotn volcano heads towards the UK, with airlines such as BA, KLM, Easyjet, Flybe, Aer Lingus, Loganair and Eastern Airways cancelling services on Tuesday.

Question: What weapon is Jack's attacker using in the last scene? Title: The Horribly Slow Murderer with the Extremely Inefficient Weapon Movie plot: The movie itself is presented as being a trailer for a 9 hour long movie. It starts with a voice-over, telling the viewer that: \\"some murders take seconds; some murders take minutes; some murders take hours; this murder... will take years!\\". The movie portrays the story of a forensic pathologist called Jack Cucchiaio (played by Paul Clemens; \\"cucchiaio\\" means spoon in Italian), who finds himself being haunted by a deranged looking man (Brian Rohan), who is, without any clear reason, hitting him with a spoon. No-one seems to believe this though as the mysterious attacker only shows up when Jack is alone. He is seen developing a phobia of spoons, stirring his coffee with a fork. Jack attempts to defend himself - stabbing the murderer in the throat with a kitchen knife. But to Jack's surprise his enemy turns out to be immortal, pulling the knife out of his throat and throwing it away, then continuing to hit Jack with the spoon. However, in this scene Jack also notices a strange sign on the arm of his attacker. Jack travels to the far East where he learns that his attacker is known as the Ginosaji, (\\"Silver spoon\\" in Japanese), an immortal and unstoppable being. After this, Jack is shown traveling around the world, trying to escape from the Ginosaji or to fight it. He uses various weapons, including dynamite, guns, and an RPG. Since the Ginosaji is immortal, however, he will always survive and find Jack again. The last scene shows a weakened, wounded Jack, crawling in the desert, with the Ginosaji still striking him with the spoon. Then, suddenly, the spoon breaks. However, Jack's final hope is brief as the Ginosaji opens his jacket and shows dozens of spoons. Finally, the title and credits are shown in typical trailer style.

The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, \\"Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, has given me a parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning.

The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.The performance was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood and most of the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent him a long letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.Holst enjoyed his time in Salonica, from where he was able to visit Athens, which greatly impressed him. His musical duties were wide-ranging, and even obliged him on occasion to play the violin in the local orchestra: \\"it was great fun, but I fear I was not of much use\\".

The gruesome discovery sheds light on a case that has been under investigation for a while and continues to shock the nation. In this article, we delve into the details surrounding this chilling incident, the ongoing investigations, and the broader implications of this high-profile case. Step 1: Detailing the kidnapping incident The kidnapping took place several weeks ago when a group of young people, aged 16 to 34, were abducted from a bar in Mexico City’s Zona Rosa district. The busy nightlife area, usually known for its vibrant atmosphere, was abruptly marred by violence and fear as the unsuspecting victims were taken by force. The motives behind the kidnapping remain unclear, with authorities tirelessly pursuing leads to uncover the truth and bring those responsible to justice. Step 2: Discovering the charred corpse The Mexican police recently stumbled upon a gruesome piece of evidence as they located the charred corpse of a man, now identified as a suspect in the kidnapping case. This disturbing development points to a possible escalation of violence within the criminal world, exposing the alarming levels of brutality that often go hand-in-hand with such abductions. Although the identity of the deceased suspect has not been released, the authorities are hopeful that this will be a breakthrough in the investigation. Step 3: Ongoing investigations and efforts to find the missing persons In response to this harrowing case, the Mexican police have stepped up their efforts in tracking down the missing individuals and solving the kidnapping mystery. Reports suggest that authorities are examining possible links to organized criminal networks, as well as other unrelated motives in an attempt to understand this cruel act. The families of the victims, who have been living in constant anguish, place their hope in the diligence of the investigators as they continue to search tirelessly for answers and, ultimately, the safe return of their loved ones. Step 4: Broader implications This shocking incident underscores the need for stronger security measures and a greater focus on crime prevention throughout Mexico. With high-profile cases of kidnapping and violence becoming all too common, it is imperative that both the government and local communities work together to implement strategies that will protect citizens and combat these heinous acts. Furthermore, this case serves as a stark reminder that awareness and vigilance are essential for anyone living in or visiting the country, especially in areas known for higher crime rates. Conclusion: The discovery of the charred corpse of one of the suspected kidnappers in this distressing case presents both a significant advancement in the investigation and a grim reflection on the brutal world of abductions and criminal activity in Mexico. As the search continues for the 12 missing individuals, we can only hope that the perpetrators of this atrocious act are brought to justice, and that the victims are reunited with their families as soon as possible. In the meantime, the ongoing quest for safety and prevention of such crimes must remain a top priority for Mexico’s law enforcement and citizens alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Double jeopardy is a procedural defence that prevents an accused person from being tried again on the same (or similar) charges and on the same facts, following a valid acquittal or conviction. As described by the U.S. Supreme Court in its unanimous decision one of its earliest cases dealing with double jeopardy, \`\`the prohibition is not against being twice punished, but against being twice put in jeopardy; and the accused, whether convicted or acquitted, is equally put in jeopardy at the first trial.'' can u be tried for the same crime twice?","completion":"In most jurisdictions and according to the legal principle of double jeopardy, a person cannot be tried again for the same crime if they have already been acquitted or convicted. Double jeopardy is commonly understood as a procedural defense that protects against being tried twice for the same criminal offense. The principle of double jeopardy is firmly established in many legal systems around the world, based on respect for the finality of legal decisions and the notion that it is unjust to subject a person to successive trials for the same alleged act. It is considered a fundamental tenet of common law and a constitutional right. In the United States, the protection against double jeopardy is enshrined in the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution, which declares that no person shall \\"be subject for the same offence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.\\" The intent of the double jeopardy clause is to protect individuals from the emotional, financial, and social consequences of successive prosecutions for the same conduct. It also restricts the power of the state and maintains the integrity of the criminal justice system. However, there are certain exceptions to this rule. For example, if it is discovered that a trial was tainted by fraud or if there are extraordinary circumstances such as the uncovering of substantial new evidence that was not available at the time of the trial. In some jurisdictions, a person can be tried for the same act but under a different law. For example, civil and criminal trials, which are different kinds of legal proceedings, can be conducted for the same incident. Also, the \\"dual sovereignty doctrine\\" allows for a person to be tried for the same crime in both state and federal courts because they are separate sovereigns. This is a significant exception to the double jeopardy rule in the U.S. However, applying these exceptions requires very careful consideration because the principle of double jeopardy is strongly rooted in the conviction that preventing the start of a new prosecution is a guarantee of fairness and legal certainty. In conclusion, while the principle of double jeopardy generally precludes a person from being tried twice for the same crime, there are exceptions. The applicability of these exceptions depends on various factors such as the circumstances of the case, the jurisdiction involved, and the specific laws in place."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.

Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\"? The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

Lors de son arrestation, il est possible que les autorités sri lankaises aient des raisons de suspecter que le plaignant était un militant du LTTE (Tigres libérateurs de l'Eelam tamoul), en s'appuyant sur la présence de cicatrices sur son corps. Cette hypothèse pourrait être renforcée par le contexte historique et politique qui a longtemps prévalu au Sri Lanka. Dans cette île située au sud de l'Inde, les tensions ethniques et politiques entre les communautés cinghalaise et tamoule ont souvent été marquées par des violences et des actes de terrorisme. Le LTTE était un groupe armé séparatiste tamoul, qui a mené une longue lutte armée pour la création d'un État tamoul indépendant dans le nord et l'est du Sri Lanka. Fondée en 1976, l'organisation a été active jusqu'en 2009, date à laquelle les forces gouvernementales ont réussi à vaincre les derniers bastions du LTTE. Tout au long de cette période, le LTTE a mené de nombreuses opérations militaires, y compris des attentats-suicides, qui ont parfois pris pour cible des installations gouvernementales et militaires. Dans ce contexte, les autorités sri lankaises ont dû développer des mécanismes de renseignement et de vigilance pour déjouer les menaces potentielles et identifier les affiliés potentiels du LTTE. C'est pourquoi les cicatrices sur le corps d'un individu pourraient éveiller des soupçons, surtout si elles correspondent à des marques typiques d'entraînement militaire ou de torture. Toutefois, il est important de rappeler qu'une telle suspicion ne constitue pas en soi une preuve formelle de l'implication d'un individu avec le LTTE. Les autorités devraient recueillir des éléments de preuve supplémentaires et mener une enquête approfondie pour établir la véracité des allégations. La présomption d'innocence, qui est un principe cardinal de la justice, doit toujours prévaloir tant que la culpabilité n'a pas été établie au-delà de tout doute raisonnable. En conséquence, les autorités sri lankaises doivent veiller à respecter les droits fondamentaux et les garanties processuelles de tout individu arrêté, indépendamment des soupçons qui pèsent sur lui et de son origine ethnique ou politique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Schools across the country reported problems as Nick Clegg’s flagship policy of giving free meals to all young children was introduced yesterday. The initiative was hailed a ‘massive success’ by the Liberal Democrats, but even schools in Mr Clegg’s Sheffield backyard admitted they couldn’t cook their own hot meals. Nine primaries in the city are bussing in meals cooked at neighbouring schools amid claims of a £400,000 shortfall in funds to upgrade kitchens. Food for thought: Nick Clegg marking yesterday's launch of his flagship meals policy at a school in London. Reports also emerged of canteen renovations over-running and deliveries of vital equipment such as tables and chairs failing to turn up. One school is offering hot meals on a ‘first come, first served’ basis while another even considered serving airline food supplied by local airports before opting for cold sandwiches. As they battle to implement the controversial £1billion policy, some schools are seating children for lunch in classrooms, music rooms or Portakabins because they lack dining space. Others are running three lunch sittings, restricting pupils’ choice of food and asking seven-year-olds to serve drinks to younger pupils to take pressure off staff. Lib Dem Schools Minister David Laws declared the scheme, which involves offering free lunches to all four to seven-year-olds, a ‘massive success’, while Mr Clegg insisted that giving children hot lunches can be better for their learning than extra English and maths lessons. The Deputy Prime Minister said that ‘giving a healthy hot meal at lunchtime is as, if not more, effective than many of the, say, literacy and numeracy initiatives which have been undertaken in the past in the classroom’. Teething problems? Schools in his own constituency could not cook hot food for pupils on the first day. But critics claim the educational and health benefits touted by Mr Clegg have yet to be rigorously proven. They also claim councils and schools have been forced to raid other budgets to push the initiative through because the Government failed to properly fund it. Oliver Coppard, Labour’s candidate against Mr Clegg in next year’s national polls, said: ‘In trying to get this policy in place before the General Election, Nick Clegg has – as usual – over-promised and under-delivered.’ At Dudley Infant Academy in Hastings, East Sussex, hot meals are on a ‘first come, first served basis’, with a cold packed lunch available as an alternative. In Portsmouth, Solent Infant School will use its music room as a lunch area and a Portakabin has been installed at Devonshire Infant School to provide additional dining space. Bournemouth Council said 12 primary schools – half of the town’s total – will start the year by offering free cold packed lunches to some or all of its key stage one pupils rather than hot meals. Nick Clegg yesterday made a string of assertions about why his policy was destined to be an overwhelming success. Here, Home Affairs Editor JAMES SLACK sorts the claims from the reality. CLAIM: All the evidence, and this has been stress-tested and analysed, shows it has a dramatic effect on educational performance. REALITY: The Department for Education’s own evaluation of pilots in London and Durham found a 1.9 percentage point increase in the proportion of pupils reaching the expected level in reading at Key Stage 1 and a 2.2 percentage point increase for maths. Critics says that, overall, this is barely statistically significant. For the highest performing children, there was no positive impact. Crucially, the authors of the study admit the reasons for the improvement in overall performance were not clear. The pilots included a wider programme to promote healthy eating, such as providing advice to parents, which may also be responsible. CLAIM: It is good for children’s health. REALITY: The evaluation stated there was no evidence the two-year pilot led to significant health benefits. For instance, it found ‘there was no evidence of any change in children’s Body Mass Index’. Researchers also found the pilot did not appear to significantly improve children’s behaviour or absence rates from school. CLAIM: The policy is about having children share a healthy meal together at lunchtime rather than having children parcelled off, one group at one end of the room on free school meals and the other not. REALITY: Russell Hobby, of the National Association of Head Teachers, said he could think of no examples in ‘living memory’ of schools segregating pupils who receive free school meals. CLAIM: I strongly dispute this idea that as we balance the books we don’t do more to invest in a future in which every boy and girl irrespective of their birth gets the best possible chances in life. REALITY: The key point. Firstly, with the deficit still running at more than £100billion, the Government is not ‘balancing the books’. The money to pay for school meals amounts to £1billion of extra borrowing. Many head teachers argue it could be spent far better elsewhere. Coincidentally, councils warned last month of a £1bn shortfall in the funding they need to provide the school places needed to cope with Britain’s rapidly growing population. The number of children in classes of more than 30 has increased by 200 per cent since 2010 – breaking the Prime Minister’s promise to create ‘small schools with smaller class sizes’. Julian Rutherford, of Principals Catering, which supplies schools in the South East, said: ‘We are ready to launch the expanded free meals policy but it is likely there will be teething problems. ‘We are having to transport food into 16 schools which do not have kitchens, mostly in Faversham and Sittingbourne.’ In Somerset, the BBC reported that 46 schools out of 201 are unable to provide hot meals. In Buckinghamshire, the figure was 45 out of 159. Lynda Mitchell, contracts manager for North Somerset Council, said she had been ‘almost reduced to tears… by builders not meeting agreed deadlines and not apparently caring’. Jo Wotton, a catering manager for five schools in Cornwall, tweeted that one school was refusing to offer free meals at all ‘until they get their kitchen in October’. Russell Hobby, general secretary of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: ‘There will be some schools that will be providing a cold meal this term while they wait for the building work to finish off. ‘The logistics of getting large numbers of children through, how you schedule the timings of lunch and whether you’ve got kids eating in their classrooms or not – all that will be quite difficult for schools. They’ll manage it but it’ll put a huge burden on them.’ Some £1billion has been earmarked over two years to cover the cost of meals, while £150million has been spent upgrading kitchens, with an additional £22.5million going to smaller schools. The Department for Education said only 239 out of 16,500 schools would be providing a cold meal instead of a hot one this week. Mr Laws said: ‘I am absolutely delighted that our statistics, which come from local authorities and schools, show that 98.5 per cent of schools across the country – 16,500 schools – are delivering a hot meal option from the start of term.’ It was a ‘massive success’, he said.

Review: This Showtime movie really deserves a far better viewer rating than a 4.5; I gave it a 10 based on the story and the acting of the two stars. After reading the viewer comments, I was surprised at how many folks expected this movie to be a comedy. Yeah, I see that IMDb lists it as Comedy/Drama under Genre. That sure is misleading, isn't it? Fortunately, I saw the movie before logging onto this website so I did not have that expectation. In fact, based on the synopsis of what I heard, I fully expected it to simply be a Drama. I'm wondering if disappoint at this not being a funny movie caused so many low votes.Another factor that might have caused low votes is that this movie is very much 'character-driven'. 'Driving Miss Daisy' is an example of another character-driven movie that comes to mind. Someone's previous comment complained about a boring trial. Tom's (Danny Glover) work scenes seemed to distract from the real plot of the movie. That is, how he was engineering the upward social climb of his family - or his personal troops, if you will. However, they served to establish credibility and justification as his right to move to Greenwich and move 'up' in the world.Tom's obsession became a compulsion. He proved that he would stop at nothing to blend into the white neighborhood. His chagrin when another black person moved next door was not due to skin color. It was because of everything the 'interloper' represented; everything that Tom had left behind. In essence, Tom had become an Oreo cookie: Black on the outside but White on the inside.The last 20 minutes of this movie are among the most powerfully written, directed and acted (by Whoopi Goldberg) I have ever had the pleasure to witness. I realized that the climax of the film was not the obvious event that happened next door (don't want to give it away). The climax is verbal and Whoopi delivers it. I am still not clear if it is the conversation when she informs Tom which college Tom -Two is going to or when she releases it, all in the middle of the night and Tom wakes up. Nevertheless, the denouement is great. You know that life on that street will never be the same.My favorite kind of character-driven flick: people go through problems, some pain, do their dance, they grow, they change, and life goes on.

WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota. Later, at the political rally, the president defended his position saying the executive order he signed hours earlier would not weaken his border strategy: “The border is going to be just as tough as it’s been” despite...

Article: A capacitor (originally known as a condenser) is a passive two-terminal electrical component used to store electrical energy temporarily in an electric field. The forms of practical capacitors vary widely, but all contain at least two electrical conductors (plates) separated by a dielectric (i.e. an insulator that can store energy by becoming polarized). The conductors can be thin films, foils or sintered beads of metal or conductive electrolyte, etc. The nonconducting dielectric acts to increase the capacitor's charge capacity. Materials commonly used as dielectrics include glass, ceramic, plastic film, air, vacuum, paper, mica, and oxide layers. Capacitors are widely used as parts of electrical circuits in many common electrical devices. Unlike a resistor, an ideal capacitor does not dissipate energy. Instead, a capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates. Now answer this question: In what form does a capacitor store energy?","completion":"A capacitor stores energy in the form of an electrostatic field between its plates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Audioslave was an American rock supergroup formed in Los Angeles in 2001. The four-piece band consisted of Soundgarden lead singer/rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell and Rage Against the Machine members Tom Morello (lead guitar), Tim Commerford (bass/backing vocals), and Brad Wilk (drums). Critics first described Audioslave as a combination of Soundgarden and Rage Against the Machine, but by the band's second album, Out of Exile, it was noted that they had established a separate identity. Audioslave's sound was created by blending 1970s hard rock with 1990s alternative rock. Moreover, Morello incorporated his well-known, unconventional guitar solos into the mix. As with Rage Against the Machine, the band prided themselves on the fact that all sounds on their albums were produced using only guitar, bass, drums, and vocals. In its six years of existence, Audioslave released three albums, received three Grammy nominations, sold more than eight million records worldwide and became the first American rock band to perform an open-air concert in Cuba. Audioslave disbanded in February 2007 when Cornell issued a statement announcing that he was permanently leaving the band \\"due to irresolvable personality conflicts as well as musical differences.\\" The 2007 Rage Against the Machine reunion and tour involving the rest of the band, as well as solo albums released that same year by Morello and Cornell, cemented the supergroup's permanent demise. On January 20, 2017, three days after announcing their reunion, Audioslave performed together for the first time in over a decade at Prophets of Rage's Anti-Inaugural Ball. In the early hours of May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell was found dead in his hotel room in Detroit, at the age of 52, after playing a Soundgarden show.

The old cards could not squeeze into the boxes because the Choose from: (1). cards were too thick.; (2). boxes were too thick.;","completion":"(1). The story of the cards that were too thick. Once upon a time in a tiny, hidden village nestled in the mountainside, there was a quaint little shop. This shop, named \\"Peculiar Pastimes,\\" was owned by a curious elderly gentleman called Mr. Archibald. Mr. Archibald was known far and wide for his collection of the most exquisite and unusual playing cards. Adventurers and collectors alike would journey to this village to visit his store in hopes of procuring some of these unique treasures. One blistering summer's day, a lively girl named Eliza came by Mr. Archibald's store. She could not help but be captivated by the variety of wonderful and strange decks of cards that filled the crowded shelves. The colors, designs, and exquisite patterns of the cards fascinated her. Inch by inch, she examined every single deck with an enthusiastic but untrained eye. Eliza's interest piqued when she noticed a set of twelve antique boxes nestled in between the stacks of playing cards. The dusty containers lay in a row, and each appeared to have a card sitting at the foot of its locked and mysterious door. A tiny placard stood by them, explaining that each box contained a playing card that was said to possess magical powers. The mystery and beauty of these boxes intrigued Eliza, who immediately inquired with Mr. Archibald more about them. \\"These cards, my dear, are not only magical — they are ancient and extremely rare, \\" said Mr. Archibald with an enigmatic smile, \\"But I must warn you, they say that each card carries a price for its use. It’s not something to be taken lightly.” Despite the warning, Eliza's curiosity couldn't be contained. She asked to see more of the cards, and Mr. Archibald, who could see the genuine passion in her, agreed to show her the cards up close under one condition — that she would not feel tempted to use any of them without first understanding the consequences. With a solemn nod, Eliza agreed, and Mr. Archibald began to remove the cards from their boxes. However, when he tried to put the cards back into their respective containers, he found that he could no longer squeeze them in. To his and Eliza's surprise, the cards seemed to have doubled in thickness since they were taken out. Determined to find the solution to this puzzle, Eliza began pouring over the countless books and scrolls in Mr. Archibald's vast library, which housed a collection of ancient tomes, magical grimoires, and historic chronicles of enchanted playing cards. Days became weeks, and weeks turned into months, but Eliza never gave up her relentless search for the answer to the cards' dilemma. Mr. Archibald couldn't be happier as, during this time, he found a kindred spirit and apprentice in the young girl. Finally, in the dark of the night, on a windy, full-moon eve, Eliza stumbled across a passage that explained the growing thickness of these magical cards. The text read, \\"As power is drawn from the enchanted cards, their essence grows and becomes more potent, signifying by the expansion of their form.\\" In her excitement, Eliza shared her finding with Mr. Archibald. Together, they decided to design new boxes that could accommodate the cards, retaining a balance of harmony and practicality. Over time, the cards revealed their powers to Eliza, and she learned to wield the magic wisely, never abusing the trust Mr. Archibald had placed in her. Years passed, and Eliza inherited \\"Peculiar Pastimes\\" from Mr. Archibald after his peaceful passing. She continued his legacy of collecting and preserving these enchanted cards, teaching young enthusiasts about the beauty and the artistry behind them. As for the twelve magical cards, they remained a reminder of the mystical bond and friendship that formed between a curious girl and a wise old shopkeeper on that fateful day they first met."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends.

The article explains how these qualities contribute to a meaningful friendship. Now, let's compare these main points to the options given: A: the qualities of a friend - This option is a strong match as the article revolves around the qualities the author looks for in a friend. B: how to get along with friends - While it is somewhat related, this option is not the main focus of the article.

While other competitors struggled to break the 10-second barrier, Bailey-Cole managed to accomplish this incredible feat, proving once again why he is considered one of the fastest men in the world. Despite Bailey-Cole's stellar performance, there was a palpable sense of disappointment at the meeting due to the absence of Usain Bolt, the reigning world record holder for the 100-meter and 200-meter sprints. Bolt was forced to withdraw from the Zurich Diamond League meeting after sustaining an injury, and his presence was certainly missed by fans and fellow athletes alike. However, the event was not without its memorable moments. In the women's 4x100-meter relay, the British team comprising Desiree Henry, Anyika Onoura, Asha Philip and Ashleigh Nelson emerged as the proud winners. The quartet of talented sprinters worked seamlessly together, showcasing their exceptional teamwork and commitment to their sport. As the British women's relay team stood atop the podium, their victory not only underscored the incredible depth of talent currently present within the world of athletics, but also served as a testament to the dedication and hard work that is required to succeed at such an elite level. Their performance undoubtedly inspired other aspiring athletes to strive for greatness, serving as proud ambassadors for their country and their sport. In conclusion, the Zurich Diamond League meeting proved to be an eventful and exciting showcase of some of the world's most talented athletes, despite the absence of renowned sprinter Usain Bolt. With Kemar Bailey-Cole returning to form in the men's 100-meter final and the outstanding performance of the British women's 4x100-meter relay team, the event served as a thrilling reminder of the incredible achievements that can be accomplished through dedication, teamwork, and raw talent. As the world of athletics continues to evolve and grow, it is certain that these extraordinary athletes will inspire future generations to push the limits of human ability and pursue their own dreams of success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Police in Germany have queried Jeremy Clarkson's claim he was barred from a UK-bound flight by an airport employee because of a 2014 Top Gear controversy. Article:","completion":"Title: Jeremy Clarkson's UK-bound Flight Debacle: Fact or Fiction? Introduction In a recent incident, former 'Top Gear' host Jeremy Clarkson alleged that he was denied boarding on a UK-bound flight by an airport staff member due to a controversy dating back to 2014. The incident, which occurred in Germany, has left the public with several questions about the legitimacy of Clarkson's claim. Police in Germany have since looked into the matter, aiming to shed light on the truth behind the allegations. The 2014 Top Gear Controversy To fully understand the context of the recent incident, we must revisit the turmoil that unfolded in 2014. The controversy began while filming a Top Gear episode in Argentina, where Clarkson, along with co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, found themselves in the midst of a political dispute. The trio, who famously pushed boundaries on the popular motoring show, drove a Porsche with the license plate H982 FKL, which some interpreted as a reference to the 1982 Falklands War between the UK and Argentina. The license plate drew the ire of locals and led to violent protests, forcing the Top Gear crew to flee the country hastily. The incident left diplomatic relations between the two nations strained and put the BBC in an unfavorable position. Clarkson's Claim of Denied Boarding Fast forward to the recent airport fiasco, Jeremy Clarkson alleged that an airport employee in Germany barred him from boarding a UK-bound flight as a form of retribution for the 2014 Top Gear controversy. According to Clarkson, the staff member was holding a personal grudge against him and intentionally delayed processing his travel documents, ultimately causing him to miss his flight. German Police Investigation Upon receiving word of the incident, German police opened an investigation into the matter, aiming to determine the truth behind Clarkson's claims. During their inquiries, authorities attempted to establish whether the airport employee had deliberately targeted Clarkson and whether the alleged actions were a direct consequence of the 2014 controversy. Key Findings and Conclusion After an extensive investigation, German authorities found no evidence to substantiate Clarkson's claim that he was intentionally barred from boarding his flight due to the past controversy. Rather, the investigation determined that the cause of the denied boarding was primarily due to standard flight protocols, which require passengers to arrive at the gate within a specific timeframe. As a result, it has become apparent that Clarkson's allegations lacked the necessary foundation to be considered a genuine, targeted incident. While tensions may certainly still exist following the 2014 Top Gear controversy, German police have concluded that the airport employee did not hold a personal vendetta against Clarkson, and the incident was not a direct form of retribution. In conclusion, while Jeremy Clarkson's allegations of being denied access to a UK-bound flight by an airport employee might have made for an interesting headline, the in-depth investigation by German authorities has found no evidence supporting the claim that the incident was fueled by a personal grudge or linked to the 2014 Top Gear controversy. As in many similar cases, the truth is often more mundane - this time revealing a simple matter of adhering to flight protocols and arriving at the gate in a timely manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Some fortunate people can go on a diet, lose the excess fat and then simply get on with their lives. Others get stuck in the eternal cycle of wanting to be thin, dieting, craving, bingeing, regaining the weight and then wanting to be thin again. You want to break free from this exhausting and depressing merry-go-round of losing and regaining weight but you’re not ready to give up doing what you know best. Let’s examine the diet cycle mentality. THERE IS A MAGIC CURE The reason you haven’t lost weight and kept it off is because you haven’t found the right diet that suits you particular physical and emotional needs. You need to eat more carbs, or more fat, you need to cycle your calories or have cleaner re-feeds, and you need a coach for accountability. Once you figure out precisely what the optimum formula is for you and you have an expert to help you then you will lose weight and keep it off. ONE LAST DIET Once you lose the weight, then you will learn how to get in tune with your body’s hunger signals and eat mindfully. You just need to commit totally to this last diet, get to your goal and then you will stop for good. YOU LOVE HEALTH AND FITNESS You really enjoy being in control of your food and planning your training regime. Time spent scouring the latest fitness magazines and entering your weight into a spreadsheet is fun and rewarding. You spend most of your waking hours plotting and planning how you are going to burn that fat! I WANT TO BREAK FREE!! The only way to break free from the diet cycle is to come to the place where you no longer believe the stories you tell yourself. If there was a magic cure that worked for you, you or someone else would have found it by now. Count the number of diet books on your bookshelf, the e-books on your computer and the magazines on the coffee table. Have any of them given you permanent weight loss? What did the author conclude about why people haven't lost weight and kept it off? - They are buying to many diet books - not enough information - They haven't found the right diet that works for them - They are bingeing and craving to be thing. Answer:","completion":"The author concludes that the primary reason people haven't lost weight and kept it off is because they haven't found the right diet that suits their particular physical and emotional needs. It implies that individuals must find the optimal formula through a tailored diet and a proper fitness regime that specifically works for them, addressing their unique circumstances, rather than following generic, one-size-fits-all diet books and methods. Furthermore, the author also acknowledges some of the misleading beliefs or narratives that keep people stuck in the cycle of losing and regaining weight: 1. The belief in a magic cure: People tend to think that there must be a perfect, ideal diet plan out there that, once discovered, will help them lose weight and keep it off for good. However, this constant search for the magic solution may cause them to overlook the importance of sustainable habits and practices that would support their weight loss journey in the long run. 2. The \\"one last diet\\" mentality: People often convince themselves that they just need to commit to one final diet and reach their goal, after which they can rely on mindful eating and paying attention to their body's hunger signals. This mentality does not take into account long-term behavioral changes, implying that once the \\"last diet\\" has been completed, there is little reason to continue maintaining the effort and discipline required for sustainable weight loss. 3. The illusion of loving health and fitness: Some may convince themselves that they enjoy being consumed by the process, spending significant time researching, planning, and tracking every aspect of their eating and training. However, it is crucial to break free from this cycle of obsession and understand the importance of balance and moderation in maintaining a healthy lifestyle. In conclusion, the author highlights that breaking free from the diet cycle requires shifting away from these misleading beliefs and recognizing that the magic cure has not yet been found. It is essential to critically examine the numerous diet books, e-books, and magazines that crowd our spaces, questioning whether they have provided sustainable and lasting solutions. To make lasting improvements in one's weight and overall health, finding a tailored approach, adapting life-long habits, and maintaining consistency in practice are key elements that need to be considered, rather than merely focusing on the endless pursuit of the \\"perfect\\" diet or magic cure."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize: Before deciding to join the Amish, it is imperative that you learn as much about their religion, history, and lifestyle as possible. The Amish communities of today are descendants of Swiss Anabaptists who emigrated to the United States in the early eighteenth century. There are approximately 250,000 people living in Amish communities across North America. The largest Amish community is in Holmes County, Ohio; although there are other sizable Amish populations in Pennsylvania, Iowa, Indiana and smaller communities across the Eastern and Mid-Western states, as well as in Canada. Amish is a stricter branch of the Mennonite Anabaptist Church, with which it shares many beliefs and practices. The Amish, with other Anabaptists, reject infant baptism in favor of adult baptism, giving an adult the right to choose their religion and commit to joining the Amish community. The Amish refer to themselves as the \\"plain people\\" and to anyone outside of the Amish community, regardless of religion or race, as \\"Englishers\\" or \\"high people\\". There are many informative websites and books available that cover every aspect of Amish life. You should do your best to visit an Amish community as part of your research. This will give you some insight into what the day-to-day life of an Amish person is like. Despite popular belief, there are no restrictions on \\"English\\" people visiting Amish communities. You can visit Amish businesses and converse with the people, most of whom will be willing to answer any questions you might have. It may even be possible to stay in a bed and breakfast run by a local Amish family. This will give you an even closer look at the Amish way of life, which places God and family above all else. If possible, try to visit several communities on your trip, as different Amish communities will vary slightly in terms of their customs, traditions, and level of strictness and you will need to find the one to which you are best suited. If you cannot travel to an Amish community, you may be able to set up correspondence with an Amish person to gain an insight into their beliefs and way of life. The Amish do not allow computers or, in most cases, telephones, so communicating by post will be your only option. Remember to respect their beliefs and do not take any identifiable photographs of them (the Second Commandment, Exodus 20:4 - \\"Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image...\\"). They may allow you to take pictures of their buggy or farms if you ask politely, however. Be aware that some may not feel comfortable (especially women) with talking to outsiders extensively about their faith or lifestyle since they are taught to be modest in everything they do. After visiting one or several communities, you need to decide which community you would like to join. Once you have developed a short list of about 3 to 5 communities, you should begin contacting the leading bishop of each community to gauge whether you would be welcome to join their church. Finding the leading bishop should not be too difficult; if the community is on your short list, you have probably already visited it and hopefully developed some contacts there who can help you. Although the Amish do not have any rules forbidding outsiders from joining, it is highly unusual and typically not encouraged, so contacting the bishop is a good way to judge what the community's reaction to a newcomer is likely to be. If the bishop is open to the idea of you joining their community, he will invite you for an interview, where you can put forward your reasons for wanting to become a member of the Amish. You will need to demonstrate the strength of your faith, your willingness to renounce the ways of the modern world, and your commitment to the Amish way of life. As long as your motives are pure and you are fully aware of what life in an Amish community entails, there should be no objection to you coming to live in the community. Once you have made your decision and you have received the bishop's permission, you may begin your new life as a member of the Amish. You will first be placed with an Amish family, where you can learn their ways and participate in the household duties. During this time you must prove yourself to the Amish by living according to their religious principles and becoming a productive and valuable member of the community. Once you have done this (there is no set time period), you may be voted into the church and become a true member of the Amish community. Unless you are coming from another branch of the Anabaptist Church with a very similar lifestyle, you are likely to find the transition to Amish living somewhat difficult. Living without electricity, cell phones and motor vehicles is a lot harder for someone who is used to having these luxuries, than it is for people who were brought up in the Amish community and don't know any differently. Although some Amish may be very welcoming and helpful to you as you make your transition, others may be more distrustful of you and not expect you to last very long. Give them time. Once you prove your faith and commitment, they will grow to trust and accept you.","completion":"The Amish are a group of people who live a simple life, without many of the things we use every day, like electricity and cars. They came from a part of Switzerland a very long time ago and now live in different parts of the United States and Canada. People who want to join the Amish need to learn about how they live, believe, and do things. To do this, they can read books, visit Amish communities, and talk to Amish people. The Amish believe in God and family, and it's important to respect their ways of doing things. If you want to join the Amish, you have to talk to their leader. If they think you really want to be part of their community, you can stay with an Amish family to learn their ways. Later, if the group decides you can join them, you become a true member of the Amish community. It can be hard to give up things we use every day, but with time, the Amish will trust and accept you if you show your commitment to their way of life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: - annoy - eat meat - open doors - need food - jog The rationale to choose \\"open doors\\" as the answer is that:","completion":"If cats were taller, the ability to open doors would likely be the most significant change in their behavior and capabilities. This is not to say that other options listed wouldn't also be affected, but let's first analyze each option and then establish why \\"open doors\\" would be the most impactful. 1. Annoy: Cats are known for their mischievous behavior, so making them taller could potentially increase their ability to knock over objects and access areas they wouldn't have been able to otherwise. However, their ability to be annoying is not necessarily dependent on their height alone. Cats are masterful in leveraging their current physical abilities, so the increase in annoyance would not be as drastic compared to the other options. 2. Eat meat: Cats, being obligate carnivores, already have the ability to eat and digest meat. As their height increases, they might be able to catch larger prey than they can currently hunt. However, the increase in height wouldn't necessarily alter a cat's diet too dramatically, as their diet primarily consists of meat in various forms, such as dry and wet commercial cat food, fish, and smaller animals like birds or rodents. 3. Open doors: This is where we see the primary impact of cats being taller. Currently, cats sometimes struggle to open doors due to their limited height and reach. With an increase in height, cats could use their increased reach to manipulate door handles and knobs, granting them the ability to access parts of the house, rooms, or spaces they couldn't before. This newfound ability would also contribute to the curiosity and exploratory nature of cats, affecting their overall behavior and interaction with their environment. 4. Need food: Cats already need food to survive, and their height would not significantly alter this fact. However, having increased height might lead to a proportionate increase in body mass, which might increase their energy expenditure and, in turn, increase the amount of food required to maintain their health. While taller cats might need more food, the fundamental need for food doesn't drastically change, unlike the ability to open doors. 5. Jog: Cats are already capable of jogging; however, taller cats could potentially cover more ground when jogging due to an increase in leg span and stride length. This benefit would be more of an adaptation to the increased height, rather than a newfound ability or significant behavioral change. In summary, while taller cats may experience changes in all of the listed areas, the ability to open doors would likely be the most significant and impactful ability gained from an increase in height. This new skill would fundamentally change the way cats interact with their environment, likely leading to even more curiosity-driven exploration and, ultimately, greater independence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

March Robisch of Thought Catalog described the single as having \\"that ska quality that made No Doubt so successful\\".

Williams equated Stefani's tone to that of a \\"child whisperer\\" due to her ability to make music that appeals to children. The lyrics are about Paddington Bear and his travels; Rolling Stone called it \\"a pop-reggae allegory about a bear with an identity crisis\\". The song opens with Stefani singing the first verse and Williams joining in the chorus, the lyrics including \\"When you're trying to get home / When you don't wanna be alone / Look at yourself in the mirror / That's your way home\\". The hook features Stefani repeatedly singing \\"Shine!\\" and Williams screaming \\"Hey!\\". Andy Morris from Gigwise noted the lyrics, \\"So we're in a strange new land in Paddington station / But you end up in good hands in the fancy British nation\\" and \\"that bear with the red hat\\", as obvious references to Paddington.

They all are so big and chunky they take up half the rearview mirror so you can't see out the window. BUT the Diono Back Seat mirror fits WONDERFULLY! Easy to install, no jumping in and out of the car a dozen times trying to get the perfect view. LOVE THIS MIRROR!!!!

Q:What is the name of the man that appointed his brother as viceroy after taking easter Deccan? Answer the above question based on the context below: Pulakeshin II conquered the eastern Deccan, corresponding to the coastal districts of modern Andhra Pradesh in 616, defeating the remnants of the Vishnukundina kingdom. He appointed his brother Kubja Vishnuvardhana as Viceroy in 621. Thus the Eastern Chalukyas were originally of Kannada stock. After the death of Pulakeshin II, the Vengi Viceroyalty developed into an independent kingdom and included the region between Nellore and Visakhapatnam.After the decline of the Badami Chalukya empire in the mid-8th century, territorial disputes flared up between the Rashtrakutas, the new rulers of the western deccan, and the Eastern Chalukyas. For much of the next two centuries, the Eastern Chalukyas had to accept subordination towards the Rashtrakutas. Apart from a rare military success, such as the one by Vijayaditya II(c.808–847), it was only during the rule of Bhima I (c.892–921) that these Chalukyas were able to celebrate a measure of independence. After the death of Bhima I, the Andhra region once again saw succession disputes and interference in Vengi affairs by the Rashtrakutas.The fortunes of the Eastern Chalukyas took a turn around 1000. Danarnava, their king, was killed in battle in 973 by the Telugu Choda King Bhima who then imposed his rule over the region for twenty-seven years. During this time, Danarnava's two sons took refuge in the Chola kingdom. Choda Bhima's invasion of Tondaimandalam, a Chola territory, and his subsequent death on the battlefield opened up a new era in Chola–Chalukya relations. Saktivarman I, the elder son of Danarnava was crowned as the ruler of Vengi in 1000, though under the control of king Rajaraja Chola I. This new relationship between the Cholas and the coastal Andhra kingdom was unacceptable to the Western Chalukyas, who had by then replaced the Rashtrakutas as the main power in the western Deccan. The Western Chalukyas sought to brook the growing Chola influence in the Vengi region but were unsuccessful.Initially, the Eastern Chalukyas had encouraged Kannada language and...

Q:Background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Paragraph: Justin and Derek are accomplished competitive weight lifters. One day, Derek suffers a severe injury to his leg. Because of this injury, Derek is forced to stop exercising for several months. Justin remains injury free and continues to work out regularly on the other hand. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who will lose less strength in their muscles? A:","completion":"Given the information provided in the paragraph above, Justin will likely lose less strength in his muscles. This is because Justin remains injury-free and continues to work out regularly, maintaining his exercise routine and muscle usage.

As a result of this inactivity, Derek's muscles are not being used consistently, leading to a decrease in size and strength as per the \\"use it or lose it\\" principle."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review: I don't know which is worse: that I actually bought this low-quality, home-produced dvd, or that there are people marketing this and calling it Capoeira. While the decription of warm-ups and instruments are passable, the rodas and demonstrations are singular and violent. This is not the dvd you want if you are a real Capoeira enhusiast. It is basically a taped class; All the games shown are a very violent regional style, Angola is not even mentioned, and \\"fighting techniques\\" are wrestling and boxing techniques that have nothing to do with Capoeira. Their music isn't very good, either. I have studied Capoeira under credible instructors for a while, and I can tell you that if you want a dvd on Capoeira, a company that makes budget aerobics videos is not the way to go. Answer: Answer:","completion":"To determine the tone of this product review, let's analyze it step-by-step: 1. The title \\"Give me a break!\\" suggests frustration or annoyance. 2. The reviewer expresses disappointment in buying the low-quality DVD and condemns the people marketing it as Capoeira. 3. While the reviewer acknowledges some passable elements, they emphasize that the rodas and demonstrations are \\"singular and violent,\\" contrasting with what a real Capoeira enthusiast would want. 4. The review criticizes the DVD for only showcasing violent regional styles and ignoring Angola, while also mentioning that the \\"fighting techniques\\" are not related to Capoeira. 5. The music is also described as not being very good. 6. The reviewer concludes by advising others to avoid purchasing Capoeira DVDs from a company specializing in budget aerobics videos.

More than 70 people were killed and hundreds were injured. While visitors gawked in awe and outrage at Yanukovych's luxurious mansions, ponds and exotic animals, journalists combed through heaps of documents that appeared to show a leader who basked in extravagant wealth while his country sought bailouts from both the West and Russia. Many of the financial and other documents were burned, while others were dumped in a lake before Yanukovych fled his closely guarded residence, flying to the eastern city of Kharkiv, where his support base is strongest. Divers were able to retrieve many of the documents, and activists laid them out to dry. Photos of the documents were posted online by Mustafa Nayem, a top Ukrainian investigative journalist for the Ukrainska Pravda website and Hromadske.tv online news channel. Other respected Ukrainian news outlets also reported on the documents. One was a receipt for 12 million in cash. Another invoice was for a payment of 10 million. Some 80,000 euros (about 110,000) went for curtains in a room called the \\"knight's hall.\\" Another 1.1 million euros (about 1.5 million) was spent on plants. Wooden decor for a handful of rooms cost 2.3 million. Notably, 115,000 was spent for a statue of a \\"running boar,\\" possibly intended for Yanukovych, who is an avid hunter. One page listed expenditures, and next to item No. 47 on the sheet was a payment of 32,580 hryvna (nearly 4,000) for what was described as a \\"bribe\\" used in a bidding process. The documents were sure to fuel more anger among protesters. Yanukovych's whereabouts were unknown Sunday. An aide said she last spoke to him Saturday night and he considered himself the legitimate president of Ukraine and did not intend to leave the country. His residence in the Mezhygirya Park, about 140 hectares (345 acres) of forested hills along the Dnipro River had become for many Ukrainians a symbol of a corrupt administration. The president refused to answer questions about the estate, saying he lived in a modest house on a small plot of land on the grounds. Journalists' investigations traced the property and buildings around it to Yanukovych's allies. After Yanukovych's departure from Kiev, the estate was taken over by the opposition's self-defense units, which opened it to visitors and deployed activists to maintain order and prevent any looting or property damage. Ukrainians, many bringing their children, rushed to tour the parks. They reacted with wonder and revulsion at the opulence, including Yanukovych's private golf courses, pig farm and a small zoo with ostriches and peacocks. Some have called for turning the site into a hospital, sanatorium or even a \\"museum of corruption.\\" The Verkhovna Rada — Ukraine's parliament that is now controlled by the opposition — voted Sunday to turn over control of the estate to the government. Yanukovych's lifestyle was on the minds of some in the crowd of thousands who flocked Sunday to the epicenter of the protests in Kiev's central square, known as the Maidan. The people paid their respects to those demonstrators who died in the unrest. Yaryna Mosur, who left her two children in western Ukraine to take part in the protests, stood on the square wrapped in the Ukrainian flag as a black-robed Orthodox priest led prayers from a stage. She said she was infuriated by the wealth on display in Yanukovych's estate. \\"We are all in shock, but he will pay for it all dearly,\\" Mosur said. |||||","completion":"During the Ukrainian anti-government protests in 2014, President Viktor Yanukovych fled his Kyiv residence, leaving behind a plethora of luxurious items reflecting his wealthy lifestyle. Journalists and protesters found financial documents listing extensive expenses, including a 12 million cash transfer receipt, dated just seven months after the president took office. Other expenditures included 31 million for ornate woodwork and expensive art pieces. Yanukovych was known for privatizing a state-owned property and converting it into his residence. Besides the financial records, the former president's abandoned residence held dossiers on social and political activists he was likely monitoring. The journalist who published the financial documents online also discovered invoices for lavish spending, like 110,000 for curtains and 1.5 million for plants. The residence also had a private zoo, vintage car collection, golf course, and personal church. The extensive spending and accumulated wealth documented in President Yanukovych's estate led to significant outrage among Ukrainians, as the country was on the verge of an economic crisis and was seeking bailouts from both the West and Russia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write some highlights for the following article: CSKA Moscow officials have accused Manchester airport immigration officials of deliberately refusing their star player Zoran Tosic the right to play in the Champions League match at the Etihad Stadium. Former Manchester United winger Tosic is not in the team to face City after allegedly arriving at the airport on Tuesday with the wrong visa. The Serb was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in or even attend the match. Now directors of the Russian club have claimed the decision was a deliberate act aimed at sabotaging CSKA’s plans for tonight’s game in Group E. CSKA Moscow's Zoran Tosic was told he couldn’t play against Manchester City because of a visa issue. According to sources in Russia, the former Manchester United player was only in possession of a ‘transit visa’ rather than the necessary work visa. As such he was allowed in to the country but told he could not play in the game or even travel to the stadium for the game. It is understood that Tosic is currently at the CSKA team hotel in Manchester City centre. CSKA, meanwhile, are considering an official complaint, feeling that their player has been deliberately targeted because of the threat he carries on the field. City need to win after taking only two points from their first three matches. Tosic (left) apparently only had a 'transit visa' and so was forced to stay at the team's hotel during the match. CSKA general director Roman Babayev said: ‘Initially there was a discrepancy and he was issued not a tourist visa, but a transit visa. ‘The English consulate advised that Serbs do not really need a tourist visa, they may arrive as transit passengers without a visa and it is issued on the spot. ‘Nevertheless, the transit visa was issued, so he had the right to stay in the UK for 48 hours, that is enough. ‘But the English border guards showed some over-adherence to the rules and found on the internet that he is a CSKA player, and felt that he had come to England to work. ‘They demanded a wok visa, which is impossible and unacceptable. ‘After a long time of wrangling, he was admitted to the country because they had no right not to (let him in), as he had a visa. Sergio Aguero gives Manchester City the lead during the two side's clash at the Khimki Arena in Moscow. ‘However, they seized his passport, which is also the first time in our experience that a passport of a citizen of another country has been confiscated. ‘The English migration service has received several requests from the Serbian consulate in England and the Russian embassy in England. ‘They considered the matter at length and in the end, not only did he not go to the match, he was even forbidden to be a spectator at the stadium and they demanded that he leave the territory of Manchester before the match. ‘Will we submit a protest? English people still can’t calm down, but, I think there is already no sense in it, because it already won’t affect the result, but it’s not very pleasant. ‘I am sure that this would not have happened in any other European country.’","completion":"CSKA Moscow has had some trouble with their star player, Zoran Tosic, playing in a big soccer game in Manchester. The Manchester airport immigration officials said Zoran arrived with the wrong type of visa, so he was allowed in the country but not allowed to play in the soccer game or even go watch it. CSKA Moscow is upset and thinks it was done on purpose because Zoran is a really good player, and they might make an official complaint."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: This article: Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\". The duet was a hit, becoming Bowie's third UK number-one single. Bowie was given the lead role in the BBC's 1982 televised adaptation of Bertolt Brecht's play Baal. Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal. In March 1982, the month before Paul Schrader's film Cat People came out, Bowie's title song, \\"Cat People (Putting Out Fire)\\", was released as a single, becoming a minor US hit and entering the UK Top 30.Bowie reached his peak of popularity and commercial success in 1983 with Let's Dance. Co-produced by Chic's Nile Rodgers, the album went platinum in both the UK and the US. Its three singles became Top 20 hits in both countries, where its title track reached number one. \\"Modern Love\\" and \\"China Girl\\" each made No. 2 in the UK, accompanied by a pair of \\"absorbing\\" promotional videos that biographer David Buckley said \\"activated key archetypes in the pop world.

It has yellow and black stripes on its body and can sometimes sting. Bees are very important because they help flowers grow by spreading pollen. 2. \\"Pollen\\" - Pollen is like yellow dust that comes from flowers. Bees visit different flowers to collect pollen, and when they do, some of it sticks to their bodies. When they go to another flower, the pollen rubs off and helps that flower make new seeds to grow more flowers. 3. \\"Dahlia\\" - Dahlia is a special type of pretty flower that comes in many different colors like pink, orange, and purple. Bees like collecting pollen from dahlias because they have lots of yummy pollen. 4. \\"Park\\" - A park is a big open space outside where you can play, relax, and see lots of trees, grass, and sometimes flowers like the dahlia. Parks are places where people, animals, and plants can be together and enjoy nature.

Context: In the 1970s I was a student nurse in psychiatry. I was rostered to the brain injury ward in a chronic hospital, where the patients had severe brain damage from tumours, car accidents, strokes, metabolic diseases, degenerative diseases, and alcoholism. Only about half were ambulant. Most had severely impacted recent and long term memories. They could not bathe or feed themselves. The majority sat most of the day in chairs lined along the sides of the day room. They were spoon-fed meals and wheeled into the toilet. One of those patients was Connie S. She was maybe 55 yrs old and she spent a lot of the day screaming in her chair. She could not speak, walk, or cooperate. One nurse was very impatient with her and once I heard that nurse say to her, “You think the water is too hot, do you? Then have it cold!” as she bathed her in cold water. I remember standing up for her to that nurse. I worked that ward for over a year and then, one day, just like that, Connie S. woke up. She suddenly began speaking and walking. She apparently remembered most of the things had had happened to her in the ward. Soon, she walked right out of that ward and never came back. As she left, she appeared dignified and so happy, so relieved. I was too junior at that stage to know what her diagnosis was supposed to have been, but no-one expected her ever to leave. No-one left that ward. It was the end of the line. I remember being really glad that I had stood up for her and thinking how ashamed the nasty nurse must have been. It is now many years later and I often think of this woman and wonder how she fared in her post-hospital life.

Knowing it acts like a magnet is one thing. Knowing why it acts like a magnet is more difficult. In fact, finding out why is a fairly recent discovery. To find out why required new technology. It was the seismograph that made it possible to learn why the Earth acted like a magnet. Seismograph are used to study earthquakes. By studying earthquake waves they were able to learn about Earths interior. They discovered that Earth has an inner and outer core. The outer core consists of liquid metals, mainly iron and nickel. Scientists think that Earths magnetic field is generated here. It is caused by the motion of this liquid metal. The liquid metal moves as Earth spins on its axis.

In October 1913, MacCallum introduced Thomson to A. Y. Jackson, later a founder of the Group of Seven. MacCallum recognized Thomson's and Jackson's talents and offered to cover their expenses for one year if they committed themselves to painting full time. MacCallum and Jackson both encouraged Thomson to \\"take up painting seriously, [but] he showed no enthusiasm. The chances of earning a livelihood by it did not appear to him promising. He was sensitive and independent, and feared he might become an object of patronage.\\" MacCallum wrote that when he first saw Thomson's sketches, he recognized their \\"truthfulness, their feeling and their sympathy with the grim fascinating northland ... they made me feel that the North had gripped Thomson as it had gripped me since I was eleven when I first sailed and paddled through its silent places.\\" He described Thomson's paintings as \\"dark, muddy in colour, tight and not wanting in technical defects\\".

Every day he runs up and down a hill near his house until he is out of breath, then walks around his house until his breathing rate returns to normal. But I can use this background: There must be more to this story than just gas exchange with the environment. To begin to appreciate the role of oxygen inside your body, think about when your breathing rate increases: climbing a steep slope, running a race, or skating a shift in a hockey game. Respiration rate correlates with energy use, and that correlation reflects the link between oxygen and energy metabolism. For this reason, the chemical process inside your cells that consume oxygen to produce usable energy is known as cellular respiration . During this process, energy is converted from glucose , in the presence of oxygen, into numerous ATP molecules. The glucose, of course, comes from the food you eat. In biological terms, you do not eat because you are hungry, you eat to get energy. Other heterotrophic organisms also acquire glucose from other organisms, whereas autotrophic organisms make their own glucose, mostly through photosynthesis. What is an answer for this question: Will breathing rate increase or decrease when the body requires more energy to preform a task such as running? Answer:","completion":"Breathing rate will increase when the body requires more energy to perform a task such as running. This is because the body needs more oxygen for the increased energy demands during these activities, so the respiratory rate increases to deliver more oxygen to the cells for cellular respiration, allowing the production of more ATP to meet the energy requirements."},{"prompt":"Q:Question: \\"What is the third mentioned language of the scriptures?\\" Context: \\"Buddhist scriptures and other texts exist in great variety.

Answer the following question: His eyes were open and his head bobbed around at an impossible angle. He was sitting in about forty feet of water, stone dead, one arm pinned between the rocks. As best I could tell, he had been dead when he landed there. The mud and ooze around him were as serene and smooth as he was. The cop who was assisting me swam over and made a palms up gesture. I shrugged back at him and began to work the body loose. The corpse had only one leg, and as I worked I wondered what he had been doing in the lake. I got the arm free and kicked toward the quicksilver surface above me. The body turned bloated and heavy when I broke water with it, and it took three of us to load it into the police launch. I dried off and got a coke out of the cooler. It was getting to be another Texas scorcher, and the sunlight bouncing off the surface of the lake felt like it had needles in it. My mouth was dry from breathing canned air and the carbonation burned like fire. Winslow, from the sheriff's office, sat down next to me. 'I appreciate this, Dan,' he said. 'No problem.'

The extra time you save her that day will allow her to do something else she enjoys. She will also appreciate your consideration in taking an active role in keeping your home clean and tidy. Household chores could also mean taking care of children. Brushing teeth, going to the toilet, combing hair, getting dressed, and eating breakfast is a time-consuming process. If you can pitch in or take the responsibility away from your wife a couple days of a week, she will appreciate both the time you save her and your interest in the kids. If feeding, grooming, and taking the dog for a walk is not usually your responsibility, go ahead and take care of the dog or other pets once in a while. It will make both your wife and the pooch happy. A few nights a week, wash the dishes and silverware or even better, polish them. Try doing the same with the laundry, washing and ironing so she doesn't have to. Let your wife know how much you appreciate all the work she does around the house. There is little enjoyment in household chores, running the children all over town, and going grocery shopping, often while working another job as well. If you do not participate in any of these responsibilities, then let your wife know how impressed you are with her abilities to multitask.

Little things can make big things happen. Take notice if your wife gets a haircut, wears new jewelry, or changes a routine meal with new ingredients. She will be happy that you care enough to notice when she does something different. Other little things you can do is hold your wife’s hand if you are out taking a walk or put your arm around her when you are sitting together in front of the television.

Choices: - football - motorsport - united kingdom Answer:","completion":"The entity related to '2009 Superleague Formula season' with the relationship of 'sport' is motorsport. While the Superleague Formula has connections with football through team sponsorship by football clubs, it is essentially an open-wheel, single-seater motor racing competition. The races took place on motorsport circuits like Donington Park in the United Kingdom, where the first season started in 2008. Drivers competed using identical cars and powerful V-12 engines, racing at high speed to showcase their skill and be crowned as champions. In the 2009 season, which was rebranded as \\"Superleague Formula by Sonangol\\" due to sponsorship from the Angolan oil company, teams represented various football clubs, and Liverpool F.C., run by Hitech Junior Team with driver Adrián Vallés, emerged as the season champions. However, the primary focus and main gameplay of the Superleague Formula remained firmly rooted in the motorsport arena, setting it apart from football and establishing its unique identity within the world of sports."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When you go to the store to buy beer, you will be spending your money to acquire the product. Your wealth, in this context, refers to the money and resources you possess. Whenever you make a purchase, you are using your wealth to pay for the items or services you require.

Cargo hold Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"The Frozen Equilibrium\\" The Frozen Equilibrium is the story of Flynn, a determined and skilled engineer who finds himself aboard the colossal spaceship, 'The Tempus,' which has been assigned to transport a secretive and precious cargo to a distant human colony living on the distant planet, Argon-9. In the year 3025, following Earth's devastating climate collapse, humanity has managed to build viable habitats on distant planets and moons. These habitats rely on highly sophisticated life-maintenance systems to regulate temperature and air quality, making air conditioning and ventilation crucial elements for human survival. Flynn, a 34-year-old engineer, has been handpicked for this mission due to his expertise in maintaining such complex systems. He joins 'The Tempus' as the lead HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) specialist. Flynn is ready for a routine assignment, but he is unaware that the cargo he's been entrusted with is the key to unlocking a new energy source that could save Earth's depleted resources and provide a new future for humanity. Unfortunately for Flynn, a powerful and sinister organization, the Galaxia Consortium, has learned of this groundbreaking energy source and will stop at nothing to acquire it for their own malicious intentions. To make matters worse, a mole has infiltrated the crew of 'The Tempus,' sabotaging the ship's ventilation system and putting the lives of everyone onboard at risk. As Flynn races against time to restore the air conditioning and ventilation throughout the ship, he discovers that the crucial systems have been tampered with, leading him to the cargo hold. Flynn realizes he must access the heart of the cargo hold's ventilation system, buried deep within the secure container housing the priceless energy source. With the crew's lives at stake and Galaxia Consortium hot on their trail, Flynn comes face-to-face with the mole who has been actively working to sabotage the mission. A thrilling battle ensues between Flynn and the mole as the two adversaries clash in the freezing cargo hold, each possessing the skill set necessary to repair or destroy the fragile air conditioning and ventilation system. As the temperature in the cargo hold continues to drop, Flynn's exceptional engineering skills are put to the ultimate test. He outsmarts the mole and successfully initiates repairs to restore the air conditioning and ventilation. Meanwhile, the captain of 'The Tempus,' Commander Evelina Troy, manages to outmaneuver and evade the Galaxia Consortium's fleet, ensuring the safe delivery of the invaluable cargo to Argon-9. Flynn's heroics in repairing the impaired system not only save the lives of 'The Tempus' crew, but they also ensure that hope is preserved for humanity's future. Upon their arrival at Argon-9, Flynn and the rest of the crew are celebrated as heroes. Flynn's newfound celebrity propels him into a unique position to lead a new generation of engineers to help secure the Earth's survival and heal the damage inflicted on it by centuries of neglect. The Frozen Equilibrium is an intense and adventurous journey that explores the importance of perseverance in the face of adversity, the significance of humanity's innate drive to endure and adapt, and the realization that the true measure of a hero includes their ability to preserve life."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Question: I had to go somewhere involuntarily is the same as?

Step 1: Identify the common elements in both premise and hypothesis. In this case, the common element is \\"the men that drive the trucks\\". Step 2: Examine the relationship between the elements in the premise. In the premise, we have two types of workers mentioned: \\"the men that drive the trucks\\" and \\"the guys that fix the power lines\\". It is mentioned that both of these groups of workers \\"aren't tested as much\\". Step 3: Compare the information provided in the premise to the hypothesis. The hypothesis is focusing solely on \\"the men that drive the trucks\\" and their testing frequency, claiming that they \\"aren't tested very much.\\" Step 4: Assess if the hypothesis aligns with the premise information. In the premise, it is mentioned that \\"the men that drive the trucks\\" aren't tested as much. Though the amount isn't specified, it does indicate that they are tested less.

Sentence 1: - Stockfish - Cured - Fermentation - Cold-adapted bacteria - Maturing process - Cheese Sentence 2: - Stockfish - Adapted - Fermentation - Cold-cured bacteria - Maturing process - Cheese Step 2: Analyze the differences found during comparison. Differences between the two sentences include the use of \\"cured\\" in Sentence 1 and \\"adapted\\" in Sentence 2, and \\"cold-adapted bacteria\\" in Sentence 1 and \\"cold-cured bacteria\\" in Sentence 2. Step 3: Evaluate if the differences change the meaning of the sentences. The main difference lies in the use of \\"cured\\" and \\"adapted\\": In Sentence 1, it is implied that the fish undergoes a curing process through fermentation, while Sentence 2 states that the fish is adapted in the fermentation process. Likewise, in Sentence 1, the bacteria are described as \\"cold-adapted,\\" meaning they can survive in cold environments, whereas in Sentence 2, the bacteria are described as \\"cold-cured,\\" which doesn't convey the same meaning. Conclusion: The two sentences do not mean the same thing. There are slight differences in the choice of words that result in changes in meaning. The first sentence properly conveys the idea of fish being cured through fermentation with assistance from cold-adapted bacteria, while the second sentence incorrectly uses \\"adapted\\" and \\"cold-cured.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"No, \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores\\" is not a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" The potential answer provided does not align with the context of the question and does not address the topic of suspicion regarding a possible affair. To provide a detailed and long explanation, we need to analyze the components of the given question and understand why the proposed choice is not valid. First, let us dissect the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" This question aims to inquire about the reasons that led Ash to think Jesse might be involved in an extramarital or unfaithful relationship. Such reasons may include, for instance: 1. Observing secretive behavior: Ash may have noticed Jesse hiding something or trying to keep certain affairs out of Ash's knowledge. 2. Increasing distance and lack of emotional connection: Ash and Jesse may not have been as emotionally connected as they used to be, making Ash question if there is someone else in Jesse's life. 3. Unusual changes in schedule or routine: If Jesse suddenly started coming home late, spending more time at work, or being unavailable without a clear reason, Ash might have wondered if there was an affair. 4. Discovering evidence of infidelity: This could range from Ash finding suggestive messages or photographs to seeing Jesse with someone else in a compromising situation. 5. Behavioral changes: If Jesse suddenly changed their appearance, began acting differently, or seemed nervous or guilty around Ash, it might have raised suspicion. Now, let us take a look at the answer choice provided: \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores.\\" This statement does not address any of the potential reasons that would lead Ash to suspect Jesse of having an affair. Furthermore, it is entirely unrelated to the topic of infidelity, as it pertains to an interest in sports information rather than a concern about the nature of the relationship between Ash and Jesse. In conclusion, the answer \\"wanted Jesse to give baseball scores\\" is not valid for the question \\"Why did Ash suspect Jesse was having an affair?\\" as it does not provide any relevant or plausible reasoning that corresponds to the suspicions surrounding an affair. A more suitable answer should be related to signs of infidelity or substantial changes in behavior, emotion, or communication that could indicate a breach of trust within the relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hrdina musí bojovat s ženou, zubatým stvořením, a zlomit její moc. Which language is this?","completion":"The language you posted is Czech. It is a West Slavic language spoken primarily in Czechia (also known as the Czech Republic), but also by Czech communities in other parts of the world. Czech is closely related to Slovak, to the extent that many linguists consider them mutually intelligible. It is also somewhat similar to Polish and Sorbian, other Slavic languages spoken in Central Europe. The sentence \\"Hrdina musí bojovat s ženou, zubatým stvořením, a zlomit její moc\\" translates to \\"The hero must fight the woman, a toothy creature, and break her power\\" in English. Czech is known for its complex grammar and large number of declensions. Like many other Slavic languages, it primarily uses a case system to indicate grammatical relationships in sentences. Therefore, word order is less rigid in Czech than it is in English. It is also notable for having a rich system of noun and verb inflection, which can be challenging for learners. The language also has several unique sounds that do not exist in English and most other languages. These include ř, a unique Czech sound that is a simultaneous trill and fricative, and ň, a palatal nasal. Czech also uses the Latin alphabet, extended with various diacritics, such as the acute accent (´), the caron (ˇ), and the ring (˚). These are used to indicate modified sounds or to distinguish words that would otherwise be homophones. Czech literature and media are extensive, dating back to the Middle Ages. Some of the most famous works in the Czech language include the Good Soldier Švejk by Jaroslav Hašek, and the works of Franz Kafka, who wrote in German but was of Czech-Jewish descent.

Even if this does not work, experts recommend using rubbing alcohol to kill and preserve a tick after removal. This makes it easier for doctors to determine if the tick was a carrier of Lyme disease. Use a clean cotton swab to apply rubbing alcohol to the area where a tick is attached. If you don't have cotton swabs, you can pour a little rubbing alcohol directly onto the skin. Use clean tweezers (preferably after sterilizing them, which you can do with rubbing alcohol) to grip the tick's body as close to the surface of your skin as possible. Gently pull the tick upward without breaking any part of the tick's body. Drop the tick into a jar or bottle filled with a little rubbing alcohol. Be sure the tick is completely submerged. Use rubbing alcohol to cleanse the skin's surface where the tick was removed. Use a spray bottle to apply rubbing alcohol to the inside of sneakers. The rubbing alcohol will kill the bacteria causing the smells, leaving your sneakers clean and odor-free. If you're out of nail polish remover, you can use rubbing alcohol in a pinch. Pour some rubbing alcohol onto a cotton swab, and rub hard on your finger nails to remove old nail polish. Nail polish won't come off as easily as with actual nail polish remover, but it will still strip away the old nail polish. A common folk remedy for fevers is to apply rubbing alcohol to the skin. As the alcohol evaporates, it's thought to offer a cooling sensation. However, pouring rubbing alcohol on the body, especially on children, can be extremely dangerous. A number of children have actually slipped into comas after their parents applied rubbing alcohol to treat a fever. For this reason, using rubbing alcohol to relieve the symptoms of a fever is highly discouraged. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary for this article is: Rubbing alcohol can be used in different ways, like removing ticks, cleaning smelly sneakers, and taking off nail polish. It can also kill a tick for doctors to check it for Lyme disease.

(b). positive.","completion":"The sentiment of the given sentence \\"smug and convoluted action-comedy\\" can be identified as: (a). negative. To understand the reasoning behind this classification, let us break down the sentence and analyze its components: 1. \\"smug\\": This adjective is used to describe someone or something that is self-satisfied, complacent, or overly pleased with themselves. When employed in the context of a film or any artistic work, it implies that the content comes across as arrogant or self-congratulatory. This perception does not generally evoke a favorable reaction in the audience and is therefore associated with negative sentiment. 2. \\"convoluted\\": This term refers to something that is complex, intricate, or difficult to understand. If a piece of art, such as an action-comedy, is described as \\"convoluted\\", it implies that the plot, characters, or other narrative elements are unnecessarily confusing or complicated. This can diminish the audience's overall enjoyment of the work, which again results in a negative sentiment. When these two adjectives are combined to describe an \\"action-comedy\\", it suggests that the film in question is marked by an unwarranted sense of self-importance and a needlessly complicated narrative structure. These elements generally contribute to a less-than-satisfactory viewing experience, hence the sentiment can be classified as negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her daughter told him that my father was a plumber, and he called, and my dad went right over---and took me with him.(Maybe he was hoping that the lawyer's daughter would be nicer to me.) My father fixed the toilet, help them clean up everything, and didn't take much time for his trouble. But as we were leaving, he told the girl, \\"If I ever need a lawyer, I'll be happy to call your dad.\\" As we walked to our car, he said to me, \\"Do you believe he didn't know where the main shut-off valve was? What a dumb ass!\\" From that point on, her dad was known in school as Lawyer Dumb Ass. When my husband and I bought our house, the first thing my dad showed him was the main shut-off valve. I have always been proud to say that I'm a plumber's daughter.

Beleaguered Malaysia Airlines suffered fresh embarrassment over the weekend after it was revealed a Christmas Day flight from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur flew in the wrong direction for eight minutes after air traffic controllers were given the wrong flight plan. The New Zealand Herald reported the pilot of flight MH132 queried the route his Airbus A330 was taking after he noticed it was headed further south than expected. Malaysia Airlines confirmed in a statement that there had been a mix up with the early-morning service's flight plans. \\"On December 24th 2015 our flight MH132 from Auckland to Kuala Lumpur was given the latest flight plan by the airline's Operations Dispatch Centre,\\" the statement says. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Malaysia Airlines' flight MH132 flew on the wrong path after air traffic controllers in New Zealand were given the wrong flight plan. \\"Auckland's Air Traffic Control (ATC) was inadvertently given an earlier flight plan.\\" \\"Both routes were following an approved flight path and the aircraft had enough fuel for both routes. The safety of both passengers and crew were never compromised at any time.\\" Advertisement The airline said it was investigating the incident. A spokeswoman for New Zealand's Airways Corporation said the incident would be investigated by its internal team. \\"The flight plan the airline filed with us was going to Kuala Lumpur but via a slightly different route than the pilot was expecting,\\" she told the New Zealand Herald. Malaysia Airlines' horror run began in March 2014 when flight MH370 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 passengers and crew on board. Just over four months later flight MH17 was shot down over Ukraine while flying from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur. Earlier this year Malaysia Airlines appointed German airline executive Christoph Mueller as chief executive, tasking him with rebuilding the airline after the string of disasters. ||||| 1/10 Shot down in a military training exercise While the Australian officials leading the search for MH370 say they remain “absolutely convinced” it ended up in the southern Indian Ocean, some passengers’ families – and theorists – distrust the unprecedented satellite data analysis involved. Among those who support this view are the British journalist and author Nigel Cawthorne, who has controversially already published the first book on the plane’s disappearance. e supports one theory, based on the eye-witness testimony of New Zealand oil rig worker Mike McKay, that the plane was shot down shortly after it stopped communicating with air traffic controllers. At the time there was a series of war games taking place in the South China Sea involving Thailand, the US and personnel from China, Japan, Indonesia and others, and Cawthorne has linked this to Mr McKay’s claims to have seen a burning plane going down in the Gulf of Thailand. 2/10 Stolen by Putin Jeff Wise, a private pilot and science writer, claims he has evidence that the plane made its way to the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, which is run by Russia as its largest space launch facility. He claims Vladimir Putin ordered Russian special forces to hijack MH370 and fly it to the spaceport, but admits he has 'no idea' why the Russian president would want to do such a thing Getty Images 3/10 Flown north and shot down deliberately, prompting cover-up At a stage in the investigation when it was believed the plane could have flown for some time from where it disappeared along either a northern or southern corridor, many posted on forums suggesting that if it had been the former we would never hear about what happened. Some still support this view, and former RAF navigator Sean Maffett told the BBC that after 9/11, any unidentified airliner entering the airspace of another country would lead to fighter jets being scrambled. “If the plane is in the northern arc it could easily have been shot down,” he said. This theory also involves a national – or possibly international – cover-up, based on the premise that no country would want to admit to shooting down an airliner full of passengers from all over the world. 4/10 Tried to land on a desert island beach After reports that the plane had turned left shortly following its disappearance from civilian radar screens, speculation grew that it could have landed on a remote beach somewhere like the Andaman Islands, which lie between Indonesia and the coast of Thailand. Though CNN reported that locals dismissed the idea a Boeing 777 could land on an airstrip there undetected, the archipelago consists of hundreds of remote islands with some long stretches of sand. Former BA pilot Steve Buzdygan said it would be difficult – but not impossible – to bring a 777 down on a long deserted beach. AP 5/10 Landed at a US military base One of the more outlandish conspiracy theories that has gained some traction online is the idea that MH370 could have been “captured” and flown to a military base on the UK-owned tropical atoll of Diego Garcia, in the middle of the Indian Ocean. The base is run by the US, and some have reportedly said in forum postings that the Kremlin has put some credence into this possibility. Such is the strength of belief in this theory that the US government has been forced to issue a denial. A spokesperson for the US embassy in Malaysia told the local Star newspaper that there was “no indication that MH370 flew anywhere near the Maldives or Diego Garcia”. “MH370 did not land in Diego Garcia,” he added. Nasa 6/10 Headed for a remote airport in Langkawi, Malaysia One theory, put forward by another aviation blogger named Chris Goodfellow, has it that the sudden left turn came after major catastrophe knocked out a range of the plane’s electronics, from transponders to communications equipment. In this scenario and in the middle of the night, Goodfellow argued, the pilot would redirect towards the nearest safe airport. “This pilot did all the right things,” he said. “Actually he was taking a direct route to Palau Langkawi, a 13,000ft (4,000m) strip with an approach over water at night with no obstacles. He did not turn back to Kuala Lumpur because he knew he had 8,000ft ridges to cross. He knew the terrain was friendlier towards Langkawi and also a shorter distance.” This theory assumes that the plane was in fact controlled manually once it disappeared – and that it did not make it to Langkawi. 7/10 An explosion in the cockpit The theory of a sudden explosion within the cockpit before the turn left could explain why there was no attempt to signal for help. Since 9/11 cockpits doors have been fortified to become extremely difficult to bypass, and such a sudden incident could perhaps have incapacitated both pilots while keeping out the rest of the crew. This explanation does not seem to tally with the claims of some Malaysian officials, however, that the change in direction was the result of “seven or eight keystrokes into a computer on a knee-high pedestal between the captain and the first officer”. 8/10 A struggle at altitude Though Malaysian officials believe that the plane was deliberately diverted, and that its communications systems were turned off one after the other, a detailed background check into all 227 passengers has cleared all of suspicion. If, however, we do accept that the plane was the subject of a passenger hijacking, it remains to be explained why the hijackers did not try to do more than fly the plane into the middle of the southern Indian Ocean. One theory suggests that there was some kind of struggle for control of the plane that ultimately ended with mutual destruction. Further analysis of data by Malaysian officials suggests that the plane was flown erratically once it left civilian radar, climbing to 45,000ft before dropping very low. Buzdygan told the BBC he would resort to this sort of flying if faced with would-be hijackers. “I’d try to disorientate and confuse the hijackers by throwing them around,” he said. Getty Images 9/10 Pilot suicide As part of the ongoing criminal investigation in Malaysia, police are looking into the state of mind and possible motives of the captain Zaharie Ahmad Shah and co-pilot Fariq Abdul Hamid. The Malaysian police chief Khalid Abu Bakar has said that “all possibilities” will be looked into, and there have been reports that Shah was going through a difficult marriage break-up.Yet such comments have been rubbished by the man’s relatives, who have described him since as a dedicated family man and model professional. Hugh Dunleavy, the commercial director of Malaysia Airlines, described Shah as a seasoned pilot with an excellent record. “There have been absolutely no implications that we are aware of that there was anything untoward in either his behaviour or attitude,” he told Reuters. “We have no reason to believe that there was anything, any actions, internally by the crew that caused the disappearance of this aircraft.” ||||| Gilze-Rijen air force base: Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 crashed last year after it was hit by a Russian-made Buk surface to air missile, an air safety investigation has found, which killed the pilots immediately but may have left passengers alive for up to a full minute and a half. A report by the Dutch Safety Board, released on Tuesday in the Netherlands, found that a Russian-made Buk missile exploded just a few metres above and to the left of the plane's cockpit. \\"(The) impact (of the missile shrapnel) was only instantly fatal to the occupants of the cockpit,\\" the report found. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link The reconstructed cockpit of MH17 at the presentation of the Dutch Safety Board's final report into the tragedy. Photo: AP Within a second the plane began to break up, exposing other crew and passengers to deafening noise, \\"abrupt deceleration, decompression, reduced oxygen level, extreme cold, powerful airflow (and) objects flying around\\". \\"Some occupants suffered serious injuries that probably caused their death. In others, the exposure led to reduced awareness or unconsciousness in a very short space of time.\\" Advertisement However it was not possible to say when they died. \\"It cannot be ruled out that some occupants remained conscious for some time during the one to one and a half minutes for which the crash lasted,\\" the report said. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Link Tjibbe Joustra, head of the Dutch Safety Board, presents the final report into what caused MH17, seen reconstructed at rear, to break up high over Ukraine last year.

However, \\"one passenger was found with an oxygen mask around the neck... it remains unclear whether the person concerned put on the mask in a reflex or that it was done by someone on the ground after the passenger's death.\\" Relatives were briefed by the board about the findings and one man, Barry Sweeney, whose 28-year-old son Liam was on board, told the BBC they were told the explosion of the missile would have caused disorientation and confusion in the rest of the plane.

Photo: Kate Geraghty Risks not properly identified The investigators' report found that the airline and air traffic bodies had not \\"adequately identified the risks to civil aviation brought about by the armed conflict in the eastern part of Ukraine\\". Ukraine itself came in for strong criticism, for not closing the airspace over a region where scores of military aircraft had been shot down in the previous few months. MH17 crashed in Ukraine's east on July 17, 2014, killing all 283 passengers and 15 crew members aboard the Boeing 777 – including 39 people who called Australia home. The report was presented at Gilze-Rijen air force base in the Netherlands, by Dutch Safety Board chairman Tjibbe Joustra, standing in front of a reconstruction of the front third of the plane, rebuilt from wreckage recovered from the fields of eastern Ukraine. The reconstruction showed the cockpit area riddled with holes, punctured by shrapnel from the exploding missile. Buk missiles are designed to explode next to their targets, rather than collide directly with them. \\"Flight MH17 crashed as a result of the detonation of a warhead outside the airplane,\\" Mr Joustra said. \\"None of the aviation parties involved recognised the risks posed to civil aviation by the conflict on ground.\\" There was sufficient reason to close airspace as a precaution, Mr Joustra said, as more than 60 military aircraft had been brought down in the months prior, and there was evidence of weapons systems that could reach civil aircraft cruising altitude. The reason for the omission was \\"straightforward and disquieting\\", he said – \\"Nobody had thought that civil aviation was at risk (even though) there was undeniably an armed conflict taking place on the ground.\\" Ukraine, which was responsible for the safety of the airspace under international law, came in for strong criticism for not closing its airspace as a precaution. However other states and airline operators were also at fault, and international rules needed to be changed, the investigators said. Alternative theories ruled out Investigators forensically examined the wreckage of the plane, recovered from the fields of eastern Ukraine, and eliminated the possibilities that the plane was brought down by an internal explosion, by gunfire or air-to-air attack. They even excluded one theory that it was hit by a meteor. \\"We investigated and eliminated the possibilities one by one,\\" Mr Joustra said. Investigators found a Buk warhead detonated outside the aircraft, slightly in front and above the left side of the cockpit. Thousands of pre-formed metal fragments penetrated the front of the plane with great force. Computer simulations backed up this theory, and it was also corroborated by millisecond analysis of the cockpit voice recorder. The front of the plane broke off, the rest of the plane broke up in mid air. The tail section crashed first, then the centre, with the engines, hit the ground upside down and caught fire. Mr Joustra said the launch site of the missile could be narrowed to a 320 square km area in eastern Ukraine, but further work narrowing this area was beyond the investigators' mandate. The finding contradicts one theory pushed by Russia and its supporters, that the plane was shot down by a Ukrainian fighter jet. However the investigators did not directly confront another Russian theory: that the missile was fired by the Ukrainian army, rather than by Russian-backed separatists (or Russian soldiers working with the separatists). Russian missile manufacturer rejects findings Before the Dutch report was released, Russia's state arms producer (and Buk missile manufacturer) Almaz-Antey announced the results of its own investigation. The manufacturer said it had fired Buk missiles at a decommissioned jet plane, similar to a Boeing 777, so they could examine the pattern of impact. They said the results demonstrated that MH17 was shot down by an old form of Buk missile – a 9M38 – which was not in use by the Russian army, and is a decade past the 'use-by date' intended by the manufacturer. The last missile of this type was produced in the Soviet Union in 1986 and Russia decommissioned its remaining 9M38s in 2011, Russian state-sponsored Sputnik News reported. \\"The results of the experiment completely contradict the results of the Dutch commission on the type of missile and the location of its launch,\\" Almaz-Antey CEO Yan Novikov told journalists. His company's report also said the missile was fired from near the village of Zaroschenskoye – an area reportedly under Ukrainian control at the time. However they produced no eyewitness evidence of a Buk in that region at the time, in contrast to the significant amount of eyewitness, video and photographic evidence of a Buk in rebel-controlled territory on the day MH17 came down. And Dutch TV reporter Rudy Bouma Tweeted that he had visited Zaroschenskoye recently and \\"villagers didn't witness (a) Buk launch previous to (the) crash\\", though the Ukrainian army was around 5km away at the time. The Dutch report was not intended to address \\"questions of blame or liability\\", a DSB spokesman said. However one DSB source told the Dutch newspaper Volkskrant the BUK missile is developed and made in Russia, and \\"It can be assumed that the rebels would not be able to operate such a device. I suspect the involvement of former Russian military officials\\". World leaders react, vow justice Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop released a joint statement welcoming the findings, saying their thoughts and prayers were with the families and loved ones of those killed on the flight. Ms Bishop said the reports findings provided critical insight into the incident. \\"It determines the plane was shot down by a surface-to-air missile, consistent with the Australian government's initial assessment of the incident,\\" she said. The criminal investigation into who was responsible for the tragedy is run separately by an international 'Joint Investigation Team', including Australian federal police, who recently told Fairfax it may be another year before the case is ready for prosecution. And in any case it is still unclear where the case could be tried. Russia vetoed a proposal for an international tribunal that was proposed by Australia and the Netherlands at the United Nations in July. \\"We, and other partner governments of the Joint Investigation Team, remain absolutely committed to seeing justice done,\\" said Ms Bishop. Malaysia's prime minister Najib Razak said countries must work together to hold those responsible for \\"this murderous\\" act after speaking with Mr Turnbull about the MH17 findings, and labelled the attack as \\"unforseeable\\". \\"Fifteen months have passed but our commitment to bringing the perpetrators to justice remains as strong as it was on that fateful day when hundreds of innocent people lost their lives in a conflict that was not theirs,\\" Mr Najib said in a statement. \\"This was an unforeseeable act and, of the 160 flights that were on MH17's general route that day, not one was advised by the relevant authorities about any specific threat,\\" he said. The White House released a statement calling the report an \\"important milestone in the effort to hold accountable those responsible.\\" with Lindsay Murdoch, AAP ||||| Search Results Time displayed is based on local departure/arrival city time.

Anna Nicole Smith gained notoriety after her short lived marriage to what Texas oil billionaire sparked a major court case, which continues to this day?","completion":"Anna Nicole Smith, born Vickie Lynn Hogan on November 28, 1967, was an American model, actress, and television personality who became widely known after her high-profile marriage to a Texas oil billionaire. She gained notoriety when she married J. Howard Marshall II on June 27, 1994, at the age of 26, while he was 89 years old. J. Howard Marshall II, born January 24, 1905, was a businessman, oil tycoon, and lawyer who made a significant fortune in the oil industry. He was a co-founder of the Great Northern Oil Company, a prominent shareholder in Koch Industries, and held various other investments. At the time of their marriage, he was considered one of the wealthiest men in the United States. The circumstances of Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall II's 14-month-long marriage sparked widespread media attention due to the age difference and the notable contrast in their public images. Anna was a former Playmate of the Year and had been making a name for herself as a model, while J. Howard Marshall II was a successful and respected businessman. J. Howard Marshall II died on August 4, 1995, which led to the beginning of a protracted legal battle over his sizeable estate, which was estimated to be worth over 1 billion. The primary parties involved in the lawsuit were Smith, who had been left out of the will and trust documents; J. Howard Marshall II's son, E. Pierce Marshall; and other family members. Anna Nicole Smith asserted that her late husband had verbally promised to leave her half of his estate, and she filed a lawsuit in Texas probate court against E. Pierce Marshall, alleging that he had interfered with her rightful inheritance. The case received extensive media coverage as it unfolded over more than a decade with several state and federal court rulings, including two trips to the United States Supreme Court. Numerous appeals, cross-appeals, and procedural complexities made it one of the most complicated and longstanding probate court disputes in American legal history. Despite Anna Nicole Smith's untimely death on February 8, 2007, the legal battle over J. Howard Marshall II's estate continued. Her estate, represented by her executor, Howard K. Stern, remained engaged in the lawsuit. The legal dispute eventually reached a conclusion in 2011 when the United States Supreme Court ruled that Anna Nicole Smith's estate was not entitled to any of the money from J. Howard Marshall II's fortune. To this day, the marriage of Anna Nicole Smith and J. Howard Marshall II is often remembered as one of the most scandalous and headline-grabbing celebrity unions in recent history. The convoluted legal battle that ensued after Marshall's death has left a lasting impact on the American legal landscape and provided an enduring testament to the complexities of inheritance law and the administration of vast fortunes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hannibal saves Face after enlisting fellow Ranger B.A. Baracus (Quinton Jackson), driving to the rescue in BA's modified GMC Vandura van.[9] Pursued by Tuco, they stop at a nearby Army Hospital to recruit the services of eccentric pilot Howling Mad Murdock (Sharlto Copley). They flee in a medical helicopter, chased by Tuco, in a dogfight that leaves BA with a fear of flying. The battle ends when they lure Tuco's helicopter into American airspace, where it is shot down by a USAF F-22 Raptor for trespassing. Eight years later in Iraq, Hannibal is contacted by CIA Special Activities Division operative Lynch (Patrick Wilson), who assigns them a black ops mission to recover U.S. Treasury plates and over 1 billion in cash from Iraqi insurgents slated to move it out of Baghdad in an armored convoy. Hannibal's commanding officer, General Morrison (Gerald McRaney), consents to the operation but Face's former girlfriend, Defense Criminal Investigative Service Capt. Charissa Sosa (Jessica Biel), tries to discourage the team against getting the plates. The mission is successful; when the team returns to base, however, the money and Morrison's vehicle are destroyed by Brock Pike (Brian Bloom) and his men from the private security firm Black Forest. Without Morrison (the only proof that they were authorized to act), Hannibal, Face, Murdock, and BA are court martialed and they are sentenced to ten years in separate prisons and dishonorably discharged. Sosa also ended up court-martialed and is demoted to lieutenant.

Lloyd (Woody Harrelson). But Lloyd shoots Max before passing out from being gassed by the thieves. Max survives and tells Lola to get the diamond. She does, leaving in its place the one-dollar bill that she had received as a tip for washing the agents' windshield (while in disguise). Max and Lola then fly to Paradise Island in The Bahamas. Agent Lloyd shows up 6 months later and accuses Burdett of planning to steal the third Napoleon diamond, which is on a cruise ship that will be docking for a week on the island. He denies this, and unwittingly turns the tables and befriends the frustrated detective Lloyd, showing him the pleasures that Paradise Island has to offer, even paying for the most expensive suite, the bridge suite, for as long as Lloyd is there. Lloyd, out of his element, adapts quickly to the easy-going Caribbean lifestyle and partners up with Sophia, a local constable, to try and capture Max at last when he steals the diamond, which Max visits and later gives in to the temptation to steal. Henri MoorÃ©, a powerful, popular tycoon thought of by some as a gangster, learns of Burdett's impressive history as a thief and offers him additional island-life benefits and pleasures in return for stealing the diamond. Burdett, still wanting the diamond for himself, pretends to work with MoorÃ©, and gives him a fake plan as to how he would steal the diamond (which he had earlier related to Stan), having no trouble keeping ahead of his nemesis in the meantime.

Miss Anthony is best known for starring in shows such as Auf Wiedersehen, Pet and in Three Up, Two Down, on which she made £2,500 a week.

The correct choice is 'David Price' as this is a human name and aligns with the context of marriage. The other choices are incorrect due to various reasons: - 'Anthony' refers to Lysette Anthony herself so it would be wrong to say she married herself. - 'Auf Wiedersehen, Pet' and 'Three Up, Two Down' are TV shows she has worked on, not someone she could have married. - 'Britain' is a country, not a person and therefore can't be someone she could have married. - 'Eighties TV' is a period or kind of TV, not a person, so it cannot be the object of marriage. - 'Lysette Anthony' is her own name, she could not marry herself. - 'Luc Leestemaker' and 'Simon Boswell' are both humans and potential valid choices, but there is no information in the passage to suggest she was married to them.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks.

The Portuguese Restoration War was the name given by nineteenth-century Romantic historians to the war between Portugal and Spain that began with the Portuguese revolution of 1640 and ended with the Treaty of Lisbon in 1668. The revolution of 1640 ended the 60-year Iberian Union. The period from 1640 to 1668 was marked by periodic skirmishes between Portugal and Spain, as well as short episodes of more serious warfare, much of it occasioned by Spanish and Portuguese entanglements with non-Iberian powers. Spain was involved in the Thirty Years' War until 1648 and the Franco-Spanish War until 1659, while Portugal was involved in the Dutch-Portuguese War until 1663. In the seventeenth century and afterwards, this period of sporadic conflict was simply known, in Portugal and elsewhere, as the Acclamation War.

In response, the UK has become a militarized police state as British government forces round up and detain immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the Fishes, a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic. Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee, which Theo obtains from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. The transit papers require that the bearer must be accompanied, so Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives them and former midwife Miriam towards the coast to a boat. They are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What were much more varied in later periods? ? Chinese imperial tombs are typically approached by a \\"spirit road\\", sometimes several kilometres long, lined by statues of guardian figures, based on both humans and animals. A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble. In Han tombs the guardian figures are mainly of \\"lions\\" and \\"chimeras\\"; in later periods they are much more varied. A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones. The walls of both the offering and burial chambers of tombs of commoners from the Han period may be decorated with stone slabs carved or engraved in very low relief with crowded and varied scenes, which are now the main indication of the style of the lost palace frescoes of the period. A cheaper option was to use large clay tiles which were carved or impressed before firing. After the introduction of Buddhism, carved \\"funerary couches\\" featured similar scenes, now mostly religious. During the Han Dynasty, miniature ceramic models of buildings were often made to accompany the deceased in the graves; to them is owed much of what is known of ancient Chinese architecture.

She and I did everything together pretty much after that, and she was my favorite person in the world. I looked forward to seeing her when I'd get home from my hitches. But slowly I found myself thinking about her in ways that weren't pg. Pretty soon, I realized I had deep feelings for her. I realized this after I found myself getting jealous of men she brought around. Id stare at her when she wasn't looking. Bought her gifts, etc. She was always on my mind.

Whether you're a three-pack-a-day smoker who doesn't like being lectured to about the health risks, or you're a person who doesn't touch cigarettes and wouldn't smoke one if you were offered a Ferrari in exchange, picture this:. Imagine, for a moment, that cigarettes had never been invented. And that in 2013 an eager entrepreneur went to the Food and Drug Administration seeking approval for a new product -- cigarettes -- that he wanted to sell to the American people. Imagine that the Food and Drug Administration, taking its time and doing its homework, came up with all the currently available medical evidence about the dangers of smoking. Whether you're a smoker or not, you know what the FDA's response would be to that hypothetical entrepreneur:. They'd laugh him out of the room. They'd ask him why he was wasting their time. They might, if they were feisty enough, point out the deadly impact of what he was asking them to authorize, and say to him:. \\"There's a legal term for knowingly causing death to people. In asking us to approve your product, sir, are you not setting us up to become accessories to murder?\\" But cigarettes are not a new product. They are perfectly legal in all 50 states, and they're going to stay that way. Which is why two cigarette-related events last week are so instructive. The federal government gave up its highly publicized battle to make every package of cigarettes carry large, gruesome-looking illustrations. FDA changes course on graphic warning labels for cigarettes. The proposed illustrations -- they included images of a diseased lung, of a tracheotomy hole in a man's throat, of rotting teeth -- were rolled out with great fanfare in 2010. The government wanted the illustrations to cover the entire top half -- front and back -- of every pack of cigarettes sold in the United States. Last week, faced with arguments from the tobacco industry that the mandatory images violated free speech rights -- the cigarette companies said the images were \\"intended to elicit loathing, disgust and repulsion\\" -- the government backed down. Attorney General Eric Holder wrote that the government will not fight the case in the Supreme Court. The FDA will instead reevaluate the proposed labels. Last week's second event took place in New York, where Mayor Michael Bloomberg asked for a law that would force merchants to hide cigarettes on sale in their stores. \\"Hide\\" in a literal sense. The legislation would mandate that any cigarettes sold in a store would have to be concealed in a drawer, or in a cabinet, or behind a curtain -- it would be unlawful for the packs of cigarettes to be visible to anyone visiting the store. Bloomberg's point is that the more difficult it is to purchase cigarettes, the fewer packs will be sold, and the healthier citizens will become. Bloomberg: Nanny-in-chief or health crusader? Bloomberg's proposal, and the case of the ghastly illustrations, both underline America's bizarrely bifurcated relationship with cigarettes:. The country -- smokers and nonsmokers alike -- realizes the dangers involved. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says that around 443,000 people a year die because of cigarette use. But the product is as legal as a loaf of bread or a jar of pickles. So the cigarette manufacturers have a point when they say the government is overstepping by demanding nauseating images on their packages. Free speech does not only refer to our right to say anything we choose; it also refers to our protection from having the government force us to say things against our will. Even convicted killers, when speaking in court before sentencing, are not required to say they are guilty. The government has a right to create, publish and broadcast the strongest anti-smoking campaigns it can come up with, but the cigarette companies make a compelling case in saying that, as long as their product is legal, they should not be forced to print repellent images on their packages. (And -- who knows? -- the federal government, in deciding not to fight the package illustrations battle in the Supreme Court, may be wary of what could happen there. What if the Supreme Court not only ruled against the proposed graphic illustrations -- but additionally, on similar grounds, opened up the question of whether the text-only warning messages on cigarette packs, the ones that have been there since the 1960s, also are an incursion on free speech?) In New York, Bloomberg's heart may be in the right place, but merchants who want to sell cigarettes should be justifiably puzzled: If any product is not legal, then they should be barred from stocking it, but as long as it is, how can anyone presume to tell them where to display it -- or, more to the point, that they can't display it? It all comes down to this:. While well-intentioned attempts to curb smoking may appear bold and decisive, they are in the end timid. The big and most effective step -- outlawing cigarettes on the grounds that they undeniably, in the long run, sicken and kill the people who smoke them, and those around them -- is not going to happen. Politicians would be terrified to do it -- there are an estimated 45 million smokers in the United States, and no one is going to risk alienating them by completely cutting them off from cigarettes. In an already shaky economy, the repercussions from shutting down the tobacco industry -- the jobs suddenly lost -- would be, to put it mildly, highly problematic from a political and real-world standpoint. The memory of Prohibition would undoubtedly be on lawmakers' minds. The government once tried to take from people something they had been accustomed to, something that had been legal: alcohol. The outcome was anything but pretty. If there really were the political will to end cigarette use, there are ways. Each state sets its own laws for the minimum age to purchase cigarettes -- in most states, it's 18. If states decided to raise the age to, say, 80, that would do it. But the chances are zero. Like it or not, the country has painted itself into a corner. Cigarettes kill. They will continue to. If they were a new product, they'd never make it to market. Don't bet against them still being here a century from now. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Cigarettes, although deadly, are a legal product manufactured and sold across the United States. This legal status creates a complex relationship between the government, tobacco companies, and public health initiatives. There are well-intentioned attempts to curb smoking, such as Mayor Michael Bloomberg's proposal to hide cigarettes in stores and the FDA's now-abandoned plan to put graphic warning labels on cigarette packages, but they often encounter pushback from the tobacco industry citing their free speech rights. Despite the dangers of smoking and the alarming number of people who die annually due to cigarette use, a complete ban on cigarettes is highly unlikely. Lawmakers may be reluctant to anger the estimated 45 million smokers in the United States or contribute to job loss in the tobacco industry. Additionally, the messy aftermath of the Prohibition era serves as a cautionary tale. Cigarettes may be a harmful and potentially lethal product, but they are likely to persist in society for the foreseeable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer the above question based on the context below: William Etty was born in 1787 in York, the son of a miller and baker. He showed artistic promise from an early age, but his family were financially insecure, and at the age of 12 he left school to become an apprentice printer in Hull. On completing his seven-year indenture he moved to London \\"with a few pieces of chalk-crayons in colours\\", with the aim of emulating the Old Masters and becoming a history painter. Etty gained acceptance to the Royal Academy Schools in early 1807. After a year spent studying under renowned portrait painter Thomas Lawrence, Etty returned to the Royal Academy, drawing at the life class and copying other paintings. In 1821 the Royal Academy exhibited one of Etty's works, The Arrival of Cleopatra in Cilicia (also known as The Triumph of Cleopatra). The painting was extremely well received, and many of Etty's fellow artists greatly admired him. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, ahead of John Constable. He became well respected for his ability to capture flesh tones accurately in painting and for his fascination with contrasts in skin tones. Following the exhibition of Cleopatra, Etty attempted to reproduce its success, concentrating on painting further history paintings containing nude figures. He exhibited 15 paintings at the Summer Exhibition in the 1820s (including Cleopatra), and all but one contained at least one nude figure. In so doing Etty became the first English artist to treat nude studies as a serious art form in their own right, capable of being aesthetically attractive and of delivering moral messages. Although some nudes by foreign artists were held in private English collections, Britain had no tradition of nude painting, and the display and distribution of nude material to the public had been suppressed since the 1787 Proclamation for the Discouragement of Vice. The supposed prurient reaction of the lower classes to his nude paintings caused concern throughout the 19th century. Many critics condemned his repeated depictions of female nudity as...

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person who writes a note containing frequent usage of the word \\"cunt\\"? ? In 1935 England, Briony Tallis is a 13-year-old from a wealthy family. She has just completed writing her first play to mark her brother's homecoming and plans to stage it later that day with her visiting cousins. Looking out of her bedroom window, she spies on her older sister, Cecilia, and the housekeeper's son, Robbie Turner, on whom Briony has a crush. Cecilia is undressing and dips into the fountain pool; a moment later, she climbs out, her undergarments wet, all while Robbie watches. Cecilia had gone to the pond to fill a vase, Robbie grabbed one of the handles, and it broke. A part fell into the pond, and Cecilia jumped in to retrieve it, but to Briony, it looked as if Robbie had ordered Cecilia to undress and go under the water. Robbie drafts a series of notes to Cecilia apologizing for the incident, namely breaking the vase and laughing about it. One contains an explicit expression of his sexual desire for her, including frequent and crude usage of the word \\"cunt\\": he writes it only as a joke, and it makes him laugh to himself. He writes another, more formal letter, and asks Briony to deliver it. Only after she has gone does he realise he has given her the explicit letter. Briony reads the letter before giving it to Cecilia. Later, she describes it to her older visiting cousin, Lola, who calls Robbie a \\"sex maniac\\". Paul Marshall, a visiting friend of Briony's older brother's and a chocolate magnate, introduces himself to the visiting cousins and appears to be attracted to Lola.

What is a sentence that describe this data?","completion":"The Punter is a unique coffee shop that offers a distinct flavor of Japanese cuisine, targeting to those who enjoy different cultural experiences. It is positioned in the middle to high end of the market, with the usual price range per head falling between £20-25, indicating that it recognizes and caters for customers looking to indulge in a fairly premium dining experience. However, it seems to yield a modest customer rating, securing only 3 out of 5 stars. This might imply that although its unique selling proposition - Japanese food in a coffee shop setting – is appreciated by many, there may be aspects of its service, food quality, or ambiance that leave room for improvement. It's also noteworthy that The Punter is not considered to be a family-friendly venue, suggesting that it is better suited for adult diners maybe focusing on providing a venue for casual meetings, solo diners, or people looking to relax, study or work. Its vicinity to Café Sicilia might mean that it aims to grab the attention of customers from an already established and perhaps similar venue, possibly encouraging a healthy local competition. This location could also offer some benefits in terms of driving footfall from potential customers who enjoy exploring different coffee shops and food experiences.

Under 100 words is a good title length. Input: Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infects swine intestinal cells causing enteric disease. Research has shown that the entry into these cells is through porcine aminopeptidase N (pAPN) receptor. To gain insights into mechanisms of PEDV-pAPN interactions, the present study aimed at identifying the domain that is critical for PEDV binding. To this end, NIH3T3 cell lines constitutively expressing pAPN or pAPN mutants were generated. The mutants were; domain VII deletion mutant and domains IV-VI deletion mutant. In the latter, domain VII was linked to the transmembrane segment through domain III. Results showed PEDV infection was restricted to pAPN and pAPN domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells. Further, reducing PEDV titre 10 fold resulted in 37.8% decrease in foci indicating positive correlation. A time course test at 12, 24, 36, 48 and 60 h showed that foci increased 6 fold in the overall time range. Also, PEDV harvested from pAPN or domain VII expressing NIH3T3 cells was induced indirect plaques in Vero cells confirming successful entry and replication. Collectively, our results demonstrate that PEDV recognizes pAPN and that the main interactive point is lodged within domain VII of the pAPN. These findings are important for therapeutic development as well as creating a platform for future studies on PEDV.

Movie title: Cannibal Holocaust Context: In New York City, a TV news reporter recounts the details surrounding the mysterious disappearance of a documentary film crew who has gone missing in the jungles of South America for two months. The reporter introduces them as Alan Yates (Gabriel Yorke) the director; Faye Daniels (Francesca Ciardi) his girlfriend and script girl; and friends Jack Anders (Perry Pirkanen) and Mark Tomaso (Luca Giorgio Barbareschi) who work as cameramen. They were last seen departing from the remote Columbian town of Leticia which sits deep in the jungle on the border points between Brazil and Peru, to document the existence of cannibal tribes in the jungle. NYU's noted anthropologist Professor Harold Monroe (Robert Kerman) is assigned the task by the university to find out what happened to the conceited, and over-confident film crew.In the jungles of South America, a group of Columbian soldiers, led by a balding Negro lieutenant, are on patrol when they stumble upon a group of natives engaged in a spot of cannibalism; eating human remains. The soldiers attack and kill many natives while the rest flee. One fights back by shooting one soldier with a poison dart, hitting him in the arm before he is killed by the other soldiers. Despite the quick medical treatment, the soldier dies soon afterwards. The Columbian Lieutenant then meets with Professor Monroe who arrives by plane at the soldiers' outpost on the Amazon. The Lieutenant shows Monroe the captured native which they identify as a Yacumo, for to the soldiers, a Yacumo prisoner is like a ticket into the 'Green Inferno', the inhospitable jungle the South Americans call it. The Yacumo is in possession of a cigarette lighter which Monroe confirms belonged to Faye Daniels. Monroe is assigned a guide, a Venezuelan named Chaco (Ricardo Fuentes), who explains to Monroe that a tattoo borne by the prisoner indicates that he is the son of a shaman, and that the Yacumo are not really cannibals.

Peter Reid says the inaugural Indian Super League heralds a time for India to shed its ‘poor boy image’. The 58-year-old former England international midfielder is manager of Mumbai City who kick off the new season on October 12 against Atletico de Kolkata. Organisers hope this is the start of a new dawn in India with the launch of the high-profile ISL and the country hosting the Fifa U17 World Cup in 2017. Peter Reid meets his star player Nicolas Anelka ahead of the beginning of the Indian Super League. The former France international is mobbed by fans on his arrival to play for Mumbai City. The league has taken three years to get off the ground, and those involved hope it will help loosen cricket’s stranglehold on India’s sporting public. Similar to the steps taken by the USA’s NASL in the 1970s, the league will boast some big names, albeit ageing ones, from Europe, with Freddie Ljungberg, Nicolas Anelka, Robert Pires, Alessandro del Piero, Mikael Silvestre and David Trezeguet among them. The league represents a huge investment with money coming from India’s booming businesses and Bollywood stars but the aim is to attract younger generations to participate and sustain the interest across the country. Reid said: ‘I feel this is the right time for football in India to shed its poor boy image. This is what happened in England when open terraces went and seating was forced on the teams. The rate of a ticket is high but, now, everything comes at a price. ‘The key message is that football can make everything attainable. We are working with the community too and encouraging their participation. I’m a big cricket fan and cricket is huge here but we want football to become another major part of their lives.’ World Cup winner Marco Materazzi has come to India as player-manager for Chennaiyin FC. Former Arsenal forward Robert Pires (R) is another superstar to join the inaugural ISL. R‘We went to watch a game the other day and there was real mixture of people in the crowd. All aspects of life and that’s what we want football to be about. It’s a game for the people and we want the people of India to embrace the sport and fall in love with the game,' he added. Reid has welcomed Anelka and Ljungberg to Mumbai over the past few days as excitement mounts for the season’s kick-off and he insists he aims to entertain but win. ‘I have a philosophy and I like to use the wingers. But I have to look at my players and play according to strength. If I have players who pass the ball, then we pass the ball. But in these conditions (heat and humidity), we need to adapt well, not pass the ball excessively. Anelka is looking to resurrect his career after leaving the Premier League under a cloud of controversy. Former Arsenal midfielder Freddie Ljungberg rests during a training session ahead of the season's start. ‘We want to be able to adapt our style to win. I am not preparing anyone in Mumbai City to face Barcelona. However, what people forget about Barcelona is their pressing game, the way they get the ball back. If we can get that kind of shape at the back, I would be happy. ‘It’s a simple process, when you have the ball, keep it...when you don’t, try and get the ball.’ Talking to the Times of India, Reid added: ‘I am coming here to coach players I don’t know. Obviously I know Nickolas Anelka, I know Freddie Ljunberg, but the Indians, I am learning. ‘It is a new league, it’s exciting. The players are getting to know me.’ India icon Sachin Tendulkar added to the romance of the occasion by bringing in former East Manchester FC player Duleep Menon to play for his franchise Kerala Blasters, who are coached by David James. Menon, 27, has been drafted in after impressing during a friendly playing for Central Excise against Blasters in Thrissur. Cricket legend Sachin Tendulkar has started his own franchise, Kerala Blasters, coached by David James. Ex-Liverpool playmaker Luis Garcis shakes hands with former cricket captain and Atletico De Kolkata co-owner Sourav Ganguly.

He played college football at Miami University (Ohio), and was drafted by the Steelers in the first round (11th overall) of the 2004 NFL Draft. Roethlisberger earned the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year Award in 2004 and his first Pro Bowl selection in 2007. On October 26, 2014 against the Indianapolis Colts, Roethlisberger completed 40 of 49 passes for 522 yards and 6 touchdowns as the Steelers defeated the Indianapolis Colts 51-34. With the win, Roethlisberger became just the fourth quarterback in NFL history to get 100 wins in his first 150 starts. He also became the first NFL quarterback to pass for over 500 yards twice in a career. He earned AFC Offensive Player of the Week for his effort against the Colts. In the next game, a 43-23 victory over the Baltimore Ravens, he had 340 passing yards and six passing touchdowns to earn AFC Offensive Player of the Week for the second consecutive week. In the Steelers Week 15 matchup against the Atlanta Falcons, Roethlisberger completed 27 of 35 passes for 360 yards in a 27-20 victory. The victory made Roethlisberger only the sixth quarterback in NFL history to have defeated at least 31 different teams, joining Tom Brady, Drew Brees, Kerry Collins, Brett Favre, and Peyton Manning; like Brady, Roethlisberger has only played with one team and thus hasn't played against the Steelers. The Steelers lost 41-38 in Roethlisberger's only other matchup against Atlanta in 2006, and he was suspended for the Steelers 15-9 overtime victory against the Falcons in 2010. During 2014, Roethlisberger passed for career highs in yards with 4,952, completion percentage with 67.1, completions with 408, and attempts with 608. Roethlisberger also matched his career high in passing touchdowns with 32, as well as posting a passer rating of 103.3, the second highest of his career. His 4,952 yards were tied for most on the season with Drew Brees, but Roethlisberger reached the mark with fewer completions. The Steelers had a 11-5 record and finished first in the AFC North. They then lost in the Wild Card round of the playoffs against the Baltimore Ravens by a score of 30-17. He was named to his third career Pro Bowl for the 2014 season. He was ranked 26th by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2015. anything else interesting in the article?","completion":"In this article, it talks about a football player named Big Ben, who is a quarterback for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

Coming off their comeback win over the Chiefs, the undefeated Broncos traveled to Ford Field to face the winless Detroit Lions on Sunday Night Football. After a scoreless first quarter, the Broncos grabbed the lead late in the second quarter, with running back Ronnie Hillman rushing for a 1-yard touchdown. With 1:07 remaining before halftime, the Lions countered, with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Joique Bell. It was initially ruled as a fumble, but after review, it was reversed to a touchdown as a result of Bell breaking the plane of the goal line. However, Broncos' cornerback Aqib Talib blocked the extra point attempt by former Broncos (now Lions) placekicker Matt Prater, leaving the score at 7-6. In the closing seconds of the first half, the Broncos responded, with quarterback Peyton Manning connecting on a 45-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Demaryius Thomas on a 4th-and-1. Following a questionable fumble by Thomas on the Broncos' opening possession of the second half, Lions' quarterback Matthew Stafford threw a 16-yard touchdown pass to running back Ameer Abdullah. However, the Broncos' defense denied a two-point conversion attempt by Bell that would have tied the game. Each team alternated punts through the next five possessions, until Broncos' linebacker Shaquil Barrett forced a fumble off Stafford near midfield. However, the Broncos had to settle for a 48-yard field goal by placekicker Brandon McManus at the 7:55 mark of the fourth quarter. The Lions were attempting to grab their first lead of the game, however, on the eighth play of the drive, Stafford was intercepted by Broncos' safety David Bruton. Five plays later, the Broncos expanded their lead, with Manning throwing an 11-yard touchdown pass to tight end Owen Daniels just before the two-minute warning to put the game out of reach. That was Daniels' first touchdown as a Bronco. Without any timeouts, the Lions advanced to as far as the Broncos' 15-yard line with 34 seconds remaining, but turned the football over on downs.

PUBLISHED:. 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013. |. UPDATED:. 12:23 EST, 25 March 2013. Economic advisers to the German government more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth today, blaming a sharp fourth-quarter contraction and weak prospects for foreign trade and investment. The advisers, known in Germany as the 'wise men', predicted the economy would almost grind to a halt this year, growing just 0.3 per cent compared to 0.7 per cent in 2012. In October they had forecast Europe's largest economy to expand 0.8 per cent in 2013, but data has since shown that it shrank by 0.6 per cent in the last three months of 2012. Economic advisers to the German government, housed in the Reichstag, more than halved their forecast for 2013 growth. Foreign trade, traditionally the main driver of German growth, would subtract 0.3 percentage points from German gross domestic product (GDP) this year, the advisers said. Demand for Germany's goods has weakened as austerity measures and recession take their toll on demand in other members of the euro zone, where Germany sends 40 per cent of its shipments. The advisers said investment was unlikely to make any significant contribution to growth in the first half of 2013. They see capital investment dropping by 3 per cent over the year, a slight improvement compared with 2012, when firms invested 4.8 per cent less in machinery and equipment. Some German companies are making cuts, with Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year. Retailer Metro has said it would reduce overall investment in the shortened 2013 year to below the 954 million euros it put into its business in the first nine months of 2012. The advisers said growth would primarily come from domestic demand, with private consumption increasing by 0.7 per cent and government spending rising by an upwardly revised 1.7 per cent. 'Especially household final consumption expenditure should continue to display a robust development, given that the labour market is still remarkably stable,' the advisers said in a statement. Germany's jobless rate is close to its lowest since the country reunited more than two decades ago and the number of Germans out of work fell in February. Air Berlin, the country's second biggest carrier, saying it would focus on savings this year. In addition, inflation is moderate, wages are rising and paltry interest rates are giving consumers little incentive to save. Data due out later this week is expected to bolster the advisers' expectations by showing that the number of unemployed Germans fell by 4,000 in March and consumer sentiment held steady heading into April. The influential Ifo survey last week showed German business morale fell in March, breaking a four-month run of gains and highlighting concerns the reignited debt crisis in the euro zone will test Germany's resilience. Consumer price inflation will ease to 1.7 per cent this year from 2.0 per cent last year and the unemployment rate will edge up to 6.9 per cent from 6.8 per cent, the advisers said, which is still near post-reunification lows. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"1.

A:","completion":"To answer this question, we consider the main function of the pupil: to regulate the amount of light that enters the eye. When it is night time, the environment is darker, and there is less light available. In order to see better in the dark, the eye will need to capture as much light as possible. Step 1: Identify the environmental condition - It is night time, which means less light is available. Step 2: Determine the pupil's response to the condition - As there is less light, the pupil needs to get bigger, i.e., to dilate, so that it can let in more light for better vision. Step 3: Compare the night time condition to normal condition - In normal or daylight conditions, the pupil size is smaller because there is enough light available and the eye doesn't need to capture as much light.

Question: whose family has left for the Appalachian Mountains and is caught in a traffic jam? Movie title: Deep Impact Movie plot: On May 10, 1998, teenage amateur astronomer Leo Biederman[5] discovers an unusual object near the stars Mizar and Alcor at a star party in Richmond, Virginia with his school's astronomy club. His teacher alerts astronomer Dr. Marcus Wolf, who realizes that the object is a comet on a collision course with Earth. Wolf dies in a car accident before he can alert the world. One year later, MSNBC journalist Jenny Lerner investigates the sudden resignation of Secretary of the Treasury Alan Rittenhouse and his connection to \\"Ellie\\", supposedly a mistress. After interviewing Rittenhouse, she is intercepted by the FBI and brought before President Tom Beck. Lerner realizes that Ellie is not a mistress but an acronym: \\"E.L.E.\\", for \\"Extinction-Level Event\\". Due to Lerner's investigation, President Beck makes an announcement earlier than planned: the comet named Wolf-Biederman (named after Wolf and Biederman, mistakenly assuming Leo Biederman was killed along with Professor Wolf) is headed for Earth. It is 7 miles (11Â km) long, large enough to cause a mass extinction, and possibly wipe out humanity, if it hits the Earth. He also reveals that the United States and Russia have been constructing an Orion spacecraft called Messiah in orbit in order to transport a team led by Oren Monash and including veteran astronaut Spurgeon Tanner to the comet, so that its path toward Earth may be diverted using nuclear weapons. After his name is mentioned on TV, Leo speaks to the town about the discovery and how the White House thought he died alongside Wolf. After landing on the comet, the crew members plant nuclear bombs beneath the surface, but are delayed and caught in out-gassing explosions when sunlight hits the comet surface. While fleeing to the space vehicle, Monash is blinded due to direct unfiltered sunlight and suffers severe facial burns, and Gus Partenza is lost, ejected from the surface by an outflow of gas. When the bombs detonate, the ship is damaged from the blast, and the team loses contact with Earth. President Beck... Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Deep Impact,\\" the family that has left for the Appalachian Mountains and is caught in a traffic jam is the family of Jenny Lerner (portrayed by Téa Leoni), the MSNBC journalist. As the comet named Wolf-Biederman is set on a collision course with Earth, resulting in a potential Extinction-Level Event, the government initiates a lottery to select people who will be saved and relocated to underground shelters to ensure the survival of humanity. Unfortunately, Jenny's mother, Robin Lerner, is not selected in the lottery, so they decide to leave for their family's cabin in the Appalachian Mountains to seek refuge together. The plot further unfolds as Jenny's father, who has remarried after the divorce, wants to bring his new family, including his wife and baby daughter, along with them. This family dynamic adds to the tension in the midst of the crisis, as they are all caught in a traffic jam trying to escape before the disastrous comet impact occurs. The traffic jams are caused by a mass exodus of people attempting to flee to higher ground or reach their loved ones before it's too late.

Context: What is creativity? How de we define creativity? Where does creativity come from? How philosophical is the notion of creativity? Is everyone’s ‘creativity’ different? Or is it an ill conceived, simplified term that is used to describe a very specific series of neuronal & bodily reactions to certain stimuli? These are all the questions I’ve been thinking (and googling, and youtubing) since beginning this Capturing Creativity studio* and I have found some answers or maybe I’ve just found more questions: Creativity is generally defined as the ability to make new things, or come up with new ideas, it’s an ability to think outside the box, to see unique solutions and employ them in inventive ways. In this sense creativity is not always utilised when being ‘creative’, as to be creative is simply defined as the ability to make or produce something. However I guess that depends on your definition of creative, how different, unique, special, once off, un-influenced does something have to be, to be classified as creative? This is where creativity get’s tricky. It’s all well and good to be like oh this is what creativity is, so it’s easy to investigate it, but what if you don’t define that as being creative, maybe that was just following a formula, a somewhat inspired formula, but maybe it is just a formula. Creativity to most people seems to be a random mix of once off genius combined with solid skill and hard work and for us humans these percentages are unique to us. Maybe creativity to you is 90% unique idea, 5% skill and 5% hard work. Maybe creativity to you is 40% unique idea, 50% skill and 10% hard work. Maybe for you creativity doesn’t have to involve any hard work at all. For me when it comes to creativity I’m most interested in that unique idea portion; where does that unique idea come from? Is it simply random? Is it a gift from the gods? Is our unique idea just a product of a lot of subconscious effort, only made aware to us in the sense of a ‘random’ idea?

Air pollution is harmful to human beings and other living things. About 22 million people die from air pollution each year. Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do.

Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Definition: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Although 65% of people with cancer want to die at home, only about 30% are successful in doing so.1,2 A government committed to choice for patients must improve this figure.3 Developing palliative care services in primary care is essential for realising the expectations of dying people. Such services could also offer important opportunities for extending supportive humane care at an earlier stage, and to people not only with cancer but with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, motor neurone disease, and cardiac failure, for example, who also often have palliative care needs. Primary care professionals have the potential and ability to provide end of life care for most patients, given adequate training, resources, and, when needed, specialist advice.4,5 They share common values with palliative care specialists—holistic, patient centred care, delivered in the context of families and friends.6 However, until recently, apart from Macmillan general practitioners and nurse facilitators, few comprehensive workforce initiatives have been undertaken in primary care that focus on end of life care. Many cancer patients and their carers experience existential distress long before they die.7 Recognising and alleviating such suffering is important, but it often goes unrecognised or is overlooked by services focusing on the terminal phase of illnesses. Primary care teams may know patients over long periods of time. They can readily identify patients from cancer and chronic disease registers who might benefit from an early palliative care approach. Such patients could be identified by clinicians asking one simple question of themselves: “Would I be surprised if my patient were to die in the next 12 months?”8 By identifying such patients proactively we could deliver, simultaneously, active treatment and patient centred supportive care, through a team with whom many patients have a valued long term relationship. Palliative care services need to be extended to patients with non-malignant conditions who have comparable concerns to and in some cases even greater unmet needs than cancer patients.9 Progress by palliative medicine specialists is hampered by issues such as uncertainty about the most effective models of care, lack of non-cancer expertise, and concerns about pressure on specialist services. General practitioners and community nurses can lead the way in providing a palliative care approach for patients with terminal organ failure illness. The first step in such an approach is for the goals of care to be discussed and agreed. Management plans are adjusted accordingly. Effective control of symptoms and maintaining quality of life are prioritised. In the light of these important opportunities it is regrettable that the new general medical services contract has not prioritised palliative care. By day, other developments to achieve the quality indicators are taking precedence. By night and at weekends, the new unscheduled care services (which are responsible for providing care for 75% of the hours in the week) are even less well configured than previous out of hours provision to facilitate dying at home. Such services specialise in dealing with acute emergencies and, as such, often struggle to meet the medical, nursing, and social care needs of dying people and their families. These changes will greatly affect care for dying people and may increase the number of hospital admissions. However, one important initiative is gaining momentum within primary care. The Gold Standards Framework is a resource for organising proactive palliative care in the community and is supported by funding from the Cancer Services Collaborative, Macmillan Cancer Relief, and the National Lottery.10 The framework provides a detailed guide to providing holistic, patient centred care and thereby facilitates effective care in the community. Other recently initiated mechanisms for developing primary palliative care include the training of general practitioners with a special interest in palliative care and the new end of life initiative in England to improve palliative care provision by generalists and to share examples of good practice. To support such developments it is essential that primary palliative care is supported by an adequate academic base.11 This is admittedly a challenging arena in which to undertake research, but progress has been made in recent years in developing conceptual models and research architectures for studying end of life issues. Now we need to build on this work to ensure that the understanding and insights gleaned can be translated into effective interventions. Every person with a progressive illness has a right to palliative care.12 Patients desire a reassuring professional presence in the face of death. General practitioners and community nurses are trusted by patients and are in a position to provide effective, equitable, and accessible palliative care. This will happen only if they have adequate time and resources and work in a system that encourages such care. Patients who receive holistic support in the community may be less likely to require expensive admission to hospital and often futile treatments at the end of their lives.

Stephen Gregory Yzerman (; born May 9, 1965) is a Canadian retired professional ice hockey player who spent his entire NHL playing career with the Detroit Red Wings and is a member of the Hockey Hall of Fame. He is currently the general manager of the Tampa Bay Lightning. In 2017, Yzerman was named one of the '100 Greatest NHL Players' in history. Yzerman was born in Cranbrook, British Columbia, but grew up in Nepean, Ontario, (a suburb of Ottawa, now a district in that city) where he attended Bell High School and played for his hometown Nepean Raiders Junior A hockey team. After one season with the Raiders, the Peterborough Petes of the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) drafted him, and he played centre for the Petes from 1981 to 1983. The 1983 NHL Entry Draft was the first for Mike and Marian Ilitch, who had purchased the Detroit Red Wings in the summer of 1982. Jim Devellano, the Red Wings' then-general manager, wanted to draft Pat LaFontaine, who had grown up outside Detroit and played his junior hockey in the area. However, when the New York Islanders selected LaFontaine third overall, Devellano \\"settled\\" on Yzerman, drafting him fourth. The Red Wings were prepared to send Yzerman back to Peterborough for one more year, but \\"after one (training camp) season, you knew he was a tremendous hockey player,\\" said Ken Holland, the current Red Wings general manager who was then a minor league goaltender for the Wings during Yzerman's rookie training camp. Yzerman tallied 39 goals and 87 points in his rookie season and finished second in Calder Memorial Trophy (rookie of the year) voting. That season, Yzerman also became the first 18-year-old to play in an NHL All-Star Game (18 years, 267 days) since the current format was adopted in 1969. This stood as an NHL record for 27 years until Jeff Skinner broke it by eight days.

In the late 1950s his family performed publicly where his father, Stuart, played saxophone, his mother, Voi, on piano and his older brother, Todd Hunter (born 1951), on guitar with Marc providing drums. He also grew up with two younger brothers, Ross and Brett. Hunter remembered, \\"We got guitars for Christmas one year, I broke mine but Todd played his. In August 1982 Dragon reformed with the line-up of Marc, Todd, Hewson, Jacobsen and Robert Taylor on guitar (ex-Mammal) for a national Class Reunion tour.

It was co-written by Marc, Todd and the latter's then-girlfriend, Johanna Pigott; and had Mansfield producing. Soon after Mansfield joined Dragon on keyboards and as a songwriter. In June 1984 the group's next album, Body and the Beat, which was produced by Mansfield and Carey Taylor, was released and peaked at No. 5. The group provided \\"a much fuller, more rock-oriented sound... [it] was a polished, contemporary sounding Adult Oriented Rock rock album.\\" After a tour in support of the album, Hewson left to return to New Zealand, he died of a heroin overdose in January 1985.

The line-up of Hunter, Borich, Paul Christie on bass guitar (ex-Mondo Rock), Richard Harvey on drums (ex-Divinyls) and Joe Walsh on guitar and lead vocals (of the Eagles), recorded that group's fourth live album, You Need Professional Help (1985), during the tour. Hunter issued his third solo album, Communication, in September 1985 with various session musicians used: Jeff \\"Skunk\\" Baxter, Kirk Lorange, Mark Punch and Peter Walker on guitars, Todd Hunter and Phil Scorgie on bass guitar, Allan Mansfield and Don Walker on keyboards, and Mark Kennedy and Ricky Fataar on drums. Mansfield produced the album, which McFarlane described as \\"a polished set of Adult Oriented Rock (AOR) songs.\\" Its title track had been released as a single in 1984.

Given those answer options, answer the question: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything. Of course I lose my temper. Self improvement is a constant process.

Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without a refinanced loan unlike Kayla because OPTIONS: A). Sarah had a worse credit score.; B). Kayla had a worse credit score.;","completion":"To determine the appropriate ending for the sentence, let's first analyze the context. The sentence mentions that Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without refinancing her loan, unlike Kayla, which implies that there must be a difference between Sarah and Kayla's situations that allowed for this outcome. Now, let's evaluate the two options: A) Sarah had a worse credit score. B) Kayla had a worse credit score. Credit score typically plays a role in determining whether or not someone is eligible for car payment reductions. A higher credit score generally implies a better financial standing and a lower risk for lenders, making them more likely to approve reductions. On the other hand, a lower credit score signifies a greater risk for lenders, making it less likely for them to approve reductions. Given this context, option B seems to be the most appropriate ending for the sentence, as it highlights the difference in their situations and explains why Sarah was able to get a car payment reduction without refinancing her loan, unlike Kayla.

Q:I can use this background: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] Now, I have a new situation: Rob is an environmental scientist. He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D.

In the Kenya-Tanzania border Kenyan grassland gradually merges into Tanzanian forest. Though they had similar soil to start with millions of years ago, today they are two different habitats. At present, Kenya has one of the largest contiguous grassland in Africa. On the other hand, Tanzania boasts one of the largest forest cover in Africa. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which place plant roots would play greater role in soil development, Kenya or Tanzania? Hint: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Answer:","completion":"In Kenya, plant roots would play a greater role in soil development compared to Tanzania. Although both grasslands and forests contribute organic matter to the soil, the deep and fibrous grass root systems in Kenya's grasslands contribute significantly to soil development. The frequent fires also stimulate even greater contributions from the grass roots. In contrast, Tanzania's forests have a thinner A-horizon, with the majority of organic matter coming from the fallen leaves on the forest floor (O horizon). The increased acidity in forests also inhibits certain soil organisms, preventing them from mixing the surface litter into the mineral soil, which contributes to less participation of plant roots in soil development compared to grasslands."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Choose your answer from: --Use apple juice as a marinade. --Use pickle juice as a marinade....I think the answer is","completion":"\\"Use pickle juice as a marinade.\\" Pickles are known for their tangy flavor because they are soaked in vinegar or another kind of sour (aka tangy) liquid. When you marinate meat in pickle juice, it helps the meat to soak up that yummy tangy flavor. On the other hand, apple juice is more sweet than tangy. If you marinated meat in apple juice, it would make the meat taste a bit sweet, not tangy. So the option of using apple juice does not achieve our target of adding a tangy flavor to the meat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

It should be noted, the bit I received did not measure to an exact 3/8\\" rabbet. Is the review positive or negative? The answer is:","completion":"The review is negative. The reviewer expresses their dissatisfaction with the quality of the rabbet bit in various aspects. Firstly, the title \\"You get what you pay for\\" implies that the product was inexpensive, and, as a consequence, the quality was compromised. The phrase is often used for situations where purchasing a less expensive or cheaper item results in poor quality or performance. The reviewer elaborates on this by describing the rabbet bit as \\"low quality,\\" indicating that the overall performance, durability, and potentially even the appearance of the bit did not meet their expectations. They also note that it \\"might suffice for a one-time job,\\" which suggests that the product is not suitable for consistent or professional use due to its inferior quality. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions that they have \\"already discarded it at this point,\\" which implies that they have chosen not to continue using the product due to the issues they have encountered. Discarding the bit could be a result of frustration, disappointment, or an inability to complete their project with the provided tool. Lastly, the reviewer provides a specific concern they had with the product: \\"the bit I received did not measure to an exact 3/8\\" rabbet.\\" This statement indicates that not only were there general issues with the quality of the rabbet bit, but that there was also a specific problem with its size or accuracy, making it unsuitable or unusable for the purpose it was intended for.

To answer the question, we need to specify the gland responsible for the surge in hormones during puberty. The gland involved in this process is the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland is a small, pea-sized gland located at the base of the brain. It is often referred to as the \\"master gland\\" because it controls the function of other glands in the endocrine system and plays a critical role in regulating growth, metabolism, reproduction, and other essential physiological processes. During puberty, the pituitary gland secretes several hormones that stimulate the gonads (testes in males and ovaries in females) to produce sex hormones, such as testosterone in males and estrogen in females. The pituitary gland does so by releasing two primary hormones: luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These hormones act on the gonads to stimulate the production of sex hormones, which in turn cause the development of secondary sexual characteristics and the onset of the reproductive capacity in both males and females. In summary, the pituitary gland is the gland responsible for secreting a surge of hormonal agents into the bloodstream during puberty. This surge in hormones triggers a series of physical changes and the development of secondary sexual characteristics in both males and females."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

În opinia sa, declaraţia de independenţă a albanezilor kosovari nu va avea consecinţe asupra relaţiilor economice dintre Serbia şi Kosovo. Translate to English","completion":"In your opinion, the declaration of independence of the Kosovar Albanians will not have consequences on the economic relations between Serbia and Kosovo. The independence of Kosovo, which was declared by its Albanian majority in 2008, has been a contentious issue, especially with Serbia not recognizing the new state. However, it is possible to argue that the declaration of independence has not significantly impacted economic relations between the two sides in the long run. Firstly, the international community has played a crucial role in maintaining stability and fostering economic cooperation in the region. The European Union (EU) and other international organizations have worked to facilitate dialogue and encourage the establishment of favorable economic policies, thereby reducing the adverse effects of Kosovo's independence on economic relations. Secondly, the normalization process has led to gradual improvements in economic ties between Serbia and Kosovo. Since the declaration of independence, both countries have signed several agreements, which have addressed some of the obstacles to economic cooperation. For example, there have been agreements on trade, energy, and telecommunications that have aided the expansion of economic ties between the two sides. Additionally, trade between Kosovo and Serbia has grown over the years, demonstrating an increasing level of economic interdependence. Despite political tensions, businesses on both sides have continued to engage in transactions, driven mainly by economic pragmatism. It is essential to note that Serbia remains one of Kosovo's main trading partners and a key source of imports. Moreover, regional economic integration has pushed Serbia and Kosovo to work together on various occasions. Since both countries aim to join the European Union, they have been asked to pursue economic and political reforms in line with EU standards. This process of integration has, to some extent, necessitated working together on economic matters, irrespective of their political differences. It is important to note that while the declaration of independence has created some obstacles to the development of economic relations between Kosovo and Serbia, both sides have shown a willingness to overcome these challenges. However, acknowledging the ongoing tensions and disputes, it is necessary to continue fostering dialogue and cooperation between Serbia and Kosovo, both bilaterally and with the support of international organizations such as the EU. In conclusion, although the declaration of Kosovo's independence has caused tensions and disagreements between the two countries, their economic relations have not suffered severely due to international support, the normalization process, increasing trade, and regional integration. With ongoing dialogue and cooperation, it is possible to maintain and further develop these economic ties between Serbia and Kosovo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: Which country did the French pick on because they were upset about a breach of contract after declaring war on Great Britain? Context: When revolutionary France declared war on Great Britain in 1793, the United States sought to remain neutral, but the Jay Treaty, which was favorable to Great Britain, angered the French government, which viewed it as a violation of the 1778 Treaty of Alliance. French privateers began to seize U.S. vessels, which led to an undeclared \\"Quasi-War\\" between the two nations. Fought at sea from 1798 to 1800, the United States won a string of victories in the Caribbean.

Should I validate this answer? Pick from: [+] No. [+] Yes. Answer:","completion":"Yes, the suggested answer is correct, but let's provide more details and context to the response. The process of Tennessee becoming a state began in the latter half of the 18th century, when settlers from various European backgrounds started to move into the area now known as Tennessee. These settlers, primarily forming frontier communities, organized themselves under the Watauga Association agreements and later under the Cumberland Compact, which provided local governance and established a framework for civil management. In 1784, the western part of North Carolina, including lands that later comprised Tennessee, was ceded to the U.S. federal government by North Carolina. This cession was due to the state's inability to provide resources and protection for the western settlers. The following year, in 1785, these lands were organized into the short-lived State of Franklin. However, the State of Franklin eventually disbanded in 1789 following widespread internal discord and financial difficulties. The territory was reorganized as the Southwest Territory in 1790 after the U.S. Congress passed the Southwest Territory Act, and North Carolina's cession was finalized. At this stage, William Blount was appointed as the territorial governor. Throughout the early 1790s, the population in the Southwest Territory steadily grew, paving the way for statehood. In February 1796, Congress approved Tennessee's proposed state constitution, which required one last step—ratification by the residents of the territory. The constitution was indeed ratified, and on June 1, 1796, Tennessee was officially admitted to the Union as the nation's 16th state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

There's my name, Alexander Spencer, typed on the front. I throw it under the bed. The piles of envelopes are growing. The envelopes were applications to all the colleges I was supposed to attend. I did open the first envelope. Then I saw the application, all those blank spaces I was supposed to fill with my own writing, spaces for my name and birth date and grade average and ... statement of purpose. I looked at them for a long time. I could write for hours and not fill all those spaces. So I put the application back in the envelope. I would fill it out the next day, when I had time. But another envelope arrived. And then the pile began. The pile scares me -- it is really like a monster. All the while, I feel the weight of a million envelopes raining down on my head until my grandmother calls me and wants to know how I am. \\"I am overcome by too many tasks,\\" I say. \\"Honey, you just take it bit by bit,\\" she says, and she reminds me about the green beans.

It was a mountain of green beans. I couldn't do it. My grandma came to me and asked if I could eat one green bean. \\"But Grandma, I have to eat ten!\\" She said all I had to do was to eat one green bean. One tiny little green bean. So I ate one. It was bad, but not as bad as I'd thought it would be. Then she asked me again if I could eat one. So I ate one green bean nine more times. My grandma doesn't know about the envelopes, but she tells me anyone can do one thing every day. Back in my room, I lay down on the bed.

Second question: We know that love fades for many reasons. But for people who are left, do we have the right to blame those who walk away from love? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: 1. no. 2. yes.","completion":"1. The point of love, even if one day the other person may stop loving you back and walk away, is that love encompasses a range of emotional and mental states that bring about feelings of happiness, security, and well-being. In a more philosophical context, love is considered an essential human emotion and experience that can contribute to personal growth, understanding, and overall quality of life. The reality in relationships is that sometimes, feelings change, and people grow apart. While it is true that the possibility of the other person walking away exists, that does not necessarily mean you should avoid love altogether. Love leads to many positive experiences and memories that can shape and define your life. In addition, experiencing love and heartbreak can actually provide valuable lessons that make you stronger, more self-aware, and better equipped to forge healthier and stronger relationships in the future. Part of love is taking the risk, knowing that there is a chance it may not work out, but also understanding that the experience and strength that come from love are worthwhile. People change and grow throughout their lives, and it's important to cherish the moments and memories of love while recognizing that relationships will have their ebbs and flows. 2. When people walk away from love, sadly, it leaves others feeling hurt and in pain. It is normal for those left behind to feel a mix of emotions and, in certain situations, to seek for someone to blame. However, it is essential to consider the reasons and circumstances when someone walks away from a relationship before assigning blame. Situations and feelings may change with time, and people may outgrow each other. It might become necessary for individuals to love themselves and prioritize their personal growth and well-being, which might mean ending an unhealthy or unfulfilling relationship. In these cases, it may not be fair to place blame on the person who chose to walk away, as these decisions are often difficult and come after much contemplation and inner struggle. However, there are instances in which someone leaves a relationship because they acted irresponsibly or without much thought for their partner's feelings. In these cases, it's more understandable to feel wronged and to a certain extent, blame the person for their lack of accountability and sensitivity. Ultimately, understanding the complexities of why love fades is crucial in the healing process. Assigning blame might provide temporary relief, but it is important to seek understanding, self-reflection, and acceptance of the situation to move past those feelings. Engaging in an internal dialogue and talking through your emotions with friends, family, or even a therapist can help offer clarity during this transitional and emotional time. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same. The first question focuses on the purpose of love even when it might be lost, while the second question emphasizes the implications of assigning blame when someone walks away from love. Both questions, however, allow for meaningful contemplation on the fragile, complex, and ever-evolving connections made through love and relationships."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize the following: Whether you've been married for two years or twenty years, it can easily feel like you and your partner have fallen into a rut. Routines form because they are convenient and they make it easier to navigate your day-to-day life, but falling into ruts and routines in your relationship can slowly kill the romance without you even realizing it. If you usually eat in most nights, try going out for a date night. If you typically make your own separate meals, try cooking a meal for your partner and eating together. Do something exciting together that you and your spouse wouldn't normally do. It doesn't have to be anything crazy, but it should push you both to have fun and get excited together. Take a romantic vacation together, or just plan a fun and exciting day together - even if it just means going to a carnival or an amusement park. When you and your spouse were dating, you probably flirted with one another all the time. So why did you stop? Most couples get comfortable with one another, which is obviously a good thing. But the downside of getting comfortable is forgetting how to turn on the charm, often because you haven't had to in several months (or even years). Make eye contact. Smile at your partner and act giggly. Use romantic body language, and mimic your partner's body language. Stand facing one another, avoid crossing your arms, and lean in towards one another when you speak. Physical contact is an important component of intimacy. Physical contact makes you feel desired, and it can make you feel comfortable and closer with your partner. If you're already very intimate and have a lot of physical contact, then keep doing it. If you've lost that part of your relationship, make an effort to bring it back. Physical contact doesn't just mean sex (although many people do consider sex a healthy part of marriage). It can mean holding hands, snuggling, embracing, kissing, or any other kind of affectionate contact. Your partner probably wants physical contact as much as you do, but may be too shy or worried that you don't also want it. Don't stress over physical contact, just initiate it. Your partner will appreciate it, and it will help you both feel closer to one another. Remember that feelings often follow actions. If you put forth the effort and try to make a romantic evening for one another, the romantic feelings will follow. If you've been married for a while, you probably both feel overwhelmed from time to time with trying to balance your work life and your home life. This can be even more daunting if you have kids. But making time for intimacy without any distractions (kids, work calls/emails, etc.) can do wonders to bring back the spark in your relationship, especially if you make it a consistent priority week after week. Spending time with one another, especially with physical contact, often sets the stage for sex and will make you both feel closer to one another. If you have to, schedule time for intimacy and/or sex. Experts advise that even setting aside 30 minutes for some intimate time alone can do wonders for your relationship. Drop your kids off at a babysitter's, or if they're old enough to be out alone you can give them money to go see a movie or shop at the mall. That will buy you some alone time with your spouse. Turn off your cellphones when you're being intimate together. Nothing kills the mood like your partner getting dragged into a long work-related phone call. Intimacy isn't just a one-time thing. You'll need to work hard to make time for it every week, or several times a week, or however often you and your partner need it. This relates to being honest and open in your communication with one another. Some people are afraid to convey their desires to others, even to a spouse. However, your preferences are nothing to feel embarrassed or ashamed of. Talk to your partner about what your sexual preferences or fantasies are, and ask your partner about his or her preferences. And no matter what you or your partner want, be mutually respectful of one another's needs. Feeling like your sexual preferences aren't being met can make sex unfulfilling, which over time can feel almost like a chore. The best way to mutually enjoy sex is to communicate to your partner what you like or don't like, and ask your spouse to do the same. Be willing to explore new things together in the bedroom so that you and your partner are both having your needs met. Plus, trying new things in general can lend a spark to your relationship, and you might find you both enjoy your new routine. Being respectful of your partner's needs doesn't mean putting yourself in an uncomfortable situation. It's okay to have boundaries and to expect your partner to respect those boundaries. Some people have the impression that couple's therapy is only for people who are on the verge of divorce. However, that is simply not true. Couple's therapy can help you and your spouse work on communication skills, find ways to feel more intimate, and work through any difficulties that arise in your marriage. There's no shame or stigma in seeing a therapist. Couple's therapy can help you and your partner at any stage of your relationship. If you or your partner experience little to no sex drive after previously having a sex drive, your therapist may refer you to your primary physician to see if there are any medical explanations. Sometimes certain medications can reduce sexual urges or the ability to perform sexually. Other times there may be an emotional reason why a person's sex drive decreases. Be honest and open with your therapist and with your doctor to address any intimacy issues you're experiencing. Summary:","completion":"When a husband and wife are together for a long time, sometimes they forget to have fun and be romantic. This can happen because they get too comfortable and are busy with work, kids, and other things. To help bring back romance, they can: 1. Try new and fun things together, like going on dates or vacations. 2. Flirt, smile, and use romantic body language. 3. Show affection with physical touch, like holding hands or hugging. 4. Make time for intimacy, like turning off phones and focusing on each other. 5. Talk about what they like and don't like in the bedroom, and respect each other's boundaries. 6. Consider couple's therapy to help improve communication and work on any problems. Doing these activities can help bring back the spark in a relationship, as well as make both partners feel closer and happier."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An unemployed military veteran who raised no funds and put up no campaign website shocked South Carolina's Democratic Party leadership by capturing the nomination Tuesday to face Republican U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint in November. With nearly all precincts reporting, Alvin Greene, 32, commanded 59 percent of the vote against 41 percent for former four-term state lawmaker Vic Rawl, 64, who had raised about 186,000 and had to abruptly scrap a late-week fundraiser for the fall. State Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler said voters unfamiliar with either candidate may have voted alphabetically for Greene over Rawl. \\"As far as I know, he never showed up at anything. Vic Rawl has been campaigning everywhere from the time he filed,\\" she said. Rawl said he was disappointed. \\"I would've liked very much to be a candidate against Jim DeMint,\\" Rawl said, describing his sole primary rival as something of a mystery. \\"I never saw him. I've still never met him.\\" As for Greene, he couldn't explain it either but thanked voters in a state numb with high unemployment and said: \\"Let's continue to make history and get South Carolina back to work.\\" Greene said he spent a total of 13 years in the Air Force and Army before leaving the Army in August. DeMint, a conservative Republican and tea party darling pursuing a second term, has marshaled a 3.5 million war chest already to face the bare-pockets Democratic underdog. Political scientist Scott Huffmon at Winthrop University said the looming DeMint-Greene contest already shapes up in lopsided favor of DeMint and shows South Carolina Democrats lack depth to field strong candidates in every race. \\"DeMint's coasting pretty much to re-election,\\" he predicted. Late Tuesday, stunned Democratic leaders in South Carolina struggled to comprehend how the little-seen candidate upstaged Rawl, a moderate Southern Democrat they viewed as their far stronger bet against DeMint. Rawl's lengthy resume lists four past state House terms and former posts as prosecutor, circuit court judge and more.

Jim DeMint (R-SC). Alvin Greene, who currently lives in his family's home, defeated Vic Rawl, a former judge and state legislator who had a 186,000 campaign warchest and had already planned his next fundraising event. Despite the odds, Greene, who has been unemployed for the past nine months, said that he wasn't surprised by his victory. \\"I wasn’t surprised, but not really. I mean, just a little, but not much. I knew I was on top of my campaign, and just stayed on top of everything, I just—I wasn't surprised that much, just a little. I knew that I worked hard and did,\\" Greene said in an interview. Greene insists that he paid the 10,400 filing fee and all other campaign expenses from his own personal funds. \\"It was 100 percent out of my pocket. I’m self-managed. It’s hard work, and just getting my message to supporters. I funded my campaign 100 percent out of my pocket and self-managed,\\" said Greene, who sounded anxious and unprepared to speak to the public. But despite his lack of election funds, Greene claims to have criss-crossed the state during his campaign—though he declined to specify any of the towns or places he visited or say how much money he spent while on the road. \\"It wasn’t much, I mean, just, it was—it wasn’t much. Not much, I mean, it wasn’t much,\\" he said, when asked how much of his own money he spent in the primary. Greene frequently spoke in rapid-fire, fragmentary sentences, repeating certain phrases or interrupting himself multiple times during the same sentence while he searched for the right words. But he was emphatic about certain aspects of his candidacy, insisting that details about his campaign organization, for instance, weren't relevant. \\"I'm not concentrating on how I was elected—it's history. I’m the Democratic nominee—we need to get talking about America back to work, what's going on, in America.\\" The oddity of Greene’s candidacy has already prompted speculation from local media about whether he might be a Republican plant. But Greene denies that Republicans or anyone else had approached him about running. \\"No, no—no one approached me. This is my decision,\\" he said. A 13-year military veteran, he says he had originally gotten the idea in 2008 when he was serving in Korea. \\"I just saw the country was in bad shape two years ago…the country was declining,\\" he says. \\"I wanted to make sure we continue to go up on the right track.\\" But when asked whether there was a specific person or circumstance that precipitated his decision to jump into politics, Greene simply replied: \\"nothing in particular...it's just, uh, nothing in particular.\\" South Carolina Democratic Party Chairwoman Carol Fowler speculated that Greene won because his name appeared first on the ballot, and voters unfamiliar with both candidates chose alphabetically. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In South Carolina, a military veteran named Alvin Greene, who had no job, no money raised, and no campaign website, surprisingly won the Democratic nomination for the U.S. Senate seat.

Step 1: Combine like terms -610 = -47*y - 14*y The two terms with the variable y are -47*y and -14*y. To combine these terms, we must add their coefficients: -47 + (-14) = -61 So, -610 = -61*y. Step 2: Isolate y Now, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. To do this, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of y, which is -61: -610 = -61*y -610 / (-61) = (-61*y) / (-61) Simplifying the equation, we get: 10 = y So the solution to the equation -610 = -47*y - 14*y is: y = 10"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He had allegedly disappeared while canoeing in the North Sea, but the story that unfolded was far from expected. It was later revealed to be an elaborate plot by John himself and his wife, Anne Darwin, to deceitfully claim £500,000 in life insurance. The pair meticulously planned and pulled off this scam, subsequently fleeing to the Central American country of Panama. However, in an unexpected twist, John Darwin reappeared in Britain five years later in 2007, claiming to have no memory of any events following his supposed death, leading to a diagnosis of amnesia. This eventually led investigators on his trail, and the truth was soon brought to light. Subheading: The trial and imprisonment Following their deceitful plot, John and Anne Darwin both faced significant consequences for their actions. They were arrested in 2007 and in 2008, they were tried and jailed for this scam. They had committed a grievous act of fraud that not only deceived insurance firms but also shocked friends and family who had mourned John's supposed death. It's worth noting that despite the fact that they collectively planned and executed the scam, the couple's relationship deteriorated while incarcerated. It is reported that they have had no contact for the last four years, symbolizing a complete breakdown in their relationship. Subheading: Life after the fraud In an intriguing development, John Darwin is reported to have rebuilt his life after being released from prison. Today, he allegedly has a new girlfriend, who is significantly younger than him at 32 years old. It seems there is another chapter to unfold yet in this extraordinary tale. Adding to the mystique, Darwin reportedly claimed that he is expecting to receive a new passport this coming March. This development, naturally, raises a myriad of questions about his future plans. After serving time for his crimes, will he choose to stay on the right side of the law or does the infamous Darwin have something else planned? In conclusion, the tale of John Darwin and his wife Anne strikingly demonstrates the lengths to which some people will go for financial gain. Their audacious plot and its subsequent unraveling is a true crime story that continues to capture public interest well over a decade later."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The virus is a variant of the virus malaria created by three scientists. They discovered and manufactured the virus with the intent of turning it into a biological weapon. Their goal was to produce soldiers who could continue fighting, even while mortally wounded. The virus is transmitted through bodily fluids. The infected have superhuman abilities, sprinting and leaping beyond human capabilities. The zombies become very durable, and a particular zombie survives despite being thrown into a plane's engine. The 747 jumbo jet encounters massive thunderstorms, and the turbulence releases one of the scientists from the cargo hold. Two of the scientists go below to ascertain if the container has been damaged by the turbulence, and are also killed, starting a zombie outbreak.

Zimbabwe's central bank is introducing a 500 million note -- the highest current denomination -- as the once-prosperous southern African nation battles against spiraling hyperinflation. Zimbabwe's new 500 million note. Finance Minister Samuel Mumbengegwi made the announcement about the new note in a government gazette set for release Friday. On the back, the purple cotton bill will feature pictures of dairy cows being milked mechanically and a miner drilling underground, he said. The Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) last week introduced a new set of denominations, including a 100 million note, but that has not helped to clear long lines for cash at banks. Some people sleep outside banks after failing to get cash. The RBZ said a 200 million note would be in circulation Friday, together with the 500 million note. The 500 million note is worth about 8 U.S. dollars and enough to buy just eight loaves of bread. Thursday, the greenback was trading around ZW60 million and is expected to shoot up in light of the new note's introduction. Prices change on an almost daily basis as businesses now peg their prices against the U.S. dollar. Zimbabwe has had higher denominations than the 500 million note in the past. But over the past two years, the country has slashed zeros from the amount of its worthless currency -- the latest being 10 zeros in August. Once one of Africa's most promising economies, Zimbabwe is reeling under its worst humanitarian and economic crisis. A cholera outbreak has killed nearly 800 Zimbabweans, forcing hundreds to cross the border into South Africa and Botswana to seek treatment. The situation has been exacerbated by the closure of government hospitals for more than a month as health personnel demand the government review their salaries and equip the hospitals with medicines and modern machinery. In addition, 5 million people are in need of food aid, the United Nations says, in a nation that once exported food to its neighbors. There has been a spate of protests -- including two by soldiers -- over the past four weeks as people voice their displeasure over President Robert Mugabe's policies.

NEW YORK, Aug. 5 (UPI) -- A diet high in refined carbohydrates, such as white bread, white rice and many junk foods, may increase the risk of depression in postmenopausal women, according to a new study. While carbohydrates typically increase the amount of sugar in the blood, more highly refined carbohydrates trigger a hormonal response in the body to lower blood sugar that may also have an effect on mood, fatigue or other symptoms of depression, according to a press release. James Gangwisch, PhD, and colleagues in the Department of Psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center reviewed data collected between 1994 and 1998 as part of the Women's Health Initiative Observational Study, considering medical data for 87,618 women initially involved in the study and the 69,954 who participated in a 3-year follow-up interview. Glycemic index, a measure of sugar in the blood, that was progressively higher increased the chance of developing depression by about 22 percent, and higher amounts of dietary added sugars increased the chance by about 23 percent. The study also showed that increased consumption of dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables, and non-juice fruits was associated with decreased risk of depression. While further study is needed to understand the link between depression and junk food, the researchers said the results of the study suggest that dietary changes could help prevent depression. The study is published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. ||||| ↵ 1 The Women’s Health Initiative is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH, US Department of Health and Human Services, through contracts N01WH22110, 24152, 32100–2, 32105–6, 32108–9, 32111–13, 32115, 32118–32119, 32122, 42107–26, 42129–32, and 44221. MEP is supported by an NIH Building Interdisciplinary Research Careers in Women's Health (BIRCWH) K12 grant (HD043446). Abstract Background: The consumption of sweetened beverages, refined foods, and pastries has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of depression in longitudinal studies. However, any influence that refined carbohydrates has on mood could be commensurate with their proportion in the overall diet; studies are therefore needed that measure overall intakes of carbohydrate and sugar, glycemic index (GI), and glycemic load. Objective: We hypothesized that higher dietary GI and glycemic load would be associated with greater odds of the prevalence and incidence of depression. Design: This was a prospective cohort study to investigate the relations between dietary GI, glycemic load, and other carbohydrate measures (added sugars, total sugars, glucose, sucrose, lactose, fructose, starch, carbohydrate) and depression in postmenopausal women who participated in the Women’s Health Initiative Observational Study at baseline between 1994 and 1998 (n = 87,618) and at the 3-y follow-up (n = 69,954). Results: We found a progressively higher dietary GI to be associated with increasing odds of incident depression in fully adjusted models (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.09, 1.37), with the trend being statistically significant (P = 0.0032). Progressively higher consumption of dietary added sugars was also associated with increasing odds of incident depression (OR for the fifth vs. first quintile: 1.23; 95% CI: 1.07, 1.41; P-trend = 0.0029). Higher consumption of lactose, fiber, nonjuice fruit, and vegetables was significantly associated with lower odds of incident depression, and nonwhole/refined grain consumption was associated with increased odds of depression. Conclusions: The results from this study suggest that high-GI diets could be a risk factor for depression in postmenopausal women. Randomized trials should be undertaken to examine the question of whether diets rich in low-GI foods could serve as treatments and primary preventive measures for depression in postmenopausal women. The Women’s Health Initiative is registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00000611. ||||| NEW YORK, NY, August 5, 2015 - A diet high in refined carbohydrates may lead to an increased risk for new-onset depression in postmenopausal women, according to a study published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition. The study by James Gangwisch, PhD and colleagues in the department of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center (CUMC) looked at the dietary glycemic index, glycemic load, types of carbohydrates consumed, and depression in data from more than 70,000 postmenopausal women who participated in the National Institutes of Health's Women's Health Initiative Observational Study between 1994 and 1998. Consumption of carbohydrates increases blood sugar levels to varying degrees, depending on the type of food ingested. The more highly refined the carbohydrate, the higher its score on the glycemic index (GI) scale. The GI scale, which goes from 0-100, measures the amount of sugar found in the blood after eating. Refined foods such as white bread, white rice, and soda trigger a hormonal response in the body to reduce blood sugar levels. This response may also cause or exacerbate mood changes, fatigue and other symptoms of depression. The investigators found that progressively higher dietary GI scores and consumption of added sugars and refined grains were associated with increased risk of new-onset depression in post-menopausal women. Greater consumption of dietary fiber, whole grains, vegetables and non-juice fruits was associated with decreased risk. This suggests that dietary interventions could serve as treatments and preventive measures for depression. Further study is needed to examine the potential of this novel option for treatment and prevention, and to see if similar results are found in the broader population. # Video is available at the CUMC website: Short video: https:/ / www. youtube. com/ watch?v= 0pC8xbZOl40 Full video: https:/ / youtu. be/ jVU9N2lrlmI The paper is \\"High Glycemic Index Diet as a Risk Factor for Depression: Analyses from the Women's Health Initiative.\\" The authors are James E.

Turkey is a democratic, secular, unitary, parliamentary republic with a diverse cultural heritage. Turkey is bordered by eight countries: Greece to the west; Bulgaria to the northwest; Georgia to the northeast; Armenia, the Azerbaijani exclave of Nakhchivan and Iran to the east; and Iraq and Syria to the south. The Aegean Sea is to the west, the Black Sea to the north, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. The Bosphorus, the Sea of Marmara, and the Dardanelles, which together form the Turkish Straits, divide Thrace and Anatolia; they also separate Europe and Asia. Turkey's location has given it geopolitical and strategic importance throughout history. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - The Sea of Marmara, also known as the Sea of Marmora or the Marmara Sea, and in the context of classical antiquity as the Propontis, is the inland sea, entirely within the borders of Turkey, that connects the Black Sea to the Aegean Sea, thus separating Turkey's Asian and European parts. The Bosphorus strait connects it to the Black Sea and the Dardanelles strait to the Aegean Sea. The former also separates Istanbul into its Asian and European sides. The sea has an area of 11,350 km² (280 km x 80 km) with the greatest depth reaching . - Thrace (Modern , \\"Thráke\\" \\"Trakiya\\") is a historical and geographic area in southeast Europe, centered on the modern borders of Bulgaria, Greece, and Turkey. In antiquity, it was also referred to as Europe, prior to the extension of the term to describe the whole continent. As a geographical concept, Thrace designates a region bounded by the Balkan Mountains on the north, Rhodope Mountains and the Aegean Sea on the south, and by the Black Sea and the Sea of Marmara on the east. The areas it comprises are southeastern Bulgaria (Northern Thrace), northeastern Greece (Western Thrace), and the European part of Turkey (Eastern Thrace). The biggest part of Thrace is part of present-day Bulgaria. In Turkey, it is also called Rumeli. The name comes from the Thracians, an ancient Indo-European people inhabiting Southeastern Europe. - A continent is one of several very large landmasses on Earth. Generally identified by convention rather than any strict criteria, up to seven regions are commonly regarded as continents.

Comprising a land area of , it is the second-largest country in the Middle East and the 18th-largest in the world. With 82.8 million inhabitants, Iran is the world's 17th-most-populous country. It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Anatolia (from Greek , ' \\"east\\" or \\"(sun)rise\\"; in modern ), in geography known as Asia Minor (from ' \\"small Asia\\"; in modern ), Asian Turkey, Anatolian peninsula, or Anatolian plateau, is the westernmost protrusion of Asia, which makes up the majority of modern-day Turkey. The region is bounded by the Black Sea to the north, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Aegean Sea to the west. The Sea of Marmara forms a connection between the Black and Aegean Seas through the Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits and separates Anatolia from Thrace on the European mainland. - The Aegean Sea is an elongated embayment of the Mediterranean Sea located between the Greek and Anatolian peninsulas, i.e., between the mainlands of Greece and Turkey. In the north, it is connected to the Marmara Sea and Black Sea by the Dardanelles and Bosphorus. The Aegean Islands are within the sea and some bound it on its southern periphery, including Crete and Rhodes. - The Dardanelles, also known in Classical Antiquity as the Hellespont (\\"Hellespontos\\", literally \\"Sea of Helle\\"), is a narrow, natural strait and internationally-significant waterway in northwestern Turkey that forms part of the continental boundary between Europe and Asia, and separates Asian Turkey from European Turkey. One of the world's narrowest straits used for international navigation, the Dardanelles connects the Sea of Marmara with the Aegean and Mediterranean Seas, while also allowing passage to the Black Sea by extension via the Bosphorus. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - A lake is an area of variable size filled with water, localized in a basin, that is surrounded by land, apart from any river or other outlet that serves to feed or drain the lake. Lakes lie on land and are not part of the ocean, and therefore are distinct from lagoons, and are also larger and deeper than ponds, though there are no official or scientific definitions. Lakes can be contrasted with rivers or streams, which are usually flowing. Most lakes are fed and drained by rivers and streams. - Kazakhstan ( \\"Qazaqstan\\", \\"Kazakhstan\\"), officially the Republic of Kazakhstan (\\"Qazaqstan Respwblïkas\\" \\"Respublika Kazakhstan\\"), is a transcontinental country in northern Central Asia and Eastern Europe.

It is bound by Kazakhstan to the northeast, Russia to the northwest, Azerbaijan to the west, Iran to the south, and Turkmenistan to the southeast. - Honshu had a population of 103 million , mostly concentrated in the coastal lowlands, notably in the Kant plain where 25% of the total population resides in the Greater Tokyo Area. As the historical center of Japanese culture and political power, the island includes several past Japanese capitals, including Kyoto, Nara, and Kamakura. Much of the island's southern shore forms part of the Taiheiy Belt, a megalopolis that spans several of the Japanese islands. - Salamanders are a group of amphibians typically characterized by a lizard-like appearance, with slender bodies, blunt snouts, short limbs projecting at right angles to the body, and the presence of a tail in both larvae and adults. All present-day salamander families are grouped together under the scientific name Urodela. Salamander diversity is most abundant in the Northern Hemisphere and most species are found in the Holarctic ecozone, with some species present in the Neotropical zone. - Triturus is a genus of newts comprising the crested and the marbled newts , which are found from Great Britain through most of continental Europe to westernmost Siberia , Anatolia , and the Caspian Sea region . Their English names refer to their appearance : marbled newts have a green -- black colour pattern , while the males of crested newts , which are dark brown with a yellow or orange underside , develop a conspicuous jagged seam on their back and tail during their breeding phase . Crested and marbled newts live and breed in vegetation - rich ponds or similar aquatic habitats for two to six months and usually spend the rest of the year in shady , protection - rich land habitats close to their breeding sites . Males court females with a ritualised display , ending in the deposition of a spermatophore that is picked up by the female . After fertilisation , a female lays 200 -- 400 eggs , folding them individually into leaves of water plants . Larvae develop over two to four months before metamorphosing into land - dwelling juveniles . Historically , most European newts were included in the genus , but taxonomists have split off the alpine newt ( Ichthyosaura ) , the small - bodied newts ( Lissotriton ) and the banded newts ( Ommatotriton ) as separate genera . The closest relatives of Triturus are the European brook newts ( Calotriton ) . Two species of marbled newts and six species of crested newts , formerly considered subspecies , are accepted , with one additional crested newt species suspected . Their ranges are largely contiguous but where they do overlap , hybridisation may take place . Although not immediately threatened , crested and marbled newts suffer from population declines , caused mainly by habitat loss and fragmentation . Both their aquatic breeding sites and the cover - rich , natural landscapes upon which they depend during their terrestrial phase are affected . All species are legally protected in Europe , and some of their habitats have been designated as special reserves . - Great Britain, also known as Britain , is a large island in the north Atlantic Ocean off the northwest coast of continental Europe. With an area of , Great Britain is the largest European island and the ninth-largest in the world. In 2011 the island had a population of about 61 million people, making it the world's third-most populous island after Java in Indonesia and Honshu in Japan. The island of Ireland is situated to the west of it, and together these islands, along with over 1,000 smaller surrounding islands, comprise the British Isles archipelago. - A newt is a salamander in the subfamily Pleurodelinae, also called eft during its terrestrial juvenile phase. Unlike other members of the family Salamandridae, newts are semiaquatic, alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats over the year, sometimes even staying in the water full-time. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. The more than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts metamorphose through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic larva, terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have lizard-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. - Art is a diverse range of human activities in creating visual, auditory or performing artifacts (artworks), expressing the author's imaginative or technical skill, intended to be appreciated for their beauty or emotional power. In their most general form these activities include the production of works of art, the criticism of art, the study of the history of art, and the aesthetic dissemination of art. - In geography, regions are areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). Geographic regions and sub-regions are mostly described by their imprecisely defined, and sometimes transitory boundaries, except in human geography, where jurisdiction areas such as national borders are defined in law. - The Black Sea is a body of water between Eastern Europe and Western Asia, bounded by Bulgaria, Georgia, Romania, Russia, Turkey, and Ukraine. It is supplied by a number of major rivers, such as the Danube, Dnieper, Rioni, Southern Bug, and Dniester. The Black Sea has an area of (not including the Sea of Azov), a maximum depth of , and a volume of . It is constrained by the Pontic Mountains to the south and by the Caucasus Mountains to the east, and features a wide shelf to the northwest. The longest east-west extent is about . - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - A larva (plural \\"larvae\\" ) is a distinct juvenile form many animals undergo before metamorphosis into adults. Animals with indirect development such as insects, amphibians, or cnidarians typically have a larval phase of their life cycle. - Siberia is an extensive geographical region, and by the broadest definition is also known as North Asia. Siberia has historically been a part of Russia since the 17th century. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - North Asia or Northern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of Siberia, and Russian Far East in the Asian portion of Russia the area east of the Ural Mountains. A large part of the region is also known as Asian Russia. - Asia is Earth's largest and most populous continent, located primarily in the eastern and northern hemispheres and sharing the continental landmass of Eurasia with the continent of Europe. Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people.

Options: 1). negative; 2). positive; Answer:","completion":"2). positive; Though there are criticisms mentioned in the review such as the higher prices and the need to actively gain the staff's attention, they do not seem to significantly diminish the reviewer's overall positive impression of the restaurant. They identify the good service—the employees understand both English and Korean—and express satisfaction with the food, calling it good. Additionally, they seem content with the restaurant's convenient location, being only a 15 mins walk from Cosmo, and its availability for late-night or early morning meals. Most notably, the reviewer illustrates their positive sentiment by stating, ‘but I would pay anything to get my cravings met.’ This statement reflects their willingness to overlook the higher prices because of the satisfaction they get from the food. Also, the author has awarded the restaurant 4 stars, an indicator of a rather positive experience. Lastly, the statement 'lack of competition for this restaurant' can be viewed as a positive remark, suggesting that this restaurant is unique in its offerings and hard to compete with in terms of late-night availability and Korean cuisine.

Q: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office.

Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.

Avoid adding too much mulch. Cut off any dead or diseased plants. Avoid over-watering your plants. Make sure you don't plant your plants too deeply.","completion":"Title: How to Take Care of Your Garden: 6 Easy Tips for Healthy Plants Hey kids! Did you know that plants need our help to grow big and strong, just like we need care from our mommies and daddies? Today, we are going to learn about six easy tips to make our garden plants happy and healthy. Are you ready? Let's go! 1. Help water go away from the soil: Sometimes, soil is like a wet sponge that holds too much water. We need to help the water go away by adding drainage. Drainage is like a road for water to travel through the soil. This way the plants' roots won't be soaked in water, and they can breathe easily! 2. Give plants their own space: Plants are like us - they need their personal space, too. When plants are too close together, they can't stretch out their leaves and it's harder for them to catch sunlight. So, make sure to move plants that are too close, so they can grow and spread their leaves happily! 3. Don't give plants too much \\"blanket\\": Mulch is like a blanket we put on the soil to keep it warm. But if we put too much mulch, it can be too warm and the plants might feel too hot. It is a great idea to use just enough mulch to keep the soil cozy, but not too much. 4. Remove sad parts of the plants: Sometimes, plants might have some dead or sick parts, like leaves or branches. We need to cut these parts off so that they don't make the rest of the plant sad, too. It's like getting a haircut to help our hair grow better! 5. Don't give them too much water: We all need water to drink, but drinking too much water isn't good for us either. The same goes for plants. Make sure to give the plants the right amount of water. Over-watering can make it hard for their roots to breathe. So, we should be careful not to give them too much water! 6. Don't plant them too deep: When we plant our little plants, we need to make sure they are not too deep in the ground. If they are, it will be hard for them to come out and play with the sun. So, always remember to plant your plants just deep enough to stay safe, but not too deep where they can't reach the sunlight. Wow! You are now an expert on taking care of plants. Next time you go to the garden, remember these six tips to make your plants happy and healthy. Happy gardening!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

One of the most crucial factors to consider when boot shopping is the shaft height. The shaft height of a boot is the vertical distance from the top of the foot to the top of the boot, usually measured at the back.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to measure and estimate an ideal boot shaft height. Step 1: Sit with your foot flat Finding the right boot shaft height starts with proper foot positioning. Sit comfortably on a chair or bench with your feet flat on the ground. This position allows your foot and leg muscles to relax, helping you achieve a more accurate measurement. Straighten your legs but avoid locking your knees, as this could also affect the measurement. Step 2: Measure up the back of your leg Begin measuring the back of your leg using a flexible measuring tape. Place the tape where the top of your shoe would normally touch the back of your heel, and extend it up the leg to the desired boot shaft height. It could be knee-high, mid-calf, or ankle level, based on your preference. It is essential to measure both legs, as most individuals have slight variations between their left and right legs. The larger or higher of the two measured distances should be considered when choosing the boot shaft height. Step 3: Measure around your calf In addition to the vertical shaft height, it is necessary to measure the circumference of your calf. This measurement will help in determining whether the boot will fit comfortably around your leg. Wrap the measuring tape around the widest part of your calf, with a gentle snug, and note down the measurement. Like the previous step, measure both calves and use the larger measurement as a reference. Step 4: Estimate an ideal boot shaft height Now that you have the measurements for both the vertical height and the circumference of your calf, it is time to estimate an ideal boot shaft height. Keep in mind that personal preferences and the type of boots you are looking for play a significant role in choosing the right shaft height. For instance, if you want tall boots for cold weather, choose a knee-high shaft height, while for a more versatile boot that pairs well with different outfits and seasons, a mid-calf or ankle-height boot would be more appropriate. A few aspects to consider while looking for an ideal boot shaft height are foot proportions, calf width, and leg length. People with a shorter leg length may prefer lower shaft heights, while taller individuals have more flexibility. Additionally, boots with wider shafts are more suitable for people with wider calves, while a slimmer shaft conforms better to a narrower calf. Conclusion Achieving the perfect fit is crucial for both comfort and style when it comes to selecting the ideal pair of boots. By following these simple steps to measure and estimate your boot shaft height based on your unique measurements, you are well on your way to finding the perfect pair. Beyond the shaft height, also look into the materials, style, and brand that resonate with your lifestyle and preference.

Two satellites, one Russian and one American, have collided some 800 kilometers (500 miles) above Siberia, the Russian and U.S. space agencies, said Thursday. Debris from the collision poses no threat to the International Space Station. The collision on Tuesday produced two large debris clouds, NASA said. The satellites collided at 10 kilometers (6 miles) per second, producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, the U.S. Strategic Command said. That debris is not believed to pose a threat to the International Space Station as long as the clouds continue moving in a lower orbit, according to NASA and the Russian federal space agency, Roscosmos. \\"There is some elevated risk, but it is considered to be very small to the ISS and to the other satellites that NASA has in orbit,\\" NASA spokeswoman Beth Dickey told CNN. She said experts were still assessing the effects of the debris. Mikhail Martirosov, from Russian mission control center, told Interfax news agency that the real threat from the debris will become obvious next week, once experts can calculate the trajectory of the fragments' descent. \\"We have not received a warning of the possible danger to the ISS. The fragments may descend to the ISS orbit in several years, although I do not rule out that some fragments may go down within several days,\\" Martirosov said. The Russian satellite was launched in 1993 and had been out of service at the time of the collision, Roscosmos said. The U.S. satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system and is owned by a consortium headed by Motorola, the space agency said. It was launched in 1997. Iridium said in a statement Wednesday it \\"expects to implement a network solution by Friday,\\" and will \\"move one of its in-orbit spare satellites into the network constellation to permanently replace the lost satellite\\" within the next 30 days. CNN is \\"one of the larger non-government users\\" of Iridium, said Arnie Christianson, operations manager for CNN Satellites and Transmission. \\"We do rely on it for communication in high-risk areas like Iraq, Afghanistan, and other remote locations,\\" he said. \\"Because of this collision, there may be a slightly longer hole in the coverage from one satellite to the next, but only in a very small area and for a very small amount of time. This is a collision, not an internal failure of the satellite or the system.\\" The satellite crash may result in \\"brief, occasional outages\\" that may slightly disrupt service, Iridium said in the statement, adding \\"this event is not the result of a failure on the part of Iridium or its technology.\\" Christianson questioned how U.S. government, which tracks all space junk larger than a football, didn't see this coming. But he said the system will continue to work without any noticeable problems. A representative of Iridium could not immediately be reached for comment. NASA's Dickey said a collision like this one is very rare. \\"This is the first impact between two intact satellites traveling at hypervelocity,\\" she said. \\"There have been some other occasions when things have accidentally collided in space, but they have been parts of rockets or parts of satellites and (produced) a very small cloud.\\" Major Regina Winchester, of the U.S. Strategic Command, said: \\"Space is getting pretty crowded. The fact that this hasn't happened before -- maybe we were getting a little bit lucky.\\" Winchester said Strategic Command tracks more than 18,000 pieces of manmade objects in space every day. \\"Any time there's an event that creates more debris, it's a concern,\\" she said. \\"All countries who have assets in space are going to be concerned simply because when there's more debris, there's a higher chance it's going to hit something.\\" CNN's Yuri Pushkin in Moscow and Melissa Gray in London contributed to this report. Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"On Tuesday, a Russian and an American satellite collided 800 kilometers above Siberia, with both the Russian and U.S. space agencies confirming the event.

The Russian satellite had been out of service since its launch in 1993, while the American satellite was part of the Iridium global mobile communications system, launched in 1997. Despite the satellites colliding at a speed of 10 kilometers per second and producing 500-600 new pieces of space debris, experts assess the risk to the ISS and other NASA satellites in orbit as minimal. Collisions like this are very rare, though space is becoming increasingly crowded, raising concerns of increasing debris potentially affecting assets in space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize the following: Making sure your body is in top physical condition before labor begins can reduce the likelihood of a prolonged labor. Preparing your body for what's to come can make labor easier and quicker when your baby arrives. Walk or swim regularly, and incorporate a few specialized exercises. Kegels, small internal contractions of the pelvic muscles, can help your body with the pushing stage of labor and also reduce the risk of hemorrhoids in the weeks after childbirth. You can do kegels virtually anywhere. Simply contract the muscles around your vagina, as you would when holding in urine, then hold for four seconds and release. Repeat this 10 times. Three or four sets, done about three times a day, is ideal. The pelvic tilt, also known as the angry cat, can strengthen abdominal muscles and reduce back pain during pregnancy. Get on your hands and knees, keeping your arms straight without locking your elbows. Tighten your abdominal muscles when breathing in and move your buttocks below your back. Relax your back when you breathe out and repeat at your own pace. Move in time to the rhythm of your breath. Squatting helps open your pelvis, important for labor. Stand with a chair facing your back and, using the chair for support, contract abdominal muscles, lift your chest, and relax your shoulders. Lower your tailbone to the floor, as if you were going to sit down on the chair, and then rise again to the standing position. Making sure your body is healthy before delivery is vital to a smooth labor. Nutrition is just as important as exercise. Each woman's body is different, so there's no one-size-fits-all guideline to how much weight you should gain. The adage that you're eating for two is false as your caloric intake does not double. However, you should increase the amount of calories you're eating as your pregnancy progresses. In general, a woman with a BMI between 18.5 and 25.9 should gain between 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy. A woman with a BMI higher than this should only gain 15 to 25 pounds. Discuss how much weight you should gain with your doctor and know how much you should increase your caloric intake to achieve this goal. If you are pregnant with twins or multiples, you will probably need to gain more weight; discuss this with your doctor. Be sure you get plenty of fresh fruits and veggies. Focus on whole grains, such as oatmeal, whole wheat breads and pastas, brown rice, and barley. Incorporating dairy will give you plenty of potassium and calcium for you and your baby. Be careful with fats. Stick to heart-healthy fats found in avocados, nuts, and olive oil. Fruits and veggies high in vitamin C, vitamin A, iron, and folate are especially good for pregnant women. Try apples, oranges, green beans, spinach, sweet potatoes, pineapple, mangoes, and squash. Zinc is particularly important during pregnancy as its vital in cell development. Chicken, turkey, ham, shrimp, dairy products, beans, and peanut butter are all great sources of zinc. Eating fish can also be a great source of protein, but you should avoid fish that may have high mercury levels, such as swordfish, king mackerel, tilefish, and shark. When your contractions begin, stay calm so you're able to relax in between. This saves up energy for the later and more trying stages of labor. There will be continual breaks between contractions throughout labor. Take advantage of such respites, especially during early labor when contractions themselves are gentler. If possible, sleep between contractions. Practice deep breathing and other relaxation techniques. Have reading and viewing material on-hand so there's something present to distract you and help you relax during the process. Summary:","completion":"Maintaining physical fitness before labor can ease the process and reduce the chances of complications. Engage in exercises such as walking, swimming, kegels, pelvic tilt, and squatting to prepare your body for labor. Nutrition is equally important, with individualized weight gain recommendations based on BMI. Focus on a balanced diet including whole grains, dairy, healthy fats, and vitamin-rich fruits and vegetables. Zinc and fish can be beneficial, but avoid high-mercury fish. During contractions, stay calm, take advantage of breaks, practice deep breathing, and use distractions to relax."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Farrah Fawcett Tribute: Golden Girl's Iconic Journey, Barbara Walters EXCLUSIVE Promotional portrait of, from left, American actresses Farrah Fawcett, Kate Jackson and Jaclyn Smith as they pose with palms together for the television program \\"Charlie's Angels,\\" mid 1977. Growing up in Texas, that so-called \\"curse\\" always lingered. In 1969, as a college beauty queen, Fawcett's looks earned her a ticket to Hollywood where she was discovered by a talent scout. At first, she was one more model and actress surviving on guest parts and commercials, selling everything from shampoo to toothpaste. In 1973, she married actor Lee Majors, who was starring in \\"The Six Million Dollar Man.\\" Three years later, everything changed when posters of Fawcett in her red one-piece bathing suit flew off store shelves and she entered the world of television with a starring role on \\"Charlie's Angels.\\" \\"She wasn't a great actress then, but she was learning,\\" said Leonard Goldberg, who created the hit, along with partner, producer Aaron Spelling. \\"She just had that way about her. When she would turn and look at you, you were mesmerized.\\" Fawcett played one of three undercover, underclothed crime fighters and \\"Charlie's Angels\\" became an enormous hit and cultural phenomenon, working to redefine gender roles. \\"What we had for the first time were women operating in what was heretofore a man's world,\\" Goldberg said. But after only one year, Fawcett walked away from the show at the height of her fame to explore a career in film -- a move, the star told Walters, she did not regret. \\"I would do it over again ... I felt that I needed to grow,\\" Fawcett said in 1980. \\"I find that, for me, personally -- and this is in everyday life -- if I'm not growing, if I can't be stimulated in a conversation, then I am bored. And I'm not good when I'm bored.\\" Jaclyn Smith, one of Fawcett's \\"Angels\\" co-stars, told Walters, \\"I was sad because it was not an actress leaving, it was my friend,\\" but says her friend didn't make a mistake. \\"When Farrah makes up her mind to do something, uh, it's well thought out, it's well ordered and planned, and it's right for her.\\" Her career faltered, but Fawcett was determined to take charge of her life. Firing her manager, her publicist and separating from Majors, the sweet blond from Texas revealed to Walters that she was no more. \\"I think that when you're kind of just shoved out there and you have to be tough and you're facing tough people and people are saying bad things about you, that all of a sudden, you have to become a little less sweet. ... And with this surge in strength, you lose a little of the softness, I guess,\\" she said. Tired of being the sex symbol, Fawcett wanted to be taken seriously, so she dove into an unrecognizable role, playing an abused wife, Francine Hughes, driven to kill her husband in the 1984 movie \\"The Burning Bed.\\" \\"I knew that if I wanted to stay in the business, I had to change. I mean, I wanted to change,\\" she told Walters in a later interview. The TV movie became one of the most highly-rated in history and earned the actress the first of three Emmy nominations. But if her acting career was finally the triumph she always knew it could be, her personal life wasn't.

Google Sued in Spain Over Data Collecting MADRID — A judge in Spain opened an investigation into whether Google unlawfully collected data from unsecured wireless networks while gathering photographs for Google’s photo-mapping service Street View. The judge, Raquel Fernandino, has ordered a representative from Google to appear before her in early October over a lawsuit filed by a Spanish association of Internet users. The summons was issued last month, but made public only this week. Street View has also caused regulatory and legal problems for Google in other European countries with strict privacy laws, including Germany and Switzerland, where opponents of the Street View photo archive have been particularly outspoken. In May, a judge in Hamburg opened a criminal investigation of Google over its collection of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks in Germany. Google has described the collection of the data as accidental and has apologized for what it called a programming error. A spokeswoman for Google Spain, Marisa Toro, said on Tuesday that the company planned to cooperate fully with the judge and other Spanish authorities to resolve the privacy concerns. “We are dedicating a lot of our time to finding a solution so that users can be at ease,” Ms. Toro said. Google introduced Street View in Spain three years ago, and Ms. Toro said that it had proved “very popular.” Plans to expand the coverage in Spain have been delayed pending an outcome in the data collection dispute. The Spanish association of Internet users, whose acronym is Apedanica, contends that Google violated an article in Spain’s criminal code that forbids the unauthorized interception and collection of such communications data. Breaching that law can lead to prison sentences of up to four years. The judge’s investigation is the most serious threat to date in Spain for Google and its mapping service. But Street View had already raised concerns among local regulators. In June, Artemi Rallo, director of the official Spanish data protection agency, Agencia Española de Protección de Datos, said in an interview that Google should hand over the original hard drives containing the actual Wi-Fi payload data — including e-mail text fragments and unencrypted passwords. Under pressure from German privacy regulators, Google acknowledged in May that it had inadvertently collected 600 gigabytes of data from unsecured Wi-Fi networks around the world as it assembled its Street View archive. The company has already agreed to destroy the data collected in Ireland, Denmark and Austria at the request of officials in those countries. Valentín Playá, the lawyer representing the Spanish association that filed the complaint against Google, said on Tuesday that “recognizing the mistake and the excuses presented by Google are not reasons to prevent the investigation, nor a criminal condemnation, if it is judged that the actions amounted to a crime and that there has been a degree of responsibility from Google.” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1.

Geoff Parling and Ian Whitten tries for Exeter helped restore parity. Waldrom grabbed his brace either side of Mitch Eadie's effort, which ensured two crucial bonus points for Bristol. If not for Waldrom's ninth try of the season three minutes from the end, Bristol would have moved to within five points of second-from-bottom Worcester.

Movie plot title: Howl's Moving Castle Movie plot: Sophie, a young hatter, encounters a wizard named Howl on her way to visit her sister Lettie. Upon returning, she meets the Witch of the Waste, who transforms her into a ninety-year-old woman. Seeking to break the curse, Sophie leaves home and sets off through the country. She encounters Howl's moving castle, where she meets Howl's young apprentice, Markl, and the fire-demon Calcifer, who is the source of the castle's energy and magic. When Howl appears, Sophie announces that Calcifer has hired her as a cleaning lady for the house. Meanwhile, Sophie's country is caught up in a war with a neighboring country. The King summons Howl to fight in the war; however, Howl decides to send Sophie to the King under the pretense of being his mother, to tell the king that Howl is too much of a coward to fight. Before leaving, he gives to Sophie a charmed ring that connects her to Calcifer. Sophie meets Suliman, the king's advisor, and also the Witch of the Waste, whom Suliman punishes by draining all of her power, causing her to regress into a harmless old woman. Suliman says that Howl will meet the same fate if he does not fight; Sophie protests passionately in his defense, allowing Suliman to see Sophie's true form, and to realize that she has feelings for Howl. Howl arrives to rescue Sophie; Suliman tries to trap him, but with Sophie's help, they escape along with the former witch. Sophie learns that Howl has been transforming into a bird-like creature in order to interfere with the plans of both sides in the war, but each transformation makes it more difficult for him to return to human form. Sophie's mother â under Suliman's control â arrives and leaves behind a \\"peeping bug.\\" The former witch promptly destroys the bug by tossing it into Calcifer, who then becomes sick and weak and unable to protect the castle.

Old Occitan generally includes Early and Old Occitan. Middle Occitan is sometimes included in Old Occitan, sometimes in Modern Occitan. As the term \\"occitanus\\" appeared around the year 1300, Old Occitan is referred to as \\"Romance\\" (Occitan: \\"romans\\") or \\"Provençal\\" (Occitan: \\"proensals\\") in medieval texts. - The trobairises (singular: trobairitz) were Occitan female troubadours of the 12th and 13th centuries, active from around 1170 to approximately 1260. The word \\"trobairitz\\" was first used in the 13th-century romance \\"Flamenca\\". It comes from the Provençal word \\"trobar\\", the literal meaning of which is \\"to find\\", and the technical meaning of which is \\"to compose\\". The word \\"trobairitz\\" is used very rarely in medieval Occitan, as it does not occur in lyrical poetry, grammatical treatises, or in the biographies of the \\"trobairitz\\" or troubadours. \\"Trobairitz\\" composed, wrote verses, and performed for the Occitan noble courts. They are exceptional in musical history as the first known female composers of Western secular music; all earlier known female composers wrote sacred music. The \\"trobairitz\\" were part of courtly society, as opposed to their lower class counterparts the \\"joglaressas\\". Although troubadours sometimes came from humble originsBernart de Ventadorn may have been the son of a castle's bakerthe \\"trobairitz\\" were nobly born. The most important \\"trobairitz\\" are Alamanda de Castelnau, Azalais de Porcairagues, Maria de Ventadorn, Tibors, Castelloza, Garsenda de Proença, Gormonda de Monpeslier, and the Comtessa de Diá. - France, officially the French Republic, is a country with territory in western Europe and several overseas regions and territories. The European, or metropolitan, area of France extends from the Mediterranean Sea to the English Channel and the North Sea, and from the Rhine to the Atlantic Ocean. Overseas France include French Guiana on the South American continent and several island territories in the Atlantic, Pacific and Indian oceans. France spans and had a total population of almost 67 million people as of January 2017. It is a unitary semi-presidential republic with the capital in Paris, the country's largest city and main cultural and commercial centre. Other major urban centres include Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Nice, Toulouse and Bordeaux. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits. The city is both a commune and department, and forms the centre and headquarters of the Île-de-France, or Paris Region, which has an area of and a population in 2014 of 12,005,077, comprising 18.2 percent of the population of France. - Aude is a department in south-central France named after the river Aude. The local council also calls the department \\"Cathar Country\\". Aude is also a frequent feminine French given name in Francophone countries, deriving initially from Aude or Oda, a wife of Bertrand, Duke of Aquitaine, and mother of Saint Hubertus's brother Eudo. Aude was the name of Roland's fiancée in the chansons de geste. - A troubadour was a composer and performer of Old Occitan lyric poetry during the High Middle Ages (11001350). Since the word \\"troubadour\\" is etymologically masculine, a female troubadour is usually called a trobairitz. - Lyric poetry is a formal type of poetry which expresses personal emotions or feelings, typically spoken in the first person. The term derives from a form of Ancient Greek literature, the lyric, which was defined by its musical accompaniment, usually on a stringed instrument known as a lyre. The term owes its importance in literary theory to the division developed by Aristotle between three broad categories of poetry: lyrical, dramatic and epic. - Narbonne (Occitan: \\"Narbona\\") is a commune in southern France in the Occitanie region. It lies from Paris in the Aude department, of which it is a sub-prefecture. Once a prosperous port, and a major city in Roman times, it is now located about from the shores of the Mediterranean Sea. It is marginally the largest commune in Aude, although the prefecture is the slightly smaller commune of Carcassonne. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - A minstrel was a medieval European entertainer. Originally describing any type of entertainer such as a musician, juggler, acrobat, singer or fool, the term later, from the sixteenth century, came to mean a specialist entertainer who sang songs and played musical instruments. - Peire Rogier ( born c. 1145 ) was a twelfth - century Auvergnat troubadour ( fl . 1160 -- 1180 ) and cathedral canon from Clermont . He left his cathedral to become a travelling minstrel before settling down for a time in Narbonne at the court of the Viscountess Ermengard . His life and career are known because his late thirteenth - century vida survives , as well as some of his works . The reliability of his vida , upon which all the details of his goings and comings are known , however , is not complete . According to it , he left the religious life to become a jongleur . He fell in love with his hostess and patron and wrote many songs in her honour , giving Ermengard the nickname Tort - n'avetz ( \`\` You are wrong '' ) , but for what reasons is unknown . Eventually the people of the Narbonnaise believed that he was in a sexual relationship with the viscountess and so she asked him to leave . He moved on to the court of Raimbaut d'Aurenga , where he also remained for a long time . From Raimbaut 's court he moved on to sojourn at that of Alfonso VIII of Castile , then that of Alfonso II of Aragon , and finally that of Raymond V of Toulouse , where he arrived circa 1170 . According to his vida , he became much esteemed as a troubadour through his travels , but there is no evidence otherwise for any movements in Spain , except perhaps the assembly of troubadours at the court of Aragon mentioned in a work of Peire d'Alvernhe ( which need not have taken place ) . He entered the Order of Grandmont before his death . Peire Rogier 's style of courtly love poetry is of the extremely reverent variety , in which the man submits completely to his lady and she is a paragon of virtue and courtliness ( though the word cortezia is absent from his surviving works ) . She can by mere words convert a boorish man into a courtly one . Love need not be physical to be enjoyed and suffering on behalf of one 's lady is considered pleasure .

Q:What is the name of the group that had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer\\"? Answer the above question based on the context below: McVeigh later said that he had contemplated assassinating Attorney General Janet Reno, Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he said that he sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.A resident of Kingman, Arizona, McVeigh considered targets in Missouri, Arizona, Texas, and Arkansas. He stated in his authorized biography that he wanted to minimize non-governmental casualties, so he ruled out a 40-story government building in Little Rock, Arkansas, because of the presence of a florist's shop on the ground floor. In December 1994, McVeigh and Fortier visited Oklahoma City to inspect McVeigh's target: the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. The Murrah building had been previously targeted in October 1983 by white supremacist group The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord, including founder James Ellison and Richard Snell. The group had plotted to park \\"a van or trailer in front of the Federal Building and blow it up with rockets detonated by a timer.\\" After Snell's appeal for murdering two people in unrelated cases was denied, he was executed the same day as the Murrah bombing.The nine-story building, built in 1977, was named for a federal judge and housed fourteen federal agencies, including the DEA, ATF, Social Security Administration, and recruiting offices for the Army and Marine Corps.

The Stooges operate a local drugstore whose landlord, the cantankerous Amos Flint, informs them their lease is about to expire. Larry protests that the trio have had their establishment for a decade, and do not want to leave. As the four bicker, Flint's elderly wife Cerina enters the store, only to be berated by Flint for being an old hag. \\"25 years is enough,\\" he coldly confirms. After he storms off, the boys take to the frail Cerina, who begins to weep that ever since she lost her beauty, Amos had threatened to leave. Both saddened and incensed, the Stooges offer Cerina their spare room in the back. Shemp, seeing this, hatches a plan to invent a \\"Fountain of Youth\\" to restore Cerina to her stunning beauty. Deeming the idea \\"tremendous, colossal and putrid,\\" the Stooges flee to their pharmaceutical lab and mix together a powerful serum. After several false tries, the trio give Cerina a taste of their Fountain of Youth, and she transforms into a fetching beauty right before their eyes. Several days later, Amos comes storming into the Stooges' drug store only to see the youthful Cerina flaunting her newfound beauty. Amos quickly reneges on his threat to evict the Stooges and even gives them the deed to their store in exchange for a dose of the serum himself.

Option A: 0.184 Option B: 0.16 Option C: 0.18 Option D: 0.147 Option E: 0.148","completion":"Let's break down the task: 1. We have a 10-sided die with three red sides. 2. Kumar rolls the die 3 times. 3. We want to find the probability of the die landing red for the first time on the third roll. We will use probability concepts to solve this problem. We first need to identify the probability of getting a red side on one roll and the probability of getting a non-red side on one roll. Probability of rolling a red side (R) = Number of red sides / Total sides = 3/10 Probability of rolling a non-red side (N) = Non-red sides / Total sides = 7/10 (since there are 10 - 3 = 7 non-red sides) Now, we want the die to land red for the first time on the third roll. This means the sequence of rolls should be: Non-Red, Non-Red, Red (N-N-R). Probability of this sequence: P(N-N-R) = P(N) * P(N) * P(R) = (7/10) * (7/10) * (3/10) Now, multiply the fractions: P(N-N-R) = (7 * 7 * 3) / (10 * 10 * 10) = 147 / 1000 = 0.147 So the probability of Kumar rolling a red side for the first time on the third roll is 0.147.

Laura, being a devoted Catholic and an active member of their local parish, felt it was important to ensure that Lindsey understood and recited the prayers accurately. This would not only help Lindsey in achieving a stronger connection with her faith but also maintain the sanctity of the prayer itself. Step 1: Listen to Lindsey's recitation and note down the errors or omissions Laura listened attentively as Lindsey recited the prayer. While doing so, she carefully noted down the parts where Lindsey had faltered or skipped any lines. This would help her address the specific issues in Lindsey's recitation later. Step 2: Understand the reason behind Lindsey's mistakes In order to better assist Lindsey, Laura asked her about her experiences with Catholic prayers and whether she encountered any difficulties in understanding or remembering the lines. Gaining insight into Lindsey's background with prayers would help Laura tailor her approach to suit Lindsey's needs and make the learning process more effective. Step 3: Clarify the purpose and significance of each part of the prayer Before correcting the actual recitation, Laura explained the purpose and significance of each section of the prayer to Lindsey. This would provide Lindsey with a deeper understanding of the prayer, thereby making it easier for her to remember and internalize the correct lines. Step 4: Address the errors or omissions in Lindsey's recitation With a clear understanding of the prayer's meaning and Lindsey's experiences in mind, Laura went on to address the specific errors and omissions that she had noted earlier. She recited the correct lines alongside Lindsey and encouraged her to follow suit. Laura made sure to let Lindsey know that it was completely normal to make mistakes and that practice would only make her better. Step 5: Encourage Lindsey to practice reciting the prayer with the correct lines Once the corrections had been made, Laura asked Lindsey to practice the prayer several times on her own with the newly learned lines in place. Laura emphasized the importance of repetition in grasping the structure and flow of the prayer, and how it would eventually become second nature to Lindsey. Step 6: Offer support and reassurance Throughout the process, Laura made it a point to be supportive and reassuring. She reminded Lindsey that even seasoned Catholics can make errors when reciting prayers, and that the key to improvement is perseverance and patience. By going through this step-by-step process, Laura ensured that Lindsey would not only learn the correct version of the prayer, but also develop a deeper understanding of its significance and purpose in her religious journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It is nonmetallic and tetravalentmaking four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. Three isotopes occur naturally, C and C being stable, while C is a radioactive isotope, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity. - The Eocene Epoch, lasting from , is a major division of the geologic timescale and the second epoch of the Paleogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Eocene spans the time from the end of the Paleocene Epoch to the beginning of the Oligocene Epoch. The start of the Eocene is marked by a brief period in which the concentration of the carbon isotope C in the atmosphere was exceptionally low in comparison with the more common isotope C. The end is set at a major extinction event called the \\"Grande Coupure\\" (the \\"Great Break\\" in continuity) or the EoceneOligocene extinction event, which may be related to the impact of one or more large bolides in Siberia and in what is now Chesapeake Bay. As with other geologic periods, the strata that define the start and end of the epoch are well identified, though their exact dates are slightly uncertain. - The Phanerozoic Eon (British English Phanærozoic) is the current geologic eon in the geologic time scale, and the one during which abundant animal and plant life has existed. It covers million years to the present, and began with the Cambrian Period when diverse hard-shelled animals first appeared. Its name was derived from the Ancient Greek words (phanerós) and (z), meaning \\"visible life\\", since it was once believed that life began in the Cambrian, the first period of this eon. The time before the Phanerozoic, called the \\"Precambrian\\" supereon, is now divided into the Hadean, Archaean and Proterozoic eons. - The Cretaceous is a geologic period and system that spans 79 million years from the end of the Jurassic Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Paleogene Period Mya. It is the last period of the Mesozoic Era. The Cretaceous Period is usually abbreviated K, for its German translation \\"Kreide\\" (chalk). - Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number. All isotopes of a given element have the same number of protons in each atom. The term isotope is formed from the Greek roots isos ( \\"equal\\") and topos ( \\"place\\"), meaning \\"the same place\\"; thus, the meaning behind the name is that different isotopes of a single element occupy the same position on the periodic table. - The Miocene is the first geological epoch of the Neogene Period and extends from about (Ma). The Miocene was named by Sir Charles Lyell. Its name comes from the Greek words (', less) and (', new) and means \\"less recent\\" because it has 18% fewer modern sea invertebrates than the Pliocene. The Miocene follows the Oligocene Epoch and is followed by the Pliocene Epoch. - An extinction event (also known as a mass extinction or biotic crisis) is a widespread and rapid decrease in the biodiversity on Earth. Such an event is identified by a sharp change in the diversity and abundance of multicellular organisms. It occurs when the rate of extinction increases with respect to the rate of speciation. Because the majority of diversity and biomass on Earth is microbial, and thus difficult to measure, recorded extinction events affect the easily observed, biologically complex component of the biosphere rather than the total diversity and abundance of life. - Sir Charles Lyell, 1st Baronet, (14 November 1797 22 February 1875) was a British lawyer and the foremost geologist of his day. He is best known as the author of \\"Principles of Geology\\", which popularized James Hutton's concepts of uniformitarianismthe idea that the Earth was shaped by the same processes still in operation today. \\"Principles of Geology\\" also challenged theories popularized by Georges Cuvier, which were the most accepted and circulated ideas about geology in England at the time. - A bolide (French via Latin from the Greek \\"bolís\\", \\"missile\\") is an extremely bright meteor, especially one that explodes in the atmosphere. In astronomy, it refers to a fireball about as bright as the full moon, and it is generally considered a synonym of a fireball. In geology, a bolide is a very large impactor. - The Paleocene or Palaeocene, the \\"old recent\\", is a geologic epoch that lasted from about . It is the first epoch of the Paleogene Period in the modern Cenozoic Era. As with many geologic periods, the strata that define the epoch's beginning and end are well identified, but the exact ages remain uncertain. - The Paleogene (or ; also spelled Palaeogene or Palæogene; informally Lower Tertiary) is a geologic period and system that spans 43 million years from the end of the Cretaceous Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the Neogene Period Mya. It is the beginning of the Cenozoic Era of the present Phanerozoic Eon. The Paleogene is most notable for being the time during which mammals diversified from relatively small, simple forms into a large group of diverse animals in the wake of the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event that ended the preceding Cretaceous Period. - The Pliocene (also Pleiocene) Epoch is the epoch in the geologic timescale that extends from 5.333 million to 2.58 million years BP. It is the second and youngest epoch of the Neogene Period in the Cenozoic Era. The Pliocene follows the Miocene Epoch and is followed by the Pleistocene Epoch. Prior to the 2009 revision of the geologic time scale, which placed the four most recent major glaciations entirely within the Pleistocene, the Pliocene also included the Gelasian stage, which lasted from 2.588 to 1.806 million years ago, and is now included in the Pleistocene. - An era is a span of time marked by character, events, changes on earth, etc. When used in science, for example geology, an \\"era\\" denotes a clearly defined period of time of arbitrary but well-defined length, such as for example the Mesozoic Era frozen m 252 Ma66 Ma, delimited by a start event and an end event. When used in social history, eras may for example denote a period of some monarch's reign. In colloquial language, eras denote longer spans of time, before and after which the practices or fashions change to a significant degree. When era is extended to a calendar system, it is known as a calendar era. In Sanskrit or Indian culture eras are known as yugas. - The transition between the end of the Eocene and the beginning of the Oligocene is marked by large-scale extinction and floral and faunal turnover (although minor in comparison to the largest mass extinctions). Most of the affected organisms were marine or aquatic in nature. They included the last of the ancient cetaceans, the Archaeoceti. - Animals are multicellular, eukaryotic organisms of the kingdom Animalia (also called Metazoa). The animal kingdom emerged as a basal clade within Apoikozoa as a sister of the choanoflagellates. Sponges are the most basal clade of animals. Animals are motile, meaning they can move spontaneously and independently at some point in their lives. Their body plan eventually becomes fixed as they develop, although some undergo a process of metamorphosis later in their lives. All animals are heterotrophs: they must ingest other organisms or their products for sustenance. - Invertebrates are animals that neither possess nor develop a vertebral column (commonly known as a \\"backbone\\" or \\"spine\\"), derived from the notochord. This includes all animals apart from the subphylum Vertebrata. Familiar examples of invertebrates include insects; crabs, lobsters and their kin; snails, clams, octopuses and their kin; starfish, sea-urchins and their kin; and worms. - The Oligocene / losin / ( symbol OG ) is a geologic epoch of the Paleogene Period and extends from about 33.9 million to 23 million years before the present ( 33.9 ± 0.1 to 23.03 ± 0.05 Ma ) . As with other older geologic periods , the rock beds that define the epoch are well identified but the exact dates of the start and end of the epoch are slightly uncertain . The name Oligocene comes from the Greek ( oligos , few ) and ( kainos , new ) , and refers to the sparsity of extant forms of molluscs . The Oligocene is preceded by the Eocene Epoch and is followed by the Miocene Epoch . The Oligocene is the third and final epoch of the Paleogene Period . The Oligocene is often considered an important time of transition , a link between the archaic world of the tropical Eocene and the more modern ecosystems of the Miocene . Major changes during the Oligocene included a global expansion of grasslands , and a regression of tropical broad leaf forests to the equatorial belt . The start of the Oligocene is marked by a notable extinction event called the Grande Coupure ; it featured the replacement of European fauna with Asian fauna , except for the endemic rodent and marsupial families . By contrast , the Oligocene -- Miocene boundary is not set at an easily identified worldwide event but rather at regional boundaries between the warmer late Oligocene and the relatively cooler Miocene . - Tertiary is the former term for the geologic period from 66 million to 2.58 million years ago, a time span that lies between the superseded Secondary period and the Quaternary. The Tertiary is no longer recognized as a formal unit by the International Commission on Stratigraphy, but the word is still widely used. The traditional span of the Tertiary has been divided between the Paleogene and Neogene Periods and extends to the first stage of the Pleistocene Epoch, the Gelasian age. The period began with the demise of the non-avian dinosaurs in the CretaceousPaleogene extinction event, at the start of the Cenozoic Era, and extended to the beginning of the Quaternary glaciation at the end of the Pliocene Epoch. - The Cenozoic Era (also Cænozoic, Caenozoic or Cainozoic ; meaning \\"new life\\", from Greek \\"kainos\\" \\"new\\", and \\"zoe\\" \\"life\\") is the current and most recent of the three Phanerozoic geological eras, following the Mesozoic Era and covering the period from 66 million years ago to present day. - The Neogene is a geologic period and system that spans 20.45 million years from the end of the Paleogene Period million years ago (Mya) to the beginning of the present Quaternary Period Mya. The Neogene is sub-divided into two epochs, the earlier Miocene and the later Pliocene. Some geologists assert that the Neogene cannot be clearly delineated from the modern geological period, the Quaternary.

Plot title: The Core Movie plot: Geophysicist Dr. Josh Keyes (Aaron Eckhart) and scientists Serge Leveque (TchÃ©ky Karyo) and Conrad Zimsky (Stanley Tucci) become aware of an instability of Earth's magnetic field after a series of incidents across the globe. They determine that the Earth's molten core, which generates this field, has stopped rotating, and within a year the field will collapse exposing the planet's surface directly to devastating solar radiation. Backed by the U.S. Government, Keyes, Leveque, and Zimsky create a plan to bore down to the core and set off several nuclear explosions to restart the rotation. They gain help of rogue scientist Ed \\"Braz\\" Brazzelton (Delroy Lindo) who has devised a vessel made of \\"Unobtainium\\" that can withstand the heat and pressure within the Earth's crust and convert it to energy, as well as a laser-driven boring system that will allow them to quickly pass through the crust. Construction starts immediately on the Virgil, a multi-compartment vessel to be helmed by Space Shuttle pilots Commander Robert Iverson (Bruce Greenwood) and Major Rebecca \\"Beck\\" Childs (Hilary Swank) who will join Keyes and the others. To prevent a worldwide panic, Keyes enlists computer hacker Theodore Donald \\"Rat\\" Finch (DJ Qualls) to scour the Internet and eliminate all traces of the pending disaster or their plan. Virgil is launched through the Marianas Trench from an offshore platform. The team accidentally drills through a gigantic empty geode structure, damaging the lasers when it lands at its base and cracking the geode's structure and causing magma to flow in. The crew repair and restart the laser array in time, but Iverson is killed by a falling crystal shard that hits him in the helmet, while returning to the ship. As Virgil continues, it clips a huge diamond that breaches the hull of the last compartment.

The answer to the question: What is the last name of Rose's ex-boyfriend? is inside the article: In Bridger's Wells, Nevada in 1885, Art Croft and Gil Carter ride into town and enter Darby's Saloon. The atmosphere is subdued due to recent incidents of cattle-rustling. Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal. Art and Gil join the posse to avoid raising even more suspicion. Davies, who was initially opposed to forming the posse, also joins, along with \\"Major\\" Tetley and his son Gerald. Poncho informs the posse that three men and cattle bearing Kinkaid's brand have just entered Bridger's Pass. The posse encounters a stagecoach. When they try to stop it, the stagecoach guard assumes that it is a stickup, and shoots, wounding Art. In the coach are Rose Mapen, Gil's ex-girlfriend, and her new husband, Swanson. Later that night in Ox-Bow Canyon, the posse finds three men sleeping, with what are presumed to be stolen cattle nearby. The posse interrogates them: a young, well-spoken man, Donald Martin; a Mexican, Juan Martínez; and an old man, Alva Hardwicke (Francis Ford, brother of film director John Ford).

Here is a question: How much did a knight 's armor weigh ? Would the answer to this question be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"How much did a knight's armor weigh?\\" would be a numeric value. Typically, the weight of a knight's armor varied based upon the period, geographical location and the specific type of armor being used. However, on average, a full suit of medieval knight's armor would average around 20-25 kg (45-55 lbs). Knight's armor was not evenly distributed throughout the body. Most of the weight was taken by the lower body, because the chest plate, back plate, and tassets (thigh armor) were some of the heaviest parts in the armor. The weight was also dependent on the material of the armor. Earlier armors, such as chainmail, were lighter than later full-plate armors. However, even though later full-plate armors were heavier, they offered better protection and distributed the weight more evenly over the body, enabling knights to retain their mobility. The armor had to be maneuverable enough to allow the knight to move freely on the battlefield, ride a horse, and engage the enemy effectively. For example, in the high medieval period (11-13th centuries), a suit of mail, including hauberk (mail shirt), coif (mail hood), and chausses (mail leggings), would weigh around 10-15 kg (22-33 lbs). In the late medieval period (14-15th centuries), when full plate armor became common, the total weight could increase up to 25-30 kg (55-66 lbs). During the Renaissance period (16-17th centuries), the full plate armor continued to be used, but there was a greater focus on the aesthetic look of the armor, adding more decorative features and sometimes sacrificing some aspects of practicality. The weight in this era was roughly the same as late medieval full-plate armor, although some particularly ornate armors designed for parades and ceremonies might have been heavier. To sum up, the exact weight of a knight's armor would depend on many variables, but as a general rule, a complete set of knight's armor would weigh around 20-25 kg (45-55 lbs)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Gymnophobia is the fear of nudity or being naked in the presence of others. It is derived from the Greek word \\"gymnos,\\" which means naked, and \\"phobia,\\" which means fear or aversion. Individuals experiencing gymnophobia are often exceptionally worried, uncomfortable, or anxious about the thought of being seen without clothes, or even seeing others in a naked state. Gymnophobia can arise from various causes, such as cultural influences, personal experiences, or upbringing. It may also be related to issues concerning body image, self-esteem, vulnerability, or privacy. In some cases, gymnophobia might be linked to traumatic incidents in the past, such as sexual abuse or an embarrassing situation involving nudity. Symptoms of gymnophobia can vary widely among individuals but commonly include: 1. Intense anxiety or panic when faced with the prospect of being naked, or seeing others naked, even in situations where it is considered normal or acceptable (e.g., locker rooms, medical examinations, or intimate relationships). 2. Avoidance of situations where nudity might be involved or expected (e.g., public swimming pools, beaches, gym facilities, or romantic relationships). 3. Feelings of shame, guilt, or embarrassment when thinking about the possibility of being seen naked. 4. Physical symptoms such as sweating, heart palpitations, shortness of breath, shaking, or nausea when exposed to nudity or the idea of nudity. 5. Intrusive thoughts or excessive rumination about nudity, which can lead to sleep disturbances and difficulties concentrating. Treatment options for gymnophobia can include various therapeutic approaches that aim to address the root causes of the fear and help the individual develop healthier ways of thinking and coping with their phobia. Some common treatments include: 1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This form of therapy focuses on identifying and challenging unhealthy thought patterns related to nudity and teaching individuals new strategies to cope with their fears. 2. Exposure therapy: This involves confronting the fear of nudity by gradually exposing individuals to various levels of nudity in a controlled, safe, and supportive environment. 3. Psychotherapy: Various forms of talk therapy can help individuals explore the underlying causes of their phobia, such as cultural, traumatic or psychological influences that lead to the development of the fear. 4. Medications: In some instances, medications may be prescribed to help manage symptoms of anxiety and stress related to gymnophobia. These may include antidepressants, benzodiazepines, or beta-blockers. 5. Relaxation techniques: Practices such as mindfulness, meditation, or deep-breathing exercises can help individuals manage anxiety and stress more effectively. The efficacy of each treatment may vary depending on the individual's severity of gymnophobia, their specific triggers, and their willingness to engage in therapy. Success and recovery will depend on the extent to which an individual can identify and address the root causes of their fear and develop effective coping strategies to manage the anxiety related to nudity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the province in whose southern areas are found the only extensive agriculture? ? The province has a saltwater coastline bordering Hudson Bay and more than 110,000 lakes, covering approximately 15.6 percent or 101,593 square kilometres (39,225 sq mi) of its surface area. Manitoba's major lakes are Lake Manitoba, Lake Winnipegosis, and Lake Winnipeg, the tenth-largest freshwater lake in the world. Some traditional Native lands and boreal forest on Lake Winnipeg's east side are a proposed UNESCO World Heritage Site.Manitoba is at the centre of the Hudson Bay drainage basin, with a high volume of the water draining into Lake Winnipeg and then north down the Nelson River into Hudson Bay. This basin's rivers reach far west to the mountains, far south into the United States, and east into Ontario. Major watercourses include the Red, Assiniboine, Nelson, Winnipeg, Hayes, Whiteshell and Churchill rivers. Most of Manitoba's inhabited south has developed in the prehistoric bed of Glacial Lake Agassiz. This region, particularly the Red River Valley, is flat and fertile; receding glaciers left hilly and rocky areas throughout the province.Baldy Mountain is the province's highest point at 832 metres (2,730 ft) above sea level, and the Hudson Bay coast is the lowest at sea level. Riding Mountain, the Pembina Hills, Sandilands Provincial Forest, and the Canadian Shield are also upland regions. Much of the province's sparsely inhabited north and east lie on the irregular granite Canadian Shield, including Whiteshell, Atikaki, and Nopiming Provincial Parks.Extensive agriculture is found only in the province's southern areas, although there is grain farming in the Carrot Valley Region (near The Pas). The most common agricultural activity is cattle husbandry (34.6%), followed by assorted grains (19.0%) and oilseed (7.9%). Around 12 percent of Canada's farmland is in Manitoba.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? of a picture that was n't all that great to begin with","completion":"Processing sentiment analysis involves considering how words are used contextually to express positive, negative or neutral sentiments. Below are the steps I would use for a basic sentiment analysis on the provided sentence: The sentence for analysis is: \\"of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with.\\" Step 1: Break down the sentence; The key elements here include \\"wasn't,\\" which is a contraction of \\"was not\\", \\"all\\", \\"that\\", and \\"great\\". The phrase \\"wasn't all that great\\" stands out as containing sentiment meaning. Step 2: Analyze each component; \\"Wasn't\\" indicates a negative as it's negating what follows. \\"All\\" and \\"that\\" together in this context are used to intensify the sentiment of the adjective that follows, which is \\"great.\\" So, overall, \\"wasn't all that great\\" is a phrase used to express strong negativity or dissatisfaction. Step 3: Combine the sentiment meanings; Since there are no conflicting sentiments in the sentence, we can conclude that the sentence carries a negative sentiment. In conclusion, the sentiment of the sentence \\"of a picture that wasn't all that great to begin with\\" is negative.

He says that \\"thirst is used to make an animal realize that it needs to replenish its bodily water by the body\\" and \\"humans are animals too\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"what uses thirst to realize it needs to replenish bodily water?\\" is humans and animals in general. Thirst is a basic physiological response experienced by various living organisms, particularly humans and animals, as a way to regulate their water intake. Professor's hint that \\"thirst is used to make an animal realize that it needs to replenish its bodily water by the body\\" and \\"humans are animals too\\" indicates that the response of thirst is not exclusive to any specific species, but rather a shared attribute amongst animals, including humans. Water is essential for all living organisms, as it plays vital roles in numerous physiological processes such as maintaining body temperature, transporting nutrients, waste elimination, and ensuring the proper functioning of cells. Consequently, maintaining an adequate balance of water within the body is crucial for survival. When the body experiences a decrease in water levels, the hypothalamus, a region in the brain, sends signals that trigger the sensation of thirst. This response prompts individuals to consume water to replenish their bodies, restoring the balance and ensuring proper physiological functioning. In conclusion, both humans and animals use the sensation of thirst to realize that it is necessary to replenish their bodily water. This fundamental biological response is vital for maintaining water homeostasis and allows organisms to maintain a proper balance of water to support their overall well-being and various physiological processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Standing on a high walkway of planks behind the palisade of the crusaders' small wooden fort, he heard faraway voices and saw torches moving on the Cathar rampart. The two men on watch with him that night, a sergeant from Champagne and a young man-at-arms from Brittany, were talking in low tones about the women to be had far below, at the foot of the mountain. They seemed not to see the activity about the Cathar stronghold on the upper peak of the mountaintop opposite their own fort. But Roland, knowing Diane was in the besieged fortress, could not take his eyes from it. He knew he had to act soon. Each day the crusaders grew stronger and the Cathars weaker. Once the Cathar stronghold fell, the crusaders would slaughter all within, including Diane. The sergeant, chuckling, was offering his young companion a wineskin. The Breton never received it. From behind the Cathar wall came the sound of a huge thump, as if a giant's fist had pounded Mont Segur. Roland recognized the sound, and fought panic as he thrust his arms out, trying to push the other two men toward the ladder. But there was no time for them to climb down to safety. The thump was the counter-weight of a stone-caster, and the whistling noise that followed fast upon it was the rock it had thrown. A shape as big as a wine barrel blotted out the stars. The stone hit the parapet beside Roland, and the whole palisade shuddered. Roland caught a glimpse of the sergeant's horrified face and heard his scream as the boulder struck him, crushing him to the ground. Question: How long did it take the boulder to hit the sergeant?

Joe Denton, a corrupt ex-cop, is released from jail. Six years earlier, while on the mob's payroll, Denton attacked district attorney Phil Coakley, earning him the enmity of the police and the nickname \\"slash cop\\". After finding his ex-wife has left the city with their children, he moves in with his elderly parents. Denton researches his ex-wife on the internet, eventually digging up a phone number. After briefly talking to one of his daughters, his ex-wife takes the phone and threatens to press charges if he ever contacts them again. Denton passes a bar on his way back home. Although a recovering alcoholic, he enters and orders a drink. His friend Scotty, the brother of Denton's slain partner, greets him and offers him any help he needs. A young woman asks Denton for a ride home. Denton is surprised when she reveals herself to be Coakley's daughter and intentionally bloodies herself. Cued by her cries for help, two men drag Denton from his car; Denton beats both men savagely. After Denton is questioned by the police, Coakley admits the evidence backs up his story and reluctantly asks if Denton wants to press charges. Denton declines, saying he wants to leave his history in the past, to the disgust of Coakley and Lieutenant Pleasant, who calls him a disgrace. Pleasant, revealed to also be corrupt, demands Denton kill mob boss Manny Vassey, who has found religion on his deathbed. Pleasant explains Vassey's guilty conscience may lead him to confess to Coakley. Pleasant promises to help Denton renegotiate the terms of the settlement with his ex-wife if he kills Vassey. At his house, Vassey denies the rumors. As Vassey falls asleep, Denton begins to suffocate him, only to be interrupted by Charlotte Boyd, Vassey's hospice nurse. Denton smoothly thanks her for her work and leaves the house, where he encounters Vassey's sadistic son, Junior. Junior threatens to kill Denton, enraged that Vassey would see him while avoiding his own son.

Question: What is the Almaty? Context: On the next day, December 18, protests turned into civil unrest as clashes between troops, volunteers, militia units, and Kazakh students turned into a wide-scale confrontation. The clashes could only be controlled on the third day. The Almaty events were followed by smaller protests and demonstrations in Shymkent, Pavlodar, Karaganda, and Taldykorgan. Reports from Kazakh SSR authorities estimated that the riots drew 3,000 people. Other estimates are of at least 30,000 to 40,000 protestors with 5,000 arrested and jailed, and an unknown number of casualties. Jeltoqsan leaders say over 60,000 Kazakhs participated in the protests. According to the Kazakh SSR government, there were two deaths during the riots, including a volunteer police worker and a student. Both of them had died due to blows to the head. About 100 others were detained and several others were sentenced to terms in labor camps. Sources cited by the Library of Congress claimed that at least 200 people died or were summarily executed soon thereafter; some accounts estimate casualties at more than 1,000.

Premise: \\"and always thought you know that being raised in the midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than uh shoplifting\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"I thought that being raised in the midwest you'd see more heinous crimes since there isn't anything else to do to keep people out of trouble.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise that \\"being raised in the Midwest you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than shoplifting,\\" it would appear that the hypothesis \\"I thought that being raised in the Midwest you'd see more heinous crimes since there isn't anything else to do to keep people out of trouble\\" is not true. The premise and the hypothesis contradict each other, and here is a detailed explanation of this contradiction. 1. Crime rates in different regions: The original premise suggests that the Midwest's crime rates, or at least the severity of those crimes, are relatively low. According to this statement, the person has not witnessed any crimes more severe than shoplifting in their upbringing within the Midwest. This implies that the author believes that the Midwest has a lower crime rate or lower severity of criminal actions than other regions, potentially due to its geography, culture, or community aspects. The hypothesis, however, suggests the complete opposite: that being raised in the Midwest might lead to higher rates of heinous crimes, as there are not many other options for entertainment or activities to keep people occupied. This argument might stem from a belief that boredom or lack of engagement in recreational activities could lead to an increase in criminal activity. 2. The nature of heinous crimes: Heinous crimes refer to exceptionally severe criminal offenses, such as murder, rape, or other acts of significant harm or violence. The premise's assertion that the person has not observed or experienced crimes of this nature in the Midwest contradicts the hypothesis that such crimes should be more prevalent in the same region. 3. Historical and statistical data: To determine if either the premise or the hypothesis is true, it would be helpful to look at statistics regarding crime rates and the types of criminal activities prevalent in different regions. FBI crime data suggests that, overall, the Midwestern states have relatively low crime rates compared to other U.S. regions. Specific cities within the Midwest might show higher crime rates than others, but on a broader scale, the general picture does not seem to support the hypothesis mentioned. 4. Factors affecting criminal activities: In order to claim that boredom or lack of entertainment/activity options would lead to an increase in heinous crimes, one must assume a direct correlation between these factors and criminal behavior. While it is true that socioeconomic factors, educational opportunities, and other aspects might influence criminal activity, it is important to remember that crime rates and types of crimes vary widely across different areas and communities. In conclusion, the initial premise that \\"being raised in the Midwest, you really didn't see any crimes really any more heinous than shoplifting\\" directly conflicts with the hypothesis suggesting that growing up in the Midwest exposes individuals to a higher occurrence of heinous crimes. Looking at historical crime data and considering various factors affecting criminal activities, logic supports the premise and contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore, based on the given information and data available, the hypothesis is deemed not true."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

What company was founded by Julius Kahn in Detroit, Michigan?","completion":"The Trussed Concrete Steel Company was founded by Julius Kahn in Detroit, Michigan, in 1903. Julius Kahn was a prominent structural engineer, inventor, and entrepreneur known for his innovations in reinforced concrete construction. Born in 1874 in Germany, Kahn immigrated to the United States with his family when he was a child. He later studied at the University of Michigan and obtained his civil engineering degree in 1897. After graduating, Julius worked alongside his brother Albert Kahn, who was a well-known architect, developing various types of buildings. It was during this time that Julius recognized the limitations of traditional wood and masonry construction methods, particularly for larger buildings that required greater strength and fire resistance. This led him to experiment with new materials and construction methods, focusing specifically on reinforced concrete. In 1902, Julius Kahn applied for a patent on what he called the \\"Kahn Bar,\\" a uniquely designed T- or Y-shaped reinforcing steel bar that could be embedded within concrete beams and slabs to create a stronger construction material. The advantage of the Kahn Bar was that it provided increased tensile strength in the concrete, allowing for longer and larger building spans, as well as improved fire resistance. With the invention of the Kahn Bar, Julius Kahn saw the potential for this new technology and founded the Trussed Concrete Steel Company in 1903 in Detroit, Michigan. Julius took the role of chief engineer at the company, while Albert assisted as the architect to design buildings that utilized the company's innovations. The company later became known as the Kahn System of Reinforced Concrete. The Trussed Concrete Steel Company quickly grew in size and reputation, as reinforced concrete became increasingly popular in the construction of commercial and industrial buildings, bridges, and other large-scale projects. The company was involved in the construction of numerous iconic buildings and structures during its existence, including the Packard Automotive Plant in Detroit, Michigan, the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn, Michigan, and several structures outside the US, such as the Kremlin Palace of Congresses in Moscow, Russia. In 1932, the company changed its name to the Kahn Structural Steel Company, reflecting the shift of emphasis from concrete reinforcement to steel construction. Despite the challenges faced during the Great Depression, the company continued to grow and remained active for several decades. The company was eventually acquired by another organization but Julius Kahn's innovative contributions to the field of construction continued to have a lasting impact on the industry. He is now considered one of the pioneers in the field of reinforced concrete construction, forever changing the landscape of modern architecture and engineering."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room.

Following the British capture of Ticonderoga, it and the surrounding defenses were garrisoned by 700 British and Hessian troops under the command of Brigadier General Henry Watson Powell. Most of these forces were on Mount Independence, with only 100 each at Fort Ticonderoga and a blockhouse they were constructing on top of Mount Defiance. George Washington sent General Benjamin Lincoln into Vermont to \\"divide and distract the enemy\\". Aware that the British were housing American prisoners in the area, Lincoln decided to test the British defenses. On September 13, he sent 500 men to Skenesboro, which they found the British had abandoned, and 500 each against the defenses on either side of the lake at Ticonderoga. Colonel John Brown led the troops on the west side, with instructions to release prisoners if possible, and attack the fort if it seemed feasible. Early on September 18, Brown's troops surprised a British contingent holding some prisoners near the Lake George landing, while a detachment of his troops sneaked up Mount Defiance, and captured most of the sleeping construction crew. Brown and his men then moved down the portage trail toward the fort, surprising more troops and releasing prisoners along the way. The fort's occupants were unaware of the action until Brown's men and British troops occupying the old French lines skirmished. At this point Brown's men dragged two captured six-pound guns up to the lines, and began firing on the fort. The men who had captured Mount Defiance began firing a twelve-pounder from that site. The column that was to attack Mount Independence was delayed, and its numerous defenders were alerted to the action at the fort below before the attack on their position began. Their musket fire, as well as grapeshot fired from ships anchored nearby, intimidated the Americans sufficiently that they never launched an assault on the defensive positions on Mount Independence.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the state that saw its only historical decline in population over a twenty-year period ending in 1950? Social tensions were exacerbated by the revival of the Ku Klux Klan after 1915. The Tulsa Race Riot broke out in 1921, with whites attacking blacks. In one of the costliest episodes of racial violence in American history, sixteen hours of rioting resulted in 35 city blocks destroyed, 1.8 million in property damage, and a death toll estimated to be as high as 300 people. By the late 1920s, the Ku Klux Klan had declined to negligible influence within the state.During the 1930s, parts of the state began suffering the consequences of poor farming practice. This period was known as the Dust Bowl, throughout which areas of Kansas, Texas, New Mexico and northwestern Oklahoma were hampered by long periods of little rainfall, strong winds, and abnormally high temperatures, sending thousands of farmers into poverty and forcing them to relocate to more fertile areas of the western United States. Over a twenty-year period ending in 1950, the state saw its only historical decline in population, dropping 6.9 percent as impoverished families migrated out of the state after the Dust Bowl. Soil and water conservation projects markedly changed practices in the state and led to the construction of massive flood control systems and dams; they built hundreds of reservoirs and man-made lakes to supply water for domestic needs and agricultural irrigation. By the 1960s, Oklahoma had created more than 200 lakes, the most in the nation.In 1995, Oklahoma City was the site of one of the most destructive acts of domestic terrorism in American history. The Oklahoma City bombing of April 19, 1995, in which Timothy McVeigh detonated a large, crude explosive device outside the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building, killed 168 people, including 19 children. For his crime, McVeigh was executed by the federal government on June 11, 2001. His accomplice, Terry Nichols, is serving life in prison without parole for helping plan the attack and prepare the explosive.On May 31, 2016, several cities experienced record setting flooding.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Complete the following sentence. The man chose to take the plane instead of the bus because it would be slower if he took the","completion":"bus, as it would have to navigate through potentially congested roads, deal with multiple stops, and wait in traffic at certain times of the day, all of which could significantly lengthen the duration of the journey and consequently reduce the time he would have available to spend at his destination. Additionally, the man might have been motivated by a number of factors that made the plane the more logical and advantageous mode of transportation for his trip, such as: 1. Greater time efficiency: Generally speaking, airplanes travel at much faster speeds than buses, covering long distances in considerably shorter time frames. This advantage was likely a key factor in the man's decision, as it would enable him to reach his destination more quickly and make better use of his limited time. 2. Fewer stops: Unlike buses, airplanes typically operate on a non-stop or one-stop basis, meaning that passengers aboard the plane would not have to endure frequent pauses in the journey due to scheduled stops or unscheduled delays. This streamlined approach to travel would have been particularly appealing to the man, who likely valued a seamless and uninterrupted journey. 3. Comfort and amenities: Airplanes tend to offer a higher standard of comfort and a wider array of amenities than buses, with features such as reclining seats, in-flight entertainment systems, and food service options. These factors would have likely contributed to the man's choice to fly, as he may have felt that the enhanced comfort and facilities would make for a more enjoyable and restful trip. 4. Punctuality: Air travel tends to be more punctual than bus travel because it is less susceptible to disruptions that typically affect ground transportation, such as traffic jams, road closures, and inclement weather. Therefore, the man may have prioritized the increased likelihood of an on-time arrival that traveling by plane offers, as he might have business meetings, appointments, or other commitments at his destination that he cannot afford to miss or be late for. 5. Frequent flyer programs and loyalty benefits: The man might be a member of a frequent flyer program or enjoy special loyalty benefits through an airline, which could have made the cost of flying relatively inexpensive or even \\"free\\" in terms of reward points used. In this case, the potential cost savings and added value afforded by flying might have outweighed the alternative of traveling by bus. 6. International travel: In cases where the man's destination would be in another country, flying would be a more practical and efficient option when compared to taking a bus, as it would not only minimize the amount of time spent in transit, but also allow the man to bypass the potential complications and added time constraints that could arise from traveling by bus across international borders. In conclusion, the man chose to take the plane instead of the bus because it would be slower if he took the bus, due to factors such as lengthy transit times, multiple stops, and potential schedule disruptions that are far less likely to impact air travel. Furthermore, the man's decision to fly might have been influenced by additional considerations, including the comfort and amenities offered by airplanes, the superior punctuality of air travel, potential frequent flyer program benefits, and, in certain cases, the need to travel internationally."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The village symbol is the Briarcliff Rose, a more brightly colored offshoot of the American Beauty rose. Since 2006, the Briarcliff Rose has been used on village street signs. The Briarcliff Manor Garden Club, which also uses the Briarcliff rose as their symbol, was established in 1956. One of its primary functions is in planting, maintaining, and improving public gardens and grounds.Briarcliff Manor has groups in several Scouting organizations, including Cub Scout Pack 6 and Boy Scout Troop 18. Pack 6 became the first Cub Scout pack in the village at its establishment in 1968; by 2002 it had over 70 cubs in 12 dens. The village's first Boy Scout troop was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. Sources cite Bill Buffman as the first Scoutmaster and John Hersey as the troop's first Eagle Scout. The first Girl Scout troop in the village was founded in 1917 by Louise Miller and Mrs. Alfred Jones, and the first Brownie troop was founded in 1929.The Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire is a winter holiday event at Law Park, hosted by the village and the Briarcliff Friends of the Arts, involving live music (primarily seasonal and holiday songs), refreshments, and craft projects for children. Another annual community event is the Memorial Day parade, a tradition in Briarcliff Manor for more than fifty years. Before the parade begins, the Municipal Building's bell is rung to commemorate firefighters who have died in the previous year; the parade ends at the village's war memorial in Law Park, where wreaths are laid on the monument. The holiday has been celebrated in the village since the early 1900s, though initially involving large family picnics, with parades reserved for the Fourth of July. The answer is:","completion":"The village in question is Briarcliff Manor, located in Westchester County, New York. The first Boy Scout troop in this village was Troop 1 Briarcliff, founded before 1919. The village, known for its symbol, the Briarcliff Rose, has a rich history of community-based organizations, including the Briarcliff Manor Garden Club and Scouting organizations like Cub Scout Pack 6, Boy Scout Troop 18, and Girl Scout and Brownie troops. Community events such as the Briarcliff Manor Community Bonfire and the Memorial Day parade also contribute to the strong sense of community within the village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Passage: Hoping to rebound from their loss to the Falcons, the Browns flew to Heinz Field for a Week 6 AFC North duel with their archrival, the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Browns were forced to start third string rookie quarterback Colt McCoy as injuries sidelined Jake Delhomme and Seneca Wallace. Cleveland delivered the opening punch in the first quarter as kicker Phil Dawson made a 39-yard field goal, his 235th field goal as a Cleveland Brown which broke Lou Groza's franchise record. The Steelers would take the lead in the second quarter as quarterback Ben Roethlisberger completed a 29-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Mike Wallace. The Browns' deficit increased in the third quarter as Roethlisberger found wide receiver Hines Ward on an 8-yard touchdown pass.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: I think that what -- I think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large, that would put us into such big deficits, that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy. I think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person. Hypothesis: The tax cut plan is designed to benefit lower-income persons the most.","completion":"Based on the given paragraph, the hypothesis that the tax cut plan is designed to benefit lower-income persons the most appears to be false. This determination arises from several elements within the paragraph, which suggest that the tax cut plan disproportionately benefits the wealthiest individuals rather than those with lower incomes. Firstly, the author asserts that the tax cut plan is \\"so large\\" that it would generate significant deficits. This implies that the focus of the plan may not necessarily be geared towards benefitting the lower-income groups, as such extensive cuts may disproportionately impact various socioeconomic demographics. If the tax cut plan were aimed at exclusively or primarily helping lower-income persons, it would be expected that the cuts would be more targeted and less likely to cause substantial deficits that could indirectly hurt this population. Secondly, the author states that nearly half of the plan's benefits would be allocated to \\"the wealthiest of the wealthy.\\" This statement directly refutes the hypothesis that the tax cut plan is primarily designed to benefit lower-income individuals. If a tax plan was indeed intended to support such persons, it would not apportion such an overwhelming proportion of its benefits to the opposite end of the socioeconomic spectrum. Lastly, the author illustrates that explaining the tax cut plan in a way that makes sense to the average person would be challenging. This challenges the hypothesis that the plan was designed with lower-income individuals in mind, as it suggests that the plan's structure may not be readily understandable or relatable to a broad audience. A tax plan specifically tailored for lower-income persons would, in all likelihood, be easier to describe clearly and concisely to the average individual, without having to go through convoluted explanations that try to reconcile the plan's purported intentions with its actual effects on different income groups. In conclusion, based on the evidence in the paragraph, it is unlikely that the hypothesis is true. The tax cut plan described does not seem designed to benefit lower-income persons the most, as it creates significant deficits, allocates a large portion of benefits to the wealthiest citizens, and is difficult to explain in a comprehensible way to the average person."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.
