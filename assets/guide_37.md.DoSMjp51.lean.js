When is the right time to drink lime water, after the workout or before the workout? Is it right to take bath just after your workout? Available choices: (1). no; (2). yes; The answer is:","completion":"(1). no; The two questions are not the same, as they address different aspects of workout routines and their potential effects on the body. The first question asks whether it is better to drink lime water before or after a workout. Lime water refers to water with added lemon or lime juice, which provides benefits such as vitamin C, improved digestion, and increased hydration. To answer the question, it is generally better to consume lime water both before and after a workout. Drinking it before a workout can help to hydrate the body, increase energy levels, and provide essential nutrients that may be used during physical activities. On the other hand, consuming lime water after exercising can help replace fluids and electrolytes lost through sweating and support muscle recovery. The second question inquires whether it is appropriate to take a bath immediately after working out. This question is more about post-workout hygiene and recovery practices. Bathing right after a workout can help to cleanse the skin from sweat, dirt, and bacteria that may have accumulated during physical activity. It also helps to relax the muscles and alleviate any soreness or stiffness. However, it is essential to allow the body to cool down for a few minutes before hopping into the shower, as the heart rate and body temperature should stabilize before immersing in water. During this cooldown period, it is recommended to do some light stretching and focus on controlled breathing. In conclusion, the two questions are not the same because they address different aspects of workout routines. The first question is about proper hydration and nutrient intake, while the second question deals with post-workout hygiene and recovery practices. Each question acknowledges essential elements for maintaining optimal health during and after exercise, ensuring that the individual is both fueled and clean for daily activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Swab your ears with a cotton swab and alcohol and apply antibiotic ointment. Article:","completion":"Title: The Importance of Proper Earring Care: Keeping Your Ears Healthy and Fashionable Introduction Earrings are a beautiful and versatile accessory that can elevate any outfit. They come in various shapes, sizes, and precious materials, allowing people to express their personalities and style. However, not everyone knows how to maintain proper earring hygiene, which can lead to infections and various ear health problems. In this article, we will outline the importance of removing your earrings every night, cleaning them with rubbing alcohol, and swabbing your ears with a cotton swab before applying an antibiotic ointment. Why Take Your Earrings Out Every Night? Removing your earrings before going to bed is not only a great way to maintain your jewelry but also essential in promoting ear health. Wearing earrings continuously can cause significant strain on the earlobes, leading to swelling and discomfort. Moreover, sleeping with earrings can lead to tearing, particularly if they get caught on fabric or accidentally pulled during the night. Taking your earrings out at night also allows your earlobes time to breathe, reducing the chances of infection. Moreover, it prevents dirt and bacteria buildup, which may occur when earrings are worn for prolonged periods. How to Clean Your Earrings With Rubbing Alcohol Cleaning your earrings with rubbing alcohol is an excellent practice to prevent the transfer of bacteria from your jewelry to your skin. To clean your earrings properly, follow these simple steps: 1. Pour a small amount of rubbing alcohol into a clean, shallow dish or bowl. 2. Remove your earrings and carefully immerse them in the alcohol solution. Ensure that all parts of the earrings, including the posts, are submerged. 3. Let the earrings sit in the rubbing alcohol for at least 30 seconds. You can leave them in for a minute or two if they are significantly dirty. 4. Carefully remove the earrings from the solution and use a clean, soft cloth to dry them thoroughly. 5. Store your earrings safely in a jewelry box or container, preferably lined with soft fabric, to protect them from getting scratched or damaged. Swabbing Your Ears with a Cotton Swab and Alcohol Cleaning your ears with a cotton swab and alcohol can significantly decrease the chance of infection. It removes any accumulated dirt and bacteria around the piercing area, ensuring a clean surface for your earrings. To swab your ears properly, follow these steps: 1. Soak a clean cotton swab in rubbing alcohol and gently remove any excess liquid by pressing the swab against a bowl's edge. 2. Carefully clean the area around the earring hole by rubbing the cotton swab in a circular motion. Avoid pushing the swab too deep into your ear as it may damage the ear canal. 3. Once you have cleaned both ears, discard the cotton swab. 4. Allow your ears to air dry for a couple of minutes before replacing your earrings. The Benefits of Applying Antibiotic Ointment Applying an antibiotic ointment after cleaning your ears is an effective way to reduce the risk of infection. The ointment creates a barrier that protects the earlobe from bacteria while also providing a nurturing environment for the healing process. To apply the antibiotic ointment: 1. Squeeze out a small amount of the ointment onto a clean fingertip or cotton swab. 2. Gently apply the ointment directly onto the earring hole, spreading it evenly around the area. 3. Replace the earrings once the ointment has been absorbed into the skin. Conclusion Proper earring care is essential, particularly for freshly pierced ears or individuals with sensitive skin. By removing your earrings before bed, cleaning them and your ears with rubbing alcohol, and applying an antibiotic ointment, you can maintain both your jewelry's aesthetic appeal and your ear health. Following these simple steps will ensure you can keep rocking those gorgeous accessories without worrying about infection or discomfort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Generally, in order to file a lawsuit, a person must be over 18 years of age and in good mental health. If you are under 18, you will need a guardian to participate in the lawsuit. If you are judged to be mentally incompetent because of age, disability or illness, you will need a guardian, trustee or executor to participate in a lawsuit. The requirements for standing are established by each state. Generally, to sue in state court a person must have been injured, or will be directly injured or harmed. There must also be a way to redress or compensate for the injury. For example, if a person or entity caused you physical harm, didn't hold up their end of a contract, or didn't pay you what you were owed then you may have legal standing to sue. The court in which you file must have subject matter jurisdiction, or the legal jurisdiction to hear the type of case you are filing. Most cases will be filed in the state where you live. Federal courts hear specific types of cases, including the following: Cases that arise under federal law, such as those concerning federal civil rights statutes, patent laws, antitrust laws, federal tax claims, or constitutional issues. Cases in which the plaintiff is suing a defendant who is a citizen of a different state or country for an amount over 75,000. If you are unsure whether to file in state or federal court, or which state to file the suit in, talk to an attorney. Venue refers to the county or judicial district within a state where the lawsuit must be filed. Sometimes, multiple courts meet the venue requirements for a case. These requirements are: The court is located in the county in which the defendant resides or does business. The court is located in the county in which the harmful actions occurred. The court is located in the county in which a violated contract was signed or was to be carried out. In cases in which multiple venues are appropriate, choose the one that is most convenient to both you and the defendant, or talk with your attorney about which one they think would be best. Every state has a time period by which a person must file a lawsuit. This is referred to as the statute of limitations. Different types of case have different statute of limitations. For example, in Alabama you have two years from the date of injury to file a lawsuit for personal injury but six years to file a case regarding property damage.

A young idealistic schoolteacher named Ruth Kirke is transporting a group of war orphans from South China to Calcutta when their steamship Tollare is torpedoed and sunk in the Pacific. Along with sailor Timothy Blake, they are the only passengers to survive the enemy attack. They are picked up by the steamship Westonia and taken to San Francisco, where immigration officials inform Ruth that the orphans will be held until a 500 bond is posted for each child. With no money of their own, Ruth and Timothy go to the home of Commodore Thomas Spencer Holliday, the wealthy owner of their sunken cargo ship, who perished during the torpedo attack. When they appeal for financial assistance for the orphans, the commodore's family refuses. Desperate to help the children, Timothy tells the commodore's family that Ruth and the commodore were married aboard the Tollare before it was attacked. With the children's future at stake, Ruth reluctantly goes along with the deception. Ruth, Timothy, and the eight orphans move into the Holliday mansion, where they soon meet the commodore's grandson, Thomas Spencer Holliday III. When a sceptical Tom questions Ruth about how she became his grandmother, Ruth explains that her Christian mission was destroyed in a Japanese bombing raid, and that she was sent south with eight European children, entrusted with their safety. Along the way, they encountered a dying Chinese woman, and Ruth agreed to care for her child as well.

Please briefly summarize this news article: 'Selma' Cast Wear 'I Can't Breathe' Shirts to New York Premiere The cast and crew of Selma — a film about Martin Luther King, Jr. and the civil rights marches in Selma, Alabama — wore “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts before the New York City premiere of their film on Sunday night to protest the death of Eric Garner. Golden Globe-nominated director Ava DuVernay stood on the steps of the New York Public Library in the “Hands up, don’t shoot” pose with cast members including star David Oyelowo. The red carpet statement came one day after an estimated 25,000 people gathered in New York at the Millions March to protest the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown, unarmed black men who were both killed by white police officers this year. In video footage of Garner’s death, he repeats “I can’t breathe” while in a chokehold. At the premiere, Oyelowo drew comparisons between the Selma march and the current protests. “Thankfully, we’re seeing a lot of the same good sides of protests happening with these protests — i.e., that they are nonviolent, and that we are now seeing black and white and everything in between coming together against injustice,” he told The Hollywood Reporter. “I think that the next step for us to be able to really articulate our demands. What is it we want out of this? In Selma, it was voting rights, and now it’s police reform.” “The lesson of the movie is strategy,” added Oprah Winfrey, who both starred in and produced the film. “Strategic planning, rigorous discipline, peaceful protest, and knowing what you want.” MORE: Selma and the Dream Worker Selma actor Wendell Pierce, best known for his role on The Wire, took his protest a step further. He spent four hours at the Millions March on Saturday before walking the red carpet for the film in his “I Can’t Breathe” shirt. His Wire co-star Michael Kenneth Williams, who is currently promoting The Gambler, also donned the shirt on the red carpet. Though the Selma actors are the first celebrities to wear the “I Can’t Breathe” t-shirts on the red carpet, several sports stars including LeBron James, Kobe Bryant and Derrick Rose have worn the shirts during warmups before NBA games.

Although much of his early life is shrouded in mystery, it is known that he would eventually become one of Costa Rica's most notorious criminals. Carvajal's life took a dark turn as he delved into a string of criminal activities that culminated in first-degree murder charges. Between 1938 and 1984, he was responsible for the deaths of four victims, propelling him into infamy. His violent actions led to his arrest on August 23, 1938, marking the beginning of a long and arduous journey through the criminal justice system in Costa Rica. As a consequence of his heinous crimes, Beltrán Cortés Carvajal faced a 32-year prison sentence. Throughout his incarceration, he became a symbol of the dangers that lurked in the shadows of Costa Rican society. Despite his notorious status, many who encountered him described him as a complex individual who possessed a range of emotions and character traits. While Carvajal's criminal lifestyle remained the focal point of his later years, he was also characterized by his physical appearance. His image, captured in the photograph \\"Beltrán Cortés Carvajal.jpg,\\" showcases the hardened visage of a man whose life was marked by violence and turmoil. Ironically, it was not his criminal past that would ultimately lead to Carvajal's demise, but rather prostate cancer. He fought bravely against the disease but succumbed to its ravages on June 11, 1984, in his birth town of Santa Bárbara, Costa Rica. His death, while bringing an end to a tumultuous life, also served as a lesson to many about the profound impact that one's choices can have on their life story. In the grand narrative of Beltrán Cortés Carvajal's life, a myriad of factors converged to create the man who would be remembered by history. From the small-town beginnings in Santa Bárbara to his struggles with prostate cancer, Carvajal's story is rife with hardship, violence, and ultimately, redemption.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, the Catalan Sheepdog (Gos d'Atura Català) and the Can de Palleiro are both dog breeds that originated in Spain. However, they were bred in different regions of the country and have distinct characteristics, purposes, and histories. Here is a detailed comparison and overview of both breeds: Catalan Sheepdog (Gos d'Atura Català): The Catalan Sheepdog is a breed that originated in Catalonia, an autonomous community in northeastern Spain. This region covers a significant portion of the eastern Pyrenees Mountains and is known for its unique culture, language, and traditions that are deeply rooted in the area. The Catalan Sheepdog has been an essential part of this region for centuries, primarily used for herding sheep and other livestock. The breed is medium-sized, with a wavy or curly coat that comes in various shades of grey, sable, fawn, or black. They have an athletic build, a sturdy appearance, and are known for their agility and intelligence. The Catalan Sheepdog is prized for its strong herding instincts and excellent guarding capabilities. They are considered to be versatile working dogs that are also known for their exceptional loyalty and affection towards their families. In addition, they are friendly with children and other animals. Catalan Sheepdogs have gained recognition outside of Catalonia over time. They have been used for search and rescue, police work, and as therapy dogs due to their intelligence and trainability. However, this breed remains relatively rare outside of their native region. Can de Palleiro: The Can de Palleiro, sometimes referred to as the Galician Shepherd or Galician Barn Dog, is a dog breed originating from Galicia, a region in northwestern Spain, known for its Celtic heritage and lush landscapes. This working breed has been used primarily in agricultural settings for centuries, where they were responsible for guarding livestock and their human families, as well as performing various farm tasks. The Can de Palleiro is a medium to large-sized dog, with a distinctive rectangular body shape and a strong, muscular build. They have a medium-length, thick coat which can come in a range of colors, including red, yellow, black, and brindle. Their ears are often semi-erect, and their facial expressions showcase intelligence and alertness. Can de Palleiros are known for their loyalty, courage, and adaptability. They are highly protective of their family and territory, making them excellent guard dogs. However, they can also be affectionate and gentle with their loved ones. With proper socialization and training, they make great companions in both rural and urban environments. In conclusion, the Catalan Sheepdog and the Can de Palleiro are both dog breeds that originated in Spain, specifically in the regions of Catalonia and Galicia. Despite their differing regional origins, they share common traits such as loyalty, intelligence, and their roles as working and herding dogs. They are both valued for their protective instincts and strong bonds with their families. While they may both be bred in Spain, their distinct characteristics, purposes, and regional origins set them apart from each other."},{"prompt":"Instructions: Languages typically provide more than one grammatical construction to express certain types of messages.

Article: The retailer digitally modified, or \\"retouched\\", the body shape of a model in an issue of Healthy , its customer magazine, to conceal her true thinness. The revelation will fuel concerns about the \\"size-zero\\" culture within the magazine industry, where increasingly-slender models are being used in photo shoots. Details of the incident emerged during a round-table debate on the issue of retouching earlier this month, hosted by the model agency Leni's Model Management and attended by photographers, magazine editors and models including Jodie Kidd. During the debate, Jane Druker, the editor of Healthy magazine – which promotes \\"health and wellbeing\\" and has featured Elizabeth Hurley on its cover – admitted that Kamilla Wladyka, the model who features in the April issue, was so thin in real life that her image was radically retouched before appearing on the cover. Miss Druker told participants in the debate: \\"She was so thin, we had to put on about half a stone.\\" Gerard Chevalier, a psychotherapist and former fashion photographer who also took part in the debate, said that Miss Druker went on to tell him the image had been enhanced to make the model appear two to three stone heavier than her actual weight. He said: \\"She told me the girl was so thin, they had to put 15 to 20 kilograms on her.\\" The Sunday Telegraph has previously revealed that fashion magazines are increasingly manipulating images of skinny models to make them look fuller-figured, in order to deflect criticism of promoting unhealthily-thin images. But the use of such retouching in a health magazine will raise concerns that the magazine industry is simply ignoring the \\"size-zero\\" issue. The details provided by Miss Wladyka's modelling agency clearly state that she is a very slender size 6, with a 24-inch waist. Susan Ringwood, the chief executive of the eating disorder charity, Beat, who has campaigned for magazines to use models of diverse sizes, described the use of the images as \\"hugely disappointing\\". She said: \\"There's a fundamental difference between using camera work to make someone look polished, and changing the shape and size of someone's body in order to portray them looking differently, to conform to whatever ideal. \\"It's just not helpful and puts huge pressure on people to keep up a hyper-perfectionism that isn't real. If you can't trust the health industry to be healthy, how can you expect the fashion magazines to put their house in order?\\" Eleni Renton, the director of Leni's Model Management, said that retouching photographs to make models appear larger was \\"crazy\\". She said: \\"Rather than take a chance on a different size model who actually fits the criteria for a shoot, it's much easier for magazine editors and casting directors to book a girl who is a known quantity in the industry, even if she might be slightly too slim or large for a job, and then retouch her later. \\"But when magazines start changing body shape, it becomes unhealthy. They are not acting responsibly. That girl probably should have been sent home from the shoot – she's supposed to be representing a 'healthy' magazine as their cover girl and they retouched her to make her look healthier. It's false.\\" She also called for magazines to introduce a kite-mark system informing readers when images are modified: \\"Retouching is getting increasingly out of hand. Most people can't tell how much is being used, so they are aspiring to unattainable fantasy images. \\"Magazines should have signs indicating when an image has been retouched, so people can see at a glance how much work has been done.\\" Miss Kidd said that retouching images to correct minor imperfections was acceptable, but condemned the practice of distorting models' body shapes. She said: \\"Re-touching for little blemishes is fine, but putting weight on, taking weight off, that goes too far.\\" Miss Druker claimed that Miss Wladyka had appeared healthy during a casting for the photo shoot a week before it took place, but looked too thin to feature on the magazine's cover on the day of the shoot. She said: \\"Sometimes when you cast a model, they look OK, but then when they turn up on the shoot day, they might not have eaten for two or three days. You're not in charge of their health. \\"When she did arrive, there were plenty of clothes that we couldn't put on her because her bones stuck out too much. She looked beautiful in the face, but really thin and unwell. \\"That's not a reflection of what we do in our magazine, which is about good health and women looking healthful and well. \\"She was a stunningly beautiful girl and we knew what we were able to do with retouching. We made her legs a little bit bigger, to make her look like she was a size 10 as opposed to a size 4. \\"It's not what we normally do and I would never want to mislead people.\\" Holland & Barrett declined to comment. ||||| Skinny model airbrushed to look curvier By MSN NZ Polish model Kamilla Wladyka was digitally altered for the health magazine cover (right). A magazine has digitally altered a model to appear curvier, rather than thinner. The model's body was retouched with added weight for the cover of UK health and wellbeing magazine Healthy. Editor Jane Druker admitted that the model used  Kamilla Wladyka  was so thin in real life that she needed to be \\"radically retouched\\" before appearing on the cover. According to the UK's Daily Telegraph, the magazine added between 15kg to 20kg to the model's frame. The magazine claimed that the model had appeared healthy during a casting for the photo shoot a week before it took place, but on the day of the shoot she appeared too thin. \\"Sometimes when you cast a model, they look okay, but then when they turn up on the shoot day they might not have eaten for two or three days,\\" Miss Drucker said. \\"You're not in charge of their health. \\"When she did arrive, there were plenty of clothes that we couldn't put on her because her bones stuck out too much.

Given the question: Process: - Air enters the nose or mouth and travels through the windpipe into the lungs - The lungs have a series of smaller and finer tubes and sacs - Air reaches the smallest and finest air sacs called alveoli - Oxygen travels from the alveoli into the blood - Oxygen-rich blood is carried to the heart - Oxygen-rich blood is pumped throughout the body by the heart - Cells take in the oxygen rich blood and release carbon dioxide rich blood - The carbon dioxide rich blood travels to the lungs - Carbon dioxide travels through the throat and is exhaled. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose blood oxygen levels decrease happens, how will it affect a GREATER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation hypothesis of decreased blood oxygen levels can have a direct effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream. When there is a drop in blood oxygen levels, the body responds through various mechanisms to increase the amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. 1. Increased breathing rate: One of the initial responses to low blood oxygen levels is to increase the rate of breathing. This results in a higher volume of air entering the lungs, allowing for a greater amount of oxygen to be absorbed by the alveoli and transferred to the blood stream. 2. Increased heart rate: The heart may also increase its pumping rate to ensure that the oxygen-rich blood reaches tissues and organs more quickly, compensating for the lower concentration of oxygen in the blood. 3. Redistribution of blood flow: The body may selectively redirect blood flow to the most critical organs and tissues (e.g. brain, heart), ensuring that they receive adequate oxygenation despite the reduced blood oxygen levels. 4. Release of erythropoietin: As a long-term response to low blood oxygen levels, the kidneys may release erythropoietin, a hormone that stimulates the production of red blood cells in the bone marrow. An increase in red blood cell count results in an increased blood oxygen-carrying capacity, ensuring that more oxygen reaches the tissues and organs. 5. Enhanced oxygen binding affinity: The body may also alter the oxygen binding affinity of hemoglobin, the molecule responsible for carrying oxygen in red blood cells, allowing it to more effectively capture and release oxygen as needed. In summary, the proposed perturbation of decreased blood oxygen levels does have a direct and indirect effect on the process of oxygen delivery to the blood stream. The body will respond through various means to counteract the reduced oxygen levels and ensure that a sufficient amount of oxygen is delivered to the vital tissues and organs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Q: Context: Malcolm Earl \\"Mal\\" Waldron (August 16, 1925 December 2, 2002) was an American jazz pianist, composer, and arranger. He started playing professionally in New York in 1950, after graduating from university. In the following dozen years or so Waldron led his own bands and played for those led by Charles Mingus, Jackie McLean, John Coltrane, and Eric Dolphy, among others. During Waldron's period as house pianist for Prestige Records in the late 1950s, he appeared on dozens of albums and composed for many of them, including writing his most famous song, \\"Soul Eyes\\", for Coltrane. Waldron was often an accompanist for vocalists, and was Billie Holiday's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959., Albums of recorded music were developed in the early 20th century, first as books of individual 78rpm records, then from 1948 as vinyl LP records played at rpm. Vinyl LPs are still issued, though in the 21st century album sales have mostly focused on compact disc (CD) and MP3 formats. The audio cassette was a format used from the late 1970s through to the 1990s alongside vinyl., Jazz is a music genre that originated amongst African Americans in New Orleans, United States, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Since the 1920s jazz age, jazz has become recognized as a major form of musical expression. It emerged in the form of independent traditional and popular musical styles, all linked by the common bonds of African American and European American musical parentage with a performance orientation. Jazz is characterized by swing and blue notes, call and response vocals, polyrhythms and improvisation. Jazz has roots in West African cultural and musical expression, and in African-American music traditions including blues and ragtime, as well as European military band music. Although the foundation of jazz is deeply rooted within the Black experience of the United States, different cultures have contributed their own experience and styles to the art form as well. Intellectuals around the world have hailed jazz as \\"one of America's original art forms\\"., Polyrhythm is the simultaneous use of two or more conflicting rhythms, that are not readily perceived as deriving from one another, or as simple manifestations of the same meter. The rhythmic conflict may be the basis of an entire piece of music (cross-rhythm), or a momentary disruption. Polyrhythms can be distinguished from irrational rhythms, which can occur within the context of a single part; polyrhythms require at least two rhythms to be played concurrently, one of which is typically an irrational rhythm., The Dealers is a 1964 album by jazz musician Mal Waldron released on Status Records , catalogue 8316 ., Ragtime also spelled rag-time or rag time is a musical genre that enjoyed its peak popularity between 1895 and 1918. Its cardinal trait is its syncopated, or \\"ragged\\", rhythm. The genre has its origins in African-American communities like St. Louis years before being published as popular sheet music for piano. Ernest Hogan (18651909) was a pioneer of ragtime music and was the first to compose ragtime into sheet music. The composition was called \\"LA Pas Ma LA\\" and it was released in 1895. Hogan has also been credited for coining the term \\"ragtime\\". The term is actually derived from his hometown \\"Shake Rag\\" in Bowling Green, Kentucky. Ben Harney, who is also a Kentucky native has often been credited for introducing the music to the mainstream public. His first ragtime composition \\"You've been a good old wagon but you done broke\\" helped popularize the musical genre. The composition was published in 1895 but released in 1896. Ragtime was also a modification of the march made popular by John Philip Sousa, with additional polyrhythms coming from African music. The ragtime composer Scott Joplin (\\"ca.\\" 18681917) became famous through the publication of the \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" (1899) and a string of ragtime hits such as \\"The Entertainer\\" (1902), although he was later forgotten by all but a small, dedicated community of ragtime aficionados until the major ragtime revival in the early 1970s. For at least 12 years after its publication, \\"Maple Leaf Rag\\" heavily influenced subsequent ragtime composers with its melody lines, harmonic progressions or metric patterns., The Jazz Age was a period in the 1920s, ending with the Great Depression, in which jazz music and dance styles became popular, mainly in the United States, but also in Britain, France and elsewhere. Jazz originated in New Orleans as a fusion of African and European music and played a significant part in wider cultural changes in this period, and its influence on pop culture continued long afterwards. The Jazz Age is often referred to in conjunction with the Roaring Twenties., West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, São Tomé and Príncipe and Togo., Compact disc (CD) is a digital optical disc data storage format released in 1982 and co-developed by Philips and Sony. The format was originally developed to store and play only sound recordings but was later adapted for storage of data (CD-ROM). Several other formats were further derived from these, including write-once audio and data storage (CD-R), rewritable media (CD-RW), Video Compact Disc (VCD), Super Video Compact Disc (SVCD), Photo CD, PictureCD, CD-i, and Enhanced Music CD. Audio CD players have been commercially available since October 1982, when the first commercially available CD player was released in Japan., The LP (from \\"long playing\\" or \\"long play\\") is an analog sound storage medium, a vinyl record format characterized by a speed of rpm, a 12 or 10 inch (30 or 25 cm) diameter, and use of the \\"microgroove\\" groove specification. Introduced by Columbia in 1948, it was soon adopted as a new standard by the entire record industry. Apart from a few relatively minor refinements and the important later addition of stereophonic sound, it has remained the standard format for vinyl albums., Prestige Records was a jazz record company and label founded in 1949 by Bob Weinstock in New York City. The company recorded hundreds of albums by many of the leading jazz musicians of the day, sometimes issuing them under subsidiaries. In 1971, the company was sold to Fantasy, which was later absorbed by Concord., A book is a set of written, printed, illustrated, or blank sheets, made of paper, parchment, or other materials, fastened together to hinge at one side, with text and/or images printed in ink. A single sheet within a book is a leaf, and each side of a leaf is a page. A set of text-filled or illustrated pages produced in electronic format is known as an electronic book, or e-book. , MPEG-1 and/or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, more commonly referred to as MP3, is an audio coding format for digital audio which uses a form of lossy data compression. It is a common audio format for consumer audio streaming or storage, as well as a de facto standard of digital audio compression for the transfer and playback of music on most digital audio players and computing devices., Eleanora Fagan (April 7, 1915 July 17, 1959), professionally known as Billie Holiday, was an American jazz musician and singer-songwriter with a career spanning nearly thirty years. Nicknamed \\"Lady Day\\" by her friend and music partner Lester Young, Holiday had a seminal influence on jazz music and pop singing. Her vocal style, strongly inspired by jazz instrumentalists, pioneered a new way of manipulating phrasing and tempo. She was known for her vocal delivery and improvisational skills, which made up for her limited range and lack of formal music education. There were other jazz singers with equal talent, but Holiday had a voice that captured the attention of her audience., Subject: the dealers, Relation: record_label, Options: (A) 1982 (B) album (C) conflict (D) digital (E) digital audio (F) france (G) island (H) leaf (I) melody (J) philips (K) pop (L) prestige records (M) record (N) sony A:","completion":"L) prestige records"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. News article: Photos View photos zoom Through his entire life, Jeff Walton Jr. had no idea his father was keeping a secret. The 35-year-old learned from police earlier this month that his father, who he knew as Jeff Walton the first — a 69-year-old New Orleans Saints fan living in small-town Oklahoma — is not who his son thought him to be. The senior Walton was born Ronald Stan, a Canadian living in the former Township of East Williams, Middlesex County until September 29, 1977, when he was reported missing after a mysterious early-morning barn fire. “I’m still trying to put all the puzzle pieces together myself,” said the younger Walton reached on the phone. He and the rest of Stan’s American family, which includes Walton’s stepmom and at least three grandchildren, only found out about his Canadian past this month. Provincial police in Ontario pieced together the story of Stan in July, when they reopened the file on his disappearance as part of a routine audit of the case file. Const. Laurie Houghton with the Middlesex County OPP attributed the resolution of the case to modern investigative techniques not available in 1977. “I can’t speak to his motives,” said Houghton. “We were able to connect the dots.” Stan, who was 32 years old when he disappeared, is considered legally dead in Canada. He was declared deceased by a court in 1986, nearly a decade after his disappearance amid circumstances that still remain murky. Police responded to a fire at a barn near a piece of farmland property owned by Ronald Stan. A witness saw Stan in the area of the barn before the fire and he couldn’t be found afterwards. At least one neighbour recalls the serious blaze in 1977. Bert Toonen said his brother Peter was out with Stan the night of the fire. A young man at the time, Toonen was one of many neighbours who helped investigators search the debris. “They were my father’s pigs in that barn. We were out the next day combing through the wreckage with the police looking for human remains,” Toonen said. No human remains were found. Decades later, Toonen now owns Stan’s former property, land which changed hands several times over the years. He lives down the street from Stan’s uncle Edward Stan, who moved in down the road with his family shortly after the fire. Both Toonen and Edward say Stan left behind a wife. Edward says the couple had two children, but that he had little contact with his nephew’s family after Ronald Stan’s disappearance. The Star attempted to reach people believed to be the wife and children of Stan but was unable to verify whether they were his relatives. It’s not clear how Stan came to be declared deceased. In Ontario at that time, a family member would have had to make the request through court, but Stan’s legal status was unclear to at least one family member — his uncle Edward did not know he was legally declared dead. In fact he said he knew Stan was alive, because he saw his nephew in 1997: “We knew because he came up when his dad died. We saw him then.” Edward said he refused to talk to Stan at his father Henry’s funeral, evading the happy-go-lucky nephew he once knew. He knows nothing about Stan’s new life in the United States, except for information gathered from provincial police after they contacted him early this month with Stan’s whereabouts. In 2002 the province enacted stricter measures to make it harder to declare someone dead. Prior to the Declarations of Death Act, the court could declare a missing person dead incidentally to another sort of application, said Joshua Eisen, an associate at Toronto law firm Hull and Hull LLP, who deals with wills and estate litigation. “(A person) would have to start litigation to get their life insurance . . . or something like that,” Eisen said. “The court could say that this person is dead for the purposes of a life insurance application or maybe to distribute the money in the will. There had to be some reason for it.” Today, a spouse, next of kin or any person affected by an order declaring that an individual is dead can apply to the courts to have somebody declared dead under only two circumstances: the person has been missing for seven years or they disappeared in circumstance of peril. The consequences of declaring a person dead are very severe, Eisen said; a person declared dead loses all right to their own property. An applicant has to show nobody has heard from the missing, they’ve made reasonable inquiries into the person’s location, they have no reason to believe the missing person is alive and there has to be enough evidence to find that the person’s dead. Courts, he said, were always reluctant to grant this sort of release. “You really have to go off the map to be declared dead,” said Eisen. Jeff Walton Jr. doesn’t blame his father for what happened but is still dealing with the shock of the new information. He declined to discuss the specifics of his father’s flight or any potential motivation. Stan, now 69 years old, suffers from vascular dementia and heart disease, his son says. He was in a nursing home when the police made the connection. Stan’s American wife, Debra Proctor, filed for divorce upon hearing the news, said Walton. “It’s been tough on me, but he’s still my father. It doesn’t change the man I knew for 35 years,” said Walton. “Hopefully one day he can sit down and write a book and remember all the stuff he’s been through in his life. It’d be a damn good book I’ll tell you that, just from what I’ve heard.” The Ontario Provincial Police said there are no charges being laid and the case is now closed. ||||| CTV A 32-year-old man who went missing in 1977 following an Ontario barn fire on the property seen here has been found alive and living in Oklahoma, according to Ontario Provincial Police. A Canadian man who was declared dead after vanishing 37 years ago has been found alive and living in Oklahoma. Ontario Provincial Police say Ronald Stan, who was 32 when he went missing, was recently discovered living under the name of Jeff Walton after vanishing on Sept. 29, 1977, CTVNews reported. Stan was suspected of dying in a barn fire, southwest of Toronto, which left firefighters painstakingly digging through the smoldering remains without any sign of his body. \\"I remember that one quite well because we dug through dead pigs and so-on with our boots on, and had done our very best to find human remains,\\" retired firefighter Jim Walsh told CTVNews. \\"And there was none in that barn.\\" CTV Retired firefighter Jim Walsh, pictured right, recently recalled sifting through the remains of the burned barn for Ronald Stan's body in September 1977 without any luck. Nearly a decade later, after finding no trace of the missing man, an Ontario court declared him dead in 1986. Fast forward to last July, authorities say a routine audit of his mysterious disappearance linked Stan to a 69-year-old man living more than 1,000 miles south. That man was positively identified as Stan. Police did not identify where in Oklahoma he was found. \\"I can't speak to his motives,\\" Const. Laurie Houghton with the Middlesex County Ontario Provincial Police told The Star of Stan's possible reason for disappearing. CTV Ontario Provincial Police Middlesex County OPP Const. Laurie Houghton, pictured, said that charges are not expected to be filed against Stan, who has been living under the name of Jeff Walton. Houghton said his family has been informed of his discovery and that he is not facing criminal charges in Canada. As for how they found him this time around, she credited new technology for cracking the case. \\"There's a lot that's available to us now for investigative tools that wasn't available to us back in 1977. As a result, we were able to connect the dots, essentially, and lead us to the state of Oklahoma,\\" she told The Star. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"A man named Ronald Stan went missing in 1977 when there was a big fire in a barn in Canada.

But recently, the police found out that Ronald is actually alive and living in Oklahoma, under the name Jeff Walton.

The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Jim and Greg are brothers who both run their own farms, but they rarely see each other due to them living in different states. Greg runs a farm in Texas where he rarely sees rain so he spends much of his day watering his crops. Jim lives in Illinois where it rains much more regularly so he has more time to spend dealing with his farm animals instead of watering his plants. Both men intentionally purchased their farms next to lakes since they have always loved fishing during their free time. The brothers are currently planning a fishing trip together, but they are just debating which lake to travel to. Whose lake will have more algae? A:","completion":"Jim's lake in Illinois Step 1: Consider the rainfall in the two areas. Jim's farm in Illinois has more regular rainfall, while Greg's farm in Texas has less rainfall and requires more manual watering. Step 2: Consider the impact of rain on fertilizer. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and can create runoff that carries the fertilizer into bodies of water like ponds and lakes. Step 3: Assess the potential for algae growth. As nitrogen from the fertilizer enters bodies of water, it promotes the growth of algae. Step 4: Compare the likelihood of algae growth in the two lakes. Since Jim's farm in Illinois experiences more regular rainfall, it is more likely that the fertilizer will be carried into the lake near his farm, leading to higher levels of nitrogen in the water and increased algae growth. Based on these steps, it is more likely that Jim's lake in Illinois will have more algae compared to Greg's lake in Texas."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is full the name of the person whose records from the 1980s have been described as being influenced by Prince?

Often non - smokers avoided places which allowed smoking for both work and recreation . However in 1998 California became one of the first to pass a bill which outlawed smoking in casinos , bars , clubs and restaurants . In the last ten years , other states such as Arizona , Florida , New York and recently Oregon have followed California 's example . Why is smoking not allowed in 5 US states in eateries , drinking establishments , clubs and gambling halls starting with the western most mainland state ?","completion":"To answer the question of why smoking is not allowed in certain establishments in 5 US states starting with California, I will provide key factors underlying such decisions: 1. Health concerns: Smoking is a significant health hazard. Secondhand smoke can be harmful for both smokers and non-smokers who are exposed to it. Banning smoking in these establishments helps protect the health of the general public, including patrons and employees. 2. California as a pioneer: Being the first state to pass such a bill in 1998, California set a precedent for other states to follow. Its progressive attitude towards environmental and public health issues encouraged other states to implement similar regulations. 3. Public demand: Various surveys and studies have shown that people often prefer smoke-free environments. In response to this demand, states have enacted legislation to create more welcoming atmospheres in public establishments, benefiting both customers and businesses. 4. Workplace safety: The Occupational Safety and Health Act establishes the importance of providing a safe and healthy workplace for employees. Banning smoking in eateries, drinking establishments, clubs, and gambling halls serves to achieve this goal, as it reduces the risk for employees who would otherwise be exposed to a hazardous environment. 5. Indoor air quality: Smoking indoors produces a decline in air quality, which can lead to respiratory issues and other health concerns for occupants. Banning smoking improves the indoor air quality in such establishments, thus benefiting both employees and patrons. In conclusion, the primary reason behind the banning of smoking in 5 US states' eateries, drinking establishments, clubs, and gambling halls is to protect public health and improve the overall experience for customers and employees. California paved the way, inspiring other states like Arizona, Florida, New York, and Oregon to adopt similar measures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Glasses are very important to many people. Do you know how they were invented and developed? Glasses took a long time to develop into what you can find in the glasses store today. The Chinese first used colored glasses as fashion. They thought that those glasses had magic, but they didn't think that glasses could help eyes to see clearly. In 1262, the inventor, Roger Bacon, discovered the amazing function of lenses , and he thought that glasses could be used to help people to see. Twenty years later, in Florence, Italy, the inventor, Alessandro di Spina, made the first pair of glasses that could help people to see. Although these glasses worked, scientists didn't understand how glasses helped eyes to see. They thought that eyes sent out light onto whatever a person was looking at, and then the light came back to the eyes. Johannes Kepler finally found out how glasses worked.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: Lay out your fabric so that it is in two layers and place your unfolded jeans on top of your fabric. Smooth them out so that they are flat and even. Then, trace around the edges of the jeans leaving about ½” (1.3 cm) on all sides for seam allowance. If you want baggier overalls, then trace further away from the edges of the jeans. For example, you could trace 2” (5cm) from the edges of your jeans for baggy overalls. You might also use a baggy pair of jeans to make it easier to get a loose fit. After you finish tracing around the edges of your jeans, use a sharp pair of scissors to cut along the edges of the lines you created. Make sure to cut straight even lines in your fabric. The 2 pieces you cut out will be the legs and waistband of your overalls. Next, you will need to create the bib pieces for your overalls. To do this, measure from your waist to your chest and cross the front of your chest. Then, add 1” (2.5 cm) to each measurement for a seam allowance. Trace a rectangle with these dimensions onto your folded fabric and then cut it out from both layers. These pieces will be the front and back bib pieces for your overalls. To make the straps, measure from your chest to your shoulder blade and add 1” (2.5 cm) for a seam allowance. This will be the strap length that you need to create. You can make your straps as wide or as narrow as you like, but 2” (5 cm) to 3” (7.5 cm) is a good size. However, make sure to add 1” (2.5 cm) to your strap width as well for the seam allowance. When you have determined your strap measurements, trace these onto the folded fabric and cut along the lines to make two identical straps. If you would like to include a pocket on the front of your overalls, then you can also make a pocket piece. To make a pocket piece, draw a rectangle onto your fabric and cut it out. Make sure that the rectangle is smaller than your front bib piece, but large enough to use as a pocket. A good pocket width might be 4” (10 cm) by 6” (15 cm). Make sure to add 1” (2.5 cm) to both sides of the rectangle for the seam allowance as well. You will only need 1 piece to create the pocket, so you only need to cut out 1 rectangle.","completion":"To make a pair of overalls, follow these steps: 1. Prepare your fabric by laying it out in two layers. Place your unfolded jeans on top of the fabric, ensuring they are flat and even. 2. Trace around the jeans with a ½” (1.3 cm) seam allowance. For baggier overalls, increase this distance or use a baggy pair of jeans as your template. 3. Cut the fabric along the traced lines using sharp scissors, ensuring straight, even cuts. These two pieces will form the legs and waistband of your overalls. 4. For the bib pieces, measure from your waist to your chest and across the front of your chest. Add 1” (2.5 cm) for seam allowance to each measurement, then trace a rectangle with these dimensions onto your folded fabric. Cut the rectangles from both layers to create the front and back bib pieces. 5. To make the straps, measure from your chest to your shoulder blade and add 1” (2.5 cm) for seam allowance. Decide on your desired strap width (2” to 3” or 5 cm to 7.5 cm is suggested), and add 1” (2.5 cm) for seam allowance.

Draw a rectangle smaller than your front bib piece but large enough for a pocket (suggested size: 4” x 6” or 10 cm x 15 cm). Add 1” (2.5 cm) to both sides for seam allowance, then cut out the single pocket piece. In summary, this process involves preparing your fabric and cutting out the necessary pieces to create overalls: legs, waistband, bib sections, straps, and optional pocket. These cut-outs will be assembled in subsequent steps to form a complete pair of overalls. Keep in mind the importance of measuring and including seam allowances during the tracing and cutting process."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Sanctions against Russia boost Iran's standing before nuclear talks restart A visitor to Tehran's energy expo, which drew 1,800 firms, including 600 foreign companies, despite sanctions. Photograph: Ahmad Halabisaz/Xinhua/Corbis The Ukraine crisis has strengthened Iran's hand in its nuclear talks and other dealings with the west by reminding European countries and the Obama administration of its potential as a major alternative energy supplier if Russia cannot be relied upon, officials and analysts in Tehran say. But even as it attempts to play the Russia card, the government of President Hassan Rouhani is simultaneously stressing closer bilateral ties with Vladimir Putin's Kremlin as a means of mitigating the impact of US, EU and UN economic sanctions, imposed in the still-unresolved row over Iran's nuclear programme. \\"The western countries are imposing sanctions on Russia [after its annexation of Crimea]. Now Russia is the bad guy,\\" said Amir Mohebbian, a government adviser. \\"This has made the situation better for Iran's nuclear negotiators. Time is on our side. If we sit here long enough, it will all come to Iran.\\" It was not for Iran to say who was right or wrong in Ukraine, said Mohammad Marandi, an international relations expert at Tehran University. \\"But of course if Iran is no longer under sanctions, the Europeans would have many more choices regarding energy. At the same time, if the sanctions continue, Rouhani may move closer to Russia and China.\\" Majid Takht Ravanchi, deputy foreign minister and a member of Iran's nuclear negotiating team, said Iran would focus solely on details of a deal to lift sanctions when nuclear talks resumed in Vienna this week. But he did not deny Ukraine had placed matters in a new light. \\"Naturally Iran and Europe could have much better cooperation on the economy, trade, energy. We believe there is much room for improvement,\\" Ravanchi said. The extent to which Iran could become Europe's alternative energy supplier is borne out by statistics, and by growing western commercial interest in its energy sector. Iran is the third largest Opec oil producer after Venezuela and Saudi Arabia. It controls an estimated about 13% of the world's recoverable crude oil reserves and the world's second largest natural gas reserves. Despite sanctions that severely limit cash sales of Iranian energy, an international oil, gas, refining and petrochemicals exhibition in Tehran last week attracted 1,800 companies, among them 600 foreign companies from 32 countries including the US and Britain. China is one of Iran's biggest customers, owing an estimated 22bn (£13bn) for oil and gas supplies, which cannot be paid due to banking sanctions. Details emerged last week of plans for China to invest an equivalent sum in electricity and water projects as a way of circumventing the restrictions. Similar barter deals are now in the pipeline with Russia. Last month the Mehr news agency reported a planned 8bn-10bn energy deal in which Russia would supply electricity, generating plants and a transmission network. The US says an earlier proposal for Iran to supply 500,000 barrels of oil a day in return for Russian products would violate sanctions. Speaking last month as the Ukraine crisis intensified, Rouhani went out of his way to praise Russia. \\"Strong political ties in bilateral, regional and international domains, along with vast economic relations between the two countries, set the stage for the promotion of peace and stability,\\" he said. Rouhani's message to the west was plain: if there is no deal to end sanctions, Iran has strategic alternatives that the US, Britain and others may find unpalatable. Western analysts worry the Iran-Russia relationship may expand into the security sphere. Concern centres on the sale of Russian advanced S-300 advanced anti-missile defence systems, which would provide Iran with state-of-the-art protection in the event of a hypothetical Israeli or American attack. The sale, agreed in 2007, was blocked after Putin came under international pressure. But if Moscow's relations with the west deteriorate further, it is possible Russia's president could give it the green light. Iran insists, meanwhile, that its missile capabilities, both offensive and defensive, cannot be part of talks with the west. Despite the election victory of the more centrist Rouhani administration, Iran remains deeply at odds with the US on a range of other fronts extending beyond Russia and the nuclear talks. The supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, and other hardline clerics persist in casting the US in the role of \\"Great Satan\\" or \\"global arrogance\\". They continue to castigate Israel at every opportunity, although former president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's notorious threat to wipe it off the map is no longer repeated. Iran is also embroiled in a regional power struggle with the key US ally, Saudi Arabia, and other Sunni Muslim Gulf states. This so-called proxy war has found its sharpest expression in Syria, where the Sunni-Shia divide is most evident, but it also extends to Bahrain, Yemen and even Afghanistan, Pakistan and Iraq. A Tehran official said Iran was intent on curtailing the spread of extremist Wahhabi ideology and jihadism that flowed from Saudi Arabia's \\"wealthy mosques, teachers and banks\\". But there was also unanimous agreement on another, overriding objective: fulfilling Iran's destiny as the leading power of the Middle East, the official said. The US should not try to thwart this ambition, said Mohebbian. \\"We need a new dynamic. The US and Iran should agree not to be friends and not to be enemies. The US [and Europe] should accept Iran as it is. It will be better for them not to have Iran as an enemy. It would be expensive for them in the long run, more than they can imagine.\\"","completion":"The crisis in Ukraine has boosted Iran's position in its nuclear negotiations, reminding European countries and the US of its potential as a major alternative energy supplier if Russia becomes unreliable. As sanctions continue against Russia, Iran is looking to strengthen its ties with the Kremlin as a means to mitigate the impact of US, EU, and UN economic sanctions imposed due to Iran's nuclear program. Iran remains the third-largest OPEC oil producer and has the world's second largest natural gas reserves, making it an attractive alternative to Europe's energy needs. Iranian officials believe that as the situation with Russia unfolds, time is on Iran's side, which could lead to a more favorable outcome in nuclear negotiations and an eventual lifting of sanctions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Trump on Tuesday announced that the United States is ending its participation in the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) that lifted sanctions on Iran in exchange for Tehran limiting its nuclear program, and would re-impose U.S. economic sanctions on Iran. The agreement was negotiated by the administration of Trump’s predecessor, President Barack Obama, and involved five other world powers; Great Britain, France, Germany, China and Russia. Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton said the U.S. decision to re-impose sanctions on Iran will set a higher standard for North Korea nuclear talks by sending, “a very clear signal that the United States will not accept inadequate deals.” The U.S. policy reversal on Iran should not seriously impede diplomatic progress underway with North Korea, said Victor Cha, a noted Korea scholar with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. “In terms of how the North Koreans would take it, I don’t think they’d take it one way or the other. I don’t think they’d see it as negative or positive because they think they’re different from anybody else anyway. They think they’re a very special case,” Cha said at a CSIS conference this week. While the Iran deal limited that country’s efforts to develop a nuclear bomb, North Korea already possesses 20 to 60 nuclear warheads, according assessments by the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and the Defense Intelligence Agency, and between 40 to 100 nuclear development facilities, according a report from the RAND Corporation security research organization. But apprehension over whether future U.S. presidents would uphold a nuclear deal reached by Trump could reinforce the North Korean demand for early concessions. John Delury, a North...

Movie plot title: Cape Fear Movie plot: Sam Bowden (Nick Nolte) is a lawyer in the quiet town of New Essex, North Carolina. Max Cady (Robert De Niro) is a former client whom Bowden defended 14 years earlier when he was working as a public defender in Atlanta. Cady was tried for the violent rape and battery of a young woman. Bowden, appalled by Cady's crime, buried evidence that might have lightened Cady's sentence or even secured his acquittal. After his release from prison, Cady tracks down Bowden. He studied law in prison and assumed his own defense, unsuccessfully appealing his conviction several times. Cady hints he has learned about Bowden burying the report. Several incidents involving Cady impact the Bowden family, which consists of Bowden's wife Leigh (Jessica Lange) and their teenage daughter Danielle (Juliette Lewis). The family dog is poisoned. Cady lurks near their property. Bowden attempts to have Cady arrested, but police lieutenant Elgart (Robert Mitchum), says there is no evidence of a crime. At a bar, Cady meets Lori Davis (Illeana Douglas), a colleague of Bowden with whom she might be having a love affair. At her house, Cady cuffs her hands behind her back, breaks her arm and rapes her. Lori refuses to press charges, ashamed of what happened. Bowden hires private investigator Claude Kersek (Joe Don Baker) to follow Cady. Cady next approaches Danielle at her school by impersonating her new drama teacher and kisses her. Bowden warns him to leave his family and him alone or suffer the consequences. Cady secretly tapes the conversation with a hidden recorder. Kersek persuades Bowden to hire three men to beat Cady and intimidate him, but as Bowden watches from a hiding place, Cady turns the tide on his attackers and viciously beats them. Cady uses the recording of Bowden's threat and an exaggerated display of his own injuries to file for a restraining order against Bowden.

Write some highlights for the following article: Israel's former security chief is slamming the country's prime minister and defense minister for their handling of Iran, saying neither one inspires confidence. \\"I don't trust a leadership that relies on messianic leadership,\\" said Yuval Diskin, the former head of the Shin Bet, the country's internal security service, at a public conference Friday night in Israel. \\"Our two messiahs from Caesaria and from the Akiorv Towers are not fit to stand at the helm of the government,\\" Diskin said, referring to the respective residences of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defense Minister Ehud Barak. His comments were widely reported in the Israeli media Saturday. Barak said while he welcomed Diskin's entry into politics, the comments are irresponsible. \\"It is both embarrassing and saddening to see the weakening of judgment and responsibility and the low language a man who served the public for years was dragged into,\\" said a statement from Barak's office. \\"Diskin is acting in a petty, irresponsible manner motivated by personal frustration. He is harming the heritage of generations of Shin Bet heads and the operational norms of the organization.\\" A senior Israeli government official said that the comments lacked credibility because the domestic security focus of the Shin Bet made the organization a \\"peripheral player\\" when it comes to Iran. The same official, who declined to be named publicly due to the sensitivity of the issue, said Diskin's comments were \\"both surprising and strange\\" because he had worked under both Netanyahu and Barak, and sought to become Mossad director under their leadership. \\"Are you saying these things because you didn't get the position?\\" the official asked rhetorically, adding that Diskin's attack seemed more \\"personal than policy.\\" Diskin, a widely respected former security official, also took the two Israeli leaders to task for mis-characterizing the possible effectiveness of a military strike against Iran and its nuclear program. He said the Israeli government presented \\"a false view to the public on the Iranian bomb, as though acting against Iran would prevent a nuclear bomb. But attacking Iran will encourage them to develop a bomb all the faster.\\" It is not the first time a high-profile figure has criticized the Israeli government's handling of Iran. Meir Dagan, the former chief of Israel's spy agency, the Mossad, has been a frequent and vocal critic of talk about an Israel strike on Iran, famously calling it a \\"stupid idea.\\" Israeli vice-premier and Likud party member Silvan Shalom told the Jerusalem Post that Diskin should not have spoken in public. \\"I think that Diskin was wrong to say what he did, and that when he considers what he said he will realize that he was wrong,\\" Shalom said. Diskin's blunt commentary follows controversial remarks by Israel's top general, who said Iran is led by \\"very rational people\\" and doesn't appear poised to build a nuclear bomb that would threaten his nation. Iran \\"is going step by step to the place where it will be able to decide whether to manufacture a nuclear bomb,\\" Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. Benny Gantz told Israel's Haaretz newspaper in Wednesday editions. \\"It hasn't yet decided whether to go the extra mile.\\" Those comments were in stark contrast to those of Netanyahu, who suggested to CNN that time is running out for Western sanctions on Iran to have a meaningful effect on Tehran's nuclear program. The sanctions \\"are certainly taking a bite out of the Iranian economy,\\" Netanyahu said in an interview broadcast Tuesday on CNN's \\"Erin Burnett OutFront.\\" But, he said, \\"They haven't rolled back the Iranian program -- or even stopped it -- by one iota.\\" Highlights:","completion":"- Israel's former security chief, Yuval Diskin, criticized the country's Prime Minister and Defense Minister for their handling of Iran. - He said he doesn't have confidence in their leadership and believes attacking Iran will just encourage them to develop a nuclear bomb faster. - His comments have caused controversy, with some calling them irresponsible and questioning his motivations for speaking out."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. and a hint : Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Please answer this question : Which friend started taking statins for his disease? A:","completion":"Ben started taking statins for his high cholesterol levels. As mentioned in the situation, Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, which is likely to be a statin, after visiting the doctor. Statins are a type of drug that inhibits HMG-CoA reductase, the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, ultimately lowering blood cholesterol levels by inducing the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This helps in the stimulation of catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is essential in tackling atherosclerosis. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor due to his carelessness and is not mentioned to be taking any medication, including statins, for his high cholesterol levels. The effectiveness of statins may vary among individuals, partly due to their genetic background and the presence of different single nucleotide polymorphisms.

Write some highlights for the following article: Facebook has started to roll out a new version of its Messenger app for Android that only requires a name and a phone number, not an actual Facebook account, to sign up. Although the new Facebook Messenger app is only available in a handful of countries for now--Australia, India, Indonesia, South Africa and Venezuela--it will eventually roll out to the United States and elsewhere, allowing users to chat with their phone contacts even if they're not using Facebook. This news has set the tech world atwitter with proclamations that the new Messenger is an assault on the lowly text message (including one such proclamation from Facebook itself). It's a nice thought, at least. Given that a single text to your neighbor can cost more than a data transmission from Mars, who wouldn't relish the idea of wireless carriers getting their comeuppance? In reality, though, standard SMS has a lot going for it, and will likely weather all kinds of assaults, especially one from Facebook. For one thing, Facebook Messenger faces the same adoption hurdle as other Internet-based messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber: It requires a conscious decision not to use traditional SMS. With Facebook Messenger, you must first consider whether the recipient has Facebook installed, and is set up to receive notifications for new messages. Then, you must commit to using the Messenger app instead of your phone's built-in SMS functionality. Once you do that, the conversation is locked into Facebook unless you have one of the select Android phones that can integrate regular text messages. That's a lot to consider compared to the standard SMS, which is guaranteed to reach and alert the recipient as long as you have the right phone number. To truly threaten the text message, Facebook Messenger needs the kind of tight smartphone integration found in Apple's iMessage, which automatically replaces standard text messages between any two iPhone users. That's not really possible unless Facebook starts making its own smartphones. In lieu of tighter smartphone integration, Facebook simply has to compete with similar services that are already well-established. As Boy Genius Report points out, competitor WhatsApp is already a Top 5 messaging app in 141 countries and handles 10 billion messages per day. (Compare that to 7.8 trillion regular text messages sent in 2011, according to Portio Research, for an average of 21 billion messages per day.) Competition is good, but in this case it means users will be fragmented across multiple services that can't talk to one another. Ideally, these competing services would somehow find a way to work with each other, so a Facebook user could send a message to someone who uses Whatsapp or Viber. It sounds crazy, but considering that wireless carriers found a way to make it work with SMS, tech companies should be able to figure out a solution. I acknowledge that the need for SMS alternatives is more desperate outside the United States, where the price per message can be cost-prohibitive. But in the land of all-you-can-eat messaging, if you really need to reach someone, SMS remains the most reliable option, and Facebook Messenger only poses a minor threat. &copy 2012 TIME, Inc.

Some speculate that Facebook's new Messenger could threaten traditional text messaging; however, it faces multiple obstacles, such as adoption hurdles and competition from well-established messaging apps like WhatsApp and Viber. 4. To truly pose a threat to text messaging, Facebook Messenger would need tighter smartphone integration similar to Apple's iMessage, which is currently not possible unless Facebook produces its own smartphones. 5.

There were a lot of truly great horror movies produced in the seventies - but this film certainly isn't one of them! It's a shame The Child isn't better as it works from a decent idea that takes in a couple of sometimes successful horror themes. We have the idea of a vengeful child, which worked so well in classic films such as The Bad Seed and then we have the central zombie theme, which of course has been the backbone of many a successful horror movie. The plot is basically this: young girl blames a load of people for the death of her mother, so she goes to the graveyard and raises the dead to get revenge (as you do). This is all well and good, except for the fact that it's boring! Nothing happens for most of the film, and although it does pick up at the end with some nice gore; it's not enough of a finale to justify sitting through the rest of it. The film was obviously shot on a budget as the locations look cheap and all the actors are rubbish. There's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it. The Child is a dismal seventies horror flick and I certainly don't recommend it. Did this review think positively or negatively of the movie (see options below)? Available choices: (i). negative. (ii). positive....I think the answer is","completion":"(i). negative. The review is clearly negative about the movie, \\"The Child\\". The reviewer mentions a number of criticisms such as the movie being boring, the plot is not engaging, the locations appearing cheap, and the acting being subpar. The reviewer also says, \\"there's really not much I can say about the film overall as there isn't much to it,\\" indicating a lack of substance or memorable moments in the movie. Finally, they explicitly recommend against watching this movie. All these elements justify the choice as negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Highlights:","completion":"- The April 28, 2014 edition of CNN Student News covered headlines from South Korea, Vatican City, and Ukraine. The financial literacy series concluded with a discussion on college savings plans, and the show also examined the science behind tornadoes as storm season began in the U.S. - In the wake of the tragic South Korean ferry sinking, the prime minister of South Korea resigned, citing remorse for the government's handling of the crisis. - History was made in the Roman Catholic Church with the canonization of two popes, as Pope Francis declared both John XXIII and John Paul II as saints, describing them as \\"men of courage.\\" - Ukraine seemed to brace for war, with the prime minister blaming Russia's recent actions for the escalating tensions. Meanwhile, the U.S. president expressed concern about the situation and called for international support. Russian leaders accused the West of orchestrating the crisis. - \\"Tornado Alley,\\" an area located in the central U.S., is particularly prone to tornado activity due to a combination of factors such as warm, moist air from the Gulf of Mexico and cool, dry air from the Rocky Mountains. Tornado activity in March 2014 was lower than average, possibly due to a long-lasting cold-air system. - A 529 Savings Plan is designed to help families save for college, offering tax advantages over traditional savings accounts. The show encouraged students to research and discuss with families and advisers about college cost options and resources."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Solve this instance: Medicinal plants have been used worldwide for centuries to maintain health and to treat diseases, more so chronic diseases. However, adulteration and use of spurious materials as substitutes have become a major concern for users and industry for reasons of safety and efficacy. Therefore, authentication of medicinal plants is of utmost importance. Morphological, anatomical, chemical and DNA markers solve the problem by differentiating the genuine material from the adulterants, substitutes and spurious drugs. DNA markers use nucleotide sequences to identify species; it takes preference over the other two markers being not age dependent, tissue specific and having a higher discriminating power. Therefore, characterization of plants with such markers is an ideal approach for identification of medicinal plant species and populations/varieties of the same species. Availability of certified taxonomic specimens in herbaria is certainly required for unambiguous confirmation through final visual comparison and analysis.

Solve this math problem Solve -55*n + 3912 = 33*n + 4352 for n.","completion":"Alright, let's solve this math problem step by step like we're talking to a five-year-old. We start with -55*n + 3912 = 33*n + 4352. 1. First, we want to put all the n's together on one side and the regular numbers on the other side. So, let's move 33*n to the other side to join -55*n. We do this by subtracting 33*n on both sides. -55*n - 33*n + 3912 = 4352 2. Now we have -55*n - 33*n, let's combine them! -55 - 33 is -88, so our expression becomes: -88*n + 3912 = 4352 3. Next, we want to isolate n, so let's move the 3912 to the other side by subtracting it from both sides. -88*n = 4352 - 3912 4. Now, let's find the difference! 4352 - 3912 is equal to 440. So, now we have: -88*n = 440 5. To find the value of n, we need to get rid of the -88. So, we'll divide both sides by -88 because that's the opposite of multiplying. n = 440 / -88 6. And finally, when we divide 440 by -88, we get -5. So: n = -5 And there you have it! We've solved the math problem, and the answer is n = -5."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A detailed answer could be: The unit for voltage is the volt (V), which is a derived unit in the International System of Units (SI). Specifically, voltage is the potential difference between two points in an electrical circuit, and it represents the amount of energy required to move a unit charge from one point to another. In terms of base units, 1 volt can be expressed as 1 joule (J) of energy per coulomb (C) of charge, or 1 V = 1 J/C. The volt is named in honor of the Italian physicist Alessandro Volta (1745–1827), who invented the voltaic pile, possibly the first chemical battery.

Assuming that: The gravitational force between two objects decreases as the objects move further apart. A:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the user's question. The user wants to know whether the gravitational force between two objects held by Milo increases or decreases when they are moved closer together. Step 2: Recall the principle governing the gravitational force. According to the law of universal gravitation, the force of gravity between two objects is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. Step 3: Apply the principle to the scenario. In this scenario, Milo moves the two objects closer together, which means the distance between their centers is decreasing. Step 4: Determine the effect of decreasing the distance on the gravitational force. Since the gravitational force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the objects, when the distance decreases, the gravitational force between the objects will increase.

What are the most important words in the following sentence: the burning candle on which to melt wax","completion":"In the sentence \\"the burning candle on which to melt wax,\\" the most important words are \\"burning,\\" \\"candle,\\" \\"melt,\\" and \\"wax.\\" These words are crucial in understanding the meaning and focus of the sentence, as they describe the central subject (\\"candle\\") and its condition (\\"burning\\"), as well as the purpose for which it is being used (\\"melt wax\\"). In addition, these words carry the primary information that someone looking to understand the purpose of the burning candle needs to grasp. 1. \\"Burning\\": This word is important because it indicates the state of the candle - that it is currently lit and producing heat and light. This word helps distinguish the candle from a non-burning or unlit candle, which would not serve the same purpose or have the same effects. 2. \\"Candle\\": The central subject of the sentence, \\"candle\\" identifies the object being described. As a familiar, commonplace object, the reader should immediately understand the candle's basic properties, such as its shape, composition (usually a wax core with a wick), and its function to produce light and heat when lit. Without the mention of \\"candle,\\" the sentence would be vague, and it would be unclear what is meant by \\"burning\\" and \\"melt wax.\\" 3. \\"Melt\\": This word describes the action that the burning candle is intended to perform. It indicates that the candle's purpose in this context is to change the state of some wax, typically by generating heat to liquefy it. \\"Melt\\" helps to clarify the function of the burning candle in this specific situation, providing context for its use. 4. \\"Wax\\": \\"Wax\\" represents the material that the burning candle is expected to affect. Most candles are made of wax, but in this sentence, it's essential to understand that there is additional wax meant to be melted by the burning candle. The combination of \\"melt\\" and \\"wax\\" emphasizes the purpose of the described scenario - to use the candle's heat to transform the wax from a solid to a liquid state. Each of these words serves a critical function in conveying the core message of the sentence. Together, the words \\"burning,\\" \\"candle,\\" \\"melt,\\" and \\"wax\\" fully express the idea of a candle actively being used to heat and melt a separate portion of wax."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Andrew Ross, 48, died after suffering severe brain damage during an operation to remove excess skin. An obese man died after suffering severe brain damage when he was put to sleep for surgery to remove excess skin, the result of a gastric band operation. Andrew Ross' weight dropped from 41 to 26 stone after the surgery in 2008, an inquest heard. The 48-year-old former fork-lift truck driver from Wythenshawe, who weighed 26 stone, was admitted to the private Spire Manchester Hospital for treatment to remove excess skin from his abdomen. It followed a gastric bypass operation carried out in 2008. At that point, he weighed around 41 stone and had a body mass index of 67, three times what it should have been. But the inquest heard ‘complications’ quickly arose after he was anaesthetised for the apronectomy procedure and he went into cardiac arrest for around 10 minutes. Mr Ross, who had four children and three step-children, was revived but suffered brain damage, his ex-wife Christine Blay told the hearing. He was taken to the cardiac intensive care unit at Wythenshawe Hospital then transferred to the specialist Dermot Murphy care home in Withington, where he had 24-hour care. He died in hospital on August 10 after developing bronchial pneumonia. The inquest heard Mr Ross had a very large heart due to his obesity and high blood pressure. Mrs Blay, 49, his wife for 11 years, said his weight rose after he stopped working following a fall. He also suffered asthma and diabetes. Coroner Nigel Meadows was told that the surgery was approved and he went for a pre-operative anaesthesia assessment a week before, where he was classed as high risk. Mrs Blay said that after he was admitted she was told that the operation hadn’t gone ahead and he was in a critical condition after a ‘cardiac event’. The inquest heard Mr Ross’s heart stopped during an attempt to intubate him, or insert a tube down his throat. The operation in March 2011 followed gastric band surgery in 2008, after which Mr Ross' weight fell from 41 to 26 stone, an inquest at Manchester Coroners' Court heard. Pictured is the private Spire Hospital in Manchester. Anaesthetist Dr Deborah Nolan said there was a high risk of complication because he was morbidly obese. It was a ‘difficult intubation’ after relaxant and anaesthetic drugs were given before his oxygen levels dropped, the inquest heard. He was immediately given oxygen but his heart rate dropped, Dr Nolan said. She said she had given him sufficient amounts of anaesthetics and had reacted in a ‘appropriate and timely’ way. The inquest continues.","completion":"A man named Andrew Ross, who used to weigh a lot, had surgery to help him lose weight. After the surgery, he needed another operation to remove some extra skin.

Q:Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A small ,white envelope stuck among the branches of our Christmas tree and it has been there for the past ten years or so. It all began because my husband Justin hated Christmas--oh, not the true meaning of Christmas.Overspending was one thing, but compared to the difficult experience of choosing gifts--running around at the last minute to get a tie for Uncle Harry and a pair of gloves for Grandma...,spending money is nothing. I felt too tired to think of any special gifts. Knowing Justin felt the same way, I decided one year not to buy the usual shirts, sweaters, ties and so on. I reached for something special just for Justin. The inspiration came in an unusual way. Our son Kevin, who was 12 that year, was wrestling at the junior level at the school he attended; and shortly before Christmas, there was a match against a team sponsored by an inner-city church.These youngsters, dressed in such worn-out shoes that shoe strings seemed to be the only thing holding them together, while our boys were in their blue and gold uniforms and new wrestling shoes. As the match began, I was shocked to see that the other team were wrestling without wearing helmets to protect their ears. Well, our boys ended up defeating them. We took every weight class. Justin, seated beside me, shook his head sadly, \\"I wish just one of them could have won,\\" he said. \\"They have a lot potential , but losing like this could take the heart out of them.\\" Justin loved kids--all kids, and he knew them, having coached little league football and baseball. That's when the idea for his present came. That afternoon, I went to a local sporting goods store and bought different kinds of wrestling helmets and shoes. I sent them to inner-city church without leaving my name. On Christmas Eve, I placed the envelope on the tree, the note inside telling Justin what I had done and that was his gift from me. His smile was the brightest thing about Christmas that year and since then the envelope has become the highlight of our Christmas. Options: A The Church Gift B A Special Note C The White Envelope D A Christmas Card Answer: C The White Envelope Question: A:","completion":"\\"What did the wife decide to give her husband, Justin, as a special Christmas gift to represent their shared sentiments and evoke a positive change?\\" A) A donation to the Church as a gift.

They both decided to join the Girl Scouts, which is a group where girls learn new skills, make new friends, and do fun activities. One of the things Girl Scouts do is selling cookies to raise money for their group. Now, Rebecca joined the Girl Scouts before Laura, which means she became a part of the group earlier than her friend. So, we can choose the option where the story goes like this: [1] Rebecca has more experience selling yummy but overpriced cookies. Since Rebecca joined the Girl Scouts first, she had a chance to sell cookies for a longer time. Laura, on the other hand, is still new to the group and figuring out how to sell the cookies in the best possible way. Even though their cookies are a little expensive, people love buying them because they taste really good and they help the Girl Scouts do more fun activities and learn new things. Plus, it feels good to help out by buying a box of cookies! Rebecca, being a good friend, decided to share her cookie-selling secrets with Laura, like the best spots in town to set up a cookie stand and how to talk to people about the delicious cookies they have to offer.

I felt so upset at that moment, but I could say nothing to my parents. I decided to help my father with his work to support my family instead of continuing my schooling. To my surprise, things completely changed just three days before the beginning of the new term. My head teacher who had taught me three years came to my family with some money, which had been raised by my schoolmates.

Given the question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What was the name of the album Nirvana was intent on releasing as it was? After the recording sessions were completed, Nirvana sent unmastered tapes of the album to several individuals, including the president of DGC's parent company Geffen Records Ed Rosenblatt and the group's management company Gold Mountain. When asked about the feedback he received, Cobain told Michael Azerrad, \\"The grown-ups don't like it.\\" He said he was told his songwriting was \\"not up to par\\", the sound was \\"unlistenable\\", and that there was uncertainty that mainstream radio would welcome the sound of Albini's production. There were few people at Geffen or Gold Mountain who wanted the band to record with Albini to begin with, and Cobain felt he was receiving an unstated message to scrap the sessions and start all over again. Cobain was upset and said to Azerrad, \\"I should just re-record this record and do the same thing we did last year because we sold out last year—there's no reason to try and redeem ourselves as artists at this point. I can't help myself—I'm just putting out a record I would like to listen to at home.\\" However, a number of the group's friends liked the album, and by April 1993, Nirvana was intent on releasing In Utero as it was. According to Cobain, \\"Of course, they want another Nevermind, but I'd rather die than do that. This is exactly the kind of record I would buy as a fan, that I would enjoy owning.\\"The band members began to have doubts about the record's sound. During this time, Cobain admitted, \\"The first time I played it at home, I knew there was something wrong. The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. I got no emotion from it, I was just numb.\\" The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. The producer declined; as he recalled, \\"[Cobain] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.'

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Choose a long, heavy overcoat for cold weather and bundle up. The primary purpose of an overcoat is to act as a warm outer layer. For this end, materials like wool, cashmere, and fleece will work best. Look for thick fabrics, strong seams and additional features like belts, buttons and high collars you can use to envelope yourself when it gets brisk. Overcoats pair well with hats, gloves, scarves and other formal cold weather gear. Nicer types like Chesterfields and Polos are ideal for wearing over a suit, which can be difficult to layer effectively in the winter. Another function of overcoats is to create a barrier between you and the outside world. They provide enough coverage to cut down on wind chill, are sturdy enough to protect you from moisture and everyday contact, and act as a membrane to keep your formal items from getting dirty. An overcoat can lend you peace of mind knowing that you and your clothing will remain protected and pristine beneath it. If you think your lifestyle might be rough on an overcoat, try out materials like cotton twill, waxed canvas or even leather. These tough fabrics are resistant to wear and tear and are generally easy to clean. Safeguard leather overcoats with a protective coating of oil to make them water-resistant. Go for an overcoat over a fleece jacket or windbreaker the next time you need to make a good impression. Overcoats are one kind of formal garment that never goes out of style. You’ll look much more suave wearing a well-fitted, sensible overcoat than you would in plain outerwear, or caught unprepared for chilly weather in only a suit. Black, charcoal gray and navy blue should be your go-to color choices for formal dress. An overcoat can and should be worn in place of inappropriately casual jackets whenever possible. While overcoats have become a less prevalent fashion choice in contemporary times, they are still regarded as the peak of men’s business and formal style. You’ll stand out from the crowd and be taken seriously as a man of refinement once you add a nice overcoat to your coat rack. It’s a good way to inject some classic style into your wardrobe, and you’re sure to turn heads when you walk past a crowd of people all wearing the same thing. Go for modern styles and materials and an accentuated fit. Overcoats are marked by a somewhat vintage aesthetic and can look like a novelty if they’re not chosen carefully. Summary:","completion":"Choose a heavy, stylish overcoat made from materials like wool, cashmere, or fleece for cold weather protection and to make a strong impression in formal settings, featuring strong seams, extra features like belts and high collars for added warmth, pairing well with other cold weather gear, and prioritizing modern styles and materials for a refined, timeless look."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to the reviewer, the employees at this particular establishment are \\"a bunch of idiots and rude people.\\" Such a description implies that the staff may be lacking the level of professionalism and courtesy expected from a restaurant.

He had also thought about naming his cat Sir Purrsalot. Bret himself planned to become a knight when he grew up (or maybe a cowboy) and thought Sir Purrsalot sounded like a good name for his brother knight. The difficulty there was that Wolfie didn't purr a lot. He purred when he was being fed or petted, but no one could say he purred a lot. Plus Bret's mother said knights liked to poke things with their swords and they also liked to hog the bathroom and they clanked. So Bret was left with a cat named Wolfgang.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: While each person will experience different effects from a stroke, hemiparesis (or weakness) of the whole side or just the arm or leg is a common result of a stroke. In addition, problems with balance and coordination are common, too. Thus, adjustments may need to be made to ensure that your loved one (who may now have mobility difficulties) can easily access her house. When attempting to make your house stroke-survivor-friendly, consider the following suggestions: Move the person’s bed to the ground floor so that she can avoid having to use the stairs, where falls are more likely to occur. Clear a path to all essential rooms (including bedroom, bathroom, and kitchen). Less clutter will mean that your loved one is less likely to fall. This includes removing area rugs. Install a seat in the shower to allow her to sit while bathing. Additionally, install handrails to assist with getting in and out of the tub and/or shower as well as by toilet to help her get up and down if needed. Make a bedpan readily available at her bedside. Encourage use of this commode, especially if the person feels off-balance or disoriented as this can avoid falls which could further injure the patient. If stairs cannot be avoided, install handrails around the stairs to assist your loved one move up and down. The person's physical therapist should be working with the person to re-learn how to navigate her environment, including going up and down stairs. A new deficiency in mobility is one of the most common issues faced by stroke survivors. A person who was once very mobile and independent may be reduced to slow, unsteady walking or even be largely bed-bound after a stroke. Expect your loved one to require some assistance moving around for at least a period of time after a stroke. Assistive devices can be used to better facilitate mobility. Family members can consult a physical therapist in order to find out which assistive devices would best suit the stroke survivor. These devices could include a wheelchair, walker, or cane depending on the severity of mobility issues. Support and encourage your loved one in his attempts to be mobile. Celebrate any reduction in dependence on assistive devices. Falls and accidents after a stroke are, unfortunately, very common. Make your loved one’s safety a priority to avoid any unnecessary side effects or complications that are related to, but not a direct result of, her stroke. Put up rails around the stroke survivor’s bed and lower the level of the bed as necessary. The rails should be up at night to prevent any falls due to imbalance or disorientation, and the bed can be lowered to avoid the need to “climb” into bed. If something that is frequently used (for example, pots and pans) are located somewhere that is hard to access (like in a high cabinet), move them. Make commonly used items in locations that are easy for your loved one to access. Be present to assist with tree trimming, snow shoveling, house painting, or any other activities that put your loved one at an increased risk for an accident after her stroke. Dysphagia is the medical term that means a person is experiencing difficulty swallowing. After a stroke, eating or drinking can become difficult because the muscles of chewing and swallowing can be weakened (this is particularly true immediately after a stroke). Thus, it is important to help your loved one adapt to new habits of eating and drinking to ensure he is getting adequate nutrition. After a stroke, it is common to have a nasogastric feeding tube in the early stages; however, in especially severe cases, a feeding tube will be a permanent requirement in order for the stroke survivor to receive the necessary nutrients. If the stroke survivor is feeding through percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube — a tube used for feeding that is inserted directly in the stomach- make sure that the tube is intact, functioning properly, and protected from infection and from pulling by the patient. Your loved one will need to undergo a test called a swallowing study, which will allow his doctor to assess his ability to swallow food. Speech therapy and x-rays are used to help the doctor determine when it is safe for the patient to move from liquids to thick, soft foods. When your loved one is able to eat without assistance of a medical device, feed him thick, soft food. Stroke survivors who are starting to feed orally must start with this type of food to prevent aspiration pneumonia. There are liquid thickeners in the market that can help make soup and juice thicker. You can also use items in your kitchen like gelatin, cornmeal, and oats. Keep your loved one upright while eating in order to prevent aspiration pneumonia, which occurs when food is inhaled into the lungs. Because his muscles involved with swallowing are weak, his position for eating is even more important. This will ensure mealtimes are safe and remain a fun part of the day. A stroke may change the control your loved one has over her bladder and bowels. This can create safety problems (for example, infections or sores) and can also be a sore subject or one that causes great embarrassment. As a caretaker, it is important to recognize if these issues are occurring and address them with your loved one in order to help her on the road to recovery. For stroke survivors that are unable to use a commode or go to the bathroom, adult diapers may be used. These can be found in almost any drug store or grocery store. Encourage your loved one to wear one if necessary until she regains control of her bodily functions. You will need to assist your loved one by making sure the diaper is changed immediately after each time she voids or has a bowel movement. Otherwise she may experience skin breakdown and sores and potential infection in the area. Most stroke survivors have certain levels of communication impairment, at least temporarily. The severity of the stroke may determine how severe the communication impairment is. Some stroke patients might not be able to express themselves correctly, while others might not be able to understand what is being said. Due to paralysis, some stroke survivors might not be able to say words properly, though the cognitive aspect of their communication is functioning. It is important to help your loved one deal with communication issues. Before considering speech impairment, make sure that the stroke survivor does not have any hearing difficulty. This can also be a cause of communication difficulty and often can be corrected with the use of a hearing aid. Learn about the different types of communication issues. For example, recognize if your loved one is suffering from aphasia (where the individual can think clearly, but has trouble getting her messages in and out) or apraxia (where the individual has difficulty putting speech sounds together in the correct way). Use short words and nonverbal communication such as hand gestures, nodding or shaking, pointing, or even showing objects. The patient should not be asked too many questions at once and should be given ample time to respond to any communication. Accept any form of communication as valid. Visual aids can be used for communication — this includes charts, alphabet boards, electronic media, objects and pictures. This can help your loved one overcome the frustration associated with not being able to communicate effectively. Establishing a daily routine can make impairments such as communication less frustrating. If the stroke survivor knows the routine for the day, he anticipates the activities and the family anticipates his needs. This can relieve stress for both the patient and those caring for him. Strokes can have emotional as well as physical effects. First, strokes can result in personality changes that can negatively affect relationships. Second, strokes can result in post-stroke mood disorders, including depression, anxiety, and pseudo-bulbar affect (PBA). As a caregiver, it is important to be vigilant and take notice of any emotional changes in your loved one. Depression strikes between one- and two-thirds of stroke survivors, while PBA affects approximately one-quarter to one-half of survivors. Get treatment for your loved one if necessary. Medication and counseling have benefitted many stroke survivors and is often covered by insurance.","completion":"This article gives suggestions on how to make a home safer and more comfortable for a person who had a stroke, as they may have difficulty moving, talking, eating, or controlling their emotions, and might need help with daily activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Exam Movie plot: Eight candidates for a top job at a mysterious company are gathered in a windowless room with two rows of desks. They have passed previous requirements not mentioned in the film. They each choose a seat and upon each desk is a piece of paper which identifies them as, \\"Candidate 1\\", \\"Candidate 2\\", etc. The invigilator, (Colin Salmon), arrives and sets forth the rules for the test.Inside the room there will be no laws other than what the company permits, as such. The candidates cannot try to communicate with the invigilator himself nor the guard. They cannot spoil the paper and they cannot leave the room for any reason. If they break any of the rules, they will be disqualified. The test consists of answering one question. The invigilator asks the candidates whether they have any questions. He sets the clock at 80 minutes and leaves the room.Once alone, the candidates turn their paper over and find nothing is written on the back. They look at each other in confusion, and the candidate \\"Oriental\\" (Gemma Chan) starts writing \\"I believe I deserve...\\" The guard (Chris Carey) puts her out because she has written on her paper, spoiling it.A young white man, (Luke Mably) starts talking, stands up and convinces everyone to work together until they find what the question is.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to what is the name of china's currency??","completion":"Yes, of course! The official currency of the People's Republic of China is called the Chinese Yuan (CNY). The term \\"Yuan\\" (元) translates to \\"round object\\" or \\"round coin\\" in English, which signifies the tradition of using coinage in China. Apart from Yuan, you may hear people using the term \\"Renminbi\\" (RMB), which means \\"people's currency.\\" Please note that while both these terms refer to the same currency, Renminbi is the official name of the currency, and Yuan stands for the unit in which Renminbi is denominated. The Chinese financial system operates under a decimal currency structure, with each Yuan being further divided into smaller units called Jiao (角) and Fen (分). 1 Yuan equals 10 Jiao, and one Jiao contains 10 Fen. Hence, one Yuan is equal to 100 Fen. It is similar to how the US dollar is divided into 100 cents. The Bank of China, which is the country's central bank, is responsible for handling all matters related to monetary policy, including the regulation, circulation, and maintenance of the value of the Chinese Yuan. The currency is available in both banknotes and coins in various denominations. Banknotes come in denominations of 1, 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100 Yuan, as well as in 1, 2, and 5 Jiao. The banknotes often feature the portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong, the founding father of the People's Republic of China, on the obverse side. The reverse sides often depict various Chinese landscapes and cultural symbols. Coins, on the other hand, are available in denominations of 1 Yuan, 1, 2, and 5 Jiao, and 1, 2, and 5 Fen. The coins are typically designed with a flower pattern on one side, while the denomination and the national emblem are on the opposite side. It's important to be aware that the Chinese Yuan operates under a managed floating exchange rate system. This means that the exchange rate is determined by market forces with some influence from the government through the central bank. Due to this mechanism, the value of the Yuan may fluctuate against other currencies, such as the US Dollar, the Euro, or the Japanese Yen. As a traveler or someone interested in doing business with China, understanding the value and conversion rates of the Chinese Yuan may prove to be helpful during financial transactions. To find the current conversion rates, you can consult reliable sources like financial newspapers, websites, or mobile applications that provide up-to-date exchange rates."},{"prompt":"How long ago was it…?

Article: Climbers at the top of Mount Everest, the world's highest peak, will now be able to make video calls and surf the Internet on their mobile phones, a Nepalese telecom group claims. Ncell, a branch company of Swedish phone giant TeliaSonera, said on Thursday it had set up a high-speed third-generation (3G) phone base station at an altitude of 5,200 metres in the Everest region. \\"Today we made the world's highest video call from Mount Everest base camp successfully. The coverage of the network will reach up to the peak of Mount Everest,\\" Ncell Nepal chief Pasi Koistinen told reporters in Kathmandu. The installation will also help tens of thousands of tourists and hikers who visit the world's highest mountain every year. Climbers who reached its 8,848-metre peak previously depended on expensive satellite phones and a voice-only network set up by China Mobile in 2007 on the Chinese side of the mountain. \\"This is a great milestone for mobile communications as the 3G high speed Internet will bring faster, more affordable telecommunication services from the world's tallest mountain,\\" said Lars Nyberg, chief executive of TeliaSonera, which owns 80 percent of Ncell. The 3G services will be fast enough to make video calls and use the Internet, said the company, which also claimed the world's lowest 3G base at 1,400 metres below sea level in a mine in Europe. Despite the installation in Mount Everest, telecom services cover less than one-third of the 28 million people of Nepal, one of the poorest countries in the world. TeliaSonera said it planned to invest 100 million in the next year to ensure that mobile coverage increases to more than 90 per cent of the Himalayan nation's population. The 3G network on Mount Everest puts TeliaSonera ahead of state-controlled Nepal Telecom, Indian-owned United Telecom and China Mobile. Around 3,000 people have climbed to the Everest summit since Edmund Hillary and Tenzing Norgay became the first people to conquer the peak in 1953.

In this context, the correct answer to the question is Li Guang (砺光), a famous Chinese general and prominent military commander of the Western Han dynasty. Li Guang, also known as the \\"Flying General,\\" was known for his expertise in archery and his exceptional battlefield tactics. He was born in 236 BC and died in 106 BC. Over his long military career, Li Guang participated in several campaigns against the Xiongnu, a tribal confederation of nomadic people who inhabited the eastern Eurasian Steppe and posed a constant threat to the Chinese empire. Throughout his campaigns, Li Guang faced many difficulties and suffered numerous losses. Unfortunately, after a failed campaign in 106 BC, Li Guang's troops suffered from hunger and, in a desperate bid, he ordered his troops to eat their horses to survive. The campaign's failure led Li Guang to lose his command, and he was eventually court-martialed. Unable to cope with the dishonor and his subsequent demotion, Li Guang took his own life in 106 BC. In conclusion, the given statement does not include any information related to Li Guang or his death, and therefore, it does not answer the question about which Han commander died in 106 BC. Instead, we must look beyond the given statement to find that Li Guang was the Han commander who died in 106 BC."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tax authorities say Ai's design firm, Beijing Fake Cultural Development, owes £1.5m in back taxes and fines. Ai disputes this and says he does not own the company involved.

Scott Fitzgerald's classic 1925 novel, The Great Gatsby, grew up in Louisville, Kentucky in a wealthy and privileged family. Daisy's upbringing, like that of many wealthy young women of the early 20th century America, took place in a society that was characterized by its traditional values, social hierarchy, and emphasis on wealth and status. It is within this cultural context that Daisy's character was shaped. Daisy's Louisville was an affluent city in the southern United States during the early 1900s. It was known for its opulent mansions, lavish parties, and distinguished families. Consequently, Daisy's upbringing was likely imbued with a strong sense of tradition, high society, and social graces. This environment cultivated her desire for wealth and social standing, which eventually played a significant role in her life choices. As a member of the privileged class, Daisy lived a relatively sheltered life that revolved around attending boarding schools, social events, and engaging in leisure activities typical for girls from her milieu. Such pursuits might have included horseback riding, playing tennis or golf, and participating in charity events. These activities reinforced her role in high society, where women were expected to be beautiful, ornamental, and dependent on the men in their lives. Daisy's character is often described as charming, vivacious, and somewhat careless. These traits, combined with her upbringing, contributed to her ultimately marrying Tom Buchanan, an immensely wealthy man from an equally illustrious background. This union ties Daisy's fate to the privileged life she has always known. However, Daisy's feelings of emptiness and disillusionment with her insubstantial existence become evident as the story unfolds, especially concerning her love affair with Jay Gatsby. Daisy's turbulent emotions, which drive the novel's central conflict, can be traced back to her Louisville upbringing. Here, she first fell in love with Gatsby when he was a young military officer stationed at Camp Taylor near Louisville. At that time, Gatsby was a poor young man, relying on his ambition and dreams to provide a brighter future for himself and the woman he loved. Despite being deeply in love, Daisy was unable to marry Gatsby due to her family's expectations and her own preoccupation with wealth and social status. This history between Daisy and Gatsby ultimately resurfaces years later, leading to the climactic events and the tragic outcome of the novel. In summary, Daisy Buchanan's upbringing in Louisville, Kentucky, shaped her character and values within the context of the privileged society of early 20th century America. Her experiences and choices, influenced by the wealth, status, and traditions of her social class, made her who she is in the novel, ultimately leading to the tragic consequences of The Great Gatsby."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

He worried also lest Pakistani authorities not get adequate warning, think the missiles came from India, RESPONSES TO AL QAEDA'S INITIAL ASSAULTS 135 and do something that everyone would later regret. Discussing potential repercussions in the region of his military responsibility, Zinni said, \\"It was easy to take the shot from Washington and walk away from it. We had to live there.\\" Zinni's distinct preference would have been to build up counterterrorism capabilities in neighboring countries such as Uzbekistan. But he told us that he could not drum up much interest in or money for such a purpose from Washington, partly, he thought, because these countries had dictatorial governments. After the decision-in which fear of collateral damage was an important factor- not to use cruise missiles against Kandahar in December 1998, Shelton and officers in the Pentagon developed plans for using an AC-130 gunship instead of cruise missile strikes. Designed specifically for the special forces, the version of the AC-130 known as \\"Spooky\\"can fly in fast or from high altitude, undetected by radar; guided to its zone by extraordinarily complex electronics, it is capable of rapidly firing precision-guided 25, 40, and 105 mm projectiles. Because this system could target more precisely than a salvo of cruise missiles, it had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. After giving Clarke a briefing and being encouraged to proceed, Shelton formally directed Zinni and General Peter Schoomaker, who headed the Special Operations Command, to develop plans for an AC-130 mission against Bin Laden's headquarters and infrastructure in Afghanistan. The Joint Staff prepared a decision paper for deployment of the Special Operations aircraft. Though Berger and Clarke continued to indicate interest in this option, the AC-130s were never deployed. Clarke wrote at the time that Zinni opposed their use, and John Maher, the Joint Staff 's deputy director of operations, agreed that this was Zinni's position. Zinni himself does not recall blocking the option. He told us that he understood the Special Operations Command had never thought the intelligence good enough to justify actually moving AC-130s into position. Schoomaker says, on the contrary, that he thought the AC-130 option feasible. The most likely explanation for the two generals' differing recollections is that both of them thought serious preparation for any such operations would require a long-term redeployment of Special Operations forces to the Middle East or South Asia. The AC-130s would need bases because the aircraft's unrefueled range was only a little over 2,000 miles. Question: \\"What was done in order to minimize collateral damage in Kandahar in December of 1998?\\" Response: \\"Not use AC-130 gunships\\" Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"No, the response does not correctly answer the question. The passage states that cruise missiles were not used in Kandahar in December 1998 due to fear of collateral damage. However, it does mention that plans were developed for using AC-130 gunships instead of cruise missile strikes because they had a much lower risk of causing collateral damage. The correct response should be: \\"Cruise missiles were not used, and plans were developed for using AC-130 gunships instead, as they had a lower risk of causing collateral damage.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hypothesis: A man is playing the piano. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude the hypothesis given the premise. The hypothesis is a statement or a suggestion that might eventually be proven true, usually formed from an analysis or observation and often to provide a basis for further understanding or investigation. In this case, the premise states that a man is sitting in a chair playing a guitar. The key elements here are a man, a chair, and most importantly, a guitar. Given these elements, any hypothesis derived should logically relate to these elements. However, the proposed hypothesis states the man is playing the piano, which is not related to the major elements of the premise. There are a few reasons why we can't conclude the hypothesis based on the given premise: 1) The premise involves a man playing a guitar, not a piano: Guitar and piano are different musical instruments with different mechanisms of producing sound. The act of playing the guitar involves techniques distinct from those used in playing a piano. 2) The setting and position could be different: Generally, playing a guitar can happen in various sitting or standing positions, and it isn't dependent on a fixed structure. In contrast, playing the piano frequently involves a specific seated position in front of the instrument, which is typically immovable or less portable than a guitar. 3) The skills required are different: Playing the guitar mainly involves the use of both hands to fret and strum or pick at the strings. On the other hand, playing the piano involves using both hands to press keys, often simultaneously reading bass and treble clef, which is fundamentally different from guitar tablatures or chord diagrams. So, from the facts given in the premise, there's no logical reason to assume or conclude that the man could be playing the piano instead of the guitar. If the hypothesis were to be valid, the premise would need some mention or suggestion of a piano, which it does not. Therefore, from the premise that a man is sitting in a chair playing guitar, we cannot conclude that a man is playing the piano."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hint: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. It’s rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information indicating that air pollution destroys the ozone layer and results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching the planet's surface, Planet A, which emitted a lot of air pollution and destroyed its ozone layer, would have higher levels of UV radiation reaching it compared to Planet B which respected the environment and used ecological products. The destruction of the ozone layer on Planet A led to an increased vulnerability to UV radiation's harmful effects on life forms and ecosystems, while Planet B was better protected due to the maintenance of a healthier ozone layer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The kneeling woman appears to be talking. Step 2: Determine characters' roles It's reasonable to assume that the kneeling woman may be a personal trainer, fitness instructor, or other fitness professional. The woman lying on her back might be a trainee or client who is receiving instruction or guidance from the professional. Step 3: Analyze possible actions Given the context and setting, the next likely action could be the woman lying down beginning an exercise or workout routine under the guidance of the kneeling woman. This could involve stretching, core exercises, strength training, or any other type of workout. Step 4: Compose the next scene As the kneeling woman continues to talk, she starts demonstrating an exercise, explaining the proper form and technique. The woman lying down focuses intently on her instructions, nodding in understanding. Once the explanation is finished, the woman lying down starts performing the exercise, with the instructor carefully observing her form and offering feedback to ensure she's executing the movement correctly. Step 5: Justify steps This scene progression makes logical sense, as it follows a typical scenario that would play out in a gym between a trainer and a client. The addition of the exercise and feedback helps to further establish the relationship between the two women, as well as create a context for the conversation they're engaged in.

He told me it was disgusting and I lost my temper . Question Why would the narrator blow up at their child ? Answer:","completion":"The narrator would blow up at their child due to a combination of factors, which can be analyzed step by step: Step 1: Setting the context In this situation, the narrator had prepared a lunch for their son, which implies that they put in time and effort to make something they believed their child would enjoy. Step 2: The child's reaction The son did not like the lunch and refused to eat it. This reaction might be perceived as ungrateful and frustrating by the narrator, given the effort they put into the task. Step 3: Attempt to convince the child The narrator tried to convince their son to eat at least some part of the lunch, in this case, the turkey. This shows that the narrator was willing to make a compromise and adapt to the child's preferences, further indicating their desire to ensure the child was fed properly. Step 4: The child's stubbornness The son remained stubborn and refused to listen to the narrator's attempts to convince him to eat. The child even went as far as calling the food \\"disgusting.\\" Step 5: The breaking point After all the previous factors, the narrator lost their temper and blew up at their child.

Add a second nut to the hook and bring the pendulum back to where you marked on the paper the first time. When you release the pendulum, start a stopwatch and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute. Repeat the process 5 times, then calculate your average. Notice the difference in the number of oscillations and the average between 1 nut on the hook and 2 nuts on the hook. Add another nut and repeat the experiment to see if even more mass will affect the pendulum’s oscillations. Go back to just 1 nut on the hook, bring the string back about 10 inches (25 cm), and make a mark on the paper taped behind it so you can repeat the experiment from the same distance. Release the pendulum and count the number of oscillations for 1 minute. Repeat the process 5 times and calculate an average. You may be surprised to learn that the distance (also called amplitude) does not affect the swing rate, or number of oscillations. Try the experiment again from 5 inches (13 cm) and find the average number of oscillations to see how much of a difference the distance makes. Slide the look off of the pencil and cut off 10 inches (25 cm) of string, tie another loop, and put it back on the pencil. Then bring the pendulum back about 10 inches (25 cm) and mark on the paper where you release it from. Repeat the experiment 5 times and find the average number of oscillations to see how the length of the string affects the pendulum. Cut off another 10 inches (25 cm) of string to see the difference it makes on the average number of oscillations. The length from which a pendulum is suspended helps determine the speed and regularity of the swings, which is why pendulums have been used to keep time.

Many composers wrote new works for him, notably Béla Bartók, Ernest Bloch, and Eugène Ysaÿe, along with lesser-known composers such as David Diamond and Hamilton Harty. The reason for Szigeti's appeal to composers was articulated by Bloch upon completion of his Violin Concerto: the concerto's premiere would have to be delayed a full year for Szigeti to be the soloist, and Bloch agreed, saying that Modern composers realize that when Szigeti plays their music, their inmost fancy, their slightest intentions become fully realized, and their music is not exploited for the glorification of the artist and his technique, but that artist and technique become the humble servant of the music. Szigeti was also the dedicatee of the first of Eugène Ysaÿe's Six Sonatas for Solo Violin; in fact, Ysaÿe's inspiration to compose the sonatas came from hearing Szigeti's performances of J.S. Bach's Six Sonatas and Partitas, to which they are intended as a modern counterpart.Perhaps Szigeti's most fruitful musical partnership was with his friend Béla Bartók. The first piece Bartók dedicated to him was the First Rhapsody for violin and orchestra (or piano) of 1928; the rhapsody, based on both Romanian and Hungarian folk tunes, was one of a pair of violin rhapsodies written in 1928 (the other being dedicated to Zoltán Székely.) In 1938, Szigeti and clarinetist Benny Goodman teamed up to commission a trio from Bartók: originally intended to be a short work just long enough to fill both sides of a 78 rpm record, the piece soon expanded beyond its modest intent and became the three-movement Contrasts for piano, violin and clarinet. In 1944, by which time Szigeti and Bartók had both fled to the United States to escape the war in Europe, Bartók's health was failing and he had sunk into depression. He was in dire need of money, but felt no inspiration to compose and was convinced that his works would..., what would be the answer ?

Migration Period art denotes the artwork of the Germanic peoples during the Migration period (ca. 300-900). It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style. In the 3rd century the Roman Empire almost collapsed and its army was becoming increasingly Germanic in make-up, so that in the 4th century when Huns pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The Visigoths settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the Franks settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century Scandinavians such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes invaded Britain. By the close of the 6th century the Western Roman Empire was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, Germanic kingdoms. Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and become farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for \\"mobile\\" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes. The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before conversion to Christianity was buried with its owner. Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived. Three styles dominate Germanic art. The polychrome style originated with the Goths who had settled in the Black Sea area. The animal style was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, Celtic, Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques. Can you clarify how the art is portable?","completion":"Certainly! \\"Portable\\" in this context refers to the fact that Migration Period art was typically not large or fixed installations like monumental sculptures or architectural elements, but rather, smaller and easily transportable objects. These objects could be carried or worn by their owners and would often accompany them wherever they went. The Germanic tribes and peoples who were on the move during the Migration Period valued personal adornment and practical objects that could be easily transported with them as they journeyed to new lands. Examples of such portable art include: 1. Jewelry: Necklaces, bracelets, brooches, rings, and other ornaments that could be worn on the body. 2. Decorated weapons: Swords, shields, and axes embellished with intricate designs, often having practical functions. 3. Horse harness and equipment: Horse bridles, buckles, and fittings decorated with ornate patterns and symbols. 4. Everyday tools: Knives, combs, belt buckles, and other functional items adorned with artistic elements. 5. Manuscripts and codices: In the case of Insular art, illuminated manuscripts containing detailed illustrations and calligraphy were also considered portable and could be transported easily. These portable art pieces were often created using materials like metal, wood, bone, and ivory, which allowed for durable and intricate designs. Due to their size, these objects would be more likely to remain intact and be preserved for future generations to discover, especially if they were buried with their owners upon their death. This portability of artwork showcases the adaptability and mobility of the Germanic peoples during the Migration Period."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Genes are segments of DNA molecules that encode for specific traits and govern the biological processes within an organism's cells. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the hereditary material found in the cells of organisms. It carries genetic information and instructions required to build, maintain and reproduce various structures and functions within a cell. The DNA molecule is composed of a long, double-stranded chain made from four types of nucleotide bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). These bases pair together, A with T and C with G, forming units known as base pairs. The sequence of base pairs in a DNA molecule forms the genetic code. Gene segments are specific sections of this DNA sequence that carry the information required to build proteins. Proteins play a crucial role in the cell by acting as enzymes, structural components, signaling messengers, and performing a wide variety of other functions. Essentially, genes serve as blueprints for the production of these proteins, ensuring proper cellular function and sustaining life. The process of converting genetic instructions into proteins involves two main steps - transcription and translation. Transcription is the process by which the genetic information contained in a gene segment is copied into a precursor molecule known as messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA then undergoes further modifications to form a mature mRNA molecule, which carries the information out of the nucleus and into the cytoplasm of the cell. Translation is the second step, wherein the genetic code in the mRNA molecule is translated into a sequence of amino acids. This process takes place in the cell's ribosomes, which are responsible for reading the mRNA sequence and assembling the corresponding amino acids to form a protein. Once the protein is synthesized, it can then perform its specific function within the cell. In conclusion, the best answer to the question is gene segments, as they contain the encoded instructions within DNA molecules that direct cellular processes by determining the production of proteins necessary for proper functioning and maintenance of cells and organisms."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Early one morning, more than a hundred years ago, an American inventor called Elias Howe finally fell asleep. He had been working all night on the design of a sewing machine but he had run into a very difficult problem. It seemed impossible to get the thread to run smoothly around the needle. Despite his exhaustion, Howe slept badly. He tossed and turned. Then he had a nightmare He dreamt that he had been caught by terrible savages whose king wanted to kill him and eat him unless he could build a perfect sewing machine. When he tried to do so, Howe ran into the same problem as before. The thread kept getting caught around the needle. The king flew into the cage and ordered his soldiers to kill Howe. They came up towards him with their spears raised. But suddenly the inventor noticed something. There was a hole in the tip of each spear. The inventor awoke from the dream, realizing that he had just found the answer to the problem. Instead of trying to get the thread to run around the needle, he should make a small hole in the center of the needle and have the thread run through it. This was the simple idea that finally made Howe design and build the first really practical sewing machine. Thomas Edison, the inventor of the electric light, said his best ideas came into him in dreams. So did the great physicist Albert Einstein. To appreciate the value of dreams, you have to understand what happens when you are asleep. Even then, a part of your mind is still working. This unconscious , but still active part digests your experiences and goes to work on the problems you have had during the day.

Let's analyze the sentence in detail to support this conclusion. The sentence reads, \\"exactly what it wants to be: an atrociously, mind-numbingly, indescribably bad movie.\\" Here, the core sentiment is focused on the characterization of the movie being discussed. The movie is described with several negatively connotated adjectives: 1. Atrociously: This word generally implies something terrible, awful, or of extremely poor quality. It typically portrays a sense of horror or unsatisfactory nature. 2. Mind-numbingly: This term suggests that the movie is so monotonous or uninteresting that it numbs the viewer's mind. It refers to a lack of entertainment or stimulation. 3. Indescribably: While this term itself is not inherently negative, it is used here in conjunction with negative words to emphasize the extent to which the movie is bad. 4. Bad: This is a straightforward negative term, which suggests that the movie is not good or of high quality. The sentence begins with the phrase \\"exactly what it wants to be,\\" which might initially seem like a positive or neutral statement. However, the string of negative adjectives that follows indicate that the acknowledgment of the movie's intentions is not meant as praise or appreciation. Instead, it portrays that the movie has achieved the undesirable qualities it apparently sought to embody. In conclusion, the sentiment of the given sentence is negative, as it illustrates the movie in question as being of extremely poor quality, monotonous, and terrible overall."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It would be hard to find a person who is neutral ,or simply doesn't care one way or the other. What I wonder is why something even without legs causes such great fear. Snakes are quite useful, but that doesn't seem to matter. Snakes help control the population of mice. Without snakes, perhaps we would find mice everywhere. Most of us, however, would rather see a mouse than a snake. The poison argument is a strong one. Some snakes are poisonous, and this causes people's death. However, the poisonous snakes are only a small number. We can't say all the snakes are bad just because of a few dangerous ones. And what do we do with the people who really like snakes? They like snakes even more strongly than we dislike them. These people learn about them, find them out, and watch them carefully. Why? The only reason I can think of is that these people are open-minded. They are able to put aside differences and welcome the snake as a friend. Whatever the reason for our like or dislike, snakes do something good in the circle of life. They would prefer to be left alone, and that is what we should do. If you're lucky, you might not run across more than a few of them in a lifetime. That would be fine with most of us. Although some snakes are poisonous, _ . A) they cause many people's death B) they control the population of mice C) they are not dangerous to people D) they are only a small number Answer:","completion":"D) they are only a small number Snakes, despite their intimidating appearance and the fear they elicit in many people, serve an important role in the ecosystem they inhabit. The fear these creatures spark in humans can be attributed to various factors such as their appearance, movement, and the potential danger posed by venomous species. However, it is essential to acknowledge the minority of venomous snakes and emphasize the significance of snakes as a whole. One of the primary reasons snakes are particularly feared is their unique appearance and method of movement. They lack legs, which sets them apart from most other animals, and they slither across the ground in a manner that can be unsettling to some. Humans tend to fear the unknown or things that deviate from the norm, so their distinctive appearance and movement contribute to the overall fear associated with snakes. Another contributing factor to the fear of snakes is the risk posed by venomous snakes. Although only a small percentage of snakes are venomous, their bites can be dangerous and, in some cases, lethal to humans. This danger is heightened by the fact that it can be difficult for the average person to distinguish between venomous and non-venomous snake species, leading to an inherent fear of all snakes. However, it is important to recognize that the majority of snakes are not venomous and do not pose such risks. The benefits of snakes within ecosystems should not be understated. They help control the population of rodents and other pests, thus maintaining a balance within the food chain. Without snakes, rodent populations could increase substantially, leading to a range of problems, such as crop damage and the spread of diseases. For those who appreciate and even admire snakes, it is often a case of open-mindedness and curiosity. They may view snakes as fascinating creatures and appreciate their unique characteristics and the role they play in their ecosystems. By learning about and understanding snakes, these individuals can move past the initial fear or apprehension that many people experience. In conclusion, while the fear of snakes may be prevalent, it is crucial to recognize the importance of these creatures in the ecosystems they inhabit. As only a small number of snakes are venomous, it is unjustified to fear all snakes based on the potential danger of a minority of species. By understanding and respecting the role of snakes in nature, humans can learn to coexist with them and appreciate their contributions to environmental balance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the same mass of wood were added to the fire in the form of small twigs, they would burn much more quickly. This is because the twigs provide a greater surface area than the log does. An increase in the surface area of a reactant increases the rate of a reaction. Surface area is larger when a given amount of a solid is present as smaller particles. A powdered reactant has a greater surface area than the same reactant as a solid chunk. In order to increase the surface area of a substance, it may be ground into smaller particles or dissolved into a liquid. In solution, the dissolved particles are separated from each other and will react more quickly with other reactants. I am facing a new situation today: Demetrious is conducting chemical reactions for his community college chemistry laboratory course. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of small particles. In his second reaction, reaction B, he uses sodium oxide as the reactant in the form of large chunks of material. Both reactions use the same total weight of sodium oxide. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which reaction, reaction A or reaction B, will occur at a faster rate? A:","completion":"Reaction A, where sodium oxide is used in the form of small particles, will occur at a faster rate. This is because smaller particles provide a greater surface area for the reactant compared to larger chunks of the same material. The increased surface area allows for more frequent and effective collisions between the reactants, leading to a faster reaction rate. In the background article, it was explained that smaller particles like twigs burn more quickly in a fire compared to a large log, due to the larger surface area of the twigs.

Here is a detailed breakdown of both sentences: 1. The mountainous stage 20 of the Giro ended on the slopes of Les Deux Alpes, and the second stage began the next day on the mountain. In this sentence, the key points are: - Stage 20 of the Giro is a mountainous stage. - This stage ended on the slopes of Les Deux Alpes. - The second stage of the Giro began the next day. - The second stage started on the mountain (presumably the slopes of Les Deux Alpes). While this sentence refers to stage 20, it mainly focuses on the relationship between stage 20, the second stage, and Les Deux Alpes. The mention of the second stage seems to be the primary difference here. 2. The Giro's mountainous stage 20 began on the slopes of Les Deux Alpes, and the penultimate stage ended on the mountain the next day. In this sentence, the key points are: - Stage 20 of the Giro is described as the mountainous stage. - This stage started on the slopes of Les Deux Alpes. - The penultimate stage (second to last stage) ended on the mountain the next day. This sentence focuses more on stage 20 and the penultimate stage's relationship to Les Deux Alpes. It does not provide information about when the second stage started, and it uses the term \\"penultimate stage\\" instead of specifying the stage number.

Definition: Given a scientific question, generate a correct answer to it. Input: Wearing what will reduce the amplitude of sound waves entering the ears? Output:","completion":"Earplugs or headphones designed for noise cancellation will reduce the amplitude of sound waves entering the ears. Step-by-step Explanation: 1. Analyze the task: The task requires me to answer a scientific question asking which kind of wear reduces the amplitude (strength) of sound waves entering the ears. 2. Understand the scientific concept: Sound waves are form of energy that travels through a medium (like air, water, or any other liquid or solid matter). When those waves reach our ears, they cause the eardrums to vibrate, which our brains interpret as sound. Reducing the amplitude of these waves will therefore reduce the intensity of the perceived sound. 3. Identify the correct solution: Earplugs and noise-cancelling headphones are devices designed to reduce the amplitude of sound waves. They work by either physically blocking the sound waves from entering the ear (earplugs), or by creating 'anti-noise' waves that interfere with and cancel out the incoming waves (noise-cancelling headphones). 4. Formulate the response: Based on the discussion above, the correct answer to the question is 'Earplugs or headphones designed for noise cancellation'. This solution is justified as both earplugs and noise cancelling headphones are scientifically proven to reduce the intensity of incoming sound waves, thus benefiting people who need to work in noisy environments, or who simply wish to reduce the amount of noise they're exposed to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At first, he was no one special in my life. Then he became my friend. In time, I felt he was also my father. Leo married my mother when I was eleven. Two years later we moved into a house in a new suburban development, where we put down roots. At first our lawn was just a mud with wild grass, but Leo saw bright possibilities. \\"We'll plant trees there to give us shade as well as some flowers,\\" he said. And just these little touches made our house different from all the others. More important, a real family was forming. Leo was becoming a full-time parent, and I was learning what it meant to have a father. Weekday mornings when the weather was bad, Leo often drove me to school. Having a father drop you off may have been something my classmates took for granted, but I always thought it was wonderful. Saturday mornings, we went to the hardware shop, then stepped into the five-and-ten, buying a sports magazine or something else. Some people might think that doing shopping together is nothing special, but I, who had ever before spent my childhood watching other families do their everyday activities, experienced them now with extreme delight.

BuzzFeed reports one photo shared on Twitter is actually an 18-year-old woman who was assaulted by her boyfriend for hours on end; he later pled guilty. Another shows the ex-wife of former White House aide Rob Porter who has accused him of domestic violence. \\"Fake posts are being created to make black people look bad and the sad part of it is some people will believe them,\\" the New York Daily News quotes one disappointed Twitter user as saying. Other images used by trolls include a young Swedish woman who was assaulted at a bar in January, a years-old stock photo, and a still from a 2013 video that used special-effects makeup to raise awareness about domestic violence. Vox advises readers to use Google's reverse image search function before believing everything they see online. \\"It’s possible the trolling is an attempt to scare people away from the theaters and cut into the movie’s bankroll—or it could be yet another example of trolling being used to create a disruptive and ever-more-extreme political environment,\\" the website states. In related news, a number of Twitter users, including Questlove of the Roots, appear genuinely concerned white supremacists could target Black Panther screenings this weekend. (Meanwhile film critics say the hype is real and Black Panther is fantastic.) Article:","completion":"Title: Beware of Online Trolls Spreading False Claims about Racial Attacks at Black Panther Screenings The internet is a powerful source of information, but it can also be a breeding ground for fake news and outrageous claims. One recent example surrounds the much-anticipated Black Panther movie, where online trolls have been spreading false claims using real photos of domestic violence victims. These trolls allege that white people are being targeted in racially-motivated attacks at movie screenings. This harmful misinformation is not only misleading, but it also disrespects the victims whose images are being used for malicious intent. BuzzFeed recently uncovered the disinformation campaign, revealing that one of the photos circulating on social media was of an 18-year-old woman who had been assaulted by her boyfriend. The boyfriend eventually pled guilty to the crime. Another photo showed the ex-wife of former White House aide Rob Porter, who has accused him of domestic violence. It's highly likely that these trolls are aiming to create a misleading narrative about Black Panther moviegoers to incite fear and potential backlash. While most internet users can discern what is real and fake, some users still fall prey to these false claims. As one Twitter user lamented, \\"Fake posts are being created to make black people look bad and the sad part of it is some people will believe them.\\" This realization highlights the importance of verifying the information we come across online. Vox recommends using tools like Google's reverse image search function to check whether images and claims are legitimate. The motives for creating these false accusations are not always clear. Some trolls may be attempting to dissuade people from attending Black Panther screenings, in an effort to cut into the movie's profits. Alternatively, it could be another instance of online trolling fueling an increasingly extreme and disruptive political environment. In related news, a number of Twitter users, including Questlove of the Roots, have expressed genuine concern that white supremacists could target Black Panther screenings this weekend. It's essential to remain vigilant, and to remember that a majority of information on the internet should be taken with a grain of skepticism. At the same time, it's important not to let these falsehoods dampen the excitement surrounding the movie. Critics agree: the hype is real, and Black Panther is indeed a fantastic film."},{"prompt":"Question: what is standard deviation in statistics I found the following answer on Google: The reported margin of error is typically about twice the standard deviation ­– the radius of a 95 percent confidence interval .

In 1989, scientist Hank Pym resigns from S.H.I.E.L.D. after discovering their attempt to replicate his Ant-Man shrinking technology. Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives. In the present day, Pym's estranged daughter, Hope van Dyne, and former protégé, Darren Cross, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the Yellowjacket, which horrifies Pym. Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief Scott Lang moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter Cassie unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out. Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the Wasp, disappeared into a subatomic quantum realm while disabling a Soviet nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator.

Solti told the representatives of the orchestra that his commitments at Covent Garden made it impossible to give Chicago the eight months a year they sought. He suggested giving them three and a half months a year and inviting Carlo Maria Giulini to take charge for a similar length of time. The orchestra declined to proceed on these lines. When Solti accepted the orchestra's second invitation it was agreed that Giulini should be appointed to share the conducting. Both conductors signed three-year contracts with the orchestra, effective from 1969.One of the members of the Chicago Symphony described it to Solti as \\"the best provincial orchestra in the world.\\" Many players remained from its celebrated decade under Reiner, but morale was low, and the orchestra was 5m in debt.

He won't be able to sell all of his cupcakes within the next week, so he has decided to store a portion of them in the freezer to preserve them for later. He is trying to decide if he should store the cupcakes at 0° F or at 10° F in the freezer. and a hint : Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms. Besides the effect of lower temperatures on reaction rates, freezing makes water less available for bacterial growth. Please answer this question : Which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's think step-by-step about the factors that affect the decay of food and the growth of microorganisms. Step 1: Consider the hint provided, \\"Freezing is a common method of food preservation that slows both food decay and the growth of micro-organisms.\\" - Freezing works as preservation because it slows down food decay and inhibits the growth of microorganisms. Step 2: Understand the relationship between temperature and reaction rates. - Lower temperatures mean slower reaction rates, which means slower decay and less bacterial growth. Step 3: Compare the given temperatures, 0°F and 10°F. - 0°F is colder than 10°F. Step 4: Determine which temperature will result in slower decay of the cupcakes. - Given that lower temperatures slow down reaction rates and reduce bacterial growth better than higher temperatures, the colder temperature of 0°F will result in slower decay of the cupcakes compared to 10°F."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a premise: In the United States, almost half of the First-Class mailstream is workshared and an even larger portion of Standard A4 is either workshared or has preparation requirements that involve work the mailer must do. Here is a hypothesis: Each year in the United States, almost half of all mail is delayed because of steep requirements on preparation. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"No, it's not possible to conclude that if the premise is true, the hypothesis is also true. Here's the reasoning process: Step 1: Understand the premise The premise states that almost half of the First-Class mail is workshared, which means it has been pre-sorted or pre-processed by the sender to expedite its handling by the postal service. It also claims that an even larger portion of Standard A4 mail either involves similar worksharing processes or the mailer has to do some preparatory work. But it doesn't give any assessment or judgment about whether this worksharing or preparatory work leads to delay or expedite in the mail delivery. Step 2: Understand the hypothesis The hypothesis claims that almost half of all mail in the United States is delayed each year due to steep preparation requirements. This statement implicitly implies a negative impact of the preparatory work - causing delays in mail delivery, which is not mentioned or proven in the premise. Step 3: Compare premise and hypothesis While the premise and the hypothesis both refer to work that needs to be done by the mailer, they depart significantly in their implications. The premise does not draw any negative correlation between work-sharing and mail delivery speed, whereas the hypothesis directly points out a negative impact causing delay. Just because some work is done by the mailer (preparation requirements/worksharing), we cannot deduce that it will cause a delay. It could, in fact, speed up the process as the purpose of worksharing is typically to expedite handling by the postal service. Therefore, if the premise is true, it does not necessarily make the hypothesis true. We would need more information that directly links the preparatory work to delays in mail delivery."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

New houses are untouched and fresh, which means they can suit your personality and you know exactly where all of the materials come from. New houses won't hold many unpleasant surprises, such as weak foundations, or other damaged areas. Most of these modern houses are also far more eco-friendly, with future decoration being just as easy to make and do as you like. Buying new houses is also a great way to save money, and you may find its benefit with the price going up in the future. Some buildings, such as those that are rare or in certain areas, are of value over the years. Sometimes it is the history that draws more buyers into older houses. A famous person may have lived there, or an important event may have taken place in the house. This may not add any value to the house, but it can add to the attraction. There may be more repairs which will need to be done in the old houses,so before you think you've found a great bargain, be sure to get a careful inspection.

According to the radar reconstruction, American 77 reemerged as a primary target on Indianapolis Center radar scopes at 9:05, east of its last known position. The target remained in Indianapolis Center's airspace for another six minutes, then crossed into the western portion of Washington Center's airspace at 9:10. As Indianapolis Center continued searching for the aircraft, two managers and the controller responsible for American 77 looked to the west and southwest along the flight's projected path, not east-where the aircraft was now heading. Managers did not instruct other controllers at Indianapolis Center to turn on their primary radar coverage to join in the search for American 77. In sum, Indianapolis Center never saw Flight 77 turn around. By the time it reappeared in primary radar coverage, controllers had either stopped looking for the aircraft because they thought it had crashed or were looking toward the west. Although the Command Center learned Flight 77 was missing, neither it nor FAA headquarters issued an all points bulletin to surrounding centers to search for primary radar targets. American 77 traveled undetected for 36 minutes on a course heading due east for Washington, D.C.

After Zach gets off the phone, the couple goes back into their bedroom where Georgina seduces Zach. Zach, however, uses a condom, much to the dismay of Georgina.The next day, Georgina goes shopping for a present for Zach's sister's baby with her mother. Georgina is taken away by the baby items around her and is saddened by it. When a doctor's ad for his clinic for women who want to get pregnant, but may not be able to conceive for much longer, Georgina's mother mentions her aunt. Presuming that her aunt was a lesbian, Georgina was never surprised that her aunt had no children, however her mother informs her that she was simply unable to have children; she was too late.A frantic Georgina spends Â£150 on a blanket, to the surprise of her mother, before leaving the store. At Zach's sister's house, Georgina is taken by the baby and is allowed to hold her as Zach goofs off with his sister's belly sculpture. After breaking the sculpture, Zach blames it on her three-year-old son and the couple soon leave.In the car, Georgina gets upset with Zach over the statue and she is about to ask him a question before he cuts her off saying, \\"I do not hate babies.\\" Georgina jumps to the conclusion that he does hate babies and demands that he pull over and lets her out. Zach goes to a friend's house to 'crash' while Georgina heads home.Prior to this event, Georgia had gone to the clinic to see how many eggs she had left; her best friend Clem goes with her and receives the call that the two of them are to return. The doctor informs Georgina that she only has one egg left and that she'd be ovulating for four days. The two women go out on a 'date' with a young man named Justin, who is completely taken aback when Georgina announces that she has one egg left.Clem and Justin help Georgina form a plan to sleep with a random stranger. On day one, Georgina has an \\"open house\\" to rent out her apartment in order to lure men inside. The first few are turned away due to their looks or their gender preference. Finally, a man of great quality comes along, however just before he and Georgina kiss, Zach calls.Georgina kicks the man out and talks to Zach, but then hears a woman's voice saying, \\"Zach, darling, will you zip me up?\\" An angry Georgina hangs up the phone and Zach isn't too pleased with the woman - Alexandra. Alexandra is the daughter of a rich man who is funding Zach's latest documentary; she is also the reason why Georgina was unable to speak to Zach before he left for a trip.On day two, Georgina goes to a funeral to pick up a man overcome with \\"emotions\\" and isn't thinking too well. She takes him back to her apartment, leaves to get wine and as she is in the kitchen he discovers her \\"PLAN\\" sheet that has all the details about her seducing him on it. He is disgusted and leaves, as Georgina tries to explain herself.Day three, Georgina finds herself with Clem at a night club. They see a very good looking young man, dancing very seductively and attracting all the girls' attention, and Georgina goes to seduce him. Before successfully seducing the man, she rips her dress in several places to make herself more sultry.At the hotel, Georgina is about to go all the way with him, before she excuses herself to go to the bathroom. While she is taking out her breast pads and washing her mouth out, he steals some of her money and a card before leaving. Georgina comes out to find the lights off and him gone. After cursing her stupidity â and noticing her money and card gone â she goes home.During this time, Zach is seen trying to hurry back to London and has to take the ferry because Alexandra had taken the last ticket going to London. Georgina and Clem purchase sperm from the Internet and go out to buy a turkey baster. At this time, Georgia reveals to Clem that she only wants Zach, before she says that she can't believe that the future father of her child is a turkey baster.Georgina, seeming desperate at this point, turns to one of her employees who reveals that he is infertile just before the two of them can have sex.

Justin can't do it and backs out.She begins to spank him, before she is thrown out of the hotel by the staff. She runs into a friend of Zach's and is comforted by him. While hugging him, Zach walks in and assumes that they are having an affair and slaps his friend before leaving. Georgina runs after him, but loses him. She misses her chance to get pregnant and mopes around because she lost both her chance to have a baby and Zach.Ben, Zach's friend, comes over to check on Georgina and the two begin to talk about how awkward the situation was just as the doorbell rings. Clem gets it and turns out that it's Zach, who is outraged to find Ben and Georgina holding hands. He slaps Ben again, who, in turn, punches Zach. The two have a scuffle, during which Ben tells Zach that while Georgia is OK, she isn't Clem. Clem, hearing this, asks him to repeat that and after establishing that he likes Clem and not Georgina, he gets off Zach and goes to Clem.Georgina asks about Alexandra, who Zach admits is beautiful, but says that isn't all he looks for in a person.

Coral reefs are the planet's most diverse marine ecosystem , known as the rainforests of the oceans.Despite taking up under 0.2% of the ocean floor, they provide food and shelter for almost a third of all sea life.If we lose the ecosystems, we lose not only the biodiversity , but we also lose the capability of people to obtain income and food from coral reefs. Climatic instability, which leads to rising sea temperatures, causes corals to bleach.Bleaching occurs when sea temperatures rise and this causes the coral tissue to expel their symbiotic algae called zooxanthellae - these are what give the coral their colour.Bleached corals often die if the stress continues.Among... The answer is:","completion":"Which of the following is NOT a threat to coral reefs mentioned in the article about the Edge Coral Reefs project led by the Zoological Society of London? A. Rising sea temperatures due to climatic instability B. Increased acidity C. Overfishing and pollution D. Invasive plant species"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Station in Kansas City to put song on heavy rotation on first night of series. Giants and Royals face off in Game 1 of World Series Tuesday night. Article:","completion":"Title: San Francisco Radio Stations Outlaw Hit Song \\"Royals\\" ahead of World Series In one of the most unconventional episodes in the world of sports media, San Francisco radio stations have enacted a necessary ban on the chart-topping hit \\"Royals.\\" The popular song by Grammy-award-winning artist Lorde has become notably absent from the airwaves of Bay Area radio stations. This decision was born out of a fierce sense of city pride, brewing up in the tension surrounding the highly anticipated clash between the San Francisco Giants and the Kansas City Royals in Game 1 of the World Series on Tuesday night. The solidarity sparked by the emblematic song has intensified the rivalry between the two cities, giving rise to a tantalizing narrative that extends beyond sports. The banning of \\"Royals,\\" a tune that one could argue is rather innocuous, has stirred various emotions among the public, creating complicated feelings towards what promises to be an electrifying Game 1 of the World Series. On the track, Lorde sings about never seeing ‘a diamond in the flesh,’ and consequently not being ‘royal.’ The lyrics, coincidentally matching the name of the Kansas City baseball team, became the de facto anthem for Kansas City Royals fans when the song was released in 2013. Now, before the showdown between the Giants and the Royals, it seems the song has found an unfortunate fate on the other side of the battle line. Simultaneously, Kansas City radio stations have responded by rallying around the song, pointing to it as a source of civic identity. Kansas City's decision to put \\"Royals\\" on heavy rotation on the first night of the series acts as a counter-protest and a hearty show of support for their home team. This move only adds fuel to the anticipation surrounding the opening game, marking the beginning of what can only be described as \\"battle of the airwaves.\\" The face-off between the Giants and the Royals on Tuesday night represents more than a sporting event; it embodies a culture clash enhanced by the interplay of a popular song, a major sport, and civic pride. This war of the airwaves, with \\"Royals\\" being caught in the crossfire, contributes to the captivating narrative of nationwide broadcast sporting events. The ban itself represents a statement that the battle for the title extends beyond the baseball diamond. It reflects San Francisco's determination and spirited solidarity, an effort to support their team and draw the line in the face of the competition. However, despite the ban on \\"Royals,\\" the song continues to ring loud in Kansas City, enhancing the sense of rivalry and camaraderie between the two cities. As the Giants and Royals gear up to face-off in the World Series, the public eagerly awaits the score, stoked by the emotional subtext of this war of the airwaves. The spirit of American baseball is alive and pulsating in a new, unprecedented manner, creating an unforgettable saga nourishing itself on the fervor of fans from both coasts. In the tumult and thrill of sports, this music ban is a powerful symbol, reminding us all of the deep roots sport can have in our communal consciousness and everyday life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film premiered at the Sundance Film Festival on January 19, 2007, and was distributed by Roadside Attractions for a limited release in the United States. Can we infer the following? Teeth is about white people.","completion":"Although \\"Teeth\\" is a 2007 black comedy horror film written and directed by Mitchell Lichtenstein and stars Jess Weixler, it is not possible to infer that the movie is solely about white people based on the information provided. \\"Teeth\\" tells the story of a high school girl, Dawn O'Keefe (played by Jess Weixler), who discovers that she has a condition known as vagina dentata, which means that her vagina contains teeth. The film explores themes of purity, adolescence, and sexual instinct, as well as incorporating elements of horror and comedy. While it can be assumed that a portion of the characters in the film may be white, due to the film being an American production and Jess Weixler being a white actress, it is not accurate to conclude that it is solely about white people. The film's themes and subject matter transcend race and ethnicity, focusing more on the protagonist's unique condition and how she comes to terms with it, navigates her relationships, and experiences the consequences of her actions. To determine the racial and ethnic representation in the film, it would be beneficial to analyze the full cast and the way various characters are portrayed. However, it is essential to remember that the focus of the movie is on the storyline, themes, and experiences of the main character, rather than on the racial identity of the actors involved.

But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of British people own smartphones and they spend an average of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the UK who suffer from shortsightedness since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring at smartphones for long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink a certain number of times. However, when you look at things closer to your face, the blinking slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphones in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils become larger, too much light enters your eyes. This can do harm to the eyes and cause a disease called glaucoma . While you're probably not going to stop using to your _ , there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least five meters from you and then focus on the tip of your nose. Repeat this several times. It should reduce the discomfort in your eyes. Question: This article is written to advise people _ .

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Intense media interest in the opinions and private lives of the royal family during the 1980s led to a series of sensational stories in the press, not all of which were entirely true. As Kelvin MacKenzie, editor of The Sun, told his staff: \\"Give me a Sunday for Monday splash on the Royals. Don't worry if it's not true—so long as there's not too much of a fuss about it afterwards.\\" Newspaper editor Donald Trelford wrote in The Observer of 21 September 1986: \\"The royal soap opera has now reached such a pitch of public interest that the boundary between fact and fiction has been lost sight of ... it is not just that some papers don't check their facts or accept denials: they don't care if the stories are true or not.\\" It was reported, most notably in The Sunday Times of 20 July 1986, that the Queen was worried that Margaret Thatcher's economic policies fostered social divisions and was alarmed by high unemployment, a series of riots, the violence of a miners' strike, and Thatcher's refusal to apply sanctions against the apartheid regime in South Africa. The sources of the rumours included royal aide Michael Shea and Commonwealth Secretary-General Shridath Ramphal, but Shea claimed his remarks were taken out of context and embellished by speculation. Thatcher reputedly said the Queen would vote for the Social Democratic Party—Thatcher's political opponents. Thatcher's biographer John Campbell claimed \\"the report was a piece of journalistic mischief-making\\". Belying reports of acrimony between them, Thatcher later conveyed her personal admiration for the Queen, and the Queen gave two honours in her personal gift—membership in the Order of Merit and the Order of the Garter—to Thatcher after her replacement as prime minister by John Major. Former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said Elizabeth was a \\"behind the scenes force\\" in ending apartheid. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): What did high public interest in the private lives of the royal family cause in the press?","completion":"High public interest in the private lives of the royal family during the 1980s caused the press to publish lots of stories about them. Some of these stories were not true, but the newspapers didn't always care if they were true or not. They just wanted to make their stories exciting for people to read. This made it hard for people to tell the difference between real news and made-up news about the royal family."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Certainly he looks like no one else of the time, that skull-like face, flattened nose, and elongated body-- even now he remains an unsettling presence. And what could be more appropriate than his emergence out of those dingy New Orleans slums that appear to fester like the plague Blackie is loosing on the city. I'm just sorry he didn't have more scenes. The movie itself is very skillfully assembled the morgue's black humor, the Widmark- Douglas interplay, the un-touristy locations, the battles among officialsall are woven into a tensely realistic thriller with a menace unlike others of the time. Even Widmark's domestic scenes that put a woman (Bel Geddes) on the marquee manage not to be too disruptive. Director Kazan certainly shows his aptitude for helming a studio (Fox) product, no matter how he may have felt about the commercial aspect. Widmark does a solid low-key job as the public health officer. But my money is on the one- and-only Zero Mostel. Was there ever a sweatier performer who could squeal louder or get pushed around more than the bulky fall guy (e.g. The Enforcer, 1950). That scene with Mostel, where Palance argues with Mostel's shrewish wife (Liswood), is a gem of frantic subservience as Mostel tries to pacify each like some berserk pinball. Too bad he lost so many years to the blacklist. (I wonder if it was the voluble Kazan who named him.) But it's not only the professionals that add color. The locals add both character and authenticity, especially the two Asian guys interviewed by the cops. That whole scene has an improvised air, as if Kazan recognized their potential and fashioned a nifty little scene on the spot. Then too, that colorful hiring hall with all the deck hands is pure inspiration. And what about those flea-bitten coffee shops that have me running to the nearest Denny's.

This documentary explores a story covered in Pilger's latest book \\"Freedom Next Time\\", which was published in 2006. It reveals the shocking expulsion of the natives of Diego Garcia, one of the Chagos Islands in the Indian Ocean. The islanders are technically British citizens, as Diego Garcia is a British colony, much like Mauritius, the nearby island to where the natives were exiled, used to be. But the British government has ignored their pleas to return to their homeland, as the island is now a military base for the United States army, who have used it as a basis for the bombing of Iraq and Afghanistan. As usual, Pilger's coverage is shocking, especially as he documents the treatment and the current impoverished living conditions of the surviving islanders. His interviews all round are excellent, and his cornering of a Parliament representative where he uses the Government's own information to pin him down, ranks as one of his best. Pilger also uses dramatic reconstruction to dissect a series of recently released documents that fully illuminate the British conspiracy to evict the natives.

They threaten to detonate it, thereby contaminating 50% of the world's oil reserve, unless Israel withdraws its settlements from the West Bank. The fact that the KGB is behind this threat is unknown, as the culprits are believed by the Israelis and Americans to be Islamic fundamentalist extremists. The American president contemplates starting a war with Israel, in order to save the world from oil crisis. The director of the CIA offers the president an alternative solution. A CIA agent codenamed The Soldier (Ken Wahl), working outside the usual channels, is assigned to the case. After Russian agent Dracha (Klaus Kinski) attempts to terminate him, he contacts the CIA director from the US embassy in Berlin. A KGB agent assassinates the director and frames The Soldier for his murder, leaving no official knowledge of his activities other than the president, who has disavowed any knowledge of his actions. On the run from his own government, he seeks refuge in the Israeli embassy. He and his team cooperate with the Israeli Mossad, represented by their director of covert operations Susan Goodman (Alberta Watson).

Translate to English English:","completion":"What if it suffers because of the European Union's bad politics? If a country or region suffers due to the European Union's bad politics, there would be several potential implications and consequences. The European Union (EU) is an economic and political union established in 1993, aiming to foster greater cooperation and integration amongst its member states. However, the EU has faced multiple challenges, including managing different political ideologies, economic policies, and addressing varying social and environmental concerns. In the case where bad politics become a significant issue, the following impacts might occur: 1. Economic stagnation: Bad politics within the EU can lead to ineffective economic policies, regulations, and decisions that stifle or slow down economic growth, leading to stagnation. This can result in higher unemployment rates, reduced productivity, and increased reliance on social welfare programs by affected citizens. 2. Social unrest and division: Poor political decision-making can have a direct impact on society, leading to social unrest and division within the affected countries or regions. This might manifest in the form of protests, increased crime rates, or the rise of extremist political movements. It could also lead to growing disillusionment with the European Union and its institutions amongst the citizens. 3. Inequality: Bad politics can exacerbate wealth disparities between EU member states and within individual countries. This can lead to escalating tensions among member states, causing resentment and potentially leading to political frictions. It might also result in an internal debate among member states, with some advocating for more equitable wealth distribution and others seeking to retain the status quo. 4. Weakening of democratic institutions: If the EU's bad politics cause mistrust among its member states and their citizens, democratic institutions might be weakened. This could make it more difficult to arrive at consensus-based decisions and lead to gridlock, further exacerbating the problems and challenges facing the union. 5. Potential for a rise in nationalist movements: As countries or regions suffer from the consequences of bad politics within the EU, nationalist movements might gain traction. This could eventually lead to calls for secession or even the disintegration of the European Union as more countries seek greater autonomy and control over their political, economic, and social destinies. 6. Impact on global relations: Bad politics within the European Union might affect its relations with non-member countries. It could potentially jeopardize international trade deals, partnerships, and alliances, consequently diminishing the EU's influence and standing on the global stage. In conclusion, if a country or region suffers due to the European Union's bad politics, it would face numerous challenges, including economic stagnation, social unrest, inequality, weakened democratic institutions, the rise of nationalist movements, and a potential impact on global relations. Addressing these problems would require a concerted effort from the EU, member states, and potentially involved international partners."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This problem is kind of like a game of stack the blocks. On the left side of the equal sign, we have 859 blocks with a letter 'v' on each of them (859*v). On the right side of the equal sign, we have two stacks of blocks: 1748 blocks with the letter 'v' on them (1748*v) and negative 865 blocks (that means we want to remove 865 blocks, like taking them away in a game of Jenga) with the letter 'v' on them (-865*v), and lastly, we have a simple pile of -624 blocks with no 'v' on them (-624). The equal sign in the middle is like a balance scale. Whatever we do on one side, we have to do on the other to keep it balanced. Now, let's play the game on the right side first. We need to add up (or subtract, based on situation) all the 'v' blocks on the right side. So if we have 1748 'v' blocks and we take away 865 of them, we will have 1748 - 865 = 883 'v' blocks left (in other words, 883*v). And remember - we still have those -624 blocks too. Now, both sides of our equation look like this: 859*v = 883*v - 624. If we want to balance out the 'v' blocks on both sides, we can remove 859 'v' blocks from each side (because that's how many we started with on the left side). So on the left, we'd have zero 'v' blocks, while on the right side, we'd end up with 883*v - 859*v = 24*v blocks and don't forget about those -624 blocks. So it looks like this now: 0 = 24*v - 624. Remember, we want to solve for 'v', kind of like a final winner of our game. To do that, let's move those -624 blocks to the other side by adding 624 to each side, to keep our scale balanced. The equation should now look like this: 624 = 24*v. To find what 'v' equals (or who the 'v' winner is), we simply need to divide 624 (total blocks) by 24 ('v' blocks). It looks like this: v = 624/24 = 26. And so, the winner of our game, or the value of 'v', is 26."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose there are tumors in the esophagus happens, how will it affect less oxygen being brought to the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"Step 1: Air is drawn in through the mouth - In this step, air containing oxygen and other gases is inhaled through the mouth. Step 2: The air goes down the trachea (not the esophagus) - The trachea, not the esophagus, is the correct anatomical structure responsible for carrying air to the lungs. The esophagus is responsible for carrying food from the mouth to the stomach. Step 3: The air moves into the lungs - The air rich in oxygen passes through the bronchial tubes and bronchioles, finally reaching the alveoli, where gas exchange occurs. Step 4: The carbon dioxide is removed, and the oxygen enters the body - Within the alveoli, oxygen diffuses from the air into the surrounding blood vessels, while carbon dioxide diffuses from the blood into the alveoli to be exhaled. Step 5: The remaining carbon dioxide is expelled through the mouth - The air is exhaled through the trachea and out of the mouth, removing carbon dioxide from the body. Perturbation hypothesis: If there are tumors in the esophagus Since the esophagus is not directly involved in the respiratory process, the presence of tumors in the esophagus may not have a direct impact on the oxygen intake. However, they can cause indirect effects: 1. If the tumors are large enough or their location causes an obstruction in the trachea, it may inhibit the proper flow of air to the lungs, leading to less oxygen reaching the body. 2. If the tumors cause pain or discomfort, it may affect the person's ability to breathe deeply, reducing oxygen intake to some extent. 3. In some cases, if the tumors are cancerous and metastasize to the lungs, they can directly affect the lung's capacity to take in oxygen. In conclusion, though the esophagus is not directly involved in the airflow and oxygen intake, the presence of tumors can have indirect effects on respiration and the amount of oxygen being supplied to the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he sat down at his favorite corner seat, a gray and white stray cat sauntered in, disregarding the people around, and loosened itself onto George's lap.

Question: Where is Liz stopping for a drink? Movie plot title: Whore Movie plot: Liz (Russell) is a Los Angeles prostitute the audience first sees attempting to get a customer on a busy downtown street near a tunnel. She addresses the audience directly on her life and problems throughout the film. When a van stops by, she gives it the brush off, recalling the last time she serviced a man in a van: it turned out there were several other men in the van, who gang-raped her and left her for dead. A passer-by (Jack Nance) helps her to the hospital, and even pays her bill there. She sends him a thank you note. Liz isn't merely attempting to get a customer, however: she is attempting to escape her pimp, Blake (Benjamin Mouton). Blake is a well-dressed, businesslike and extremely controlling man who catches up with her at a convenience store. He demands money, and Liz has no choice but to agree though she gives him the finger as he leaves. As Liz stops off at a strip club for a drink, she explains how she ended up as she did: she was a small town girl, who married a violent drunk named Charlie (Frank Smith). Though they have a child together, she can no longer take it and leaves him, taking her son with her, as he's sleeping it off. She takes a job on the graveyard shift at a diner, and when a customer offers her more money to have sex with him, she decides, given her rather low pay, to take it. She does this independently for a time until she meets Blake, who takes her to LA. Though Blake does do some things for her (including getting her tattooed), he is ultimately as cruel as her husband, so she decides to escape from him. A local homeless person/street performer named Rasta (Antonio Fargas) decides to treat Liz to a movie. Though Rasta is a bit scary (his act involves walking on broken glass), Liz agrees. At this point the scenes of Liz and Rasta at the movie are intercut with Blake explaining his life to the audience, giving the impression that Liz and Rasta are watching Blake's soliloquy.

Tina and tinga are other popular genres, while extent folk traditions include ceremonial music used in funerals, initiations and other rituals, as well as Balanta brosca and kussundé, Mandinga djambadon, and the kundere sound of the Bissagos Islands. Q: What type of tradition includes ceremonial music used in funerals?","completion":"In Guinea-Bissau, the tradition that includes ceremonial music used in funerals, as well as in initiations and other rituals, can be attributed to the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the country. This West African nation is home to various ethnic groups, each with its own distinct language, customs, and musical styles. These groups include the Balanta, Mandinga, Fula, Manjack, Papel, and Bijagós, among others. The ceremonial music played during funerals serves various purposes, such as honoring the deceased, providing comfort to the grieving family, and fostering a sense of community and continuity within the ethnic group. It is often characterized by a combination of traditional instruments, vocal performances, and rhythmic patterns that reflect the unique cultural identity of the group. Different ethnic groups in Guinea-Bissau may have their specific variations of funeral music. For example, the Balanta people often play brosca, a type of ceremonial music, in their funeral rites. This music is characterized by the use of drums, rattles and other percussion instruments, as well as call-and-response singing patterns. Similarly, the Mandinga people use their traditional djambadon music, played on an indigenous string instrument called kora, during funerals and other important cultural events. Additionally, in the Bissagos Islands, located off the coast of Guinea-Bissau, the kundere sound is a unique musical style utilized during ceremonies, including funerals. The kundere uses a specific type of wooden xylophone, accompanied by singing and dancing. In summary, the tradition of incorporating ceremonial music in funerals in Guinea-Bissau is deeply rooted in the various ethnic groups that comprise the country's diverse population. Each group has its own cultural identity and practices, which are reflected in the unique musical styles and instruments used during funeral ceremonies and other significant rituals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Roy Barnes will spend his first day as a private citizen by starting his new job as a full-time, pro-bono (unpaid) lawyer at the Atlanta Legal Aid Society. The decision by Barnes, the most improbable casualty of Election Day 2002, to go to work for legal aid was almost as unexpected as his November defeat. As a legal services attorney, Barnes will help women escape domestic violence, Mauricio Vivero is vice president seniors fight predatory lending scams and parents obtain child support for their kids. of Legal In doing so, he will take his place on the front line of the U.S. legal community's Services Corporation, the uphill and underpublicized struggle to achieve equal access to justice for millions of Washington-Americans too poor to afford legal representation. based nonprofit corporation chartered by The inaccessibility of the U.S. civil justice system is hardly a new development, but it Congress in took Barnes' decision to put the national media spotlight on our country's ongoing 1974 to promote equal access to access-to-justice crisis. civil justice. The 2000 U.S. census reports that more than 43 million Americans qualify for free federally funded legal assistance, yet fewer than 20 percent of eligible clients (annual income: 11,075 or less) are able to obtain legal help when they need it, according to the American Bar Association. In Georgia, there is just one legal aid lawyer for every 10,500 eligible poor people. Barnes understood this problem long before he became governor. While in private practice, he handled many pro-bono cases and was a frequent volunteer in the Cobb County office of the federally funded Atlanta Legal Aid Society. Most memorably, he secured a 115 million judgment in 1993 against Fleet Finance for victimizing 18,000 homeowners -- many of them senior citizens -- with its widespread predatory lending mortgage practices. His long-standing commitment to the underserved is certainly admirable, but it should not be viewed as a rare and laudable act of civic virtue. To be admitted to practice law, every attorney must take a professional oath to promote justice -- and every state's ethical rules include language indicating lawyers' responsibility to be guardians of fair play for those living in poverty. In Georgia, many law firms, corporations and private attorneys are working pro bono to serve the neediest clients. Yet only 23 percent of the state's 23,598 active lawyers reported meeting the Georgia State Bar's goal of 50 hours of pro-bono service in 2002. The need for volunteers is most severe outside the five-county Atlanta metropolitan area, where 70 percent of the state's poor people are served by only 24 percent of the state's lawyers. National pro-bono participation is even worse. Only 23 percent of the roughly 1 million attorneys in America volunteer even one hour of pro-bono service annually, according to the ABA.

Hellenistic period During the Hellenistic period, Judea became a frontier region between the Seleucid Empire and Ptolemaic Egypt and therefore was often the frontline of the Syrian wars, changing hands several times during these conflicts. Under the Hellenistic kingdoms, Judea was ruled by the hereditary office of the High Priest of Israel as a Hellenistic vassal. This period also saw the rise of a Hellenistic Judaism, which first developed in the Jewish diaspora of Alexandria and Antioch, and then spread to Judea. The major literary product of this cultural syncretism is the Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible from Biblical Hebrew and Biblical Aramaic to Koiné Greek.

Article: Like most parents, I worry that my child isn't getting enough sleep. Now it turns out that doctors have been warning kids don't get enough sleep for over a century--long before iPads, and texting robbed children of peaceful sleep. What's more, there's no solid scientific basis for pediatricians' recommendations on the amount of time children need to sleep. That's the word from researchers in Australia. It turns out that children are sleeping less than those in days of old. The researchers, at the University of South Australia's Health and Use of Time Group, found that kids' nightly sleep time declined by about three-quarters of a minute each year for the period they studied. My daughter was more likely to beg for a few more minutes of Angry Birds before bedtime.That means nowadays my daughter is sleeping about 50 minutes a night less than her grandfather who had to get up to milk the cows at 5:30 am. What hasn't changed is the predictions from health professionals on the consequences of lack of sleep. \\"This is a sleepless age and more and more... we are turning night into day,\\" one expert said in 1905. Back then, sleep was seen as a way to restore \\"wearied brain tissue\\". Children and \\"clever\\" children were thought to be most at risk, and most in need of energy-restoring sleep. The words may be different today, but the threats are pretty much the same. Parents are told that children risk mental and physical problems, and even obesity, if they don't get enough sleep. So the Australians looked to see how much sleep kids do need. The answer is the biggest surprise of this study--no one really knows. \\"There is almost no exact evidence for proper sleep for children,\\" the authors write.

Article: If you are afraid of the dark,it's not a big deal.It's perfectly normal to feel afraid After all,animals do too. \\"Fear matters,\\"says Karen Warkentin,an ecologist.\\"It's a good thing,\\" she adds, \\"because fear makes you do things that keep you alive.\\" Like kids,many animals experience fear and they respond to the feeling in variety of ways.A frightened turtle pulls its head and legs inside its shell.A small fish will swim away when a big,hungry fish approaches. Some animals respond to fear in ways you might not expect.The first example is that the fear of being eaten can scare some frogs right out of their eggs. Warkentin made the surprising discovery while studying red--eyed tree frogs in Costa Rica. In this species,female frogs attach jellylike clumps of their eggs to the undersides of leaves.The leaves hang on branches that dangle over ponds.After they hatch from the eggs,the tadpoles then fall into the water,where they eventually grow into adult frogs. Tree frog eggs usually grow for 6 days before hatching.If they sense that a hungry snake is about to attack,however,they can hatch up to 2 days ahead of schedule. As the snakes are unable to swim,by falling into the water early,the tadpoles can escape. If hatching early helps protect red--eyed tree frogs from snakes,you might wonder why their eggs don't always hatch sooner.It turns out that hatching early brings its own danger.Once tadpoles land in the water,hungry fish and other animals like to eat them too.Staying in their eggs for a full 6 days,then,allows frog embryos to grow big and strong.This extra growth improves their chances of surviving in the water.

This week, Obama has asked Francine Wheeler, mother of 6-year-old Ben, to deliver the address instead. Wheeler and her husband, David, lost their young son in the December schoolhouse shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown. A month after the shooting, the Wheelers spoke publicly with members of Sandy Hook Promise, asking for action to prevent more violence. “We are not done being the best possible parents we can be for Ben, not by a very long measure,” David Wheeler said at the time. “If there is something in our society that needs to be fixed, clearly healed or resolved, that resolution needs a point of origin. It needs parents.” Then, he posed the question to parents everywhere of what it is worth to them to keep their children safe. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama believes the voices of Newtown families have been critical to progress on gun control. When asked if this was the first time in history someone other than the President has delivered the weekly address, Carney said the only person other than President Obama to deliver the address in this administration was Vice President Joe Biden. The families who lost loved ones during the shooting have been in Washington lobbying members of Congress. The Senate cleared its first hurdle for gun control legislation on Thursday and will consider expanded background checks next week. The weekly address is posted on the White House Web site. ||||| President Obama (Photo: Alex Wong Getty Images) Story Highlights The president spoke about Francine Wheeler's anguish in a speech earlier this week WASHINGTON—With the White House trying to keep pressure on Congress to pass gun control legislation, President Obama has asked the mother of a 6-year-old victim of the Sandy Hook Elementary School tragedy to deliver his weekly radio address. Francine Wheeler, whose son Ben was among the 26 victims of the Connecticut school shooting, will deliver the radio address, said White House spokesman Jay Carney. \\"Nobody has a more important and powerful perspective on the issue than the families who have lost loved ones,\\" Carney said. Obama spoke of Wheeler's anguish in a speech he made in Hartford, Conn., earlier this week as part of the White House push for the legislation. \\"Over the weekend, I heard Francine Wheeler, who lost her son Ben that day, say that the four months since the tragedy might feel like a brief moment for some, but for her, it feels like it's been years since she saw Ben,\\" Obama said in the Connecticut speech. \\" And she's determined not to let what happened that day just fade away. 'We're not going anywhere,\\" she said. 'We are here. And we are going to be here.' And I know that she speaks for everybody in Newtown, everybody who was impacted.\\" The radio address airs on Saturday. |||||","completion":"The White House has announced that Francine Wheeler, a mother who lost her 6-year-old son in the Newtown shooting, will deliver the weekly presidential radio and internet address.

Instructions: In this task, you are given an abstract of article. Your task is to generate title for this article. Preferred titles are under thirty words. Input: Polymerization of actin filaments directed by the actin-related protein (Arp)2/3 complex supports many types of cellular movements. However, questions remain regarding the relative contributions of Arp2/3 complex versus other mechanisms of actin filament nucleation to processes such as path finding by neuronal growth cones; this is because of the lack of simple methods to inhibit Arp2/3 complex reversibly in living cells. Here we describe two classes of small molecules that bind to different sites on the Arp2/3 complex and inhibit its ability to nucleate actin filaments. CK-0944636 binds between Arp2 and Arp3, where it appears to block movement of Arp2 and Arp3 into their active conformation. CK-0993548 inserts into the hydrophobic core of Arp3 and alters its conformation. Both classes of compounds inhibit formation of actin filament comet tails by Listeria and podosomes by monocytes. Two inhibitors with different mechanisms of action provide a powerful approach for studying the Arp2/3 complex in living cells.

The 'j' terms are -624*j and -693*j, so we will add them together: -624*j + (-693)*j = (-624 - 693)*j = -1317*j The constant terms are -358, -99, and +3091: -358 - 99 + 3091 = 2634 Now, our simplified equation is: -1317*j + 2634 = 0 Step 2: Solve for 'j' Now we need to isolate 'j' on one side of the equation. To do this, we will move the constant term, 2634, to the other side of the equation by subtracting 2634 from both sides: -1317*j + 2634 - 2634 = 0 - 2634 -1317*j = -2634 Now we can solve for 'j' by dividing both sides by -1317: j = -2634 / -1317 Now, we will divide the numbers: j ≈ 2 So the solution for 'j' is approximately 2."},{"prompt":"Q:Given the following passage \\"Corruption facilitates environmental destruction.

Zappa sued Cohen for skimming more than he was allocated from DiscReet Records, as well as for signing acts of which Zappa did not approve. Cohen filed a lawsuit against Zappa in return, which froze the money Zappa and Cohen had gained from an out-of-court settlement with MGM over the rights of the early Mothers of Invention recordings. It also prevented Zappa having access to any of his previously recorded material during the trials. Zappa therefore took his personal master copies of the rock-oriented Zoot Allures (1976) directly to Warner Bros., thereby bypassing DiscReet.In the mid-1970s Zappa prepared material for Läther (pronounced \\"leather\\"), a four-LP project. Läther encapsulated all the aspects of Zappa's musical styles—rock tunes, orchestral works, complex instrumentals, and Zappa's own trademark distortion-drenched guitar solos. Wary of a quadruple-LP, Warner Bros. Records refused to release it. Zappa managed to get an agreement with Phonogram Inc., and test pressings were made targeted at a Halloween 1977 release, but Warner Bros. prevented the release by claiming rights over the material. Zappa responded by appearing on the Pasadena, California radio station KROQ, allowing them to broadcast Läther and encouraging listeners to make their own tape recordings. A lawsuit between Zappa and Warner Bros. followed, during which no Zappa material was released for more than a year. Eventually, Warner Bros. issued different versions of much of the Läther material in 1978 and 1979 as four individual albums (five full-length LPs) with limited promotion.Although Zappa eventually gained the rights to all his material created under the MGM and Warner Bros. contracts, the various lawsuits meant that for a period Zappa's only income came from touring, which he therefore did extensively in 1975–77 with relatively small, mainly rock-oriented, bands. Drummer Terry Bozzio became a regular band member, Napoleon Murphy Brock stayed on for a while, and... Guess a valid title for it!

Answer the above question based on the context below: On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded. They cuddle, and their bodies form a heart-shaped silhouette on the horizon.","completion":"In the given context, Peter, the male penguin, saves Polly, the female penguin, from a shark.

Based on the sentence \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street, while looking at the camera.\\", is the sentence \\"The man chipped his toot on the soda bottle.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The sentences \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street while looking at the camera.\\" and \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle.\\" seem unrelated, and it's impossible to determine the truth of one based on the other. Let's analyze each sentence individually to see why it's not possible to answer the question. Sentence 1: \\"A woman, with a drink in hand, is leaning against a silver car parked along the street while looking at the camera.\\" The first sentence describes a visual scene in which a woman is interacting with a parked car and a drink. The elements mentioned are: - A woman - A drink in the woman's hand - A silver car parked along the street - The woman leaning against the car - The woman is looking at the camera. Sentence 2: \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle.\\" The second sentence describes an unfortunate situation wherein a man suffers damage to his tooth due to a mishap with a soda bottle. The elements mentioned in this sentence are: - A man - A soda bottle - The man's tooth - The man's tooth getting chipped Now, let's look at the connections, if any, between sentences 1 and 2: There is no connection between the woman and the man, as they are different people or subjects. Additionally, the car, which is an essential part of sentence 1, does not appear in sentence 2. Likewise, the man's tooth and the soda bottle, which are the primary components of sentence 2, are not present in sentence 1. Although there is a drink mentioned in the first sentence, it's important to note that it is held by the woman. Furthermore, the specifics of the drink — whether or not it's from a soda bottle — are not disclosed. Therefore, the drink could be unrelated to the man's unfortunate incident. In conclusion, the truth of the second sentence, \\"The man chipped his tooth on the soda bottle,\\" cannot be determined based on the first sentence. Both sentences present distinct scenarios and subjects, with no evidence supporting the veracity or falsehood of either statement based on the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The post provided is in Bengali, so I'll translate it first. Translation: \\"If you try to blaspheme with the scholars of this country by blocking the assembly in a country of 90% Muslims, your own idols will be destroyed.\\" Now, to classify this post: 1. If the post is expressing hate or encouraging violence based on religion - it will be classified as 'religious'. 2. If the post is not based on religion, but on any of the other protected characteristics such as race, sex, sexual orientation, and it does not pertain to any political context or dimension specifically, it will be classified as 'non-political religious'. Here the post refers to the possible consequences of blocking religious assemblies in a predominantly Muslim country and usages religious terms such as \\"blaspheme\\" and \\"idols\\". This indicates that the hate speech is indeed based on religion. Therefore, this hateful post will be classified as 'religious'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: On an ocean liner sailing from the Orient to San Francisco, Mei Lei Ming gives fellow passenger Nita Kenton a reading. When Nita's boyfriend, importer Phillip Corey, scoffs at her predictions, she informs him that he himself will die within 48 hours. Corey is later found dead in his San Francisco shop, an apparent suicide. Police Inspector Jim C. Gregg is certain it is a homicide and has Sergeant Kelly bring Mei Lei in for questioning. She convinces him she is innocent and, after demonstrating her astrological powers by telling both skeptical policemen about themselves based solely on their birth dates, proceeds to help them solve the case and two subsequent, related killings. Police forensic scientist Dr. Merton, however, remains firmly scornful of Mei Lei's unscientific methods. When Corey's Chinese business partner Frederick Gow shows up at the police station, he recognizes Juggler Barrows (an uncredited Sidney Bracey), who has been brought in for questioning about an unrelated crime. He pretends to cough and uses a handkerchief to conceal his face from Barrows as he enters Gregg's office. There, he announces that he wants to recover certain business letters from Corey's safe. Mei Lei becomes suspicious. When the letters Gow wanted are later examined, Mei Lei discovers a coded message that indicates Corey and Gow were involved in drug smuggling.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Toby Harnden. UPDATED:. 16:49 EST, 7 March 2012. A confident Mitt Romney has said he feels 'pretty darn good' about his six wins on Super Tuesday, dismissing the narrowness of his Ohio victory over Rick Santorum by insisting he would be the Republican nominee. Appearing on CNBC the morning after he increased his delegate lead and won states from Alaska to Massachusetts with Idaho, Ohio, Virginia and Vermont in between he said he was 'getting the kind of support across the party that I need to become the nominee'. Santorum won North Dakota, Oklahoma and Tennessee while Newt Gingrich claimed his home state of Georgia but the Romney campaign said that it was a virtual impossibility either could win. On the way: Mitt Romney, who claimed at least 212 delegates on Super Tuesday, believes that he is well on his way to becoming the Republican nominee for president. 'All we have to do is keep doing what. we're doing and we can get to the nomination,' a senior Romney adviser. said. 'Those guys, it's going to take some sort of act of God to get. where they need to be to win the nomination.' As if to confirm that President Barack. Obama believes Romney will be his opponent in November, the Obama. campaign held a press conference call slamming the former Massachusetts. governor. David Axelrod, Obama's top strategist. said that Romney 'grinds out tactical victories in a kind of death. march' and added: 'We tried to appeal to the best of people, and they. appear to be trying to appeal to the worst in people' Though critics argue that he is having. trouble 'sealing the deal' with voters, Romney advisers argue that the. rules for apportionment of delegates make it certain that he will be the. nominee. Romney said: “We will come together. because Barack Obama has organised a conservative community…the. community organiser has organised us in a big way. 'When we have a nominee we will come together because Barack Obama has organized the conservative community. 'We're going to come together because we really believe that he needs to be replaced.' As well as winning more states and. securing more votes, Romney also amassed a clear majority of the more. than 400 delegates at stake. But proportional Republican rules meant he. was several hundred away from the 1,144 needed for the GOP nomination. In the bag? Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his wife Ann greet supporters as they arrive at their Super Tuesday primary rally in Boston tonight. He now leads the field with 415 delegates with Santorum on 176, Gingrich on 105 and Ron Paul on 47. Romney's His wafer-thin margin of. victory in Ohio underlined doubts about his candidacy and his ability to. connect with low-income voters. Santorum's wins in North Dakota,. Oklahoma and Tennessee gave his shoestring campaign a boost but his poor. campaign organisation was revealed in his failure to secure more. delegates. Kansas is set to vote on Saturday. followed by two Southern states Alabama and Mississippi, where. evangelicals are suspicious of Romney because of his Mormon faith. Santorum is expected to do well in all three contests. Gingrich's win in Georgia was a lone. bright spot in a dismal night for him. He vowed to continue but will. face pressure to drop out so that Santorum can consolidate the. conservative anti-Romney vote, especially if victory eludes him in. Alabama and Mississippi. He told supporters in Georgia: 'There. are lots of bunny rabbits to run through, I am the tortoise. I just take. one step at a time.' Ron Paul, the libertarian Texas. congressman whose uncompromising anti-war stances have meant he never. had a realistic chance of the nomination, failed to win a single state. He is likely to stay in the race for the long haul but is not viewed as a. threat by Romney. The results underlined Romney's. continued inability to win over large swathes of the Republican base,. who view his past as a moderate Massachusetts governor with suspicion. Fighting spirit: Rick Santorum rallied his supporters on Super Tuesday at the Steubenville High School in Ohio - before he lost the state to Mitt Romney. Early success: Newt Gingrich makes his victory speech in Atlanta with wife Callista after he won the state of Georgia. Confident: Rick Santorum kisses his wife after he won in Tennessee and Oklahoma on Super Tuesday. Speaking to supporters in Boston, Romney acknowledged that he had not landed a knockout blow. He said: 'Tonight, we are counting up. the delegates for the convention – and counting down the days until. November. We're going to take your vote and our victory all the way to. the White House.' Romney and his allies spent almost. four times the money on campaigning in Ohio compared to Santorum, with. much of that on negative advertising. Santorum waited until Oklahoma and Tennessee fell into his column before speaking to cheering supporters in Ohio. Santorum told supporters in. Steubenville, Ohio: 'We're going to get at least a couple of gold medals. and a whole passel full of silver medals. 'We've won in the West, the Midwest, in the South and we're going to win across this country.' Romney is worth more than 200 million and has at times struggled to connect with ordinary people. But he honed his message in Ohio,. saying that the 2012 election centred around 'whether the stresses on. families are going to be alleviated, where you've got a mom working the. day shift and a dad working a night shift and the kids not sure who's. home when'. He unveiled a new slogan of 'more jobs, less debt, smaller government' that was as much aimed at Obama as his Republican rivals. Party elders fear that a prolonged race would leave Romney damaged against Obama in the general election. In Ohio, Santorum charged: 'The. underlying problem that I hear when I talk to people all over, they say. they just don't trust Mitt Romney to not do what's the fashionable thing. at the moment.' State Gingrich Paul Romney Santorum reporting. North Dakota 8.5% 28.1% 23.7% 39.7% 100%. Oklahoma 27.5% 9.6% 28.0% 33.8% 100%. Virginia - 40.5% 59.5% - 100%. Ohio 14.6% 9.3% 38.0% 37.0% 99%. Massachusetts 4.6% 9.6% 72.1% 12.1% 98%. Georgia 47.4% 6.5% 25.7% 19.6% 97%. Vermont 8.1% 25.5% 39.8% 23.7% 93%. Idaho 2.1% 17.9% 63.7% 16.2% 91%. Alaska 19.9% 25.4% 31.7% 22.6% 13%.

Recently suspected of being a traitor due to his love affair with American ecologist Catherine Foley, Alexei is patriotic and is unaware that Catherine is not who she claims and is working with London-based arms dealer Dick Murdoch.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Whether you and your husband live together but rarely see each other, or you have a long distance marriage, it's important to talk about how you plan to make this arrangement work for you. Good communication is key to keeping your romance alive, even when you are physically apart. The conversation should be ongoing. Check in regularly with your husband to make sure the arrangement is still working for both of you. Don't be afraid to share your feelings if you feel that something needs to change. Consider making a list of the benefits of the separation. When things get hard or you start arguing about how little you see each other, you can consult the list to help remind you about why you chose the arrangement in the first place. Your husband will miss you tons if he's always finding little reminders of you while you are apart. Before your next separation, consider hiding little treasures for him to discover. They can be anything from notes to photos of the two of you or other tokens of your affection. If your husband is going away, you can leave him love notes in his suitcase or in the pockets of his clothing. Try to put them in places where he will discover them at different times. If you are leaving home, hide things around the house for him to find. They can be notes or small mementos of your affection, like his favorite chocolate. Phone conversations tend to be centered around recounting daily activities. While this is fine, it's not the kind of conversation that will make your husband miss you. Instead, try to think of the kinds of conversations you have in person, and recreate these over the phone. Share something personal about yourself during each phone call. For example, you might tell your husband about something interesting you noticed today or about an activity you would like to try. You can also remind your husband of all of the things you love about him. For example, you might tell him that he's an excellent cuddler or that you love his laugh. While you may need to talk about household things, like bills or maintenance, be sure that they do no dominate the conversation. Balance them out by also talking about enjoyable topics. For example, you could tell your husband about a great movie that you saw, or you could discuss plans for a trip you plan to take together. Instead of just talking on the phone and telling each other about your days, find ways to participate in activities together. This will help remind your husband of how enjoyable it is to be with you, even if you won't get the opportunity to see each other in person for a long time. For example, you could play an online game together, watch the same movie while talking to each other, or even bring each other to important events via video conference. If you get the chance to see your husband periodically, make that time count. You may choose to do activities together or just relax together, but no matter what you do, make sure that you both enjoy the time you have together. It's easy to get into a rut when it comes to long-distance communication. For example, if you write your husband a letter every week or speak to him on the phone every evening, it can easily become routine. Keep your husband on his toes and looking forward to your next communication by doing something a little different every once in a while. For example, you might send your husband videos or silly cards at times. Alternatively, you might recite a poem that you wrote for him the next time you speak on the phone. Try to be a little unpredictable! When you talk to your husband, try not to say anything that will make him feel bad about being apart. You want to make him miss you, and complaining about the burden he has left you with by leaving will do just the opposite. Instead of complaining, try offering him some sweet compliments. For example, you might let him know that something he fixed before he left is working very well. This will make him realize how much you appreciate him, which will intensify his feelings for you. If you are the one who is away from home, you could let him know that a joke he told you made you smile all day. If you want your husband to miss you while you are apart, it is vital that the time you spend together is as enjoyable as possible. Let him know that you value your time together, and he will too. Avoid bombarding him with a to-do list if he is coming home from a long trip. Instead, take a few days to spend quality time together doing things you both enjoy. If your husband is coming home from a military deployment, consider throwing him a welcome home party or meeting him at the airport with a welcome home banner.","completion":"This article talks about keeping romance alive in a long-distance marriage by having good communication, hiding little surprises for each other, sharing personal stories over the phone, participating in activities together, making the most of the time spent together, and offering sweet compliments instead of complaining about the distance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person that helps the park ranger find the naturalist in an animal skin? from the following article ? The film opens with military veteran helicopter pilot and guide Don Stober flying individuals above the trees of a vast national park. He states that the woods are untouched and remain much as they did during the time when Native Americans lived there. Two female hikers are breaking camp when they are suddenly attacked and killed by an unseen animal. The national park's chief ranger, Michael Kelly, and photographer Allison Corwin, daughter of the park's restaurant owner, decide to follow a ranger to the primitive campsite to check on the female hikers. There, they discover the mangled corpses of the two girls, one of which has been partially buried. At the hospital, a doctor tells Kelly that the girls were killed by a bear. The park supervisor, Charley Kittridge, blames Kelly for the attacks, saying that the bears were supposed to have been moved from the park by Kelly and naturalist Arthur Scott before the tourist season began. Kelly and Kittridge argue over closing the park, before deciding to move all hikers off the park's mountain while allowing campers to remain in the lowlands. Kelly calls Scott, who tells him that all of the bears are accounted for and this specific bear must be unknown to the forest. During a search of the mountain, a female ranger stops for a break at a waterfall. Deciding to soak her feet, she is unaware that the bear is lurking under the falls, and she is attacked and killed. Kelly recruits the helicopter pilot, Stober, to assist in the search. Flying above the forest, they see what they believe to be an animal, only to discover the naturalist Scott adorned in an animal skin while tracking the bear. He informs them that the animal they are looking for is a prehistoric grizzly bear (a fictional Pleistocene-era Arctodus ursos horribilis) standing at least 15 feet tall and weighing 2,000 pounds.

The former — and possibly future — presidential candidate will launch a website called the Huckabee Post, according to multiple reports. Mediaite found a Craigslist post listing openings for reporters at the new venture, touting it as \\"a new and exciting online news publication covering news on politics, U.S., international, media, sports and other general news.\\" Huckabee served as governor of Arkansas from 1996 to 2007 and briefly led the race for the Republican nomination during the 2008 presidential election before John McCain secured the nomination. His campaign featured one of the more tongue-in-cheek advertisements: an endorsement from Chuck Norris. Huckabee has also recently indicated that he is considering another run for the presidency in 2016. Conservative personalities have found success leveraging their personal popularity into media brands, most notably with subscription service. Glenn Beck started TheBlaze in 2011 and Andrew Sullivan launched The Dish earlier this year.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"Lysias Anicetus, also known as the \\"Invincible,\\" was an Indo-Greek king who reigned between 130 and 120 BCE. His rule marks an important period in the history of the Indo-Greek kingdom, as he continued to expand the territories under his control and fostered a flourishing cultural exchange that still echoes through the ages. Lysias Anicetus' name, derived from the Greek words for \\"liberator\\" and \\"invincible,\\" suggests his reign was marked by a strong sense of martial prowess and an unwavering belief in his divine right to rule. He inherited the throne at a time when the Indo-Greek kingdom was already well-established, with the Greek influence having permeated deep into the cultural fabric of the region. One of the most notable aspects of Lysias Anicetus' rule was his impressive coinage. A well-preserved example of one of his coins - dated to approximately 120 to 110 BCE - showcases the king's image and offers valuable insights into the artistic achievements of his time. It displays the king's portrait, draped in royal attire and wearing a distinct diadem, a symbol of his power and authority. The coin also features the legend \\"BASILEOS ANIKETOU LYSIOU,\\" which translates to \\"Of the Invincible King Lysias\\" - a clear testament to his self-image as a fearless ruler. During his reign, Lysias Anicetus focused on expanding the kingdom's borders and securing the territories already under his control. He led a series of successful military campaigns against neighboring kingdoms and tribal chieftains, which reinforced his image as a powerful, victorious ruler. Consequently, the Indo-Greek kingdom enjoyed a period of relative stability and prosperity. Lysias Anicetus' reign was also marked by a vibrant cultural exchange between the Greek and Indian civilizations. The artistic styles of the time fused Hellenistic and Indian elements, creating a unique aesthetic that celebrated the best of both worlds. This cultural fusion is best evidenced in the realm of art and architecture, with the creation of numerous Buddhist and Hindu temples and monuments exhibiting intricate Greek-inspired designs. In the religious sphere, Lysias Anicetus is said to have supported both Buddhism and Hinduism, demonstrating his tolerance and openness to diverse beliefs and practices. The Indo-Greek kingdom became a melting pot of ideas and philosophies, with the blending of these ancient traditions potentially shaping the development of later forms of Buddhism, such as Mahayana Buddhism. In conclusion, Lysias Anicetus, the \\"Invincible\\" Indo-Greek king, was a dynamic figure who played a significant role in the expansion and cultural blossoming of the Indo-Greek kingdom. His reign, marked by military successes and thriving artistic endeavors, left an indelible mark on the legacy of the Indo-Greek kingdom and its enduring links with Hellenistic and Indian civilizations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Apple trees can grow in a wide range of locations, as long as they have favorable conditions such as the right soil, temperature, and sunlight. - Park: A park is a public space or area, and while an apple tree can be planted and grow in a park, it is not a requirement for the tree's growth. - Paradise: This word refers to an ideal or perfect place, and is not a tangible requirement for an apple tree to grow.

Much research has focused on the issues of discontinuity versus continuity with the previous Tokugawa Period. In the 1960s younger Japanese scholars led by Irokawa Daikichi, reacted against the bureaucratic superstate, and began searching for the historic role of the common people . They avoided the elite, and focused not on political events but on social forces and attitudes. They rejected both Marxism and modernization theory as alien and confining. They stressed the importance of popular energies in the development of modern Japan. They enlarged history by using the methods of social history. It was not until the beginning of the Meiji Era that the Japanese government began taking modernization seriously.

Answer:","completion":"Given that Taylor has spilled coffee on Ash's shirt and offered to pay for it, it's necessary to consider various factors and potential courses of action in order to determine what Ash might want to do next. Here's a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Assess the situation Ash would likely assess the situation by evaluating the extent of the coffee spill and any potential damage to their shirt. They would also consider Taylor's gesture of offering to pay for any damages caused due to the incident. Step 2: Respond to Taylor's offer Depending on how much they value the shirt and their relationship with Taylor, Ash might accept, decline, or suggest an alternative to Taylor's offer. If the shirt holds sentimental value or is expensive, they might be inclined to accept the offer. On the other hand, if they're close friends with Taylor or believe the shirt isn't worth much, they might decline the offer. Step 3: Clean up Ash would likely want to clean up the coffee spill as soon as possible to minimize the stain on their shirt. They could use napkins or water to gently dab at the stain, or visit a restroom to clean it more thoroughly if the situation allows. Step 4: Decide on a course of action Following the immediate response and clean-up, Ash might want to consider their next steps based on the specific context of the incident. Some possible options include: - If the shirt is ruined and Ash has accepted Taylor's offer, they could arrange a time to shop for a replacement together or discuss reimbursement for a new shirt. - If Ash declined Taylor's offer, they may want to clean the shirt thoroughly when they get home and possibly purchase a new one on their own. - If the shirt isn't badly damaged and Ash is not overly concerned, they might choose to let it go and move on from the incident. Overall, Ash's immediate next step would likely be responding to Taylor's offer and cleaning up the coffee spill as best as possible. From there, their subsequent actions would depend on the specifics of their relationship with Taylor and the value they place on the damaged shirt."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Abortion is legal in Mexico in cases of rape. But Regina Tames, director of the Group for Information on Reproductive Choice, said officials in Sonora state are relying on a judge’s decision to classify the assault on the girl as a crime in which consent was obtained through deception or seduction, reasoning it falls short of rape. “She has the right as the victim of sexual aggression to end the pregnancy,” Tames said. “The classification of the crime doesn’t matter.” The attack occurred in May, but the group did not become aware of it last week, Tames said. The family reported the assault to state investigators the same day it occurred. The girl was not offered emergency contraception upon reporting the rape, Tames said. A representative in the communications department for the Sonora state health agency said officials were meeting about the case and would comment later. Tames said the family was considering bringing the girl to Mexico City for an abortion where it is legal up to 12 weeks. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

The teenager immediately reported her abuser to the police after an attack she described as rape and a medical report showed physical evidence which corroborated her allegations. But the case judge in the state of Sonora instead accused the alleged rapist of “illegal sex with a minor” as he ruled that the man had gained the girl's consent by deception. The state health service has refused to allow the girl, named by local media as Citlali, to terminate the foetus - despite rape-related pregnancies being exempt from a ban on abortions Women’s rights organisations are demanding that hospital authorities reverse their decision, arguing that the judge’s interpretation of the crime does not change the fact that Citlali was sexually assaulted and became pregnant as a result. “This is important in terms of the criminal investigation, but should not affect access to legal termination,” said Regina Tamés, president of GIRE, an organisation which defends the right of women to access legal abortion and contraceptive methods. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A 13-year-old girl in northern Mexico, who became pregnant after being raped by a family acquaintance, has been denied her legal right to an abortion.

So I ignored all the bad reviews and bought 4 of these anyway. Big mistake. Only 1 actually works. The other 3 simply leak air. Give it 4 hrs and the \\"vacuum\\" bag balloons to its original size. Sad. I know you're thinking, \\"Nah, I'm gonna get this anyway\\" -- ok, do it but you've been warned. Answer: The answer to this question is:","completion":"There is a predominantly negative tone to this product review. The review starts with a positive sentiment, referring to the product as a \\"good idea.\\" However, this positive sentiment is immediately followed by the critic's expression of dissatisfaction, stating that the product \\"simply doesn't work.\\" From this point forward, the review carries a mostly negative tone, which is further supported by the specific issues highlighted by the reviewer. The reviewer mentions that they disregarded negative reviews and purchased four of these products, but ended up regretting their decision. They emphasize that out of the four purchased, only one worked as intended, and the other three did not maintain their vacuum seal. By using the word \\"sad,\\" the reviewer further implies frustration and disappointment. Additionally, the review ends with a warning to potential buyers who may be thinking of purchasing the product despite its negative feedback: \\"ok, do it but you've been warned.\\" This statement reinforces the negative tone of the review, as the reviewer explicitly cautions others against repeating the same mistake they made. In summary, while the review begins with a slightly positive tone acknowledging the good idea behind the product, the overall tone quickly shifts to negative due to the significant drawbacks and shortcomings discussed by the reviewer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He learns from police detective Nick Ruskin that Naomi is the latest in a series of young women who have vanished. Soon after his arrival, one of the missing women is found dead, bound to a tree, and a short time later, Kate McTiernan is kidnapped from her home. When she awakens from a drugged state, Kate discovers that she is being held by a masked man calling himself Casanova, and she is one of several prisoners trapped in his lair. She manages to escape and is severely injured when she jumps from a cliff into a river. After she recuperates, she joins forces with Cross to track down her captor, whom Cross concludes is a collector, not a killer, unless his victims fail to follow his rules. This means there is time to rescue the other imprisoned women, as long as they remain obedient. Clues lead them to Los Angeles, where a series of gruesome kidnappings and murders have been credited to Dr. William Rudolph, known as the Gentleman Caller. Cross's efforts to capture and question Rudolph are foiled when Rudolph escapes. In North Carolina, Cross traces Casanova up the river.

Both teams began the game with lengthy drives that ended in field goals, consuming nearly the first twenty minutes of the game. Neither team could generate much offense after that. An interception from Bills quarterback Trent Edwards and a fumble on a trick play by the Jets' Leon Washington ended the only serious attempts either team made at scoring in the second quarter. Edwards sprained his right wrist in the third quarter and was replaced by his backup, former starter J. P. Losman. Losman led Buffalo downfield early in the fourth quarter, and the Bills took a 6-3 lead on a 40-yard field goal by Rian Lindell. On the Bills' next possession, Losman threw downfield from his own 15-yard line, and found Lee Evans, who, after wrestling the ball away from Darrelle Revis, ran untouched for 43&#160;yards into the end zone to give the Bills a 13-3 lead. Revis appeared to have a chance to intercept the ball, but Jets' safety Abram Elam ran into Revis, allowing Evans to claim the ball. After the touchdown, and with 3:38 left to play, Jets quarterback Chad Pennington was replaced by backup Kellen Clemens. Clemens twice attempted to drive the Jets for a score, but both drives ended in interceptions, including one on a Hail Mary that ended the game.

Q:Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: Job offer many years ago. I had two, one for staff accountant and the other was as accounting manager for a holistic health clinic. The clinic job paid about 40% more and came with a “manager” title. I believed in myself and all that, but who offers someone just out of school with only 2 years of internship and no specialty in field manager level? That kept bugging me. Something just wasn’t right. Acting on instinct, I took the other job. Good thing! A few months later, I read that the owner of the clinic (an MD) and his two partners (his wife and the CFO) had all been indicted for numerous counts of fraud. They were cheating the state, they were cheating the church they were affiliated with, they were cheating Medicare and private insurance companies. The IRS was after them — it was supposed to be not-for-profit but it turns out they were living large. Not only that, but they hadn’t been sending in w/h tax for non-church member paid employees. Then there was the allegation that they were abusing mentally handicapped workers who were related to church members. The church itself tried to distance themselves, but three elders were also on the clinic’s Board of Directors. It was nasty and the entire management team ended up with at least some jail time. There was no way anyone who had any access to the records (medical or financial) could have claimed innocence. My job would have included filing false budget and financial statements with the Board, IRS and other agencies. I would have also probably known that they were withholding but not remitting tax from employee checks. Fact is, the poor kid who took the job got 2 years, so I found out. Those in on the medical fraud got even worse and the three principals all got 2-digit sentences.

Context: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat. Get up, stand up, the radio cried out, and that was what Manny hoped would happen. He hoped that she would at least just stir and be okay. But she just lay there. Question: What was the weather like?

Given the question: It’s October, which means it’s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns. Here’s what I’ll cover: * The basics of influenza and vaccination against the flu * What to know about flu shots for older adults * What’s new and resources for the 2017-2018 flu...

Article: Warning: reading too much Cinderella to your daughter may damage her emotional health in later life. A paper to be developed at the international congress of cognitive psychotherapy in Gothenburg suggests a link between the attitudes of women abused by their parents and early exposure to the wrong sort of fairy tales. It says girls who identified with Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast were more likely to stay in destructive relationships as adults. The theory was developed by Susan Darker Smith, a psychotherapist at the University of Derby. She interviewed 67 female abuse survivors and found that 61 put up with severe abuse because they believed they could change their partners with patience, composition and love. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. Hardly any of the women in a control group, who had not experienced abuse, thought they could change their partners in this way. The same view was taken by male survivors who had been abused as children. These women and men said they would leave a relationship rather than put up with abuse from a partner. Ms Darker Smith found the abused women were much more likely to identify with Cinderella and other _ female characters in fairytales, who were later rescued by a stranger prince or hero. Although most girls heard the stories, damage appeared to be done to those who adopted the characters as role models. \\"They believe if their love is strong enough they can change their parents' behaviors,\\" she said.\\" Overexposure in children to stories that emphasize the transformational qualities of love may make women believe they can change their partners.\\" For example, they might never have understood the obvious flaw in the story of Rapunzel, who remained locked in a high tower until rescued by a knight on a white horse, who broke the door down. \\"The question,\\" said Ms Darker Smith, \\"is why she did not break the door down herself.\\" Question: Cinderella, Rapunzel and Beauty in Beauty and the Beast are similar in that _ .

Befitting a lush, tropical island stranded in the middle of the ocean, Madeira's origins are shrouded in mystery and fanciful legend. Some claim that the archipelago is what remains of Plato's lost Atlantis, or part of a landmass that once fused the continents of Europe and America. The Portuguese Step Ashore: Recorded history of the volcanic archipelago begins in relatively recent times: 1418, just as the golden age of Portuguese discovery was erupting. Under the leadership of Henry the Navigator, caravels set out from the westernmost point of the Algarve, in southern Portugal, in search of foreign lands, fame, and wealth. João Gonçalves Zarco, sailing in the service of Prince Henry, made the first of many famous Portuguese discoveries, which would culminate a century later in Magellan's historic circumnavigation of the globe. Zarco happened upon a small volcanic archipelago 1,000 km from Lisbon. Perhaps Zarco knew precisely where he was heading, having learned of the existence of Madeira from a Castilian source. After all, the waters of the Canary Islands, only 445 km (275 miles) to the south, had occupied busy shipping lanes for very nearly a century, and Genovese maps from the mid-14th century depict both Madeira and Porto Santo. More likely, Zarco was heading for Guinea and storms forced him onto the beach of Porto Santo. If so, then he was extremely fortunate, for he managed to land on the only large, sandy beach for hundreds of miles around. Little wonder he subsequently named it Porto Santo (Holy Port). The following year Zarco returned to claim the larger island he had seen from Porto Santo, and with him went Tristão Vaz Teixeira and Bartolomeu Perestrelo. They officially became the first men to set foot on the heavily forested island, naming it Ilha da Madeira, \\"Island of Timber. \\" The Portuguese Crown, delighted with its first important discovery, immediately embarked on a program of colonization. Zarco and Teixeira were appointed co-go­vern­ors of Madeira, while Perestrelo was awarded Porto Santo. Question: \\"Why might a Castillian source have known about the existence of Madeira around the time Zarco was exploring?\\" Response: \\"Castillians were the first to explore Maderia\\" Select from the following. (A). no (B). yes Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"(A). no The response doesn't correctly answer the question.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Process: - Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather - Animals gain weight - The season changes to one with bad (cold, snowy) weather - Animals find a place to hibernate - Animals enter a type of &#x27;sleep&#x27; (hibernation) - Body processes slow down - The animal&#x27;s heart rate and breathing rate slow - The animal loses weight more slowly than usual - The animal is able to survive not eating or drinking without hurting itself - suppose less stormy weather occurs happens, how will it affect more food available. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The perturbation in this scenario, where less stormy weather occurs and more food becomes available, can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process. Here's a detailed explanation: This scenario introduces a change in the weather conditions, specifically, less stormy weather. Storms can substantially impact the availability of food resources for animals, affecting either quantitative or qualitative aspects of their diet. With lesser storms, more food becomes available, allowing the animals to have easier access to resources and potentially affecting their feeding habits. In the given process, the step that would be influenced by this change would be the first step: \\"Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather.\\" With less stormy weather, the availability of food increases, potentially allowing animals to consume a higher quantity of food than they would under normal circumstances, in turn affecting their weight gain. This perturbation does not directly impact other steps within the process; however, the increased food availability could have secondary effects on the animal's behavior, well-being, and overall physiology. For example, if an animal manages to store more energy due to increased food intake, it might be able to cope better with the changes caused by the unfavorable weather conditions and may not need to hibernate as early or as long. Moreover, with increased food availability, animals might gain weight more rapidly than usual, leading to a shift in the usual timeline of events. In turn, this might affect the subsequent steps of the process, like hibernation and the rate of weight loss while in hibernation. Therefore, we can conclude that the supposed perturbation in this scenario is indirectly impacting a step of the process, as the changes in weather conditions and food availability introduced in the question are not targeting a specific step in the process but rather, are modifying the environment in which the process takes place. The alteration in such environmental factors can set off a ripple effect, consequently influencing the different steps in the process in an indirect manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Recording sessions began in New York in October 1965 with numerous backing musicians, including members of Dylan's live backing band, the Hawks. Though sessions continued until January 1966, they yielded only one track that made it onto the final album—\\"One of Us Must Know (Sooner or Later)\\". At producer Bob Johnston's suggestion, Dylan, keyboardist Al Kooper, and guitarist Robbie Robertson moved to the CBS studios in Nashville, Tennessee. These sessions, augmented by some of Nashville's top session musicians, were more fruitful, and in February and March all the remaining songs for the album were recorded. Blonde on Blonde completed the trilogy of rock albums that Dylan recorded in 1965 and 1966, starting with Bringing It All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited. Critics often rank Blonde on Blonde as one of the greatest albums of all time. Combining the expertise of Nashville session musicians with a modernist literary sensibility, the album's songs have been described as operating on a grand scale musically, while featuring lyrics one critic called \\"a unique mixture of the visionary and the colloquial\\". It was one of the first double albums in rock music. The album peaked at number nine on the Billboard 200 chart in the US, where it eventually was certified double platinum, and it reached number three in the UK. Blonde on Blonde spawned two singles that were top-twenty hits in the US: \\"Rainy Day Women #12 & 35\\" and \\"I Want You\\".

Connie Talbot entered the public eye appearing, aged six, on the first series of the reality programme Britain's Got Talent, reaching the final. After briefly recording with Sony BMG, Talbot was signed to Rainbow Recording Company, an offshoot of the label Rhythm Riders made specifically for her. To produce Over the Rainbow, Talbot worked with John Arnison, then-manager to Gabrielle and Billy Ocean, and Marc Marot, a former managing director of Island Records. It was produced and mixed by Simon Hill and Rob May. A recording schedule was worked out so that Talbot could continue with her normal school activities while recording the album in her aunt Vicky's spare bedroom, which her mother described as \\"a better solution\\" than the one offered by Sony BMG, \\"which has not robbed her of her childhood\\". Talbot said that \\"it was just amazing that we could do it in my auntie's house\\". Arnison and Marot asked the Talbot family to \\"write down a list of the songs that Connie would sing at her birthday party\\" to help choose the track listing, and then \\"thought long and hard\\" about including more adult songs on the album. Talbot herself insisted that they should.The final version of Over the Rainbow was recorded at Olympic Studios, on 12 October 2007. Arnison described the recording process by saying that Talbot \\"hadn't sung nursery rhymes; she'd always sung classic tracks. So it was actually quite an easy task to make the record\\". The album was released on 26 November 2007, with an initial pressing of 50,000 copies.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"(ii). yes. While both questions discuss the topic of the human buttocks, the nature of the questions differ significantly in focus and context. Question 1: \\"How was the famous 'Ass To Ass' scene filmed?\\" The famous \\"Ass to Ass\\" scene is a controversial part of the movie \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" directed by Darren Aronofsky. The filmography and techniques used in this scene aimed to depict the dark realities of drug addiction and the character's downward spiral. To film this scene, Aronofsky and his team would have employed various methods to effectively capture the essence and emotion of the scene. First, the director might have used specific camera angles to create an emotionally engaging point of view. This could have been achieved through the use of close-ups and longer shots to establish a voyeuristic perspective, making the audience feel uneasy and uncomfortable. Next, the lighting would have been designed to create a dark and gritty atmosphere, reflecting the intense emotional turmoil experienced by the characters. Low key lighting and chiaroscuro techniques may have been employed to evoke a sense of despair and gloom. The actors involved in the scene would have undergone rehearsal and preparation to accurately convey the character's emotional journey. This could involve practicing the choreography and studying the script to thoroughly understand the motivations behind each character's actions. Lastly, editing and post-production work would have been essential in refining the scene to achieve the desired impact. The editor would have had the task of intuitively syncing the visual and audio elements to maintain the continuity of the story while amplifying emotions. Sound design and score would have played a significant role in enhancing the scene, adding intensity and heightening the overall emotional impact. Question 2: How do I make my ass bigger? Making the buttocks or \\"ass\\" bigger generally involves a combination of exercise, nutrition adjustments, and lifestyle changes. Here are some methods to achieve a more prominent derriere: 1. Exercise: Incorporate strength training exercises, targeting the glutes, into your workout routine. Some popular glute exercises include squats, lunges, hip thrusts, donkey kicks, and glute bridges. Aim to do these exercises 2-3 times per week, using progressive overload by gradually increasing weights or resistance bands. 2. Nutrition: A healthy diet plays a role in shaping the buttocks. Consume a balanced diet that includes complex carbohydrates, healthy fats, and lean proteins. Eating frequently in smaller portions may help increase your metabolism, ensuring consistent fuel for muscle-building workouts. A dietitian, personal trainer, or nutritionist can help customize a diet plan for your specific needs. 3. Protein: Increase protein in your diet to support muscle growth. Lean sources of protein include chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, beans, and low-fat dairy products. Consider incorporating protein shakes or supplements if you find it challenging to meet your protein requirements through food alone. 4.

Question: \\"Backwoods Gallery\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to? Answer:","completion":"To determine the category to which \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" belongs, I will follow a step-by-step analysis: Step 1: Analyze the title for context clues. \\"Backwoods\\" refers to a remote or rural area, and \\"Gallery\\" is usually associated with a place displaying artworks, such as paintings or sculptures. Step 2: Eliminate unlikely categories based on context clues. Given that \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" suggests a display of artworks in a rural area, I can eliminate several categories that do not fit the context: - Educational institution - Athlete - Office holder - Mean of transportation - Building (could be a possibility, but requires further examination) - Natural place - Village - Animal - Plant - Album - Film - Written work Step 3: Examine the remaining categories and compare them to the context. The remaining categories are: - Company - Artist - Building Step 4: Select the most fitting category based on the context. Out of the remaining categories, \\"Backwoods Gallery\\" seems to fit best as an Artist or Company, since it may refer to a business or a group of artists showcasing their work. However, the term \\"Gallery\\" is more commonly associated with a business that displays artwork rather than individual artists.

Here are possible answers to this question: - mall - kitchen - fairgrounds - neighbor's house - military base I believe the correct choice is \\"fairgrounds\\", here's why: Answer:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"fairgrounds.\\" This is because fairgrounds typically host various events, such as fairs, carnivals, and festivals, where numerous tickets, rides, and games are offered as entertainment. While these attractions generate income, the real money is often made from the sale of food and beverages. Food vendors at fairgrounds usually offer a wide range of irresistible and delicious options, from classic fair treats like cotton candy, funnel cakes, corn dogs, and deep-fried delights to gourmet festival food, artisanal items, and international cuisine. Visitors to these events are often more than willing to spend money on such indulgent treats. Due to the temporary and festive nature of these events, guests usually allocate more of their spending budget toward food and beverages as they enjoy the unique atmosphere and communal experience. Additionally, the captive audience at fairgrounds is more likely to splurge on food items as there are limited options for them to eat during their visit. In summary, the correct answer is \\"fairgrounds\\" because it is a location where tickets, rides, and games are commonly associated with events; however, the main revenue source is from the sale of a diverse range of food and beverages that cater to the large audiences attending these events."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: On April 24th, another natural disaster-the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, happened. Millions of dollars have been used to help stop the spill and to clean up the animals, beaches, and land spoiled by the oil. Unfortunately, when many of these chemicals are used, more damage is caused to the environment, especially to lives in the sea. But governments seem to accept the _ of transporting mil-lions of tons of oil by ship every day so that we can fill up our cars and drive around and cause even more environmental damage. Interestingly, the biggest companies in the world produce cars, and the next biggest supply the gasoline to make them run. Of all of today's environmental disasters, an oil spill may actually be one of the least serious. Although oil is poisonous, it is a natural material. In the end, it breaks down naturally. In 1967 the tanker Torrey Canyon sank off the Scilly Isles near the coast of England and spilled 120,000 tons of oil into the ocean. If you go there today, you will find it hard to see any sign that it ever happened. However, we should be thinking more about reducing our dependency on oil. Governments should be encouraging research into new technologies, such as cars run by solar power, electricity, hydro-gen, and so on. Much of this research, in the past, was stopped by the oil, gas, and coal. If the world's millions of cars were 10% more efficient ,we would need many fewer tankers crossing the oceans each year. If this happened, the risks of oil spills would be reduced, and the air we breathe would be cleaner and fresher, too. Options: A Oil spills pollution. B What oil pollution is. C Oil tanker accidents. D How to reduce oil pollution. Answer: A Oil spills pollution.

Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money.

A:","completion":"The review depicted in the question highlights a negative experience and thus, portrays the product in an unflattering light. The reviewer discusses a specific issue with the product, which is related to the memory card being \\"locked\\" without any option to unlock it. The fact that this particular card lacks a slide to unlock it for formatting and writing, unlike other memory cards that the reviewer has owned, suggests a potential design flaw or manufacturing defect. This issue ultimately affects the usability of the product, causing dissatisfaction for the customer. Furthermore, the notion of the product being \\"locked\\" could indicate that the customer cannot fully utilize it for their intended purpose – in this case, storing photographs taken with an older Nikon DSLR camera. This also contributes to an overall unfavorable view of the product and can deter potential buyers. The reviewer briefly mentions that they do not believe the issue warrants a return due to the low cost of the item. Although this statement does not necessarily denigrate the product, it does little to counterbalance the negative impression established earlier in the review. The fact that the reviewer decides to purchase another card instead of returning the current one suggests that they have lost faith in this particular product and would rather invest in another option. In conclusion, the review described above negatively portrays the product because it details a crucial functional issue that prevents the customer from using it as intended. The lack of resolution and the decision to buy a different card instead of seeking a refund further underscores an overall unflattering depiction of the product.

A metro area usually comprises multiple jurisdictions and municipalities: neighborhoods, townships, boroughs, cities, towns, exurbs, suburbs, counties, districts, states, and even nations like the eurodistricts. As social, economic and political institutions have changed, metropolitan areas have become key economic and political regions. Metropolitan areas include one or more urban areas, as well as satellite cities, towns and intervening rural areas that are socio-economically tied to the urban core, typically measured by commuting patterns. - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways. - The Straits of Florida, Florida Straits, or Florida Strait is a strait located south-southeast of the North American mainland, generally accepted to be between the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Florida Keys (U.S.) and Cuba. It is 150 km (93 mi) wide at the narrowest point between Key West and the Cuban shore, and has been sounded to a depth of 6,000 feet. The strait carries the Florida Current, the beginning of the Gulf Stream, from the Gulf of Mexico. - South Florida is a region of the U.S. state of Florida, comprising the southernmost part of the state. It is one of Florida's three most common \\"directional\\" regions, the others being Central Florida and North Florida.

Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - A lagoon is a shallow body of water separated from a larger body of water by barrier islands or reefs. Lagoons are commonly divided into coastal lagoons and atoll lagoons. They have also been identified as occurring on mixed-sand and gravel coastlines. There is an overlap between bodies of water classified as coastal lagoons and bodies of water classified as estuaries. Lagoons are common coastal features around many parts of the world. - The Gulf of Mexico is an ocean basin largely surrounded by the North American continent. It is bounded on the northeast, north and northwest by the Gulf Coast of the United States, on the southwest and south by Mexico, and on the southeast by Cuba. The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \\"Third Coast\\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \\"south coast\\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \\"north coast.\\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin. - A skyscraper is a tall, continuously habitable building having multiple floors.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: In early 1969, Quaife told the band he was leaving. The other members did not take his statement seriously, until an article appeared in New Musical Express on 4 April featuring Quaife's new band, Maple Oak, which he had formed without telling the rest of the Kinks. Ray Davies pleaded with him to return for the sessions for their upcoming album, but Quaife refused. Davies immediately called up John Dalton, who had filled in for Quaife in the past, as a replacement. Dalton remained with the group until 1977, when the album Sleepwalker was released.Ray Davies travelled to Los Angeles in April 1969 to help negotiate an end to the American Federation of Musicians' ban on the group, opening up an opportunity for them to return to touring in the US. The group's management quickly made plans for a North American tour, to help restore their standing in the US pop music scene. Before their return to the US, the Kinks recorded another album, Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire). As with the previous two albums, Arthur was grounded in characteristically English lyrical and musical hooks. A modest commercial success, it was well received by American music critics. Conceived as the score for a proposed but unrealised television drama, much of the album revolved around themes from the Davies brothers' childhood; their sister Rosie, who had migrated to Australia in the early 1960s with her husband, Arthur Anning, the album's namesake; and life growing up during the Second World War. The Kinks embarked on their tour of the US in October 1969. The tour was generally unsuccessful, as the group struggled to find cooperative promoters and interested audiences; many of the scheduled concert dates were cancelled. The band did, however, manage to play a few major venues such as the Fillmore East and Whisky a Go Go. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person Ray pleaded with to return for the sessions for their upcoming album?

(AP) — Prosecutors in a murder case against Aaron Hernandez won’t be allowed to tell a jury about two other killings with which the ex-New England Patriot is charged or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister, a judge ruled Friday. Hernandez has pleaded not guilty to murder in the June 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating the sister of Hernandez’s fiancee. He has also pleaded not guilty to the fatal shootings of two men in 2012 after an encounter at a Boston nightclub. Prosecutors have said Hernandez may have showed Lloyd the spot where the double shooting allegedly took place, and suggested that was a possible motive for killing Lloyd. But Judge Susan Garsh, after hearing arguments, said that theory is “clearly in the realm of speculation” and “does not comport with common sense.” She said there was no demonstrated link between the two crimes and disallowed the introduction of the 2012 homicides. Garsh also said Friday she would not admit the final text messages sent by Lloyd to his sister, including one sent just minutes before he was shot to death at an industrial park near Hernandez’s North Attleborough home. Prosecutors say Lloyd sent the messages while in a car with Hernandez and suggested they showed he had become fearful. One said “U saw who I’m with” and another indicated the person was “NFL,” referring to Hernandez. Defense lawyers called it “rank speculation” that the texts indicated fear and said they were inadmissible. Garsh said the texts did not suggest any hostility and that prosecutors didn’t meet the burden to prove Lloyd felt he was at an “imminent death.” Jury selection is scheduled to start Jan. 9. Patriots coach Bill Belichick and team owner Robert Kraft have been listed by prosecutors as possible witnesses. Garsh also ruled that prosecutors may not introduce the shooting of Alexander Bradley, a former associate of Hernandez. Bradley has filed a civil suit against Hernandez that says the ex-player shot him in the face in 2013 after an argument in Florida. Massachusetts prosecutors sought to admit a range of evidence related to the ex-player’s other alleged crimes or “bad acts,” including the Boston homicides, firearms found at Hernandez’s home or elsewhere and even a photograph obtained from the celebrity gossip website TMZ that depicts Hernandez holding a gun. His attorneys warned against compromising his right to a fair trial. “It is critical that this trial be about the murder of Odin Lloyd,” defense attorney James Sultan said Friday. The judge allowed in some evidence relating to firearms, but disallowed the photograph.","completion":"A judge ruled on Friday that prosecutors in the murder case against Aaron Hernandez, a former New England Patriot, cannot tell the jury about two other killings he has been charged with or the final text messages the victim sent to his sister.

Our goal is to find out what n could be. So, we will first get all the 'n' parts on one side and the number on the other side. Currently, it looks like this: -27*n = -18*n + 45. Let's add 27*n to both sides. This is just like playing on a seesaw, we have to make sure it stays balanced. Adding 27*n to both sides will make it: 0 = 9*n + 45. Getting better, right? Now, our new goal is to leave 'n' alone on one side of the = sign. So let's subtract 45 from both sides, to help our 'n' be on one side: 0 - 45 = 9*n. This becomes -45 = 9*n. We're nearly there! Now we divide 9 from both sides to get the value of 'n'. Just like you split your gummy bears equally with your friend, we'll do the same here. So -45 divided by 9 will give us the value of 'n'. When we do that division, we get n = -5. And that's our answer! Great job, you did really well! Our mystery 'n' turned out to be -5! So if this was a treasure hunt, we found the treasure.

Provisional squad: Jakupovic, Watson, Davies, Rosenior, Robertson, Chester, Bruce, McShane, Elmohamady, Meyler, Diame, Huddlestone, Livermore, Brady, Aluko, Quinn, Hernandez, Ben Arfa, Aluko. Hull's third-choice keeper Eldin Jakupovic could again start for Hull against Southampton on Saturday. Southampton. Sadio Mane could return to the Southampton squad as Saints look to maintain their impressive run of form at Hull. Mane was rested as a precaution against Stoke in the Capital One Cup on Wednesday night. The midfielder was expected to train on Friday in the hope that he will be included in the squad that travels to East Yorkshire. Saints manager Ronald Koeman, whose team have won six of their last seven Barclays Premier League matches, otherwise has a full squad to select from. Provisional squad: Forster, K Davis, Cropper, Clyne, Fonte, Gardos, Alderweireld, Bertrand, Targett, Schneiderlin, S Davis, Wanyama, Reed, Cork, Tadic, Yoshida, Mane, Long, Mayuka, Pelle, Gallagher. Sadio Mane is set to return to the Southampton squad after missing their midweek Capital One Cup tie. Key match stats (supplied by Opta) Hull City have drawn five of their nine Premier League games this season – they only drew seven in the whole of 2013-14. Southampton have won their last four league games against Hull and lost just one of the last 16 in all comps (W10 D5 L1), incl. a meeting in the Full Members Cup in 1986/87. Southampton have won six of their opening nine games to a top-flight season for the first time in their history. Ronald Koeman’s side have conceded just five league goals this season; fewer than any other team in England’s top four divisions. Four of those five goals have been conceded on the road, with the Saints managing just one clean sheet in four games away from St Mary’s in the PL this term. Hull players look on as Jose Fonte pounces to score in Southampton's 1-0 win at the KC Stadium in February - the Saint's fourth consecutive victory over the Tigers in all competitions. Southampton have won every game that they have scored first in this season in the Premier League (5/5). No-one has dropped more points from leading positions this season than Hull City (8 – level with Swansea City). Hull (11 points, 10th position) are exactly where they were after nine games of the season in 2013/14, although they have lost only two games this season (W2 D5) compared to four at this season last season (W3 D2). The Tigers have scored exactly two goals in each of their last three home league games (W1 D1 L1). No side have caught their opponents offside on fewer occasions this season than Hull City (6; level with Stoke). Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"This weekend, there's a big soccer game between Hull City and Southampton. Both teams are going to try their best to win. Hull City might play with the same players as last week, but their main goalkeepers are still hurt, so their third-choice goalkeeper will have to play. Southampton might have Sadio Mane back in their team after he took a rest. Both teams have had some good games and some not-so-good games this season, but they are hoping to do well in this match. People are excited to see who will win!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Norman Sterns and Leela Sterns are newlyweds who are driving from their home in New York City to Los Angeles. They become lost and run out of gas, stranding them in the rural Ozark countryside. They meet a friendly paleontologist named Wayne Thomas. Wayne suggests that they visit the nearest farm that could provide gas. The farm is run by a strange man named Greely, who tells them that the gasoline truck was supposed to arrive the previous day, but since it didn't, he expects it there any minute. Greely suggests that they go inside to the parlor, where it's cooler. On the way up to the house, he asks if they know anybody out here, in case they may be waiting for them. They say no, and when they get inside, Greely goes off to tell his \\"housekeeper\\", Bella to make some iced tea. She argues with him on what he will \\"do with them\\", but Greely smacks her, and threatens that she will \\"take their place\\" if she doesn't serve them some tea. Thomas arrives and Greely goes outside. He tells them that their car won't start. Wayne decides to take a look at the engine and tells Greely to go back to his truck and get a tool. Greely instead beats him on the back of the head with it and drags his body off. Meanwhile, Leela appears to be worried about Greely, because he is acting strange and his eyes don't look right.

USA TODAY Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts battles fans in the right field seats for a ball hit by the Astros' Jose Altuve. Umpires ruled the fans interfered with Betts and Altuve was called out. (Photo: Troy Taormina, USA TODAY Sports) HOUSTON -- He won’t hide in anonymity like Steve Bartman, or be famous like Jeffrey Maier, but Troy Caldwell certainly will be forever known in Houston if the Astros don’t reach the World Series. The Boston Red Sox made Caldwell infamous overnight Wednesday by knocking off the Astros, 8-6, and taking a commanding 3-1 lead in the American League Championship Series, with a replay review that may be debated forever in Texas. Caldwell was just an anonymous Astros fan sitting in the first row of Section 152 in the right-field seats at Minute Maid Park. Jose Altuve hit a drive deep to right field. Caldwell jumped up and stuck out his hand, hoping to catch the ball. Red Sox right fielder Mookie Betts jumped high, trying to catch it himself. Caldwell’s hand knocked against Betts’ glove. No one caught the ball. The sellout crowd of 43,277 went wild, believing it was a homer, and Caldwell started cheering himself. Only for the stadium to watch in disbelief as right-field umpire Joe West shot his arm up in the air. Out! Caldwell stood in horror, screaming along with everyone else as they waited 3 minutes, 13 seconds - which seemed like an eternity - for the replay review. The decision came. The call was confirmed: Spectator interference. Out. Here’s Troy Caldwell. He was the fan who was ruled to have interfered with the Astros potential home run ball. “I’m going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don’t come back to win this.” pic.twitter.com/IXE2uEzSoW — Matt Young (@Chron_MattYoung) October 18, 2018 Replay after replay was shown on the huge scoreboard, and on TV sets across America, but it was virtually impossible to tell if the ball was over the fence or just short. There was no conclusive evidence. The call stood, and the sellout crowd went berserk. “After viewing all relevant angles,’’ MLB said in a statement, “the replay official could not definitely determine that the spectator failed to reach out of the stands and over the playing field, clearly preventing the fielder from catching the ball. “The call stands, the batter is out.’’ The Astros were livid, with George Springer, who had been standing on first base, slamming his helmet to the ground. “I’m not sure if Mookie makes that catch,’’ Astros manager A.J. Hinch said during an in-game interview on TBS. “He’s a great athlete, but how it’s an assumed out is unbelievable. … “Jose paid kind of (the) ultimate price for something out of his control.’’ Caldwell, who did round after round of interviews for the next few innings, spent the rest of the game praying. “I’ll need security to escort me out of here,’’ Caldwell told reporters, “if the Astros don’t come back to win this. … I promise you I didn’t do anything wrong.’’ MORE MLB: Dodgers learn valuable lesson - they can win big without long ball Clayton Kershaw dominates as Dodgers move to brink of World Series Then again, neither did Bartman, who simply was trying to catch a foul ball in the stands in the eighth inning of Game 6 of the 2003 NLCS between the Cubs and Marlins, only to keep left fielder Moises Alou from catching the ball. The Cubs blew the lead, lost the game, and the series. Bartman, who was escorted from Wrigley Field and received death threats, was never again seen publicly, living his life in anonymity. Maier, just a 12-year-old in 1996, reached over the wall in right field at Yankee Stadium in Game 1 of the ALCS. He snared Derek Jeter’s fly ball just as Baltimore Orioles right fielder Tony Tarasco waited at the wall to catch it. There was no replay then, and right-field umpire Richie Garcia called it a homer. The Yankees won the game, the ALCS, and the World Series. It was the start of a Yankees dynasty, and Maier became a hero in the Bronx. The Astros did everything possible to make sure that Caldwell was neither hero nor goat in their zany back-and-forth game. The teams scored in every inning, and three times in the same inning, trading jabs like pugilists in a prize fight, with five different lead changes and ties. The Red Sox know they will be facing Cy Young candidate Justin Verlander on Thursday for Game 5, while the Red Sox have no idea who they’ll be starting. They were scheduled to start ace Chris Sale, but he’s still weak, having lost weight after being hospitalized with stomach problems. “He’s feeling better compared to [Tuesday],’’ manager Alex Cora said, “but physically he’s not there yet. So I think if necessary, he’ll pitch Game 6. He feels that he’ll be ready for that one.’’ And for Game 5? “I’m learning very, very quick that in the playoffs,’’ Cora said, “you live for today.’’ Then again, the Red Sox may not even need Sale to pitch again until Tuesday, Oct. 23: Game 1 of the World Series, at Fenway Park, against the National League champions.

Then, he noticed that crew chief Joe West, who was manning the right-field line in Wednesday's critical Game 4 of the American League Championship Series, had called fan interference and ruled Altuve out. COLUMNIST: Astros wronged by call on fan interference, only on HoustonChronicle.com As a lengthy review dragged on, Caldwell had a sinking feeling that he might be in trouble. The review upheld West's original call that Caldwell interfered with Red Sox rightfielder Mookie Betts. Just like that, a potential game-tying home run was ruled an out. Two batters later, the Red Sox got out of the inning without suffering any damage except for what Caldwell was experiencing in the front row of Section 152. \\"I'm going to need security to escort me out of here if the Astros don't come back to win this,\\" said Caldwell, who grew up in Houston but currently lives in Atlanta and flew to town just for this game. NOT ESPIONAGE: Astros were doing surveillance against Indians, Red Sox, MLB says West said neither the ball nor Betts' glove had crossed the railing when the interference took place. \\"Here's the whole play,\\" West said. \\"They hit the ball to right field, he (Betts) jumped up to try to make a catch, a fan interfered with him over the playing field. That is why I called spectator interference.\\" Caldwell disagreed. \\"I didn't reach over the wall; I was on this side of the line,\\" Caldwell said. \\"I don't understand what happened. I know the rules, and I didn't reach over the line.\\" Rule 3.16 states that: \\"No interference shall be allowed when a fielder reaches over a fence\\" unless \\"it is clearly intentional.\\" West says that rule isn't applicable, because - in his view - Betts didn't reach into the stands. \\"I think you know what I think of Joe West right about now,\\" Caldwell said. At least early in Wednesday's game, Caldwell had the support of Astros fans sitting around him, who were busier yelling at West than they were bothering Caldwell. Pinkerton's Barbecue sent out a tweet during the game urging fans around Caldwell to buy him a beer and offered him free barbecue. \\"I promise you I didn't do anything wrong,\\" Caldwell said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In a baseball game, there was a play where a player named Jose Altuve hit a ball really high and far.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is the best way to: What can I use to help hold LEDs in place when soldering them to jewelry?","completion":"The best way to hold LEDs in place when soldering them to jewelry involves the following steps: 1. Gather necessary tools and materials: Before beginning the soldering process, gather all the required tools and materials, such as a soldering iron, solder, helping hands or a third hand tool, heat shrink tubing or electrical tape, wire strippers, small pliers, and a clean, heat-resistant workspace. 2. Determine LED placement: Decide where you would like to place the LEDs on the jewelry piece. Consider the overall design and aesthetic of the jewelry, as well as the functionality of the LEDs. 3. Secure the LED: To hold the LED in place during the soldering process, use a helping hand or third-hand tool. This tool typically features adjustable clamps and a weighted base, which allows for precise positioning and stability while soldering. If you do not have a helping hand, you can use other methods like placing the LED on a flat surface with a small piece of heat resistant tape to keep it stable. 4. Prepare the wires: Strip the ends of the wires that will be soldered to the LED terminals. If necessary, tin the stripped wire ends by applying a small amount of solder, which will make the soldering process easier and more efficient. 5. Apply heat shrink tubing or electrical tape: Cut small pieces of heat shrink tubing or electrical tape to insulate and protect the soldered connections. Slide the tubing or tape over the stripped wire ends before soldering. 6. Solder the wires to the LED: Using a soldering iron and solder, carefully connect the wires to the LED terminals. Be sure to follow proper soldering techniques, such as heating the joint to be soldered and not the solder itself, and allowing the solder to cool and solidify before moving or adjusting the connection. 7. Secure and insulate the connections: Once the solder has cooled and solidified, slide the heat shrink tubing or electrical tape over the soldered connections. Use a heat source, such as a heat gun or lighter, to shrink the tubing and create a secure, insulated connection. If using electrical tape, wrap it tightly around the soldered joint. 8. Test the LED: With the soldered connections secured and insulated, test the LED by connecting it to a power source. Ensure the LED lights up and functions properly. 9. Attach the LED to the jewelry: Once the LED is soldered and tested, attach it to the desired location on the jewelry piece. Use super glue or epoxy to secure the LED and wires discreetly, ensuring they do not compromise the overall design of the jewelry. By following these steps, you can securely solder and position LEDs on your jewelry while maintaining a clean and professional appearance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"How does this change dogma?\\" is in \\"The papal bull defining the dogma, Ineffabilis Deus, mentioned in particular the patrististic interpretation of Genesis 3:15 as referring to a woman, Mary, who would be eternally at enmity with the evil serpent and completely triumphing over him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Sentence: \\"My heart is pounding.\\" Would a linguist rate this sentence to be acceptable linguistically?","completion":"A linguist would most likely rate the sentence, \\"My heart is pounding,\\" as acceptable linguistically, considering various factors such as grammaticality, semantics, pragmatics, and the sentence's place within a communicative context. Let's analyze each aspect in detail: 1. Grammaticality: Grammaticality refers to the adherence of a sentence to the rules of syntax, morphology, and phonology in a given language. In this case, the sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure common in English sentences. It also conforms to morphological and phonological rules, as each word is easily identifiable and the sentence flows smoothly when spoken or read. Subject: \\"My heart\\" – a noun phrase referring to the possession of the heart by the speaker Verb: \\"is pounding\\" – the verb \\"to pound\\" in the present continuous tense, showing ongoing action Object: There is no direct object in this sentence, but it is still considered a complete thought and is grammatically correct in the context of expressing a feeling or sensation. 2. Semantics: Semantics is the study of meaning in language and how language conveys meaning. In this sentence, the meaning is quite clear – the speaker is expressing that their heart is beating rapidly and forcefully, often implying strong emotions or physical exertion. The words and their arrangement in the sentence make logical sense and convey a concept that is easy to understand. 3. Pragmatics: Pragmatics studies how context influences language use and interpretation. Although the sentence can be read in isolation and still be considered linguistically acceptable, additional context would help the reader or listener understand the reason behind the speaker's pounding heart. For example, the speaker might be nervous, excited, or physically strained, which caused their heart to pound. Nevertheless, the sentence stands on its own and can be feasibly used in various contexts. 4. Communicative context: The sentence \\"My heart is pounding\\" might appear in different communicative contexts such as spoken or written language, in both formal and informal settings. As a stand-alone sentence, it is more likely to be found in less formal contexts like casual conversations, personal narratives, or social media posts. That said, the sentence could still be integrated into more formal contexts, such as a character's dialogue in a literary work or an individual's personal testimony or report. In conclusion, a linguist would likely find the sentence \\"My heart is pounding\\" to be acceptable linguistically, as it adheres to grammatical rules, has a clear meaning, functions well in a variety of contexts, and can be utilized in diverse communicative situations. However, understanding the specific context in which the sentence is used would undoubtedly enrich the interpretation and provide deeper insights into the speaker's intended message."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Born in Cherryvale, Kansas, Louise Brooks was the daughter of Leonard Porter Brooks, a lawyer, who was usually too busy with his practice to discipline his children, and Myra Rude, an artistic mother who determined that any \\"squalling brats she produced could take care of themselves\\". Rude was a talented pianist who played the latest Debussy and Ravel for her children, inspiring them with a love of books and music. When she was nine years old, a neighborhood predator sexually abused Louise. This event had a major influence on Brooks' life and career, causing her to say in later years that she was incapable of real love, and that this man \\"must have had a great deal to do with forming my attitude toward sexual pleasure.... Brooks made her screen debut in the silent The Street of Forgotten Men, in an uncredited role in 1925. Soon, however, she was playing the female lead in a number of silent light comedies and flapper films over the next few years, starring with Adolphe Menjou and W. C. Fields, among others. She was noticed in Europe for her pivotal vamp role in the Howard Hawks directed silent \\"buddy film\\", A Girl in Every Port in 1928. In an early sound film drama, Beggars of Life (1928), Brooks played an abused country girl who kills her foster father in a moment of desperation. A hobo, Richard Arlen, happens on the murder scene and convinces Brooks to disguise herself as a young boy and escape the law by \\"riding the rails\\" with him. In a hobo encampment, or \\"jungle,\\" they meet another hobo, Wallace Beery. Brooks's disguise is soon uncovered and she finds herself the only female in a world of brutal, sex-hungry men. Much of this film was shot on location, and the boom microphone was invented for this film by the director William Wellman, who needed it for one of the first experimental talking scenes in the movies. By this time in her life, she was mixing with the rich and famous, and was a regular guest of William Randolph Hearst and his mistress, Marion Davies, at San Simeon, being close friends with Davies' niece, Pepi Lederer. Her distinctive bob haircut helped start a trend; many women styled their hair in imitation of her and fellow film star Colleen Moore. Soon after the film Beggars Of Life was made, Brooks, who loathed the Hollywood \\"scene\\", refused to stay on at Paramount after being denied a promised raise, and left for Europe to make films for G. W. Pabst, the prominent Austrian Expressionist director. Paramount attempted to use the coming of sound films to pressure the actress, but she called the studio's bluff. It was not until 30 years later that this rebellious move would come to be seen as arguably the most savvy of her career, securing her immortality as a silent film legend and independent spirit. Unfortunately, while her initial snubbing of Paramount alone would not have finished her in Hollywood altogether, her refusal after returning from Germany to come back to Paramount for sound retakes of The Canary Murder Case (1929) irrevocably placed her on an unofficial blacklist. Actress Margaret Livingston was hired to dub Brooks's voice for the film, as the studio claimed that Brooks' voice was unsuitable for sound pictures.

Paragraph: Inflammation in arteries has been associated with an increased risk of stroke. Inflammation and emboli, or small blood clots, were significantly reduced in patients treated with 80 milligrams of Lipitor compared with those who received 10 mg of the drug each day for 12 weeks, said researchers, who presented the data at the American College of Cardiology scientific meeting on Monday. The study divided 40 patients with diseased carotid arteries into the two groups. The artery was examined for changes in inflammation at six weeks and 12 weeks using a unique contrast agent with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). While the 80 mg Lipitor, known generically as atorvastatin, reduced inflammation, researchers appeared even more enthusiastic about the technique used to measure the results. The arteries were viewed using Ultra Small Particles of Iron Oxide, or USPIO-enhanced, high-resolution MRI. “The real star of this study is this new way of imaging, which allows you to zero in on what is actually going on in these arteries,” said Dr Jonathan Gillard, one of the study’s lead researchers. The study demonstrates that if you treat patients who have inflammation of the carotid artery with “a high dose of atorvastatin, you substantially reduce the amount of inflammation and risk of stroke, whereas low dose atorvastatin does not reduce risk,” Gillard said. “Thanks to this imaging technique, we can now figure out which patients need the aggressive treatment before we begin our therapy,” he added. Lipitor, which lowers levels of LDL, or bad, cholesterol in the blood, is the world’s top-selling prescription medicine with some 12 billion in annual sales. Claim: High dose Lipitor reduces artery inflammation: study.","completion":"The study shows that high dose Lipitor (80 mg), also known as atorvastatin, reduces artery inflammation as compared to the lower dose (10 mg) of the drug.

In the group treated with 80 mg of Lipitor, inflammation and emboli, or small blood clots, were significantly reduced, subsequently lowering the risk of stroke. The study's lead researcher, Dr. Jonathan Gillard, confirmed that a high dose of atorvastatin effectively reduced the inflammation and stroke risk, while a low dose did not exhibit the same risk-reducing effect. The new imaging technique using Ultra Small Particles of Iron Oxide (USPIO)-enhanced high-resolution MRI allowed researchers to closely observe arterial inflammation and thus determine the best treatment course for each patient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let us do this step by step. Step 1: Simplify the equation Combine the terms with t: (41*t + 316*t) + (8007 + 1632) = 0 (357*t) + (9639) = 0 Now, the simplified equation looks like this: 357*t + 9639 = 0 Step 2: Rewrite the equation in the form of At^2 + Bt + C = 0 to apply the quadratic formula The given equation is linear (no t^2 term), so the equation can be rewritten as: 0*t^2 + 357*t + 9639 = 0 Now, we have the equation in the form At^2 + Bt + C = 0, with A = 0, B = 357, and C = 9639. Solution: We can solve the linear equation since it is not a quadratic. Step 3: Solve for t 357*t + 9639 = 0 Isolate t by moving the constant term (9639) to the other side of the equation: 357*t = -9639 Now, divide both sides by the coefficient of t (357): t = -9639 / 357 Step 4: Simplify the answer Dividing -9639 by 357, we find: t = -27 So, the solution for the given equation 41*t + 316*t + 8007 + 1632 = 0 is: t = -27"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump...

A traditional conditioner is applied every time you shower, just after you rinse out your shampoo. This type of conditioner works to repair the damage done by hot tools, chemicals, and general wear-and-tear that your hair experiences on a daily basis. Choose a type of conditioner that is advertised for your specific hair needs; whether you have curly and frizzy hair, dry and damaged hair, colored hair, fine hair, relaxed hair, or limp and lank hair, there is a specific conditioner that can help with each. Hop in the shower, and go along with your regular washing routine. You’ll condition your hair after you wash it, so give your scalp and strands a good scrubbing with your favorite shampoo. Focus most of your washing power on the scalp, being careful not to tug at your wet hair as you wash as this can damage the ends and cause more breakage. Use warm water to wash out the shampoo. Warm water is safer on your hair than hot water is. Be careful not to tug on the strands if you run your fingers through it. When your hair feels ‘squeaky’, you’ve rinsed out all the shampoo. If your hair is sopping wet, any conditioner you try to apply will run right off and won’t stick long enough to affect your hair. If your hair is very short, you probably won’t have to do much wringing. If, however, you have long hair, spend a bit of time getting as much water out of it as you can. Pour a bit of conditioner into the palm of your hand; the amount you need will vary depending on the length of your hair. A dime-sized amount is usually recommended for professional conditioners, while drug store brands may require more because they can be diluted. If your hair is very long, you may need a whole palm-full of conditioner. Run this through the ends of your hair, trying to apply it to every strand that you’re able. Your conditioner should be applied only to the ends of your hair, as this is the part that is damaged (it’s the oldest). Putting conditioner near your scalp and roots can actually clog your follicles, and slow hair growth/increase oil production. This step is slightly optional; the longer you wait and allow your conditioner to set, the more it will be able to do to improve the health of your hair. If you’re in a rush, you can rinse it out nearly immediately after, but it won’t make your hair as soft and shiny as it normally would. Try applying your conditioner, and then washing the rest of your body/face while it sets. Then when you’re finished (normally a minute or two later), you can rinse out your conditioner for maximum effect. Assuming you’ve turned the water temperature back up for comfort’s sake, turn it back down as cold as you can handle it. As aforementioned, the cold water is healthier for your hair. Spend a few minutes rinsing out the conditioner; if your hair still feels ‘slimy’, then you haven’t gotten it all out. When your hair is smooth and no longer feels super slippery, then you’re set! Wring out your hair and you’re done conditioning.","completion":"This article explains how to properly use traditional conditioner by applying it to the ends of damp, shampooed hair, letting it set, and rinsing it out, aiming to help repair daily damage, provide specific hair care, and maintain overall hair health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Michael Jai White stars in the new spoof \\"Black Dynamite.\\" \\"The problem I have with the word is that it seems to encompass movies that don't fall under that category,\\" White said. \\"As soon as you hear the title 'Shaft' people think 'blaxploitation' and that is absolutely unfair because that film was made before the term even existed.\\" White, the star and co-writer of the new movie \\"Black Dynamite,\\" would rather people focus on what he views as the positives of the genre of 1970s urban action films starring African-American actors. His new movie, which opened in limited release last weekend and will start going wider, follows the exploits of Black Dynamite, a former CIA agent who takes to the streets after his brother is killed by the mafia, orphanages are flooded with drugs and some bad malt liquor finds its way into the 'hood. It is both a spoof of, and homage to, the genre whose films like \\"Black Caesar,\\" \\"The Mac,\\" \\"Foxy Brown,\\" and \\"Superfly\\" have developed a cult following over the years. \\"Black Dynamite\\" caught the eye of Sony Pictures at the Sundance Film Festival and the studio acquired the rights to distribute the film. A viral marketing campaign helped whip up anticipation for the movie, which also features former late-night talk show host Arsenio Hall and \\"In Living Color\\" cast member Tommy Davidson as pimps. Director Scott Sanders said he has always been fascinated by the fact that while blaxploitation really only grabbed hold of the industry for about five years during the early 1970s, it was so influential. \\"It was such an extreme genre with the look and the music and there were really no boundaries or rules,\\" he said. \\"It's always been a fascination for me given how much it influenced hip-hop, black culture and culture as a whole, given the brevity.\\" White, best known for his roles in the films \\"Spawn\\" and Tyler Perry's \\"Why Did I Get Married,\\" said he is a huge fan of blaxploitation films and views his movie as a loving send-up. While he is aware that some of the films were unintentionally funny with their low-budget gaffes -- such as the appearance of mic booms in some scenes -- and their stereotypes, White said the genre is a valued part of the movie industry's history. \\"These movies really saved Hollywood because the studio system was in trouble and they learned that they had a cash cow with these films,\\" he said. \\"Later they exploited it by making any movie and throwing the term 'black' in front of it and that's what made it exploitive.\\" They also gave African-American actors a chance to work and reflected a people's pride following the gains of the civil rights era. Laurence Washington, managing editor and co-publisher of Blackflix.com, said the movies helped young, black fans like him realize that \\"when we grow up we don't have to be train porters, busboys and waiters.\\" The films instead portrayed handsome, brave and suave black heroes who always got the girl, Washington said. \\"When the blaxploitation films came out in the '70s, black audiences had never had action film heroes they could identify with,\\" he said. \\"[The movies] also opened the door for today's black actors and directors to enter the mainstream.\\" Darius James, author of \\"That's Blaxploitation!: Roots of the Baadasssss 'Tude (Rated X by an All-Whyte Jury),\\" said blaxploitation films were like any other film that appeal to a specific audience, such as the indie movies of Roger Corman and Russ Meyer. James said he grew up seeing civil rights workers beaten and hosed on television and the movies came out time when there was a sense of defiance and resistance against the marginalization of African-Americans. \\"These films, black exploitation films, reflected that spirit,\\" James said. White said he wishes there were more action films starring black actors these days. The films of the past were fearless and about true emotion, he said. \\"The 'black is beautiful' movement had taken off and there was so much pride,\\" White said. \\"When they called each other 'brother' they meant it.\\" \\"The heroes were strong, sexy and they kicked ass.\\" \\"I ask 'Where is that now?' I would like people to look at our film and say: 'Where are the black actors like that now?' \\" Jay Potts, the cartoonist behind World of Hurt -- which bills itself as \\"The Internet's #1 Blaxploitation Webcomic\\" -- said he hopes \\"Black Dynamite\\" furthers interest in the genre. And while \\"blaxploitation\\" is a convenient moniker to lump in films that may not have always had the best production value, Potts said they were a testament to an era. \\"The films came out at a time when black people were learning about themselves and flexing their creative muscles,\\" Potts said. \\"To me, there was a lot of fun, had a lot of energy and while it always wasn't perfect by any means there was so much life in it that I hope people take another look.\\" Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Actor Michael Jai White's new movie \\"Black Dynamite\\" is a tribute to the blaxploitation genre of the 1970s, which features African-American actors in urban action films. White thinks that the term \\"blaxploitation\\" has a negative connotation and that people should focus on the positive aspects. He believes these movies gave African-American actors a chance to work, reflected people's pride after the civil rights era, and showed strong, brave, and suave black heroes who always got the girl.

He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird.

Please briefly summarize this news article: British tabloid names Diana 'killer' In a front-page splash on the day Britain opened an inquest into Diana's death,Â The MirrorÂ named the person she had claimed was \\"planning an accident\\" in a chilling prediction of her own death in a car crash in August 1997. She made the allegation in a letter she gave to her butler and confidant, Paul Burrell, before she died. The former wife of heir-to-the-throne Prince Charles died at the age of 36, along with her lover Dodi al-Fayed and their chauffeur Henri Paul in a Paris road tunnel. The Mirror appeared to be risking an aggressive legal response from Buckingham Palace to its story on Tuesday. The rest of the normally competitive British media omitted the name, apparently to avoid legal action under Britain's tough defamation laws.Â TheÂ tabloid printed a copy of the letter Diana wrote just 10 months before her death on its inside pages. Although it identified the person in its own story, the name was blanked out in the reproduction of the handwritten letter. \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous,\\" it quoted the letter as saying. \\"(...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury.\\" \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Sensational headlines \\"This particular phase in my life is the most dangerous... (...) is planning 'an accident' in my car, brake failure and serious head injury\\"Excerpt from Princess Diana's letter to her butlerÂ Burrell, who gave The Mirror access to the letter as part of a serialisation of excerpts of his book which was published late last year, reacted angrily to news the name had been revealed. \\"I am not very happy about it... I only learnt about it late last night. And it was always my intention never to publish that name,\\" he told reporters on Tuesday. Britain's tabloid newspapers have been engaged in an almost daily battle in the years since Diana's death to produce the most sensational headlines about Diana, Charles and other members of her family and former household. Tuesday's revelation came as Royal Coroner Michael Burgess was due to open and adjourn inquests into the deaths of Diana and Dodi. Hundreds of journalists from around the world gathered for the start of the inquests in central London - the first official public hearings into the crash to be held on British soil. An inquiry by French authorities in 1999 ruled the accident was caused by Diana'sÂ chauffeur being drunk and driving too fast. The Mirror said Burrell was prepared to hand over the Diana letter to the coroner as part of the inquest. It said that in doing so, he would be \\"honouring a long-standing promise to cooperate fully with the inquiries\\". After a 15-year marriage, Charles and Diana divorced in 1996 after both had admitted to having adulterous affairs. Summary:","completion":"Okay, sweetie, imagine there's a very famous princess named Diana. A long time ago, she had a very scary car accident that she didn't survive. Recently, a big newspaper in Britain, The Mirror, wrote on its front page that they think they know who Princess Diana said might cause her an accident. She had written this in a letter to her really close friend, Mr. Burrell, before she died. The newspaper even printed some of her letter, but they covered the name when they showed it. Mr. Burrell was surprised and upset when he found out they revealed the name because he didn't want that to happen. He did promise to share the letter with people trying to find out what really happened to Princess Diana. This big news came out just when some people were about to start their own investigation about her and her boyfriend's deaths. Many newspapers in Britain write stories about Princess Diana and her family a lot trying to make attention-grabbing headlines. And even though she and her husband, Prince Charles, were not together anymore when she died, what happened to her still makes people very sad and curious."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Movie title: Invincible Context: Zishe Breitbart (Jouko Ahola) is the son of an Orthodox Jewish blacksmith in rural Poland. He is fantastically strong, largely from working at hard labor all day. A talent agent sees how strong Breitbart is in his Jewish shtetl home and convinces him to move to Berlin, where he can find work as a strongman. Hanussen (Tim Roth), an epic con-man and supposed mystic, runs a cabaret variety show. Hanussen gives Breitbart a blonde wig and a Nordic helmet and calls him \\"Siegfried\\" so as to identify him with the Aryan notion of physical superiority. This appeals to the largely Nazi clientele, and he is a big hit. This is a dark comedy but is as much so a deeply dramatic story, involving the mainly secular Jews of Berlin. Included is interaction between Breitbart, an attractive stage musician Marta, their boss Hanussen, who abuses her, and some very top level Nazis. Ultimately Breitbart becomes disgusted and dismayed. A visit from Breitbart's young brother, Benjamin (Jacob Benjamin Wein), convinces Breitbart to be proud of his Jewish heritage, and so, without warning, he takes off the blonde wig in the middle of his act to announce that he is not an \\"Aryan\\", and calls himself a new Jewish Samson. This has the effect of making him a hero to the local Jews, who flock to the cabaret to see their new Samson. The Nazis aren't as pleased, and Hanussen tries to discredit Breitbart. He tries to make it seem that it was his mystic powers that were the true strength behind the strongman, and makes it look as though even his frail female pianist Marta can break chains and lift weights if under his power. Hanussen knows the Nazis dabble in the occult and hopes to become a part of Hitler's future government. He therefore hobnobs with the likes of Himmler and Goebbels. In the end, however, he is exposed as a Czech Jewish con artist named Herschel Steinschneider. As a result, Hanussen is kidnapped and murdered by the Brownshirts. Breitbart foresees what will be known as the Holocaust and returns to Poland to warn the Jewish people...

FRIDAY, AUGUST 26, 2005. On moonless nights the men and boys of Jableh, a dusty fishing town on the coast of Syria, would gather their lanterns and set out in their quietest boats. Five or six small craft, two or three fishermen in each. A mile out, they would arrange the boats in a circle on the black sea, drop their nets, and, holding their lanterns over the water, they would approximate the moon. The fish, sardines, would begin gathering soon after, a slow mass of silver rising from below. The fish were attracted to plankton, and the plankton were attracted to the light. They would begin to circle, a chain linked loosely, and over the next hour their numbers would grow. The black gaps between silver links would close until the fishermen could see, below, a solid mass of silver spinning. Abdulrahman Zeitoun was only thirteen when he began fishing for sardines this way, a method called lampara, borrowed from the Italians. He had waited years to join the men and teenagers on the night boats, and he'd spent those years asking questions. Why only on moonless nights? Because, his brother Ahmad said, on moon-filled nights the plankton would be visible everywhere, spread out all over the sea, and the sardines could see and eat the glowing organisms with ease. But without a moon the men could make their own, and could bring the sardines to the surface in stunning concentrations. You have to see it, Ahmad told his little brother. You've never seen anything like this. And when Abdulrahman first witnessed the sardines circling in the black he could not believe the sight, the beauty of the undulating silver orb below the white and gold lantern light. He said nothing, and the other fishermen were careful to be quiet, too, paddling without motors, lest they scare away the catch. They would whisper over the sea, telling jokes and talking about women and girls as they watched the fish rise and spin beneath them. A few hours later, once the sardines were ready, tens of thousands of them glistening in the refracted light, the fishermen would cinch the net and haul them in. They would motor back to the shore and bring the sardines to the fish broker in the market before dawn. He would pay the men and boys, and would then sell the fish all over western Syria -- Lattakia, Baniyas, Damascus. The fishermen would split the money, with Abdulrahman and Ahmad bringing their share home. Their father had passed away the year before and their mother was of fragile health and mind, so all funds they earned fishing went toward the welfare of the house they shared with ten siblings. Abdulrahman and Ahmad didn't care much about the money, though. They would have done it for free. Thirty-four years later and thousands of miles west, Abdulrahman Zeitoun was in bed on a Friday morning, slowly leaving the moonless Jableh night, a tattered memory of it caught in a morning dream. He was in his home in New Orleans and beside him he could hear his wife Kathy breathing, her exhalations not unlike the shushing of water against the hull of a wooden boat. Otherwise the house was silent. He knew it was near six o'clock, and the peace would not last. The morning light usually woke the kids once it reached their second-story windows. One of the four would open his or her eyes, and from there the movements were brisk, the house quickly growing loud. With one child awake, it was impossible to keep the other three in bed. Kathy woke to a thump upstairs, coming from one of the kids' rooms. She listened closely, praying silently for rest. Each morning there was a delicate period, between six and six-thirty, when there was a chance, however remote, that they could steal another ten or fifteen minutes of sleep. But now there was another thump, and the dog barked, and another thump followed. What was happening in this house? Kathy looked to her husband. He was staring at the ceiling. The day had roared to life. The phone began ringing, today as always, before their feet hit the floor. Kathy and Zeitoun -- most people called him by his last name because they couldn't pronounce his first -- ran a company, Zeitoun A. Painting Contractor LLC, and every day their crews, their clients, everyone with a phone and their number, seemed to think that once the clock struck six-thirty, it was appropriate to call. And they called. Usually there were so many calls at the stroke of six-thirty that the overlap would send half of them straight to voicemail. Kathy took the first one, from a client across town, while Zeitoun shuffled into the shower. Fridays were always busy, but this one promised madness, given the rough weather on the way. There had been rumblings all week about a tropical storm crossing the Florida Keys, a chance it might head north. Though this kind of possibility presented itself every August and didn't raise eyebrows for most, Kathy and Zeitoun's more cautious clients and friends often made preparations. Throughout the morning the callers would want to know if Zeitoun could board up their windows and doors, if he would be clearing his equipment off their property before the winds came. Workers would want to know if they'd be expected to come in that day or the next. \\"Zeitoun Painting Contractors,\\" Kathy said, trying to sound alert. It was an elderly client, a woman living alone in a Garden District mansion, asking if Zeitoun's crew could come over and board up her windows. \\"Sure, of course,\\" Kathy said, letting her feet drop heavily to the floor. She was up. Kathy was the business's secretary, bookkeeper, credit department, public-relations manager -- she did everything in the office, while her husband handled the building and painting. The two of them balanced each other well: Zeitoun's English had its limits, so when bills had to be negotiated, hearing Kathy's Louisiana drawl put clients at ease. This was part of the job, helping clients prepare their homes for coming winds. Kathy hadn't given much thought to the storm this client was talking about. It took a lot more than a few downed trees in south Florida to get her attention. \\"We'll have a crew over this afternoon,\\" Kathy told the woman. Kathy and Zeitoun had been married for eleven years. Zeitoun had come to New Orleans in 1994, by way of Houston and Baton Rouge and a half-dozen other American cities he'd explored as a young man. Kathy had grown up in Baton Rouge and was used to the hurricane routine: the litany of preparations, the waiting and watching, the power outages, the candles and flashlights and buckets catching rain. There seemed to be a half-dozen named storms every August, and they were rarely worth the trouble. This one, named Katrina, would be no different.

The Domestic Violence Legal Assistance Program fills the gap of legal resources for domestic violence survivors who can't afford an attorney. Domestic violence survivors in Jackson, Vicksburg, Hattiesburg, Oxford and Pascagoula can all get help. Julia Crockett, deputy director of Central Southwest Mississippi Legal Services Corp., said the program expects to help nearly 1,000 domestic violence victims. Crockett said legal help gives domestic abuse survivors a way to rebuild their lives. \\"They have been made to feel by the abuser that no one is going to help them do anything, so when they come to us they are desperate,\\" she said. \\"Those who need legal help and don't get it feel totally lost. Because then they feel like they are forced to stay in that situation.\\" Crockett said the program, funded by a 300,000 grant from the U.S. Justice Department, has no economic restrictions on who can get help. Legal services typically helps the poor. Gladys Bunzy, who said she was in an abusive relationship with a boyfriend for eight years, said such a program is long overdue and could be a lifeline for those escaping violent relationships. \\"When I finally made up my mind to leave, I had a restraining order put against him and that was 50 but that was 50 well spent to me,\\" said Bunzy, 40. \\"For people who can't afford it, this will be a godsend ... If a woman knows she is going to get some help that will be a burden off her mind, if the law will help her keep that person away from her.\\" Gwen Bouie-Haynes, project director of the Domestic Violence Services Center for Catholic Charities Inc., said often domestic violence survivors do not have the money to seek legal representation. \\"Legal assistance is a major issue for women fleeing a domestic violence situation,\\" she said. \\"Often times women are in need of immediate legal assistance services for the protection of the mother and the child. To get a protective order you need to be represented by an attorney.\\" Crockett said the pilot program was launched in 1998 at the Haven House Family Shelter Inc., a domestic violence shelter for women and children in Vicksburg. The program has helped victims in 90 court cases, and 150 legal counseling sessions have been held there.

The moment I installed the app, I expected it to help me optimize my device's performance. I was under the impression that it would provide more control over my kernel settings and enhance my phone's overall functionality. Nonetheless, I was gravely mistaken. First and foremost, there is the matter of the user interface (UI). The design is unpolished, cluttered, and unintuitive. As a user, I had to navigate through confusing menus, try to decipher ambiguous icons, and figure out various unknown functions. The app constantly bombards you with convoluted data and options without providing any insights on how to utilize them effectively. To make matters worse, there is a severe lack of documentation. As a somewhat tech-savvy person, I tried to fumble my way through the settings, hoping for some guidance along the way. Alas, the app did not offer any helpful tooltips, explanations, or even a tutorial. A newbie or someone with minimal technical knowledge would be hopelessly lost and probably end up causing undesirable effects on their device. Another issue, which I consider to be extremely alarming, is the impact this app has had on my device's stability. Since installing com.grarak.kerneladiutor, my phone has become more prone to random reboots, crashes, and even sluggishness. I feel like it is crucial to mention that my device (a flagship model!) was perfectly stable before I installed this app. Furthermore, and quite ironically, battery life – an aspect that this app claims to improve – saw a significant downfall. Instead of optimizing my device's performance, the application only managed to deteriorate essential aspects of its functionality. The developer's support leaves much to be desired. When I encountered issues, I tried to get in touch with their customer service through the provided email, expecting at least a semblance of assistance. Alas, my email was met with radio silence – not even an automated response acknowledging my concerns. Finally, I cannot, in good conscience, ignore the apparent security risks associated with entrusting such an intrusive app. With its lack of transparency and professionalism, it is alarming to grant this application unfettered access and control over critical aspects of my device. In conclusion, I can only award a 1-star rating to com.grarak.kerneladiutor. Save yourself the trouble, and avoid this app like the plague. Not only does it fail to deliver on its promises, but it can also potentially harm your device. I have since uninstalled the application and restored my phone to its original state, and I sincerely implore you to do the same or simply avoid it altogether."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The phrase \\"genuinely inspirational\\" highlights the reviewer's admiration for the real-life story depicted in the film. However, the brevity of the statement and lack of direct commentary on the movie's execution, acting, or other specific elements prevent a more comprehensive assessment. A truly inspirational real-life story can refer to the movie's captivating and compelling plot that is based on true events. This kind of story usually evokes strong emotions and feelings of admiration in the audience. When a movie manages to capture an inspirational real-life story accurately and convey the emotions effectively, it often results in a powerful cinematic experience that leaves a lasting impression on the viewers. However, it is crucial to note that the success of a movie is not solely determined by its plot, even if it is based on an incredible true story. Other essential factors contribute to a film's overall reception, such as direction, cinematography, acting, music, and pacing. A strong real-life story can sometimes overshadow weaker aspects of a film, making it essential to consider other elements for a more complete evaluation. In conclusion, while this brief review seems to convey a positive opinion of the movie based on the inspirational real-life story it portrays, it does not provide enough details to evaluate the movie's execution and craftsmanship thoroughly.

Step 1: Combine like terms -5*l and -5*l are like terms, so we can combine them. 0 = (-5*l - 5*l) + 40 0 = -10*l + 40 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (l) Now, we need to isolate the term containing the variable l on one side of the equation. To do this, we can subtract 40 from both sides of the equation: 0 - 40 = -10*l + 40 - 40 -40 = -10*l Step 3: Solve for l Now, we can solve for l by dividing both sides of the equation by -10: -40 / -10 = (-10*l) / -10 4 = l So the solution to the equation 0 = -5*l - 5*l + 40 is l = 4."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the police reveal the man they believe to be the culprit- Mildred's first husband, Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennett), who was the owner of the murder weapon- Mildred proclaims his innocence with emotion. Realizing that she knows more than she lets on, the detectives gather information from Mildred.Several years earlier, Mildred was married to Bert and spent her days as a housewife in their middle-class home. Her chief concern was providing all she could for their two daughters, Veda (Ann Blyth) and Kay (Jo Ann Marlowe). Bert loses his job, and reveals his frustration with Mildred's treatment of their children; namely showering them with expenses they cannot afford. Mildred sells baked goods to the neighbors to afford gifts for Veda in particular, but Bert chastises her for spoiling the girl. It is suggested that Bert has been unfaithful, and the two agree to separate. Mildred reveals the news to her daughters that afternoon when they return from school and witness Bert packing the car and driving off.

Question: what is peat moss good for growing?? Would \\"The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Peat moss is good for growing plants that require acidic and moist growing conditions. It is commonly used for growing acidic-loving plants like blueberries, azaleas, and rhododendrons, as well as moisture-loving plants like ferns and some types of orchids. Peat moss can also be added to general-purpose potting mixes to increase water retention and air porosity in the soil. However, the sentence \\"The top of the plant, or capitulum, has compact clusters of young branches.\\" does not seem to be a reasonable answer to the question, as it describes a morphological feature of a plant rather than explaining the benefits of peat moss in plant growth.

Walking through the deserted streets, she stops to admire some gruesome paintings in a gallery window painted by artist Antonio Sordi (Campbell), who coincidentally also comes by to look in on his \\"lost children.\\" After a friendly conversation, Sordi convinces the young woman to pose nude for him that night. At his bell-tower studio, Sordi is possessed by the spirit of a long-dead ancestor and suddenly transforms into a vampiric monster who hacks the screaming Daisy to death with a cleaver. Afterwards, he lowers her mutilated corpse into a vat of boiling wax. Sordi, in his vampire form, stalks Venice in search of victims; he is able to do so freely at all hours. In the middle of the day, he chases a young woman into the surf at a beach and drowns her. At night, he kills a prostitute in a car while pedestrians stroll by, all of them assuming the pair are lovers sharing an intimate moment. Another victim is approached at a party, chased into a swimming pool, and drowned there after the other guests have moved into the house.

The goal is to classify the review as \\"POS\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is positive or as \\"NEG\\" if the overall sentiment of the review is negative. Input: Still a Lot of \\"Country\\" on this Crossover Album . In the 1990s, the Country Music began to go through some transitions. Country music which had for the most part stayed in a vacuum began to go mainstream and embrace other genres of music. As a result, the sound started to change. One artist that led this transition was Faith Hill. Faith Hill had previously released two albums, but it was her 1998 breakthrough album \\"Faith\\" that helped her break into mainstream music. Surprisingly, while \\"Faith\\" did cross-over into the mainstream, there still is a strong country element on this album. By no means do I consider myself a Country Music expert. The nice thing about \\"Faith\\" is that I believe it caters to a fan like myself that may not be deep into Country Music, but can appreciate many of the elements Country Music can bring to the table. While \\"Faith\\" could be directed to a more casual fan like myself, I think the collection does an admirable job at addressing the fan who is deeper when it comes to the Country Music genre. Faith Hill brings an interesting formula to this album. Faith's role on the collection is primarily of vocalist. Since she is focused on vocals, she is dependent on a solid cast of characters (musicians and songwriters) to support her effort. On \\"Faith\\", this doesn't appear to be a problem. She is surrounded by many top notch studio musicians and is given an oustanding slate of songs to work with. Given this solid infrastructure, Faith is able to provide stellar vocals and produce a great product. The interesting twist to this formula is that Faith Hill is a co-producer on all 12 songs. Therefore she just isn't a \\"vocalist for hire\\". She ultimately is deciding what the songs should be and how the final product should sound. This is why \\"Faith\\" is a solid collection. \\"This Kiss\\" was the song that made Faith Hill a household name on the mainstream music scene. This was also the song that was my first introduction to Faith Hill. In 1998, I first heard this song on the radio and it completely blew me away. One reason why this song made it into the mainstream arena is that it does have qualities that make it sound like a \\"pop\\" song. However, there is a true country element to this song - complete with Steel Guitar and Fiddle (played by Glen Duncan). This instrumentation gives the song a most unique flavor. The song features some very clever and catchy lyrics such as \\"It's a centrifugal motion; It's perpetual bliss; It's that pivotal moment\\". The vocals are delivered with a very up-tempo pace (with little rests between the words) and that also contribute to the unique flavor. This song features some great background vocals by Chris Rodriguez (who provides background vocals on several other songs on the album) and Beth Nielson Chapman (who is a co-writer for this song). At first, upon purchasing \\"Faith\\", I expected it would basically be \\"This Kiss\\" and not much else. However, after my first listen to this collection - I realized that this was not the case. There were many other terrific songs that are included on this collection. The second song \\"You Give Me Love\\" is also pretty catchy. This has much more of a country element on this song. This song is highlighted by some terrific drums and more Fiddle by Glen Duncan. Although not as catchy a song, \\"Let Me Let Go\\" is worth mentioning. The highlight of this particular song is background vocals by Vince Gill. Gill is a master in the domain of steering Country Music toward the mainstream, but not abandoning the Country Music element. This song clearly has a Country Element and it works. This song also features a string section of viola players. The Country Music element is alive and well in the song \\"Better Days\\". This song was co-written by former Fleetwood Mac vocalist Billy Burnette. This song also features Duncan's Fiddle. The Country Music element is also present in the song \\"My Wild Frontier\\". This is a powerful and sad song about a woman, who with her family moves into the Canadian Prairie. Tragedy then strikes when the woman's baby son dies in his sleep. This song is a great example of some of how a very well written song is made even better by some very emotional and powerful vocals by Faith. The best song on the album is \\"The Secret of Life\\". This song was co-written by Gretchen Peters, who is a songwriter that worked with Bryan Adams on \\"On a Day Like Today\\" and his \\"Unplugged\\" album. The song is about exactly what the title says - telling little bits on what \\"the secret of life is\\". No loss of a solid country feel in this song - including more great fiddle by Duncan. Simple lyrics like \\"The Secret of Life is in Sam's Martini\\" (Sam is a character that is referred to in the song) or \\"The Secret of Life is a Good Cup of Coffee\\" give this song a very special quality. Two other country element songs are that are solid are \\"Just to Hear You Say That You Love Me\\" and \\"The Hard Way\\". In \\"Just to Hear You Say You Love Me\\", Faith does a terrific duet with her husband Tim McGraw. As for \\"The Hard Way\\", this is very powerful song (more great Fiddle) and is best described by the lyrics \\"I Keep Livin and Lovin and Learnin The Hard Way\\". Finally, \\"Me\\" is another good song - this song has more of a pop element and deals with a woman changing who she is. On a side note, Sheryl Crow is a co-writer of \\"Somebody Stand By Me\\". Not a great song, but worth mentioning. All of the lyrics, studio musicians, songwriting and production credits are listed in the liner notes. This album should appeal to Country Music and Mainstream fans. Highly Recommended Output:","completion":"POS"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Its most striking feature is the great Norman screen, running up without buttresses or projections to the parapet and hiding the bases of the square, richly decorated towers of the west front. The plain centre of the screen is the work of Remigius, the first bishop. The rest of it is relieved with rich arcading of Late Norman and Early English periods. The wooden spires which crowned the towers were removed in 1807. In 1192 Hugh of Avalon determined to rebuild the Norman building of Remigius, which an earthquake had shaken. To him we owe the choir and eastern transept. His successors completed the western transept and began the west end of the nave. So much money had to be spent in rebuilding the central tower, which fell in 1239, that the canons could not rebuild the nave entirely, but had to incorporate the Norman end by Remigius. Unfortunately the axis of the west front does not correspond to that of the nave, which is too wide for its height. The low vaulting is a serious defect in the choir built by St. Hugh, but of the superb beauty of the Angel Choir, which encloses his shrine, there can be no doubt.

Possible answers: a thoughtless person, guilty and ashamed, remorseful and sad A:","completion":"Jesse can be described as a thoughtless person, guilty and ashamed, as well as remorseful and sad. As the individual responsible for creating the disaster that put Taylor in such a bad situation, it is evident that Jesse made decisions without fully considering the consequences or the impact they might have on others. First and foremost, Jesse's actions were thoughtless. This implies that they did not think about how their actions would affect Taylor, and likely did not take the necessary precautions to mitigate risks or prevent harm. Thoughtlessness can stem from carelessness, selfishness, or simply a lack of awareness. Regardless of the reason, this aspect of Jesse's personality created the conditions for disaster and caused Taylor to face challenging circumstances. However, it is also possible that Jesse is guilty and ashamed of what they have done. Guilt and shame suggest that Jesse is not a completely heartless individual; rather, they possess the capacity to acknowledge and feel regret for their actions. This could mean that Jesse was unaware of the potential consequences at the time but has since recognized the error of their ways. Being consumed by guilt suggests that Jesse may be searching for a way to rectify the situation or make amends with Taylor. Finally, it is very likely that Jesse feels remorseful and sad about the disaster they have caused. Remorse indicates that Jesse understands the pain and hardship they have inflicted upon Taylor and wishes they could undo their actions. This emotional response reflects a genuine desire to make things right and salvage their relationship with Taylor. The sadness that Jesse might be experiencing can stem from witnessing the unfavorable outcomes or the realization that their actions have potentially jeopardized their relationship with Taylor. Overall, Jesse's character can be best defined by their thoughtlessness, guilt and shame, as well as their remorse and sadness. While their actions have caused harm to Taylor, their subsequent emotional responses suggest that they have the capacity for self-reflection and empathy, offering a glimmer of hope for eventual redemption and reconciliation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Broad: This word refers to a wide expanse or measurement, without specifying how tightly something is secured. It doesn't describe the state of the bundle in relation to Sarah's request to make it tight. 2. Slack: Although \\"slack\\" can imply a lack of tightness or tension, in this context, it's somewhat ambiguous and not as specific as \\"loose\\" in describing the reason for items falling out of the bundle. 3. Windtight: This term typically refers to the sealing of a structure or enclosure against wind and air infiltration.

Step 2: Interpret the meaning of the sentence in the context of a movie review. - As a movie review should discuss the quality of a film, we can assume that this sentence is commenting on the actor's impact on the movie. - Using the negative term \\"burdened\\" implies that the actor's performance or presence detracted from the film's quality. Step 3: Make a decision based on this analysis.

Banks are holding more than 200 million in insurance payments meant for victims of Superstorm Sandy, nearly four months after the storm made landfall, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Tuesday. The Cuomo administration said it has delivered letters to various banks and mortgage service providers asking they \\"use maximum discretion and effort to speed the release of funds.\\" \\"Families need to be able to return to their homes and the state economy, which took a hit from Superstorm Sandy, needs the boost from spending on repairs,\\" Cuomo said in a written statement. \\"After insurance companies have sent homeowners checks to pay for repairs, the money should not be sitting with the bank because of red tape.\\" A month of outrage later, Senate passes Sandy relief. The state's Department of Financial Services found that four of the biggest U.S. banks -- Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citibank and JP Morgan Chase -- are holding more than 4,100 checks worth more 130 million. The banks were not immediately available for comment, though have maintained that they were socked with a massive amount in payouts that require processing in the wake of the storm. Thousands of storm-battered residents are still awaiting a total of 208 million in insurance checks. Cuomo said the payouts are often issued jointly to the homeowner and their bank or mortgage servicer, which then requires the \\"bank's endorsement of the check before the homeowner may access the funds.\\" Delays can follow when banks request proof of repairs or servicing required by federal mortgage agencies. But many residents have complained that they haven't received the funds they need to start the repairs.

Located on the banks of the Bagmati River in the eastern part of Kathmandu, Pashupatinath Temple is the oldest Hindu temple in Kathmandu. It served as the seat of national deity, Lord Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. However, a significant part of the temple was destroyed by Mughal invaders in the 14th century and little or nothing remains of the original 5th-century temple exterior. The temple as it stands today was built in the 19th century, although the image of the bull and the black four-headed image of Pashupati are at least 300 years old. The temple is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Shivaratri, or the night of Lord Shiva, is the most important festival that takes place here, attracting thousands of devotees and sadhus.[citation needed] When was the Pashupatinath Temple built?","completion":"The Pashupatinath Temple was built in the 5th century.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star .","completion":"The phrase \\"tunney , brimming with coltish , neurotic energy , holds the screen like a true star\\" can be considered a mixed statement, containing both positive and negative elements. However, it predominantly leans towards the positive spectrum. To understand this better, let's break down the phrase into its components and analyze each part. 1. \\"Tunney\\" - This is likely referring to an actor or actress with the surname Tunney. The focus of the statement is on their performance and characteristics. 2. \\"Brimming with coltish, neurotic energy\\" - This is a mixed description. The word \\"coltish\\" refers to playful or frisky behavior, usually associated with young animals like colts. It conveys enthusiasm, energy, and a sense of youth. In this context, it could be considered positive, as it suggests the actor's performance is lively and spirited. On the other hand, \\"neurotic energy\\" implies a degree of tension, anxiety, or instability in the actor's performance. This could be interpreted as a subtle criticism, although not a strong negative remark. It could also be argued that neurotic energy, when channeled effectively, can add complexity to a performance and enhance its overall appeal. 3. \\"Holds the screen like a true star\\" - This is undeniably a positive statement, suggesting that the actor has a strong screen presence. It implies that they command attention when they are on screen and have the charisma and talent expected from a true star. In conclusion, while the phrase contains both positive and negative elements, it is more inclined towards positivity due to the powerful screen presence and lively energy conveyed in the description. The choice of wording suggests that the actor's performance is captivating and stands out, despite any potential anxiety or tension that might be present in their performance style."},{"prompt":"You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.

Later, Jared (Kyle Gallner), a friend of Travis, reveals he received an invitation from a woman he met on a sex site for group sex with himself, Travis and Billy Ray (Nicholas Braun). They borrow Travis's parents' car and travel out into the country to meet with the woman.Along the way, they accidentally sideswipe the vehicle of Sheriff Wynan (Stephen Root), while he was engaged in a homosexual affair in his car. Afraid, the boys drive off. Sheriff Wynan returns to the station and tells his deputy Pete (Matt L. Jones) to go and look for the vehicle (but doesn't tell him about what he was doing out on the back road).Meanwhile, the boys arrive at the trailer of the woman who sent out the invitation, Sarah Cooper (Melissa Leo). She encourages them to drink, and after being drugged by the beer, they pass out while undressing. Jared wakes up while being moved in a covered cage. He realizes he is in the sanctuary at Five Points after he identifies Cooper. Here, Cooper begins a long, hate-filled sermon/monologue before his warped followers about sin reeks in the world and that all evil must be eradicated before the end of the world comes which is their one-way ticket into Heaven. Cooper then identifies another captive, a homosexual young man they lured in through an internet chat room.

Syntactical similarity: - Both sentences are simple subject-verb-object (SVO) constructions with a preposition phrase. - Verb tense differs slightly, as \\"jumped\\" is in past tense, while \\"jumps\\" is in present tense. - Overall, their syntax is quite similar. 3. Semantic similarity: - Both sentences express the same core meaning – a deer jumping over a fence. - The difference between \\"the fence\\" and \\"a cyclone fence\\" is only a small detail regarding the type of fence. - Verb tenses (past vs. present) are also a minor difference in meaning.

This is according to recent work by archaeologists--history experts who investigate how human beings lived in the past. Archaeologists digging near Stonehenge last year discovered the remains of a large prehistoric village where they think the builders of the mysterious stone circle used to live. The village is about 4,600 years old, the same age as Stonehenge and as old as the Pyramids in Egypt. It is less than two miles from the famous ancient landmark and lies inside a massive man-made circular dirt wall, or \\"henge\\", known as the Durrington Walls. Remains found at the site included jewellry, stone arrowheads, tools made of deer antlers, wooden spears and huge amounts of animal bones and broken pottery. \\"These finds suggest Stone Age people went to the village at special times of the year to feast and party\\", says Mike Parker-Pearson from Sheffield University in England. He said many of the pig bones they found had been thrown away half-eaten. He also said the partygoers appeared to have shot some of the farm pigs with arrows, possibly as a kind of sport before barbecuing them. An ancient road which led from the village to the River Avon was also found. Here, the experts think, people came after their parties to throw dead s in the water so the bodies would be washed downstream to Stonehenge. Parker-Pearson believes Stonehenge was like a cemetery where ancient Britons buried the dead and remembered their ancestors. The theory is that Stonehenge is a kind of spirit home to the ancestors. The recent discovery of the village within the Durrington Walls shows that Stonehenge didn't stand alone but was part of a much bigger religious site, according to Parker-Pearson.People still come to worship and celebrate at Stonehenge today.

(B). positive.).","completion":"Title: Fading Dreams Review: Fading Dreams, a highly publicized venture led by Michael Grayson, failed to live up to the expectations surrounding its release. The negative sentiment surrounding this movie is largely attributable to its lackluster plot, misguided character development, and the shortcomings in maintaining the audience's engagement. Amidst the sea of directorial debacles, Grayson's attempt at creating a thrilling adventure undoubtedly sinks without a trace. To begin with, the plot unfolds like an exhaustingly predictable tale. The central storyline revolves around the protagonist's journey to find closure after the grisly demise of his loved ones. Rather than challenging stereotypes and testing the boundaries of narrative complexity, Grayson chooses to underwhelm the audience with a frustratingly linear progression. The glaring absence of unexpected twists and turns leaves the viewers uninterested and exasperated. Additionally, the character development in Fading Dreams is abysmally inadequate. Grayson's reliance upon clichéd tropes and one-dimensional personalities hinders the audience's ability to empathize or connect with the characters on a deeper level. The protagonist’s journey of self-discovery comes off as contrived, while the supporting cast exists merely as cardboard cutouts without any semblance of genuine motivation or purpose. This lack of emotional depth further disengages the audience, ultimately detracting from the overall impact of the film. Perhaps one of the most disappointing aspects of Fading Dreams is its inability to captivate the viewer's attention. Throughout the movie, dawdling scenes and needlessly prolonged dialogue lead to a jarring pacing issue. The unrelenting sluggishness of the plot contrasts with Grayson's previous efforts, which were known for their riveting momentum and captivating intensity. In fact, this sluggishness is so pervasive that it undermines even the film’s few redeeming elements. Despite boasting a star-studded cast and an ample budget, Fading Dreams falls woefully short in creating a memorable cinematic experience. Its lack of innovation, coupled with an uninspired script and disengaging execution, ultimately results in a profoundly negative impression. Grayson and his ensemble might have reached for the stars in an attempt to create a heart-rending tale of loss and redemption. Unfortunately, they only manage to underscore the very depths from which they set out to escape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The name Gilberto should be used instead. - MLS refers to Major League Soccer, which is the league and not an individual player.

He can't help but cry along with all the other mourners. After being abused by locals at a pub, he chances upon a woman, Colette (Katherine Kath), and her 6-year-old daughter Nicole (Diane Gardner), huddled in a doorway trying to stay dry. He takes them to his dingy basement abode, gives them what food and drink he has, a bed to sleep in, and shelter from the rain. Colette is suspicious but is so exhausted that she accepts.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is it possible to draw the conclusion that \\"Dan is very cruel.\\" if \\"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird.

The statement \\"Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird. He is very cruel.\\" is ambiguous, and the pronoun \\"he\\" could potentially refer to either Dan or Bill. To draw a conclusion, we need further information and context about the situation and the characters involved. There are different ways to interpret this statement, and we will discuss two possible scenarios that can help in understanding the situation: 1. If \\"he\\" refers to Bill: In this scenario, the statement implies that Dan stepped in to stop Bill from harming the injured bird. Bill was the one displaying cruelty by toying with the bird, and Dan took action to protect it. In this case, we could potentially conclude that Bill is the cruel one, and Dan showed some level of empathy or compassion for the bird by intervening. 2. If \\"he\\" refers to Dan: If, in the context, \\"he\\" refers to Dan, then it might be implied that Dan had to stop Bill from toying with the injured bird because Dan wanted to be the one inflicting harm or wanted to display cruelty towards the bird himself. In this scenario, we could conclude that Dan is cruel. However, even in this interpretation, there is not enough information to ascertain Dan's intentions or motivations, and additional context would be required to confirm this conclusion. Given the ambiguity in the statement, it is important to gather more information and context in order to accurately draw any conclusions about Dan's character. For example, in situations where Dan consistently displays cruel behavior towards animals or other individuals, one might be more inclined to believe that Dan is cruel. On the contrary, if this is an isolated incident and Dan has generally been compassionate or empathetic towards others, it could be an exception or might be misinterpreted. In conclusion, based on the given statement, we cannot definitively conclude that Dan is very cruel. The statement is ambiguous, and the pronoun \\"he\\" could either refer to Dan or Bill. Drawing conclusions about an individual's character requires more context and a comprehensive understanding of their behavior and actions in different situations."},{"prompt":"Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump’s longtime personal lawyer who is under investigation for his business dealings, has provided legal advice to Fox News host Sean Hannity, one of Trump’s most prominent media supporters. The dramatic revelation came Monday during a court hearing in New York where lawyers for Cohen and Trump argued for permission to determine whether thousands of pages of documents FBI agents seized from Cohen last week should be subject to attorney-client privilege. U.S. District Court Judge Kimba Wood appeared to reject the idea, saying that a “taint team” created by prosecutors to set aside privileged documents is a “viable option,” while a court-appointed outside lawyer known as a “special master” may also play a role in determining which records can and cannot be viewed by prosecutors. The disclosure about Hannity, who also hosts a nationally syndicated talk radio show, came after prosecutors indicated that Cohen performed “little to no legal work” and had just one client: Trump. In response, Cohen’s lawyers said that Cohen has represented three clients in the past year — Trump, GOP fundraiser Elliott Broidy and a third “publicly prominent individual” who wished to remain anonymous. Cohen's lawyers identified Hannity as the third unnamed client only after Judge Wood ruled that it must be made public. In a statement, Hannity sought to minimize his relationship with Cohen, saying he had never retained him as a lawyer. “Michael Cohen has never represented me in any matter,” Hannity said. “I never retained him, received an invoice, or paid legal fees. I have occasionally had brief discussions with him about legal questions about which I wanted his input and perspective.\\" “I assumed those conversations were confidential, but to be absolutely clear they never involved any matter between me and a third-party,” Hannity said.

They try to give credit when it's due by pointing out the nice, big, recently upgraded suite they were provided. However, the rest of the review is riddled with complaints regarding their overall experience during the stay. Firstly, the guest complains about the terrible acoustics, which caused significant disturbances due to the loud noise from the neighboring room. Secondly, they express their dissatisfaction with the housekeeping service, highlighting that their requests were not met, and the cleaning staff was inattentive to their needs.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the background: Compared to conventional milk production, organic milk production tends to have lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland, because it potentially reduces leaching of nitrates (NO3−) and phosphates (PO4−) due to lower fertilizer application rates. Because organic milk production reduces pesticides utilization, it increases land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare. Mainly due to the lower level of concentrates given to cows in organic herds, organic dairy farms generally produce less milk per cow than conventional dairy farms. Because of the increased use of roughage and the, on-average, lower milk production level per cow, some research has connected organic milk production with increases in the emission of methane.Animal welfare issues vary among dairy farms and are not necessarily related to the way of producing milk (organically or conventionally). and the situation: Two neighboring dairy farms produced milk for half the state. Berry farm produced conventional milk, while Rose farm produced organic milk. Answer the following question: Which farm had milk production which reduced leaching of phosphates?","completion":"Based on the given background, Rose farm, which produced organic milk, had milk production practices that reduced the leaching of phosphates (PO4−). Organic milk production typically utilizes lower fertilizer application rates compared to conventional milk production, such as that employed by Berry farm. As a result, this leads to lower levels of nitrate (NO3−) and phosphate (PO4−) leaching from the farmland and ultimately lower eutrophication potential per ton of milk or per hectare of farmland. The reduction in leaching is due to organic farming practices that focus on maintaining the natural balance of the soil ecosystem, promoting sustainable agriculture, and avoiding the use of synthetic fertilizers and pesticides. While this approach can result in increased land use per ton of milk due to decreased crop yields per hectare, it does have environmental benefits such as mitigating water pollution and soil degradation, as well as promoting biodiversity. Despite the differences in conventional and organic milk production methods, it is important to note that animal welfare issues are not solely determined by the farm's production type. Factors such as management, housing, and the handling of cows can contribute to the overall well-being of the animals, whether they are on an organic or conventional farm. In the given situation, it is not possible to compare Berry farm and Rose farm regarding animal welfare issues without more specific information. In summary, Rose farm, which produces organic milk, would have milk production practices that reduce leaching of phosphates due to lower fertilizer application rates as a part of its organic farming approach. While there are differences in environmental impacts and production efficiency between conventional and organic milk production, animal welfare concerns are not solely exclusive to either method and depend on the specific conditions on each farm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

My specific task was to work with the rather over-excited father-to-be. He was an absolute delight to work with…very solicitous of his wife all throughout, very cooperative with the staff, and very appreciative of the help we were giving the mother-to-be. The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t. He made the cut, and came immediately over to the wife…”Honey…are you all right?? I didn’t hurt you??”” While the his daughter was being bathed and checked out by the APGAR nurse, he excited called out the various observations—she as healthy..she was pinking up…she was so beautiful “I can’t believe it.” When the nurse returned the little girl to “mom”, the three of them cuddled together, tears just pouring from his eyes…and we in the birthing suite were all getting teary-eyed ourselves.

What is the solution?","completion":"To solve the given equation, -158*y + 167*y + 18 = 0, for y, we first need to simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable y. 1. Combine the y terms: -158*y and 167*y are like terms, so we can add them together: -158*y + 167*y = 9*y Now, our equation becomes: 9*y + 18 = 0 2. Isolate the variable y: To do this, we need to get y by itself on one side of the equation. First, we will subtract 18 from both sides of the equation: 9*y + 18 - 18 = 0 - 18 This simplifies to: 9*y = -18 3. Solve for y: Now, we just need to isolate y by dividing both sides of the equation by 9: (9*y) / 9 = -18 / 9 This simplifies to: y = -2 So, the solution for the given equation, -158*y + 167*y + 18 = 0, is y = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They are ambushed by historical antiquity collector and Dr. Melon's colleague Dr. Glencliff whom they then lead on an action-packed chase through the countryside. Things become more complicated for them when British authorities hear about the incident and send a team of secret agents after them to retrieve the jewels. Dr. Melon's wife, Nan, on the other hand is only after him and Ernest for the jewels. While everyone is hot on their trail, Ernest develops a deep friendship with Dr. Melon. After crashing the cannon into a forest, Ernest locates the jewels, not in its barrel as the legend describes but in the gunpowder kegs. After putting the crown on his head, he finds himself unable to get it off. Dr. Glencliff shows up, abducts him, and takes him to his clinic in an attempt to surgically remove it and kill him at the same time. Dr. Melon meets up with Nan and convinces her to help him save Ernest. Answer:","completion":"Ernest P.

Unearthing deep-seated questions surrounding death, abandonment, and the sanctity of life, this grim revelation has sent shockwaves throughout the community and sparked strong reactions from residents, local officials, and law enforcement alike. This tragic incident not only highlights a shocking lapse in concern for the welfare of these lost young ones but also raises concerns over the pervasive disregard for human life in our growing world. The Harrowing Discovery The storage locker, located in the U-Haul facility in the McPhillips Street area, housed a gruesome secret that would only be unveiled as the staff began to clean out a delinquent account. In compliance with their abandoned property policy, workers were following standard procedures when they came across the unimaginable – the remains of at least three to four infants, shrouded by the darkness of the locker. The decomposing corpses were immediately reported to the local authorities, thus beginning a complex investigation into an unspeakable act. Investigation and Autopsy Results As the police work tirelessly to unravel the mystery shrouding these abandoned souls, autopsy reports have yet to reveal the cause of death or whether the infants were alive at the time of being placed in the locker. While experts in forensic pathology are striving to uncover the answers the community so desperately seeks, investigators have stated that the bodies were in a very advanced state of decomposition, a fact that has complicated their efforts in seeking the truth. Criminal Charges and the Hunt for Answers A primary consideration in the investigation is the identification of the individuals responsible for this heinous act. Determining if the deaths were a result of foul play or accidental in nature is crucial in assessing the appropriate criminal charges. Should this grim event be a result of criminal actions, it could deeply impact the community's trust in law enforcement and bring the effectiveness of Canada's justice system into question. As the investigation progresses, authorities remain focused on delivering justice for these innocent lives and ensuring that the person or persons responsible for this abomination are held accountable. Public Reaction and the Impact on Winnipeg The news of this gruesome discovery spread like wildfire throughout the city, sparking outrage, sadness, and disbelief. The tragedy has left the community in shock, with many questioning how such a horrifying event could have taken place in their city. It has also brought the topic of child abandonment and abuse to the forefront, with countless individuals expressing their concerns over the welfare of children and demanding that more significant measures be taken to prevent such occurrences in the future. In response to the outcry, community leaders, law enforcement officials, and social service agencies are expected to work collaboratively to address these concerns and reinforce a stronger sense of safety and protection for the vulnerable in Winnipeg. Conclusion The grisly discovery of four infant bodies in a Winnipeg storage locker serves as a harrowing reminder of the fragility of human lives and the persistent presence of evil in our world. While the authorities tirelessly work to unravel the mystery surrounding this heinous event, the community wrestles with a mix of shock, grief, and anger. This tragedy stands as a testament to the increasing necessity for improved child protection measures, heightened community awareness, and stronger prevention efforts. In the end, only by remaining vigilant and fostering a more profound sense of empathy and responsibility for one another can we hope to construct a world where senseless acts like these no longer exist."},{"prompt":"Q: Deciding to go on a diet is easy, but sticking to a diet is not easy! So, when facing that challenge, it is important to know how to reach your weight-loss goal. Of course, you have to decide you want to lose weight and be committed to doing so; then, you must stick to your guns and stay motivated or the goal will never be realized. There is no magic bullet, but there are two important tips that can help you reach your weight-loss goal. #1 – Take It a Week at a Time You must break your ultimate goal into smaller chunks and have bench marks that will indicate you are moving in the right direction. According to the Mayo Clinic, “Over the long term, it’s best to aim for losing 1 to 2 pounds (0.5 to 1 kilogram) a week.” When you have a realistic weekly weight-loss target, you will be more confident in your efforts and you will know exactly what you are going to measure at the end of each week. Your long-term goal may be 40 pounds, but take it “one week at a time” (1 to 2 pounds/week = 20 to 30 weeks) In addition to choosing a healthy diet that fits your lifestyle and current health conditions, plus a solid commitment to stay with it, don’t forget to get plenty of rest and exercise. . BUT . . . the primary target should be the number of pounds you plan to lose each week. That target should be clear – and realistic. If it is, you should be able to stick to your weight loss program and enjoy success week after week, after week. AND, feel good in the process. If you are not hitting your target, be willing to look closely at what you are doing, or not doing – and figure out why you are not reaching your weekly target. Maybe the target you set was not sensible or reasonable; or, maybe you are putting too much pressure on yourself. Honest introspection is a good way to see what you are really capable of doing and then, you can develop or choose a plan that is suitable for your unique lifestyle.

News article: This article is over 2 years old Lady Gaga has reportedly been added to a list of hostile foreign forces banned by China’s Communist party after she met with the Dalai Lama to discuss yoga. The American pop singer, who has sold more than 27m albums, met the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader on Sunday before a conference in Indianapolis. China cracks down on aggrieved party cadres in Xinjiang and Tibet Read more A video of the 19-minute encounter – in which the pair pondered issues such as meditation, mental health and how to detoxify humanity – was posted on the singer’s Facebook account. The meeting sparked an angry reaction from Beijing, which has attacked the spiritual leader as a “wolf in monk’s robes”. The Dalai Lama, who fled into exile in March 1959, insists he is merely seeking greater autonomy from Chinese rule for Tibetans. But China’s rulers consider him a separatist who they claim is conspiring to split the Himalayan region from China in order to establish theocratic rule there. Following Lady Gaga’s meeting, the Communist party’s mysterious propaganda department issued “an important instruction” banning her entire repertoire from mainland China, Hong Kong’s pro-democracy newspaper Apple Daily reported on Monday. Chinese websites and media organisations were ordered to stop uploading or distributing her songs in a sign of Beijing’s irritation, the newspaper said. The propaganda department also issued orders for party-controlled news outlets such as state broadcaster CCTV and newspapers the People’s Daily and the Global Times to condemn the meeting. Asked by a foreign reporter whether the tête-à-tête would create a “bad romance” between Beijing and Lady Gaga, a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry initially hinted that he was not familiar with the pop star’s Grammy-winning back catalogue. “Who?” Hong Lei said when asked for Beijing’s view on the singer’s meeting. Benjamin Haas 本雅明 (@haasbenjamin) Me: will @ladygaga meeting with @DalaiLama lead to a bad romance with China? China Foreign Ministry spokesman: who? Hong went on to condemn the Dalai Lama’s global campaigning. “The purpose of his visits and activities in other countries is just to promote his proposal for Tibetan independence,” the spokesperson said, according to AP. “We hope that people from the international community can be fully aware of his true colours and nature.” All mention of the Lady Gaga controversy appeared to have been purged from the official transcript of that press conference. On Tuesday afternoon it was still possible to download Poker Face and Bad Romance on China’s QQ Music and NetEase Cloud Music players. But a report about the Dalai Lama’s meeting with Lady Gaga appeared to have been deleted from the NetEase website. China has previously banned artists and groups such as Maroon 5, Bjork and Oasis from performing in the country after they met with the Dalai Lama or spoke out in favour of him or Tibetan independence. Experts suggested the American singer would have gone into her meeting with the spiritual leader with her eyes wide open as to the consequences. “Lady Gaga knew how Beijing would react,” Bill Bishop, who runs the Sinocism newsletter, wrote on Twitter. “Good for her to show some courage, unlike most celebrities who are scared of bullying Beijing now.” Lady Gaga (@ladygaga) Thank you for this special day.

During her meeting with the Dalai Lama she said: “We have to cool the system down. It’s about less heat, more cooling, more relaxation but also [being] thoughtful and strategic.” ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Lady Gaga speaking at the US Conference of Mayors where she met the Dalai Lama Chinese fans have reacted with outrage to Lady Gaga's meeting with the Dalai Lama over the weekend. Her social media posts about meeting with the Tibetan spiritual leader on Sunday have led to online speculation over whether she will still be allowed to perform in the country. Lady Gaga is one of, if not the most, popular western musician in mainland China. Yet she has irked mainland fans by showing her support for the Dalai Lama, who many feel is a figurehead for Tibetan separatism. The Dalai Lama says he now advocates a \\"middle way\\" with China, seeking autonomy but not independence for Tibet. 'Has not considered Chinese fans' Lady Gaga's popularity in mainland China means that she is often a major talking point for entertainment and mainstream media there. However, such media have been notably quiet on her 26 June meeting, meaning that it largely went unnoticed. Image copyright Free Weibo Image caption Censorship-monitoring website Free Weibo said posts mentioning the meeting were censored Some Weibo users have had their posts censored for sharing pictures of the singer's Instagram post. But fans have been determined to talk about it. More than 2,000 users have reacted to one prominent user MusicWars's post about the story, calling for \\"rational views on the matter\\". Many have been quick to condemn Lady Gaga, asking whether she is \\"stupid\\" or \\"ignorant\\" on the subject of Chinese political sensitivity. \\"She has not considered Chinese fans,\\" says -GeorgeLee-, receiving over 1,000 likes. DIZzyF says \\"she has given up on the Chinese market\\" and Svaniscono7 accuses her of causing controversy to stay relevant in a waning market. \\"The political depths this turtle will go to, to stay ashore,\\" she says. Yet lotusb defends her, saying \\"she should not be ashamed\\" and adding that some of her fans had \\"gone over the Chinese firewall\\" to find out why she met the Dalai Lama, and then tried to \\"painstakingly explain her reasons to other Chinese fans\\". \\"We should respect all of her choices,\\" he added. His comment received over 400 likes. Other concerts cancelled Many Weibo users are also speculating over whether Lady Gaga's meeting will mean she is banned from performing in China in the future. A number of western acts have had their gigs cancelled in the last year, purportedly because of their links to the Dalai Lama. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Selena Gomez's gig was cancelled, reportedly because of pictures of her with the Dalai Lama In April, pop singer Selena Gomez cancelled her August 2016 tour dates in Guangzhou and Shanghai, and rumours circulated that she had been forced to do so because of photos she shared on social media with the Dalai Lama. Last September, Bon Jovi concerts in Shanghai and Beijing were also cancelled at the last minute, reportedly because the band featured the Dalai Lama in previous gigs. And in July, a Dalai Lama tweet by one member of Maroon 5 was widely believed to be the reason for the American band's cancelled Shanghai September tour.

They talked about things like yoga, meditation and being kind to each other. China's government didn't like this meeting, because they think the Dalai Lama wants Tibet to be separate from China. So, they got mad at Lady Gaga and stopped people in China from listening to her music. Some of her fans in China were also unhappy about the meeting. In the past, China has done similar things to other singers who talked to the Dalai Lama."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

First question: How did AngularJS get so popular when it is so horribly designed? Second question: How did AngularJS become popular for corporate software development? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"Completing this task requires two distinct actions: 1. Analyzing and comparing the two user questions. 2. Providing a detailed and well-thought-out answer based on my understanding of the domain. First, I'll begin by analyzing the two questions: Question 1: \\"How did AngularJS get so popular when it is so horribly designed?\\" Question 2: \\"How did AngularJS become popular for corporate software development?\\" Although the two questions are similar, as they both ask about the popularity of AngularJS, they are not the same. The first question takes into consideration the perspective of the design of AngularJS and implies a judgement about its quality (assumed negative). Meanwhile, the second question is more specific, focusing on the popularity of AngularJS within the context of corporate software development. It does not imply any judgement about AngularJS's design. So, while they both revolve around the same subject (the popularity of AngularJS), the context and point of view from each question varies, making them different questions. Now, I’ll provide an answer to both questions: 1. Despite person's perspective that AngularJS is 'horribly designed', its popularity could be attributed to various factors. AngularJS was one of the first JavaScript frameworks that proposed an efficient way to develop single-page applications (SPAs). It implemented two-way data binding and dependency Injection which became popular at its time. Furthermore, AngularJS is backed by Google, which lends it credibility and visibility in the competitive landscape of JavaScript frameworks. 2. AngularJS became popular for corporate software development for many of the reasons mentioned above, along with a few additional factors. Its strong testing capabilities made it an attractive choice for large-scale projects. Its structure and pattern encourage control and organization – an important aspect when working in a team or on large-scale applications. Its community support, comprehensive documentation and being backed by a large corporation like Google made it more trusted in a corporate setting. In conclusion, the questions are different as they are looking at the popularity of AngularJS from two different angles, one from design perspective and second from a specific application in a corporate setting. The detailed answers above provide more nuanced answers that address those specific contexts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: If I have a forgiving attitude toward someone, what do they receive? Possible A: redemption, isolation, absolution, great relief, feel better Why is \\"redemption\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Redemption\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of having a forgiving attitude towards someone mainly because the term reflects the emotional and psychological aspects of making amends or being forgiven. When one person forgives another, they essentially allow the individual who has made a mistake or hurt them to redeem themselves. Redemption involves a change or improvement in a person's actions or character, leading them to become a better version of themselves. When someone forgives another person, it provides the opportunity for personal growth and transformation. This often leads to a restored sense of worth and a renewed sense of purpose, which is why redemption is considered an outcome that aligns with human common sense in a forgiveness context. The other answers provided might also be related but are less direct outcomes than redemption: - Isolation: This may happen if forgiveness is not extended, and instead a person chooses to distance themselves from the person who hurt them. - Absolution: This term is more related to a formal pardon or release from guilt, which could be seen as a consequence of forgiveness. However, it does not necessarily convey the personal improvement or transformation aspect that redemption does. - Great relief and feel better: These are emotional states that the person being forgiven might experience. Relief and feeling better are valid reactions to being forgiven, but they don't represent the broader concept of redemption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

So when her son went round with an air rifle popping his neighbours like they were allotment pigeons, they figured all the boy really needed was a bit of attention. Shandor finally flipped one day after finding out the inbred farm boys who made his life hell most days were in fact his half-brothers. He returned home to confront his mother only to find her pritt-sticking press cuttings of the Mad Killer into a brand new scrapbook and seemingly not in the least bit concerned by her son's unexpected discovery. Luckily Shandor's shooting spree didn't do too much damage beyond putting one of his so-called new father's eyes out, which could be considered doubly unfortunate given as the so-called new father in question owned the old byre Shandor and his mother called home. After Shandor had spent enough time shut away in borstal with the kind of kids who would've sent his mother all weak at the knees, he went straight home half-expecting the byre to be boarded up with a blu-tacked note saying she was lugging her stupid arse to Texas to spring her latest psycho boyfriend from his cell on death row. Shandor was thinking how much that excuse would sit well with her as he scuffed up the stone track to the byre with a black bin-bag of belongings and a sunburned arm across his forehead to shield himself from the glare.

It helps you grow big and strong, makes you feel fresh and happy when you wake up, and helps your brain remember all those exciting things you learn every day. You know, sometimes, people find it hard to fall asleep and may not sleep soundly. In this article, I'll teach you some cool tips to have an awesome sleep every night! 1. Get enough sleep Sleeping is like fuel for your body. Just like a car needs to fill up with fuel to go vroom-vroom, your body needs sleep to feel energetic and ready to play all day long. When you're little, you need more sleep than grown-ups! Try to get around 10-13 hours of sleep every night. It may sound like a lot, but your body will thank you for it! 2. Sleep on your side Sometimes, the way we sleep can affect how well we sleep. Lying on your side can make it easier for your body to stay comfortable all night long. Think of it like this, if you were a teddy bear and you wanted to be cozy in bed, you'd snuggle up on your side too! So, when you're getting ready for bed, try rolling onto one side, and see if you sleep better. 3. Prop your head on a pillow Pillows are like soft, fluffy clouds for your head! They can help you sleep better by making you more comfy. When you lay down in bed, place a pillow under your head so it's slightly raised. This helps your neck and head stay in a good position while you sleep. It's kind of like you're building a cozy nest for your head to rest in. How cool is that? 4. Relax once you get into bed Close your eyes and think about your favorite things. Take deep, slow breaths and imagine you're in a place where you feel safe, happy, and calm, like a magical forest or your favorite playground. Pretend that all your worries and thoughts are balloons, and let them float away into the sky. Doing this can help your body know it's time to sleep. You'll be off to dreamland before you know it! 5. Tell your doctor if you have sleep apnea Sleep apnea may sound like a really big word, but it just means someone has trouble breathing while they sleep. This can make it harder for the body to get all the rest it needs. If you or your parents notice that you snore a lot, have a hard time breathing, or wake up often at night, let your doctor know. They can help you find ways to sleep better and stay healthy. Conclusion: Sleep is really important for growing up healthy, happy, and smart. The next time you're getting ready for bed, remember these tips: get enough sleep, sleep on your side, use a pillow, relax, and tell the doctor if you have sleep apnea.

Speed is a familiar rate that expresses the distance traveled by an object in a given amount of time. Wage is a rate that represents the amount of money earned by a person working for a given amount of time. Likewise, the rate of a chemical reaction is a measure of how much reactant is consumed, or how much product is produced, by the reaction in a given amount of time. The rate of reaction is the change in the amount of a reactant or product per unit time. Reaction rates are therefore determined by measuring the time dependence of some property that can be related to reactant or product amounts. Rates of reactions that consume or produce gaseous substances, for example, are conveniently determined by measuring changes in volume or pressure. For reactions involving one or more colored substances, rates may be monitored via measurements of light absorption. For reactions involving aqueous electrolytes, rates may be measured via changes in a solution’s conductivity. For reactants and products in solution, their relative amounts (concentrations) are conveniently used for purposes of expressing reaction rates. If we measure the concentration of hydrogen peroxide, H2O2, in an aqueous solution, we find that it changes slowly over time as the H2O2 decomposes, according to the equation: 2H 2 O 2(aq) ⟶ 2H 2 O(l) + O 2(g) The rate at which the hydrogen peroxide decomposes can be expressed in terms of the rate of change of its concentration, as shown here: change in concentration of reactant time interval ⎡ ⎤ ⎡ ⎤ − ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t ⎣H 2 O 2⎦ t 1 2 = − t2 − t1.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please briefly summarize this news article: Everything You Need to Know Every year, TIME names the person (or people) who wielded the most influence in the previous 12 months. This year, TIME’s editors decided on President-elect Donald Trump. Each year, readers have questions about how the Person of the Year was chosen. Here’s what you need to know about the process. When did Person of the Year start? Though the issue has become a signature feature for TIME, it started as a whim. Over the week of New Year’s Day in 1928, the editors of the magazine struggled to find someone to write about during a slow news period—so they decided to feature one person who had been influential the year before. “This was an easy choice,” wrote then-publisher P.I. Prentice in a 1945, issue looking back on the decision. “Charles Augustus Lindbergh, who had soloed the Atlantic in only 33 hours and 39 minutes, was the hero of 1927.” As a bonus, he hadn’t appeared on the cover before, and this rectified that oversight. The cover line dubbed him “The Man of the Year” and a tradition was born. Though Wallis Simpson became the first “Woman of the Year” in 1937, the title did not become gender neutral until 1999. What does it mean to be Person of the Year? The title goes to “the person or persons who most affected the news and our lives, for good or ill, and embodied what was important about the year, for better or for worse,” as former Managing Editor Walter Isaacson wrote in the 1998 issue. That means the person is not necessarily a hero—Adolf Hitler, for example, was Person of the Year in 1938, with a cover showing him playing a ghastly organ and a cover line touting, “From the unholy organist, a hymn of hate.” Stalin got the nod twice, while the selection of Iran’s Ayatullah Khomeini in 1979, when the magazine called him “the mystic who lit the fires of hatred.” And some choices have been ambiguous; take Newt Gingrich, who was a hero to some and a menace to others. How secretive is the process? Even within the newsroom, very few people know who the Person of the Year or runners-up will be. The announcement is made publicly before the issue goes to the printers, to make sure no leaks ruin the surprise. What’s the deal with the reader’s choice poll? While TIME’s editors make the final decision about who is the Person of the Year, the magazine also invites readers to weigh in on who they think has earned the title. The online poll is a valuable way to see who Internet denizens think has most affected their lives. In early years, before the Internet, readers were invited to weigh in by mail, with their suggestions often filling the letters-to-the-editor page in the weeks before the announcement. Is it always an actual person? Sometimes, TIME has chosen to highlight the influence of an object (like the personal computer in 1982) or an archetype (like the protester in 2011). In hindsight, 1982 might have been a good time to name Steve Jobs Person of the Year, a title he never won; but ideally these non-conventional choices are meant to capture a movement that’s bigger than any one individual. Why have most of the winners been men? Last year, Angela Merkel became only the fourth woman to hold the Person of the Year cover alone. (Women who have made the cover as part of a group include Madame Chiang Kai-shek and her husband as “Man and Wife of the Year” in 1937, Melinda Gates alongside her husband and Bono in 2005, and “American Women,” collectively, in 1975.) “It seems like too few women, over the course of nearly nine decades,” former Deputy Editor Radhika Jones wrote in 2013. “You can count them on two hands. But it’s a fair reminder that for much of TIME’s history, women seldom held the kinds of positions of power that would set them up for Man of the Year status … The flip side of that observation—that men have tended to hold positions of power—is that franchises like Person of the Year have tended to privilege roles traditionally held by men.”","completion":"Time Magazine has a special edition every year, called \\"Person of the Year.\\" They choose someone who had a really big influence on the world in the last 12 months. This year, they chose Donald Trump, who will be the next President of the United States. The first \\"Person of the Year\\" was in 1927, and it was a man named Charles Lindbergh who flew an airplane across the Atlantic Ocean all by himself. Sometimes, the person they choose might not be a hero, but someone who had a big impact, either good or bad. And, sometimes, they pick an object or an idea instead of a person. The editors of Time Magazine secretly pick the \\"Person of the Year,\\" and even let readers share their thoughts too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You are given a new situation: Greg is studying the environmental impact of agriculture. He noticed that in his own state a lake near agricultural lands has been declared as a dead zone. For his study Greg labeled this zone as zone A. Then he found near a national park in his state a lake is not declared as a dead zone. To further his study he labeled this zone as zone B. and a hint : Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Please answer this question : Which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, zone A or zone B? A:","completion":"To determine which zone is a result of algae overgrowth, let's consider the given information step by step. 1. Zone A is near agricultural lands and has been declared a dead zone. 2. Zone B is near a national park and has not been declared a dead zone. Considering the hint provided: 1. Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil and runoff carries it away. 2. The fertilizer (nitrogen) ends up in bodies of water. 3. The excess nitrogen causes algae to grow out of control. 4. Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water and then die. 5. Decomposers break down the dead algae and use up the oxygen in the process. 6. This creates a dead zone where nothing can grow due to the lack of oxygen. Based on this information, Zone A, which is near agricultural lands and has been declared a dead zone, is likely a result of algae overgrowth due to excess nitrogen from the nearby agricultural activities causing the conditions described in the hint. Zone B, near a national park and not declared as a dead zone, is less likely to be affected by agricultural activities and is therefore less likely to experience the same impacts from algae overgrowth. So, Zone A is a result of algae overgrowth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Constant terms are 628 and 544. 628 + 544 = 1172 So the equation becomes: -118 = 86*i + 1172 Step 2: Isolate the variable \\"i\\" by subtracting 1172 from both sides of the equation. -118 - 1172 = 86*i + 1172 - 1172 -1290 = 86*i Step 3: Solve for \\"i\\" by dividing both sides of the equation by 86. -1290 / 86 = 86*i / 86 i = -15 The solution to the problem is i = -15."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sentence 2: The it WAS in fact in Miss Howard's favour. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available choices: (a). yes. (b). it is not possible to tell. (c). no.","completion":"The available choices are (a). yes, (b). it is not possible to tell, and (c). no. To determine whether the second sentence is true if we assume the first sentence is true, let's analyze each sentence closely. Sentence 1 states: \\"But I can tell you this much – it was not in Miss Howard's favour.\\" This sentence conveys that whatever situation or event the speaker is referring to was not advantageous for Miss Howard. The speaker also claims confidence in their knowledge about the matter, even if the listener might be skeptical. Sentence 2 claims: \\"The it WAS in fact in Miss Howard's favour.\\" This sentence directly contradicts the first one, stating that the situation or event was, in reality, advantageous for Miss Howard. Now, let's evaluate the truth of the second sentence based on the assumption that the first sentence is true. If the first sentence is true, the situation or event was not in Miss Howard's favour. In this case, the second sentence, which claims that it was in Miss Howard's favour, would be false. Therefore, if we assume the truth of the first sentence, the second sentence is false. Based on our analysis, the correct choice is: (c). no. If the first sentence is true, then the second sentence is not true."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Banner A:","completion":"Title: \\"The Banner's Tale: Ink of Influence\\" In the bustling city of New York, amidst the glamour and bustle, there lies a powerful entity - \\"The Banner,\\" a renowned newspaper company that stands at the heart of our story. Our protagonist, Ellsworth Toohey, an enigmatic and sophisticated man, writes for The Banner. Passionate about architecture, Toohey is the newspaper's chief architectural critic and wields tremendous influence over public opinion. As we begin our narrative, Toohey is seen as an honest critic, using his platform in The Banner for the good of architecture and design. His life takes an unexpected turn when he comes across a young, ambitious, and talented architect, Henry Roark. Roark’s designs challenge traditional architectural norms, and Toohey finds himself in awe of Roark's work. However, Toohey feels threatened by Roark’s fresh perspectives, suspecting it could disrupt the status quo of architectural thinking that he has guided for years. Simultaneously, Toohey’s influence at The Banner is growing. He begins to leverage his standing not only to shape architectural discourse but to sway socio-political debates as well, delving into issues of corruption, wealth disparity, and gentrification. Through his words, he instigates change and becomes a celebrity in his own right. One day, Toohey discovers a scandal involving the Mayor, incriminating construction mafia, and substandard materials related to a city infrastructure project. Roark, being the architect for this project, emerges as a whistle-blower, threatening the peace of the city officials. Toohey, driven by his fear of losing influence and his envy toward Roark, manipulates information and frames Roark as the culprit in his column. Roark, misunderstood and persecuted, fights back with the truth. This initiates a cat-and-mouse game of public opinion, bias, and truth between Toohey, Roark, and The Banner. At the same time, an investigative journalist, Dominique Francon, who has been silently in love with Roark and his work, discerns Toohey’s misconduct. Despite threats to her own career, she decides to expose Toohey. The climax unfolds as Francon manages to obtain proof of Toohey's manipulation and the corrupt Mayor's deeds. On the big day, Roark’s designs for a revolutionary social housing project are set to be unveiled, Toohey plans to utilize this event to finally tarnish Roark’s career once and for all. However, Francon intervenes, revealing the true mastermind behind the scandal, vindicating Roark and exposing Toohey's manipulative character. As a result, Toohey loses his credibility, and his reign over The Banner comes to an end. Roark, once ostracized, becomes a symbol of hope and integrity for the city, and Francon's brave journalism renews faith in The Banner. In the denouement, The Banner pledges to uphold its mission of truthful journalism, ushering in a new era of journalism that values integrity over influence."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: China’s Defense Ministry said Thursday that a U.S. decision to disinvite China from a major international maritime exercise is “unconstructive.” A ministry statement said despite the decision, China will continue playing a role in “maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region.” The United States announced its move Wednesday, saying Beijing’s “destabilizing behavior” in the South China Sea is inconsistent with the principles of the U.S.-led drill. “China’s continued militarization of disputed features in the South China Sea only serve to raise tensions and destabilize the region,” read a statement from Lt. Col. Christopher Logan, a Pentagon spokesman. The statement said that disinviting China from the 2018 RIMPAC is an “initial” response to Beijing’s South China Sea activities. It did not specify what other steps may be taken. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China’s activity in the South China Sea was for self-defense and that it was a “much smaller scale” than what the United States had done in Hawaii and Guam. “We hope that the U.S. will change such a negative mindset,” he said at a joint news conference with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Since 2014, China has taken part in RIMPAC, the world’s largest international maritime drill, which is held every two years in Hawaii.

Spielberg, Austria (CNN) -- Inside the Red Bull Ring -- home to the returning Austrian Grand Prix -- Mercedes toreadors Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in Sunday's race. Hamilton flew from ninth to fourth by the end of the first lap to once again put himself into a fight with his teammate and chief world title rival. The two Mercedes circled each other like silver sharks in the final 20 laps around the undulating circuit but each time Hamilton bit into Rosberg's lead, the German responded. There was to be no final attack and Rosberg took a third win of the season to stretch his lead in the 2014 Formula One drivers' championship to 29 points. \\"It's a nice gap,\\" said Rosberg, who remains determined to stem rising expectation that he will emulate his father Keke and be crowned world champion. \\"It's still so early in the season.

With Dylan piecing together the song's sections, and the chorus that gives the song its title only emerging on take five, the session stretched through the night and into the next morning. It was not until the fifteenth take that a full version was recorded. Dylan and the band persisted until they recorded take 24 which closed the session and made it onto the album four months later. Critic Jonathan Singer credits Griffin's piano for binding the song together: \\"At the chorus, Griffin unleashes a symphony; hammering his way up and down the keyboard, half Gershwin, half gospel, all heart. The follow-up, a killer left hand figure that links the chorus to the verse, releases none of the song's tension.\\"\\"One of Us Must Know\\" is a straightforward account of a burned-out relationship. Dissecting what went wrong, the narrator takes a defensive attitude in a one-sided conversation with his former lover.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Two American scientists told the people in industrial nations that they would be much healthier if they ate more of the same kind of foods eaten by humans living more than 10,000 years ago. The scientists say that the human body has changed very little since human first appeared on earth, but the way we live has changed greatly. Our body has not been able to deal with these changes in life style and this has led to new kinds of sicknesses. These new sicknesses were not known in ancient times. So they are called \\"diseases of civilization\\". Many cancers and diseases of the blood system, including heart attacks and strokes are examples of such diseases. Scientists noted that early stone-age people used very little alcohol or tobacco, probably none. Ancient people also got a great deal of physical exercise, but a change in food is one of the main differences between life in ancient times and life today. Stone-age people hunted wild animals for their meat, which had much less fat than farm animals. They also ate a lot of fresh wild vegetables, and fruits. They did not use milk and other dairy products, and they made very little use of grains. But today, we eat a large amount of dairy products and grain foods. We eat six times more salt than stone-age people. We eat more sugar. We eat twice as much fat but only one third as much protein and much less vitamin C. People today probably do not want to live as people thousands of years ago did, but scientists say that we would be much healthier if we ate as those ancient people did, cutting the amount of fatty, salty and sweet foods.

Answer:","completion":"Yes, this product review is negative. The review highlights the initial appeal and performance of the DVD player, but ultimately emphasizes the poor quality and subsequent failure of the product after a limited amount of usage. The reviewer mentions that the DVD player appears to be a good option when looking at its features and capabilities on paper. The phrase \\"nice out of box\\" implies that the initial experience with the product was satisfactory and met expectations upon set up and first use. However, the review takes a negative turn as the writer explains that the DVD player stopped working after being used for only about 20 videos. This highlights a significant issue with the product, specifically its durability and reliability, as a properly functioning device should be expected to last longer with consistent use. Moreover, the reviewer supports their negative experience by stating that they have read several other user reviews (mainly on CNET.com) that also report product failure. By mentioning these additional negative experiences, the writer indicates that the problem may not be isolated to their specific unit and could potentially be a widespread issue affecting many users of this particular DVD player. The closing remark, \\"Think twice before choosing this poor quality machine,\\" acts as a warning to potential buyers of the product. This statement suggests that the reviewer does not recommend the DVD player due to its poor performance and disappointing longevity.

Please answer the following question: It was not entirely true that Patch knew there was food in the mountains. He had never been to the mountains. No squirrel in all the Center Kingdom, as far as he knew, had ever been to the mountains. For between the kingdom and the mountains, surrounding it on all sides like a moat around a castle, there lay a blasted concrete wasteland, as wide as fifty squirrels laid nose to tail, and horrific death machines roared up and down this wasteland at terrifying speeds, all day and night. What's more, humans and dogs often crossed between the mountains and the kingdoms. And sometimes the dogs were not leashed. A squirrel would have to be very desperate indeed to dare the wastelands. It was Toro who had told Patch about the food in the mountains. Toro was Patch's friend. And that itself was extraordinary. Patch had always talked to birds. The drey he had grown up in -- Silver's old drey, before she became leader of the Seeker clan -- had been only a few branches away from a nest of robins. Once, in early spring when he was still a baby, Patch had crawled out of Silver's drey and into the robin's nest, and had spent a whole day among the chicks before Silver returned home and retrieved him. The robin mother had been unamused by Silver's profound apologies, and even less amused when Patch had returned to her nest the very next day. Eventually Silver taught Patch to leave the robins alone, but not before he had learned how to speak Bird. Most squirrels of the Center Kingdom could say and understand a few simple things in Bird, but Patch could actually hold conversations. And so, one autumn day when a bluejay swooped past and stole an acorn out of Patch's paws, Patch shouted angrily at the thief in Bird to bring it back; and the thief, intrigued, wheeled around in midair, perched on a branch above Patch, and looked curiously down at the irate squirrel. \\"Thieving feather-brained no-nose hawkbait!\\" Patch shouted up. \\"Stupid blind furry groundworm!\\" the bluejay retorted, and began to peck at the acorn.

Based on the premise \\"In the other factor, the federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes typical of the federal sector.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"The federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise, \\"In the other factor, the federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes typical of the federal sector,\\" it seems reasonable to conclude that the hypothesis \\"The federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes\\" is true. However, it is essential to consider the context and analyze the factors in detail to provide a comprehensive understanding of the constraints faced by the federal CIO. The federal CIO (Chief Information Officer) typically operates within a uniquely complex organizational environment, characterized by various features of the federal sector. These features may include bureaucratic structures, strict regulations, budget limitations, political pressures, and a diverse array of stakeholders. All of these factors significantly influence the decision-making process and the scope of responsibilities of the federal CIO. 1. Bureaucratic structures: The federal sector is known for its hierarchical organizational structures, which can sometimes slow down decision-making and implementation processes. The CIO, being part of this system, may find it challenging to introduce innovative methods or new technologies due to bureaucratic red tape. 2. Strict regulations: In the federal sector, adherence to laws, rules, and regulations is usually a top priority. The CIO, therefore, has to ensure that any new technology, system, or process complies with all relevant government regulations and policies. This stringent requirement for compliance may limit the CIO's flexibility in implementing innovative solutions. 3. Budget limitations: The federal CIO is often subject to budget constraints and funding allocations, directly influencing their ability to invest in new technologies or initiatives. Lack of adequate funding can significantly impede the CIO's efforts in driving transformation and modernization projects. 4. Political pressures: The federal sector is influenced by political dynamics, which extend to the CIO's role. The priorities and policies of a particular administration or decision-makers can significantly impact the CIO's ability to pursue specific objectives, initiatives, or projects. 5. Multiple stakeholders: The federal CIO is responsible for managing the information technology needs of various stakeholders, both internal and external. Balancing the competing priorities and requirements of these diverse groups can be challenging, potentially limiting the CIO's capacity to drive strategic transformation and innovation. Taking these factors into consideration, the hypothesis \\"The federal CIO tends to be constrained by organizational attributes\\" is supported by the premise provided. While there are undoubtedly instances where federal CIOs are successful at implementing innovative solutions and managing risks, the nature of the federal sector and its organizational attributes may impose significant constraints and challenges on the role and responsibilities of the CIO."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Yes, both questions 1 and 2 are asking the same thing, which is how to write a letter excusing your child's absence from school. In order to address this topic, I will provide a detailed guideline on how to write the absence letter. 1. Heading: Start with your name, contact details (address, phone number, and email address), and the date at the top left corner of the letter. 2. Addressee: Write the name of the school principal, the school's name, and its address. If you know the specific person to whom you are addressing the letter, include their name and designation. 3. Subject Line: Write a brief and clear subject line that mentions the main purpose of the letter, such as \\"Excused Absence for [Child's Name]\\" or \\"Request to Excuse Absence for [Child's Name].\\" 4. Salutation: Greet the recipient with a formal salutation, such as \\"Dear Principal [Last Name]\\" or \\"Dear [Designation/Title].\\" 5. Introduction: With a clear and concise tone, clarify who you are and your main reason for writing the letter. Mention your child's name, grade, and class (if applicable). Briefly state the reason for the absence and the dates your child was/will be absent from school. 6. Reason for Absence: Explain the reason for your child's absence in more detail. If the absence is due to illness, mention the doctor's visit or recommendations, without going into too many specific medical details. If the absence is due to a family event or travel plans, explain the importance of the event or trip. Always maintain a respectful tone. 7. Offer Support: Offer assistance to the school by ensuring your child will complete any missed assignments, homework, or exams. Request information on any additional work or materials your child needs to catch up on. 8. Express Gratitude: Thank the school staff and teachers for their cooperation and understanding. Also, request that they notify you if there are any specific actions required for your child's absence to be officially excused. 9. Closing: End the letter with a formal closing, such as \\"Sincerely,\\" \\"Kind Regards,\\" or \\"Yours Faithfully,\\" followed by your full name and signature. 10. Proofread: Double-check the letter for grammar, punctuation, and spelling mistakes. Make sure the information is accurate and clear. Here is an example of a well-structured absence letter: [Your Name] [Your Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] [Phone Number] [Email Address] [Date] [Principal's Name] [School Name] [School Address] [City, State, ZIP Code] Subject: Excused Absence for [Child's Name] – [Dates of Absence] Dear Principal [Principal's Last Name], I am writing to inform you about my child, [Child's Full Name], who is in Grade [Grade], Class [Class], that he/she will be absent from school on [Dates of Absence].

To counteract this, I assure you that [Child's First Name] will complete any missed assignments, homework, or exams during his/her absence.

In this case, \\"Her cats show her plenty of affection.\\" is the fourth sentence. We need to write the fifth sentence. Part #2: The last sentence should not connect with the rest of the story. Usage: Despite the story being about Angela and her cats, the last sentence should not extend or build on the existing narrative.

Part #3: The generated sentence should be contextually relevant to the story. Usage: The new sentence should still relate to the story in some way, even if it doesn't connect to the previous narrative. For example, \\"Angela's favorite color is purple.\\", while not connected to the narrative about her cats, is still somewhat relevant because it's about Angela. This meets the criteria because it's still about the story's main character without extending the narrative about cats.

Article: Don’t assume that all employees have a universal sense of what’s right and wrong. Compile an exhaustive list of workplace standards, from acceptable language to ethical business practices. Post written standards in common areas and publish them in the employee handbook. Keep standards as specific as possible. Instead of “Be respectful,” specify that “Employees should not comment on physical appearance or make unwanted sexual advances of any kind.” Legality is important, but it doesn’t define workplace ethics. Educate employees about industry-specific regulations, but don’t limit your ethical standards to legal codes. For example, ensure that all employees know the safety standards for the products you manufacture and repair. However, set your standards beyond safety codes. If a product needs to be repaired, terminate or discipline employees if they overcharge for services by repairing parts that weren’t broken. Written ethical standards are useless if the organization’s leadership doesn’t follow them. Executives, board members, and department heads must act as role models for the rest of the organization. Furthermore, standards must be enforced consistently; a senior manager should face the same consequences as a mailroom clerk. “Do as I say, not as I do,” and “They’re breaking the rules, so I can, too,” mentalities can lead to a toxic company culture. If the head of sales fudges numbers and misleads customers to exceed quotas, your entire sales team will follow their example. The resulting company-wide ethics breakdown is a lot more difficult to handle than individual cases of misconduct. When you interview prospective employees, include specific questions that gauge their values. Hire a candidate who demonstrates strong ethical reasoning over one with dubious ethics, even if the latter has a strong professional record. For example, ask industry-specific interview questions such as, “Is it more important to meet a deadline or to ensure a product exceeds safety standards?” or “What would you do if you knew a coworker took bribes?” What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of establishing clear and specific workplace ethical standards that go beyond legal requirements. It advises companies to compile a comprehensive list of workplace standards, including acceptable language and ethical business practices, which should be posted in common areas and included in employee handbooks.

The article also recommends incorporating questions that gauge ethical values during interviews, prioritizing strong ethical reasoning over professional records in hiring decisions.

Title: The Prophecy Movie plot: Thomas Dagget, a Catholic seminary student, loses his faith when he sees disturbing visions of a war between angels. Years later, Thomas is a detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. Two angels fall to Earth: one, Simon, enters Thomas' home and warns him of coming events, before disappearing. The second, Uziel, a lieutenant of the angel Gabriel, is killed in an altercation with Simon. Investigating the disturbance, Thomas finds in Simon's apartment the obituary of a recently deceased Korean War veteran named Colonel Arnold Hawthorne and the theology thesis about angels which Thomas himself wrote in seminary. Meanwhile, in Chimney Rock, Arizona, Simon finds the dead veteran awaiting burial and sucks the evil soul out of the body. The medical examiner informs Thomas that Uziel's body is like nothing he has seen before: it has no eyes, no signs of bone growth, hermaphroditism, and the same blood chemistry as an aborted fetus. Among the personal effects found on the body is an ancient, hand-written Bible, which includes an extra chapter of the Book of Revelation that describes a second war in heaven and prophecy that a \\"dark soul\\" will be found on Earth and used as a weapon. Unknown to Thomas, Gabriel arrives on Earth. Needing a human helper, Gabriel catches Jerry, a suicide, in the moment of his death and keeps him in a state of limbo. Unhappily dominated by Gabriel, Jerry retrieves Uziel's belongings from the police station while Gabriel destroys Uziel's body in the morgue. After finding Hawthorne's obituary, Gabriel and Jerry head for Chimney Rock. Before Gabriel arrives, at the local reservation school Simon hides Hawthorne's soul in a little Native American girl, Mary, who immediately falls ill and is taken care of by her teacher, Katherine.

Mitt Romney speaks at the University of Warsaw Library in Warsaw, Poland, Tuesday, July 31, 2012. / AP Photo/Charles Dharapak Updated: 11:37 a.m. ET (CBS News) Under fire from Palestinian leaders for recent comments suggesting that Israel's economic success is borne out of its \\"culture,\\" Mitt Romney on Tuesday attempted to clarify his remarks, telling Fox News that he had not talked about \\"the Palestinian culture or the decisions made in their economy.\\" \\"I'm not speaking about it, did not speak about the Palestinian culture,\\" Romney told Fox's Carl Cameron, in an interview taped before the candidate's departure from Poland. \\"That's an interesting topic that perhaps could deserve scholarly analysis but I actually didn't address that. I certainly don't intend to address that during my campaign. Instead I will point out that the choices a society makes have a profound impact on the economy and the vitality of that society.\\" At a fundraiser in Israel on Monday, Romney, speaking to Jewish-American donors, compared Israel's economy to that of the Palestinians, noting a \\"dramatically stark difference in economic vitality.\\" (Romney delivers speech in Warsaw, Poland on Tuesday.) \\"As you come here and you see the GDP per capita, for instance, in Israel which is about 21,000 dollars, and compare that with the GDP per capita just across the areas managed by the Palestinian Authority, which is more like 10,000 per capita, you notice such a dramatically stark difference in economic vitality,\\" he said. He drew parallels between other neighboring countries with such economic disparities, such as Chile and Ecuador and Mexico and the United States, and noted his interest, as a former businessman, in determining the source of those gaps. He also referred to the book \\"The Wealth and Poverty of Nations,\\" which concludes that culture plays key role in success of nations. \\"Culture makes all the difference,\\" Romney told donors on Monday. \\"And as I come here and I look out over this city and consider the accomplishments of the people of this nation, I recognize the power of at least culture and a few other things.\\" Romney did not specifically mention Palestinian culture in his remarks, but the comparison between the Israeli and Palestinian economies, and his comments about culture, seem to suggest an implicit judgment. Romney was swiftly upbraided for the comments by Palestinian leaders, including Saeb Erekat, a senior aide to President Mahmoud Abbas of the Palestinian Authority, who told the Associated Press the remarks were racist, and failed to note the potential impact that Israel's occupation of the West Bank have had on the nation's economy. Others have also pointed out that Israel has strict trade restrictions on Palestine, which Romney did not mention. \\"It is a racist statement and this man doesn't realize that the Palestinian economy cannot reach its potential because there is an Israeli occupation,\\" Erekat told the AP. \\"It seems to me this man lacks information, knowledge, vision and understanding of this region and its people.\\" (Audio of the Romney aide's altercation with the press.) The controversy marks just one in a series of gaffes that have marked the Republican candidate's brief trip abroad. Most recently, Romney's traveling press secretary was forced to apologize after telling reporters to \\"shove it\\" and \\"kiss my a**\\" during a tense exchange in Poland. Romney dismissed the notion that his trip to Europe had been characterized by missteps, suggesting the press is focusing on the incidents in an attempt to distract voters from the real issues. \\"And I realize that there will be some in the fourth estate or whichever estate who are far more interested in finding something to write about that is unrelated to the economy to geopolitics to the threat of war to the reality of conflict in Afghanistan today to a nuclearization of Iran,\\" Romney told Cameron. \\"They'll instead try and find anything else to divert from the fact that these last four years have been tough years for our country.\\" Speaking to reporters Tuesday, top Romney strategist Stu Stevens characterized the trip as a \\"great success\\" and argued American voters aren't concerned about gaffes. \\"I think people understand that big elections are about big things. And I think that one thing we've learned about this race is only that which is important matters,\\" he said. \\"This is not a race that has been affected by small things at all. I think it means absolutely nothing to the people at home because it has no relevance to their life. It doesn't matter.\\" ||||| Mitt Romney, in an interview with Fox News, accused the media of attempting to \\"divert\\" attention from more substantive issues by harping on his so-called gaffes overseas. \\"I realize that there will be some that in the fourth estate ... who are far more interested in finding something to write about that is unrelated to the economy, to geo-politics, to the threat of war, to the reality of conflict in Afghanistan today, to nuclearization of Iran,\\" Romney told Fox News' Carl Cameron, after wrapping up his final event in Warsaw, Poland. With the candidate heading home after a weeklong tour across three countries, the Republican presidential candidate expressed frustration with the way some of his remarks have been portrayed by both the media and Democratic campaign operatives. Delivering the most outright criticism of the Obama administration since he landed on foreign soil, Romney said: \\"They'll instead try to find anything else to divert from the fact that these last four years have been tough for our country. They've been years of tumult and war and we need to see a better direction taken on the part of our nation.\\" Romney also specifically responded for the first time to remarks he made at a fundraiser in Israel Monday implying that Israel's economy is stronger than Palestine's because of culture. The comments were branded as \\"racist\\" by some Palestinian leaders, but Romney denied he was being culturally insensitive. \\"I'm not speaking about it, did not speak about the Palestinian culture or the decisions made in their economy.\\" Instead, he said he's pointing out \\"that the choices that a society makes has a profound impact on the economy and the vitality of that society.\\" The fallout from the remarks spilled over into Tuesday as he was finishing a tour of the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and a memorial for Pope John Paul II in Warsaw. Despite the somber nature of the moment, U.S. reporters shouted questions at him and were told in colorful language by a Romney aide to show respect. In the interview with Fox News, the GOP candidate maintained that he was \\"very pleased\\" with his trip -- which spanned six days and made stops in Great Britain, Israel and Poland -- despite the reports of foreign fumbles. He sat down with at least a dozen foreign leaders in all three nations, yet his official meetings seemed overshadowed by media reports of missteps. On his first day in Great Britain he became something of the British press' whipping boy when he questioned the readiness of the U.K. to host the Olympic Games. Headlines read, \\"Who invited you?\\" and \\"Mitt, the party-pooper.\\" Romney left Warsaw Tuesday afternoon Boston-bound. He will return to the States campaigning in high gear and to speculation of an impending vice presidential pick announcement. Though he wouldn't offer a timeline or even a hint as to who the pick may be, the candidate did tell Fox News about a new app called \\"Mitt's VP,\\" which allows people to be find out via mobile phone the moment he announces. While overseas, Romney kept largely to his word and refrained from criticizing the president directly, yet he told Cameron that he will not be so restrained when he gets back home. \\"I can assure you that when I land tonight, I will be back to my old and direct contrasts,\\" he said. Fox News' Nicole Busch and Carl Cameron contributed to this report. ||||| Summary:","completion":"During Mitt Romney's foreign trip, he made comments at a fundraiser in Israel suggesting that Israel's economic success compared to the Palestinians' is due to its culture. This statement faced backlash from Palestinian leaders who denounced the comments as racist and lacking understanding of the region. Romney attempted to clarify his remarks in a Fox News interview, claiming that he did not specifically discuss Palestinian culture.

However, between the three LED formats mentioned, the starburst display is the best choice for working with words."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Choices: +negative +positive","completion":"The sentiment of a tweet focusing on working on Father's Day can be interpreted in various ways, as it largely depends on the context and the language used in the tweet itself. However, to provide a detailed analysis, let's consider two possible scenarios and the sentiment that may be associated with each. Scenario 1: Negative Sentiment In this case, if the tweet carries a tone of disappointment or frustration, such as lamenting having to work on Father's Day instead of spending quality time with family, the sentiment can be described as negative. An example of such a tweet might be: \\"Can't believe I'm stuck at work on Father's Day. Really wish I could be at home celebrating with my kids 😔 #MissingOut\\" The negative sentiment here arises from the missed opportunity to enjoy Father's Day with family, leading to feelings of sadness and dissatisfaction. The use of an unhappy emoji and a hashtag like \\"#MissingOut\\" further emphasizes the negative nature of the sentiment in this case. Scenario 2: Positive Sentiment On the other hand, if the tweet has an encouraging or grateful tone, such as expressing appreciation for having a job or acknowledging the sacrifices fathers often make to support their families, the sentiment can be characterized as positive. An example of such a tweet might be: \\"Working on Father's Day, just like my dad used to do for our family. Proud to continue the tradition of hard work and dedication 💪 #Grateful #HappyFathersDay\\" In this example, there is an underlying tone of appreciation and recognition of the sacrifices fathers make for their families. The use of an uplifting emoji, as well as positive hashtags like \\"#Grateful\\" and \\"#HappyFathersDay,\\" highlight the gratitude and positivity in the tweet. In conclusion, the sentiment of a tweet about working on Father's Day can be either positive or negative, depending on the context, language, and tone employed. A thorough examination of the tweet's content, along with the use of emojis and hashtags, can provide valuable insight into the expressed sentiment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Just as there are good-quality grasses for putting greens, there are good-quality grasses for the fairway and rough. The quality of grass influences the roll of the ball as well as the ability of the player to \\"take a divot\\" (effectively, the ability to hit down into the ball, hitting the ball first, then hitting the turf and removing a portion of it as the club continues its arc). Fairways on prestigious tours, like the PGA Tour, are cut low. Mowing heights influence the play of the course. For example, the grass heights at U.S. Open events are alternated from one hole to the next in order to make the course more difficult. One example of this is the infamous roughs at U.S. Opens, which are often 3 to 5 inches high, depending on how close to the fairway or green the section of grass will be. This makes it difficult for a player to recover after a bad shot. Now, I have a new situation: The golf course at the Aurora Country Club cuts their grass to 2 1/2 inches high.

Putin told Obama that their positions on Syria do not 'coincide'","completion":"Title: Russian and U.S. Presidents Discuss Syria at G8 Summit: Positions on the Crisis Remain Divided On Monday, the G8 Summit held in Northern Ireland witnessed a crucial bilateral meeting between the presidents of Russia and the United States. Russian President Vladimir Putin and U.S. President Barack Obama engaged in a dialogue concerning the ongoing crisis in Syria. Both leaders expressed their respective countries' positions on the matter, which, according to Putin, do not 'coincide.' The G8 Summit, which took place in Northern Ireland, brought together the leaders of the most prominent and influential countries in the world. These nations include Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. This annual event provides an opportunity for the G8 leaders to address a wide range of pressing international issues, including global economic policies, environmental concerns, and matters of international security. The Syrian crisis has been one of the critical topics discussed at this year's summit due to the catastrophic humanitarian consequences and geopolitical ramifications of the ongoing conflict. During the meeting, both presidents acknowledged the escalating violence in Syria as a pressing concern that needs to be addressed immediately. The United States, along with its European allies, has been vocal in their support for the Syrian opposition. On the other hand, Russia has maintained its stance of backing the current government in Syria, led by President Bashar al-Assad. Consequently, President Putin's statement that their positions on Syria do not 'coincide' underscores the apparent disagreement between the two nations over the ideal solution to the crisis. Despite the differing viewpoints, both leaders have repeatedly emphasized the importance of finding a political and diplomatic resolution to the Syrian crisis. President Obama has noted the urgency of ensuring that the Assad regime complies with international law and respects human rights, while also considering the potential threat of extremist groups in the region. On the other hand, President Putin has emphasized the need to uphold the principles of international law and state sovereignty, expressing concerns over external intervention in Syria's internal affairs. The divide between Russia and the United States on the Syrian crisis has led to a complex diplomatic landscape, involving relationships between not only the two major powers but also other nations and non-state actors that are directly or indirectly involved in the conflict. While the United States and its allies have been calling for increased support to the Syrian opposition, Russia remains committed to engaging with the Assad government through dialogue and negotiations. Despite the discord between the Russian and U.S. positions, the meeting at the G8 Summit has underscored the importance of continued dialogue and cooperation in addressing the Syrian crisis. Both Presidents have emphasized a shared commitment to minimizing human suffering and ensuring regional stability in the Middle East. As the international community continues to grapple with the complexities of the Syrian situation, it is crucial that all parties involved, including Russia and the United States, collaborate to achieve a political solution to the crisis that respects human rights, state sovereignty, and international law. In conclusion, the recent bilateral meeting between Russian and U.S. presidents at the G8 Summit has highlighted their differing positions on the Syria crisis. While both nations have recognized the importance of finding a political solution to the issue, their approach to the central aspects of the conflict remains distinct. The dialogue between the two leaders emphasizes the necessity for continued collaboration and negotiation between all parties involved in the Syrian crisis, underpinned by a mutual commitment to finding a resolution that adheres to international law and protects human rights."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

No. Given those answer options, answer the question: If I tell you that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger, and ask you the question \\"what can make cells appear bigger?\\", is the correct answer \\"prolactin release\\"? A:","completion":"Based on the provided answer options (i) Yes and (ii) No, neither of these directly answers the question \\"what can make cells appear bigger?\\" when given the context that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger. However, I will provide a detailed explanation of the topic. Electron microscopes use a beam of electrons to magnify an image of a sample, allowing researchers to study cellular structures and details at much higher resolutions compared to traditional light microscopes. This makes cells appear larger because it provides a significantly higher magnification and resolution. Consequently, the correct answer that relates to what can make cells appear larger in the context provided is the electron microscope. On the other hand, prolactin release is not the right answer for this question. Prolactin is a hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland, primarily associated with lactation and breast development in mammals. It can also influence cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation in various tissues but does not play a direct role in the visual magnification or enlargement of cells as observed through a microscope. In summary, the correct answer for what can make cells appear bigger, given the context that Electron microscopes can make cells appear larger, is not \\"prolactin release.\\" Instead, it is the electron microscope that enables the magnification and visualization of cells at a much higher resolution, making them appear larger."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This might be something you need an adult's help with because the oven can be very hot! Next step is to prepare our baking pan. A baking pan is a flat tray where we will place our squash to cook in the oven. We need to grease, or put some oil on the pan, so our squash won't stick to it while it cooks.

Squash is a yummy vegetable that comes in many shapes and colors, but for this recipe, you can choose any kind of squash you like! We need to put the squash in the baking pan and mix it with some oil. This will make sure our squash gets a beautiful golden color when it cooks. Once our squash is all mixed with oil, we can put the pan in the oven that we preheated before. Remember, ovens are hot, so always ask for the help of an adult. We need to let the squash cook inside the oven for about 10 to 15 minutes. We can use this time to do a little dance, sing a song, or draw a picture to make the waiting fun! After the squash finishes cooking, we're almost ready to eat! We need to take the pan out of the oven very carefully (with an adult's help, of course!) and let it cool down for a bit. Then, we have a special ingredient to add: minced parsley! Minced means the parsley has been chopped into teeny tiny pieces. All we need is 1 tablespoon (4 g) of this minced parsley, sprinkled all over the cooked squash like magical fairy dust. This will add a yummy flavor and make our dish look extra pretty! And there you go, my little chef friends! Your Oven-Roasted Squash is now ready to be enjoyed by you and your family.

Formed from land donated by the states of Maryland and Virginia, the initial shape of the federal district was a square measuring 10 miles (16 km) on each side, totaling 100 square miles (259 km2).Two pre-existing settlements were included in the territory: the port of Georgetown, Maryland, founded in 1751, and the city of Alexandria, Virginia, founded in 1749. During 1791–92, Andrew Ellicott and several assistants, including a free African American astronomer named Benjamin Banneker, surveyed the borders of the federal district and placed boundary stones at every mile point. Many of the stones are still standing.A new federal city was then constructed on the north bank of the Potomac, to the east of Georgetown. On September 9, 1791, the three commissioners overseeing the capital's construction named the city in honor of President Washington. The federal district was named Columbia (a feminine form of \\"Columbus\\"), which was a poetic name for the United States commonly in use at that time. Congress held its first session in Washington on November 17, 1800.Congress passed the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801 that officially organized the District and placed the entire territory under the exclusive control of the federal government. Further, the unincorporated area within the District was organized into two counties: the County of Washington to the east of the Potomac and the County of Alexandria to the west.

At a ceremony Monday, the Israeli interior ministry in Jerusalem handed Sandra Samuel her identity card. \\"I hope I will honor the citizenship and love Israel. I would give my heart and soul for Israel,\\" she said. Samuel has been caring for the boy, Moshe Holtzberg, since his parents died in the terror attacks on a Jewish cultural center, Chabad House, and several luxury hotels in India's financial capital. They were among six people who were killed at Chabad House. Altogether, more than 160 people died in the attacks. During the raids, 10 men also attacked buildings including the luxury Taj Mahal Palace and Tower and Oberoi-Trident hotels and the city's Chhatrapati Shivaji train station. The only surviving gunman, Mohammed Ajmal Kasab, a Pakistani, was convicted of murder, conspiracy, and waging war. Moshe's father, Rabbi Gavriel Noach Holtzberg, and his pregnant wife, Rivka, ran the Mumbai headquarters of the Chabad community -- a Hasidic Jewish movement. Samuel, who worked as a cook and nanny at the Chabad House, found Moshe -- who turned 2 just after the attacks -- standing between the bodies of his slain parents.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. it would be a long time before the dust from the books of old was removed. How would the previous sentence be correctly capitalized?","completion":"The previous sentence is correctly capitalized if written as follows: \\"It would be a long time before the dust from the books of old was removed.\\" In English grammar, the first letter of the first word in a sentence should be capitalized. In this sentence, the word \\"it\\" is the first word and it should be capitalized, as is done above. The rest of the sentence does not require capitalization as it does not contain any proper nouns, acronyms, initialisms, or any other word that usually needs capitalization. Capitalization in English is used at the beginning of sentences, for proper nouns (like names and places), and for important words in titles. It is also used for the pronoun \\"I\\", and for acronyms and initialisms (like \\"NASA\\" or \\"FBI\\"). The sentence given as an example is quite straightforward and doesn't contain special cases. Capitalization can become a bit more complex when dealing with titles, direct speech, certain types of nouns (proper nouns), or the pronoun \\"I\\". In titles, most style guides suggest capitalizing the first and last word of the title, and all nouns, pronouns, verbs, adverbs, and adjectives. Articles, conjunctions, and prepositions are usually in lower case, unless they are the first or last word of the title. In direct speech, every separate speech starts with a capital letter, no matter where in the sentence it appears. And finally, the English language has a unique rule for capitalizing the pronoun \\"I\\", probably because of its visual impact and readability concerns. This is almost unique among languages, as most other languages do not capitalize the first-person singular pronoun. In your sentence, none of these special cases occurs, making the correct capitalization relatively simple."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These court categories were not, however, wholly exclusive: for instance, the Islamic courts—which were the Empire's primary courts—could also be used to settle a trade conflict or disputes between litigants of differing religions, and Jews and Christians often went to them to obtain a more forceful ruling on an issue. The Ottoman state tended not to interfere with non-Muslim religious law systems, despite legally having a voice to do so through local governors. The Islamic Sharia law system had been developed from a combination of the Qur'an; the Hadīth, or words of the prophet Muhammad; ijmā', or consensus of the members of the Muslim community; qiyas, a system of analogical reasoning from earlier precedents; and local customs.

Hoagland Howard \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael (November 22, 1899 - December 27, 1981) was an American composer, pianist, singer, actor, and bandleader. American composer and author Alec Wilder described Carmichael as the \\"most talented, inventive, sophisticated and jazz-oriented of all the great craftsmen\\" of pop songs in the first half of the twentieth century. Carmichael was one of the most successful Tin Pan Alley songwriters of the 1930s, and was among the first singer-songwriters in the age of mass media to utilize new communication technologies, such as television and the use of electronic microphones and sound recordings. Carmichael composed several hundred songs, including fifty that achieved hit record status. Carmichael and lyricist Johnny Mercer received an Academy Award for Best Music, Song, for \\"In the Cool, Cool, Cool of the Evening,\\" which was featured in the 1951 film Here Comes the Groom. \\"Ole Buttermilk Sky\\" received an Oscar nomination for Best Music, Song, of 1946, but it was not the winner. Carmichael's recording of \\"Star Dust\\" in 1927 at the Gennett Records studio that includes him playing the piano solo was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame. In addition, it was selected for inclusion in the National Recording Registry at the Library of Congress in 2004. Carmichael was inducted into the Hollywood Walk of Fame on February 8, 1960. (His sidewalk star tribute is located at 1720 Vine Street in Hollywood.) In 1971 Carmichael was inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame as one of its initial ten inductees. In 2007 Carmichael was inducted into the Gennett Records Walk of Fame in Richmond, Indiana. Bronze and ceramic medallions, one for each of the inductees, have been placed near the location of the Starr Piano Company's manufacturing complex, the site of the Gennett Records studio where he first recorded \\"Star Dust\\" in 1927. On July 5, 2008, a mural with his portrait was dedicated to him on the south wall of the Readmore building in Richmond, Indiana. Carmichael is memorialized with an Indiana state historical marker, installed in 2007 in front of the former Book Nook (one of Carmichael's favorite local hangouts) on South Indiana Avenue, near the corner of Kirkwood and Indiana Streets in Bloomington. The marker is located across the street from the heart of the Indiana University campus. In 2008 the bronze Hoagy Carmichael Landmark Sculpture by artist Michael McAuley was installed at the northeast corner of the IU Auditorium on IU's Bloomington campus. On June 27, 1979, the Newport Jazz Festival honored Carmichael with a tribute concert, \\"The Star Dust Road: A Hoagy Carmichael Jubilee\\", at New York City's Carnegie Hall. \\"Georgia On My Mind\\", composed by Carmichael with lyrics by Stuart Gorrell, is the U.S. state of Georgia's official song.","completion":"This text is about Hoagland Howard \\"Hoagy\\" Carmichael, an American composer, pianist, singer, actor, and bandleader who was born on November 22, 1899 and passed away on December 27, 1981.

Glass expands when heated, and contracts as it cools, and this is sufficient to stick glasses together in some cases.","completion":"To separate the stuck glasses effectively, it is essential to carefully manipulate their temperature to cause this expansion and contraction. Begin by filling the stuck glasses with cold water for the inner glass, and then submerge the outer glass in a container of warm water.

This temperature difference will help to loosen the bond between the two glasses.

The story is interesting and deals with time traveling. A virus killed a lot of people back in 1997 and a guy named Cole (Bruce Willis) is send back to 1990 and 1996 to find a cure for the virus. In 1990 he is arrested and put in a mental hospital. There he meets Jeffrey Goines (Brad Pitt), who probably has something to do with the virus. He also meets psychiatrist Dr. Kathryn Railly (Madeleine Stowe) who doesn't believe him in 1990. When Cole disappears from the mental hospital while he is chained and locked in a room and re-appears in 1996 Kathryn starts believing Cole's stories. The movie constantly plays with time. Cole makes a phone call and leaves a message in 1996, it is picked up in the future and \\"they\\" send someone. For Cole that someone appears only seconds after the phone call.

Do you know about football, the game where players kick a ball with their feet and try to shoot it into a big net? Well, in England, there are people who play football as their job! These people are called professional footballers. Now, sometimes people like to guess which team will win a football match and they put some money on their guess, which is called betting. But starting from the next football season, all the professional footballers in England won't be allowed to do that anymore. They will be banned, which means they're not allowed, from betting on football matches. This new rule is being made to make sure that the games are fair and that the football players only focus on playing and winning the game with their team.

Answer:","completion":"William de Chesney (dates unknown, died in 1174) was a significant figure in medieval England, known for his service as the sheriff of Suffolk and Norfolk. He held this office on two occasions - first, between 1146 and 1149, and later between 1156 and 1162 - during which he would have been responsible for maintaining law and order and collecting taxes on behalf of the king. William married a woman named Gilla, with whom he had three children: Margaret, Clemence, and Sara. His family life would have played a crucial role in his social standing and influence within the community. As the sheriff of both Suffolk and Norfolk, William de Chesney had considerable responsibility and jurisdiction over a large area in Eastern England. He would have been responsible for overseeing the administration of justice, enforcing royal policies, and ensuring that taxes and other forms of revenue were properly collected and submitted to the crown. He was appointed to this position for his first term, which began between 1146 and 1149, and seems to have performed well, as he was reappointed for the second term in 1156. During his tenure as sheriff, William may have faced various challenges, such as implementing new laws, dealing with disputes between landowners, and curbing violence or unrest within the region. However, he must have been effective in overcoming these problems, as he managed to retain his position until the end of his second term in 1162. William de Chesney passed away in 1174, leaving behind a legacy as a dedicated and competent administrator who had successfully managed the complex tasks involved in being a sheriff of two major English counties. His descendants would likely have continued to enjoy the social and political influence he had gained during his lifetime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

I ordered one of their 8 omelet choices, and it was overcooked, and with pieces of fat instead of ham. It even had a bone splinter in there. The toast was soaked in butter, not that I asked for butter on it, but apparently that's the default. The hash-browns were OK, and the coffee kept coming, although it wasn't special. I don't expect much from a cheap diner, but a decent omelet is minimum. My girlfriends High Protein, Low Calorie order also came with butter-dripping toast.

Q:Generate a question that has the following answer: Beowulf and his men celebrate in Heorot to lure Grendel out. for the following movie plot: Movie opens up with a celebration in the Great Hall of Heorot, built by Hrothgar (Anthony Hopkins), king of the Danes. The Danes are celebrating the completion of the Hall, and theyre really boozing it up and partying quite loudly. Booziest of all is Hrothgar himself quite inebriated, half-naked, slurring his words and barely able to keep his balance. He's somewhat repulsive and a bit of an embarrassment to his young wife, Queen Wealthow (Robin Wright Penn).The revelers begin to chant, pounding the ground in time with the chanting. The camera pulls away from the Hall, to the snowy hills surrounding the kingdom, where the chanting and thumping have died out and all is silent. Finally, we pull into a cave miles away, where the chanting and thumping are suddenly heard at an almost unbearably loud level. We hear something in the cave screaming in pain, as if the noise is too much for it to bear.Back to Heorot, where after-hours are still rocking full-blast. The large wooden entrance doors are blasted off their hinges, the halls torches blow out, and the hearth in the middle of the hall erupts in eerie blue flames. People start wigging, as we hear same the something from the cave screaming right outside Heorot's doorway. As the Danes gird their loins and take up arms, the creature enters.It's huge, about 15 feet tall and vaguely humanoid in appearance, but clearly not all human. Its misshapen, deformed, and appears to have, instead of ears, some highly sensitive pads that serve as hearing organs. The screaming of the Danes seems to hurt the creatures ears and, enraged, he begins to tear the revelers apart, literally.Eventually, the creature makes his way to Hrothgar, who, to his credit, didn't run away in a drunken panic, but held his ground. The King demands that the monster fight him, but the creature is unafraid. It simply takes a long almost quizzical look at Hrothgar and abruptly withdraws.Back at his cave, the monster is chastised by his mother for killing men. We don't see his mother, though we catch...

Step 2: Analyze the hypothesis The hypothesis states that the speaker was under the impression that it was in the nineties in San Antonio yesterday. Step 3: Compare the information in the premise and the hypothesis The information about San Antonio's temperature in the premise aligns with the hypothesis: the speaker mentions in the premise that they think they heard about the nineties temperatures in San Antonio yesterday.

The second sentence shares some similarity to the first one – the subject spent three years in Germany and then moves back to Japan with his family. Here, the subject most likely lived in Japan before residing in Germany and then returned to Japan again with his family after the three-year stay in Germany.

Please answer the following question: It was September of 2003 and I was struggling to find work after experiencing downsizing . I had fallen on some of the grandest challenges of my life. I found myself sitting in my house constantly worried. I decided to force myself to find some volunteer work to occupy my thoughts. The first place I sought out was the Arizona Humane Society. It offered me a program, \\"Equestrian Therapy Program\\" ,whose mission is to build self-esteem and confidence in children who have been through difficult times in their lives. Being with animals was the only time I truly felt 1 had a place in the world. But I had never been around a horse in my life. I found myself a little apprehensive during my first day--being around such large strong animals was much harder than the three cats I'm accustomed to caring for. I found that I wasn't different during my first day around these fantastic creatures from the kids who came into the program. But there is a strange transformation when one is around horses. I found myself playing the role of student, observer, teacher, mentor, worker, friend, and companion; not only to the kids,but to the horses and staff! Before long, I was good at handling the horses and kids and having a grand time working with human and animal elements equally. I realize this experience has helped me to develop my horizons in ways I never thought likely. I started this wanting to give others help and realized in doing so I was the one who really benefited the most. 1 believe the companionship and peace that comes from working with our animal brothers is something that can and will make the world a better place!
