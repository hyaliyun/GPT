Haruki Murakami (Cun Shang Chun Shu , Murakami Haruki, born January 12, 1949) is a Japanese writer. His books and stories have been bestsellers in Japan as well as internationally, with his work being translated into 50 languages and selling millions of copies outside his native country. The critical acclaim for his fiction and non-fiction has led to numerous awards, in Japan and internationally, including the World Fantasy Award (2006) and the Frank O'Connor International Short Story Award (2006). His oeuvre received, for example, the Franz Kafka Prize (2006) and the Jerusalem Prize (2009). The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle (1995) is a novel that fuses the realistic and fantastic, and contains elements of physical violence. It is also more socially conscious than his previous work, dealing in part with the difficult topic of war crimes in Manchukuo (Northeast China). The novel won the Yomiuri Prize, awarded by one of his harshest former critics, Kenzaburo Oe, winner of the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1994. The processing of collective trauma soon became an important theme in Murakami's writing, which had previously been more personal in nature. Murakami returned to Japan in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack. He came to terms with these events with his first work of non-fiction, Underground, and the short story collection after the quake. Underground consists largely of interviews of victims of the gas attacks in the Tokyo subway system. Murakami himself mentions that he changed his position from one of \\"detachment\\" to one of \\"commitment\\" after staying in the United States in 1991. \\"His early books, he said, originated in an individual darkness, while his later works tap into the darkness found in society and history.\\" English translations of many of his short stories written between 1983 and 1990 have been collected in The Elephant Vanishes. Murakami has also translated many works of F. Scott Fitzgerald, Raymond Carver, Truman Capote, John Irving, and Paul Theroux, among others, into Japanese. Murakami took an active role in translation of his work into English, encouraging \\"adaptations\\" of his texts to American reality rather than direct translation. Some of his works which appeared in German turned out to be translations from English rather than from Japanese (South of the Border, West of the Sun, 2000; The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 2000s), encouraged by Murakami himself. Both were later re-translated from Japanese. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: When did he return to Japan?","completion":"Haruki Murakami returned to Japan in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack. It's essential to note that the Kobe earthquake occurred in 1995 and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack happened in 1995 as well. This information is derived from the text which states, \\"Murakami returned to Japan in the aftermath of the Kobe earthquake and the Aum Shinrikyo gas attack.\\" Thus, it can be concluded that Haruki Murakami returned to Japan in 1995."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Prime Minister Tony Abbott has promised 'good government starts today,' after surviving an attempt to spill the Liberal leadership that he called 'a very chastening experience.' But Mr Abbott's future as prime minister remains in doubt after 39 of his own MPs voted for the spill in the secret party room ballot. A majority of the Liberal backbench is thought to have voted against the prime minister, with the vote count totalling 61 votes to 39. The vote count is considered so dire for Mr Abbott because there was no direct challenger for his leadership. In a recorded statement released following the vote, Mr Abbott said: 'The Liberal Party has dealt with the spill motion and now this matter is behind us.' 'We are absolutely determined to work for you, the people.' Scroll down for video. Relieved: Mr Abbott enjoys a moment of peace during a press conference this afternoon. He survived a leadership motion, telling reporters: 'Good government starts today' While Mr Abbott expressed contrition about his performance in recent weeks, Opposition Leader Bill Shorten today revelled in the prime minister's misfortune, questioning whether he had the mandate to remain leader. Isolation: Prime Minister Tony Abbott, pictured in Parliament, was deserted by 39 of his colleagues who voted against the spill. Leadership murmurs: Mr Abbott was not opposed by any of his colleagues, including Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull. The pair are pictured sharing a moment on the floor of Parliament today. Discussion: Mr Abbott is now formulating plans on how his team can claw back support in the polls. Survivor: Mr Abbott has survived the threat to his leadership, but 39 of his own MPs voted against his leadership. The victor: Prime Minister Tony Abbott walks from the party room after a majority of his backbench voted against his leadership. Mr Abbott is due to give his first statement to the media following the vote shortly. At a press conference later, Mr Abbott conceded the government had been having a difficult time recently, citing the Queensland election result that delivered a massive swing against the Liberals. 'Who wouldn't be nervous after watching the result in Queensland,' he said. 'So all of us are determined to lift our game and the fundamental point I make is that the solution to all of these things is good government. 'And good government starts today.' Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting on Monday morning flanked by a large throng of supporters. Malcolm Turnbull - his potential leadership rival - was not one of them, sidling into the meeting on his own. Mr Turnbull has remained coy about his position and has not publicly challenged the leader. Today's vote was instigated by rebellious backbenchers, who revolted following his controversial decision to knight Prince Philip and the disastrous defeat of Campbell Newman's Liberal National government in Queensland two weeks ago. Mr Abbott faced more grim news this morning, with a Newspoll commissioned by the Australian newspaper finding that more than 68 per cent of voters are dissatisfied with his performance. Worse, the Newspoll figures revealed Mr Turnbull was by far the preferred Liberal Party leader, with 64 per cent voting in support of him compared to just 25 per cent backing Mr Abbott. On a two-party preferred basis, Labor led the Coalition by 14 points, 57 points to 43. The poor approval ratings are the most bleak ranking for a Prime Minister in more than 20 years, comparable only to Paul Keating in 1994. Mr Abbott began today with a visit to a Canberra church. It was a traditional service held at the beginning of each parliamentary sitting year. He told reporters afterwards that the government would 'get on with being the government we were elected to be' following the vote. Contrast: Mr Abbott swept into the party room meeting accompanied by his deputy leader, Julie Bishop and a huge column of supporters. On his own: Malcolm Turnbull arrived to today's party room meeting without any supporters in tow. Cheeky stunt: Labor bigwigs Bill Shorten (centre), Tanya Plibersek and Penny Wong swept by the assembled media after buying coffees. Time to pray: Mr Abbott appeared with his wife, Margie, at a traditional church service prior to the beginning of the year's first sitting week of Parliament. After grim polling this morning, Mr Abbott is facing one of the most critical tests of his leadership in the form of a spill motion this morning. Tony Abbott and his family spent time in Sydney's China Town on Sunday afternoon after he had announced the spill motion would take place in Canberra on Monday. Tony Abbott claims he has moved the spill motion forward because, 'the last thing Australia needs right now is instability'. However, others believe he made the decision to avoid an awkward question time on Monday. Senior Liberal figure Arthur Sinodinos has said he is very disappointed by Prime Minister Tony Abbott's decision to move the spill motion forward to Monday, and revealed he will vote in favour of a spill. The most influential person to come out in favour of the spill motion was Liberal Senator Arthur Sinodinos, the former chief of staff to Prime Minister John Howard. 'I believe it will help precipitate a discussion', Senator Sinodinos told Fairfax Media on Sunday. He said he was 'very disappointed' with the Prime Minister's decision to move the spill forward from Tuesday to Monday. He said: 'MPs should be given time to discuss the matter at hand. Tuesday is the time to do that.' Treasurer Joe Hockey has said any Cabinet minister who supports the Liberal leadership spill motion should resign. Mr Hockey said he expected all cabinet members to reject the spill motion, but if they supported it they should declare their hand now. 'If I disagreed with the prime minister and if I believed he wasn't the best person to lead the team I would step down from the cabinet - that is the appropriate thing to do,' he told Sky News on Sunday. He said he trusted his Cabinet colleagues Malcolm Turnbull and Julie Bishop. 'If you are going to be disloyal to someone, you should front them,' Mr Hockey said. He expected the motion would be voted down, but not unanimously. 'There will always be a third of the party room that are upset about one thing or another,' he said. The treasurer rejected media reports that he could lose his job in a compromise to head off the leadership spill. 'I think everyone should do the jobs they have and properly serve the Australian people, not engage in commentary on gossip.' Mr Hockey stood by the government's controversial decisions to overhaul Medicare, higher education, pensions and welfare, which have contributed to the leadership unrest. 'We have no choice,' he said of the budget changes. Queensland MP Wyatt Roy, 24, has also declared that he will vote in favour of the motion to spill the leadership of the government. Wyatt (left) is pictured with Abbott in 2010. Communications Minister Malcolm Turnbull welcomed Foreign Minister Julie Bishop to Sydney on Sunday. Mr Turnbull has only voiced his opposition to Mr Abbott moving the vote forward, labelling it a 'captain's call' - what the prime minister has dubbed some of his less popular decisions, including knighting Prince Philip. Mr Turnbull said anyone was in a position to contest the leadership without being disloyal. 'If, for whatever reason, the leadership of a political party is vacant then any member of the party can stand, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, without any disloyalty to the person whose leadership has been declared vacant,' he said outside his home on Sunday. On Sunday Mr Abbott said he wanted to deal with the spill line 'as quickly as possible' so the Liberal party can put the matter behind them. 'The only question for our party is do we want to reduce ourselves to the level of the Labor party in dragging down a first term prime minister,' he said. 'Now obviously I've been talking to many colleagues over the last few days and my very strong sense is that we are determined to do what we are elected to do - to clean up Labor's mess and to give our people the economic security and the national security that they need and deserve.' Turnbull has refused to deny he will challenge the Prime Minister for leadership of the Liberal party, and said if anyone stands for a vacant position that does not mean they are disrespecting the person whose leadership has been declared vacant. Malcolm Turnbull refused to say if he will run for the leadership but maintains he supports Mr Abbott in line with cabinet solidarity. As Prime Minister Tony Abbott battles to secure the backing of his own party members amidst next week's leadership spill motion, a new Galaxy poll has revealed that 55 per cent of voters want him to stand down. As reports that Malcolm Turnbull will contest the leadership continue to circulate, the poll showed he would improve the Liberal's chance of winning at the next election if he were made Prime Minister. Foreign Minister Julie Bishop is also preferred as leader when measured up against Mr Abbott, but still not as much as a Labor government according to the 53:47 two-party preferred vote focused on her taking the top spot. There may be some hope yet for Mr Abbott, as sources reveal Mr Turnbull would offer him his support on Tuesday if he were to be promised the role of Treasurer, dumping Joe Hockey (pictured) from the position. The Communications Minister took to Twitter this week to deny he was in secret meetings with deputy leader Julie Bishop. He also revealed he believes the spill will fail and if so he will take that as an endorsement of his leadership. Ms Bishop said as Mr Abbott's deputy, she supported the prime minister. Luke Simpkins, pictured with potential leadership contender Malcolm Turnbull, has announced he will move for a federal Liberal leadership spill.

He travelled from his base in London to Kenya in 2012 to spend three months working with 88mph, a seed investment firm based in Kenya, where he launched Mdundo, a mobile platform for downloadable African music. Originally, Nielsen intended to manage the business from Europe, but he soon relocated to Kenya after finding the local and regional market a much more attractive place for entrepreneurs. Martin Nielsen (left), Founder & CEO, MdundoCredit: Mdundo In three years, Nielsen’s business, Mdundo, has become one of the continent’s leading music service sites with more than 1,000,000 active users every month, mainly from Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Nigeria. More than 25,000 musicians – well known, and undiscovered, from across Africa contribute to Mdundo, earning revenue every time a user downloads their music. Nielsen believes the same level of growth would have been impossible in Europe. He says there are many compelling reasons for entrepreneurs to consider relocating to smaller markets relevant to their business plans. Amy Guttman: Why did decide to relocate to Africa? Martin Nielsen: The startup space is less crowded here and the problems are much more visible. You cannot go for a walk in Europe without someone talking about starting a business to solve a problem that likely doesn’t exist. Here, problems are real and practical solutions are valuable. Guttman: Basing Mdundo in Kenya makes sense, since the business is Africa-focused. Why does it make sense for other founders to relocate to Africa? Nielsen: Three things stand out as being much easier for starting a business in Africa, than Europe. The way we clear rights here is very similar to Soundcloud because of the difficulty of acquiring music rights in Africa (for Soundcloud the issue is DJ mixes) and we follow the same monetisation philosophy than Spotify, however we build our products to tailor for a wide range of low end devices and we tailor our payment systems to mobile money solutions currently penetrating the African market.

Given the question: Given the following context: By the early 20th century, major river-control projects had begun to take place. Levees were constructed along the river in most urban areas, and Portland built concrete walls to protect its downtown sector. In the following decades, many large dams were built on Cascade Range tributaries of the Willamette. The Army Corps of Engineers operates 13 such dams, which affect flows from about 40 percent of the basin. Most of them do not have fish ladders.With development in and near the river came increased pollution. By the late 1930s, efforts to stem the pollution led to formation of a state sanitary board to oversee modest cleanup efforts. In the 1960s, Oregon Governor Tom McCall led a push for stronger pollution controls on the Willamette. In this, he was encouraged by Robert (Bob) Straub—the state treasurer and future Oregon governor (1975)—who first proposed a Willamette Greenway program during his 1966 gubernatorial campaign against McCall. The Oregon State Legislature established the program in 1967. Through it, state and local governments cooperated in creating or improving a system of parks, trails, and wildlife refuges along the river. In 1998, the Willamette became one of 14 rivers designated an American Heritage River by former U.S. President Bill Clinton. By 2007 the Greenway had grown to include more than 170 separate land parcels, including 10 state parks. Public uses of the river and land along its shores include camping, swimming, fishing, boating, hiking, bicycling, and wildlife viewing.In 2008, government agencies and the non-profit Willamette Riverkeeper organization designated the full length of the river as the Willamette River Water Trail. Four years later, the National Park Service added the Willamette water trail—expanded to 217 miles (349 km) to include some of the major tributaries—to its list of national water trails. The water-trail system is meant to protect and restore waterways in the United States and to enhance recreation on and near them.A 1991 agreement between the City of... answer the following question: What is the full name of the person that named the river that had cleanup efforts begin in the 1930s get a American Heritage River?

Five years earlier, Welbach had caused a traffic accident in which he hit the car of local mobster Arnold Margolese (Gene Hackman), who was jailed for five years after the police searched his car following the crash, finding someone tied up in his trunk. In compensation for the jail time, Welbach has been sent on various errands by Margolese's prickly second-in-command, Bernie Nayman (Bob Balaban). Retrieving the gun will be his final errand. Welbach has a girlfriend, Samantha (Julia Roberts), with whom he argues constantly and who leaves Jerry prior to the trip over his lack of commitment to their relationship. Jerry arrives in Mexico and makes his way to pick up Beck (David Krumholtz), the Margolese employee now in possession of the gun. There, a drunken Beck tells Jerry about the gun's history as a suicide weapon used as part of a jilted love-triangle between a woman, a nobleman, and the son of the gunsmith who forged the weapon, as well as its curse to misfire. Jerry helps Beck to his car, only for the man to be killed by celebratory gunfire from a nearby festival.

Net debt has also been cut by about £10.7m to £126.7m, which the group said was in line with its long term strategy. It also highlighted a number of key investments. They include energy projects and a major redevelopment at Dalkeith Country Park. Chief Executive Officer John Glen said: \\"As a business, we are committed to playing a leading role in stimulating economic development in the rural economies in which we live and work. \\"A number of major initiatives and investments have been made in the hospitality, leisure and energy elements of the business. \\"A new multi-million pound food, drink, retail and wellness space, named the Restoration Yard is being created within Dalkeith Country Park's former stable yard, alongside a spectacular new adventure playground.\\" He said more than £7m of private money would be invested in the project, which was due to open this summer and should create more than 40 new jobs. He said \\"significant steps\\" had also been taken to convert the opencast coal site at Glenmuckloch near Kirkconnel in Dumfries and Galloway into an energy park. He claimed plans for a pumped storage hydro scheme on the site could create 270 construction posts for a period of five to seven years. The group has also announced scoping for two further potential wind farms in the North Lowther Hills and at Hopsrig, both in Dumfries and Galloway.

Two countries used different methods to produce their energy. Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used Nuclear fission. Which country caused more acid rain? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy.","completion":"Based on the provided information, Albania, which used fossil fuels, likely caused more acid rain. Step-by-step reasoning: 1. Comparing the energy production methods: Albania used fossil fuels, while Croatia used nuclear fission. 2. The hint states that burning fossil fuels leads to air pollution, acid rain, and global warming, while nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the associated environmental problems. 3. Considering the environmental impacts and their relationship to the energy production methods, we can deduce that Albania, which relied on fossil fuels, would have contributed more to the occurrence of acid rain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

It turns out the answer is quite simple and you don't even need to be \\"technical\\" to understand the causes and solutions. In most cases, the hardware you have is capable of being restored to its original function and kept in fast running condition with little effort. Spyware are software programs that are loaded on your computer without your permission. Most spyware and viruses get onto our computers through files that we download from the Internet or as attachments to emails. They tend to take up a lot of computing power and , as a result, will slow down your computer. The simple rule to follow is to never download any free software programs from companies you do not know and trust, especially screensavers, emoticons, and the like. In addition, you should never open any attachment to an email unless you are 100 percent certain you know and trust the sender. In addition, make sure you have a good anti-virus spyware removal software running at all times. Every time you load a program, your PC's software registry is updated with new instructions needed to operate that item. However, when the item is carried out, these instructions remain on your PC. Every time you run your computer it tries to execute these instructions but, because the related program can't be founded, it causes a registry error. Your PC is doing a lot more work than it should be and the result is a slower computer. One of the best ways to manage this is with a neat little tool from Support.com. You can now get a free working version of the software which will quickly scan your entire PC and identify all of the registry errors. The free version also scans for junk and checks your PC.

Summarize this article: The village of Imber was abandoned in 1943 and has been closed to civilians ever since as it is sited on the MoD's training zone on Salisbury Plain. St Giles Church, the only building left intact in Imber, is normally open to the public for two weeks each August. This year the MoD has reduced it to three days due to visitors \\"attempting to access restricted areas\\". It was just before Christmas 1943 that Imber villagers were ordered to pack up and leave to provide a training area for American troops preparing for the invasion of Europe during World War Two. They were never allowed to return and the village vanished off the map. Since then, up to 50 days of public access is granted each year by the MoD. But this year it has been \\"significantly reduced\\", according to Neil Skelton, custodian of the church, because visitors have been \\"trespassing in the restricted areas\\" of the deserted village. \\"Last August, we had probably around 4,000 to 5,000 people over the two weeks and at Easter it was manic,\\" he said. \\"It's the sheer numbers, we're attracting so many people but if you reduce the number of days, you'll be squeezing more people in to fewer days.\\" It is feared people are putting their lives at risk by trespassing in to areas where there could be \\"unexploded ordnance\\".

During the 14th century in the northeastern part of the state nomad tribes by the name of Jornado hunted bison along the Rio Grande; they left numerous rock paintings throughout the northeastern part of the state. When the Spanish explorers reached this area they found their descendants, Suma and Manso tribes. In the southern part of the state, in a region known as Aridoamerica, Chichimeca people survived by hunting, gathering, and farming between AD 300 and 1300. The Chichimeca are the ancestors of the Tepehuan people. During the Napoleonic Occupation of Spain, Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, a Catholic priest of progressive ideas, declared Mexican independence in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato on September 16, 1810 with a proclamation known as the \\"Grito de Dolores\\". Hidalgo built a large support among intellectuals, liberal priests and many poor people. Hidalgo fought to protect the rights of the poor and indigenous population. He started on a march to the capital, Mexico City, but retreated back north when faced with the elite of the royal forces at the outskirts of the capital. He established a liberal government from Guadalajara, Jalisco but was soon forced to flee north by the royal forces that recaptured the city. Hidalgo attempted to reach the United States and gain American support for Mexican independence. HIdalgo reached Saltillo, Coahuila where he publicly resigned his military post and rejected a pardon offered by Viceroy Francisco Venegas in return for Hidalgo's surrender. A short time later, he and his supporters were captured by royalist Ignacio Elizondo at the Wells of Baján (Norias de Baján) on March 21, 1811 and taken to the city of Chihuahua. Hidalgo forced the Bishop of Valladolid, Manuel Abad y Queipo, to rescind the excommunication order he had circulated against him on September 24, 1810.

Premise: \\"Permits are required, and you will need to buy one separately for each lake.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"You do not need a permit for any of the lakes. \\"?","completion":"Given the premise that \\"permits are required, and you will need to buy one separately for each lake,\\" it tells us that the hypothesis \\"You do not need a permit for any of the lakes\\" is not entailed by the premise and is, in fact, contradicted by the premise. Let us further analyze the key elements that contribute to this conclusion. 1. \\"Permits are required\\": This part of the premise clearly establishes that there is a necessity for permits in order to access the lakes. The obligation to possess a permit is, by definition, in direct opposition to the idea of not needing a permit. As a result, considering this component of the premise alone already disputes the validity of the hypothesis. 2. \\"Buy one separately for each lake\\": Not only does this statement reaffirm the need for permits, but it also specifies that individual permits must be purchased or obtained for each lake a person wishes to access. This element highlights that acquiring a permit is not a one-time occurrence but rather a requirement for each lake separately. This detail further contradicts the hypothesis, as it does not leave room for the possibility of accessing the lakes without acquiring the necessary permits. In conclusion, the premise \\"permits are required, and you will need to buy one separately for each lake\\" indicates the importance and necessity of obtaining permits to access the lakes. The hypothesis \\"You do not need a permit for any of the lakes\\" is not entailed by the premise and is incompatible with the established rules or requirements outlined in the premise.

What is the best way to: how to clean pennies with Coca Cola","completion":"Alright, imagine you have a little group of dirty pennies that you want to make shiny and clean. You can use Coca Cola to help clean them, because it has special ingredients, like little tiny cleaning helpers, that can remove the dirt. Here's how you can do it: 1. First, find a small bowl or cup. It should be big enough to hold all the pennies and some Coca Cola. 2. Carefully pour enough Coca Cola into the bowl or cup until all the pennies are covered. The Coca Cola should make a little pool that the pennies can swim in. 3. Now, let the pennies and the Coca Cola play together in the bowl or cup for about 30 minutes. This will give the tiny cleaning helpers in the Coca Cola enough time to make the pennies clean and shiny. 4. After the pennies have been playing in the Coca Cola for 30 minutes, carefully pour out the Coca Cola into the sink. The Coke did its job and it's time to say goodbye to it. 5. Rinse the pennies with some water from the faucet to make sure they are completely clean. You can use a little sieve or your hands to prevent the pennies from falling into the sink while rinsing them. 6. Dry the pennies with a soft towel or paper towel. You'll see that they are much cleaner and shinier than before. Remember, always ask an adult for help if you need it, and never drink the Coca Cola that you used to clean the pennies, because it's dirty now.

The reviewer expresses appreciation for the film's storytelling and the way it plays with the viewer's emotions and expectations.

The mention of the brutal finale demonstrates an awareness of the film's powerful impact, eliciting a mix of hope and disappointment, as they knew the ending was inevitable, yet still hoped for a different outcome. The reviewer's positive experience in witnessing the film during a film theory class implies that they find it valuable and worth recommending to others. The difficulty in finding the film adds a sense of exclusivity and prestige, making it more appealing to those who manage to find and watch it.

Established in 1946, the ANU has always had a strong research focus and is ranked among the leading universities in the world and the best in Australia by The Times Higher Education Supplement and the Shanghai Jiao Tong World University Rankings. There are two religious university campuses in Canberra: Signadou in the northern suburb of Watson is a campus of the Australian Catholic University; St Mark's Theological College in Barton is part of the secular Charles Sturt University.The Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA) and the Royal Military College, Duntroon are located in the inner-northern suburb of Campbell. ADFA teaches military undergraduates and postgraduates and includes UNSW@ADFA, a campus of the University of New South Wales; Duntroon provides Australian Army officer training. Tertiary level vocational education is also available through the multi-campus Canberra Institute of Technology.In 2016 there were 132 schools in Canberra; 87 were operated by the government and 45 were private. During 2006, the ACT Government announced closures of up to 39 schools, to take effect from the end of the school year, and after a series of consultations unveiled its Towards 2020: Renewing Our Schools policy.

The first thing was an Afghan blanket at a church raffle when he was 25 years old. But this was much bigger: it was 120,000! He had won the Big Cube, a state lottery game. To win, a contestant must first guess which number a spinning cube will stop on. The cube has six numbers on it: 1X, 10X, 50X, 100X, 500X, and 1000X. If he is correct, the contestant must then guess which of two selected variables is going to be greater. So, just guessing which number appears on the cube does not guarantee that you will win any money. Sam correctly guessed 1000X, but he still had to choose between two variables. One variable was the number of cars that would run the stop sign at Hill Street and Lake Avenue in six hours. The other variable was the number of times that a teenage boy would change TV channels in a three-hour period. This was a tough decision. Finally, Sam flipped a coin. It came up heads, so Sam picked the teenager. He picked right. The stop sign was run only 76 times, but the teen clicked 120 times. Sixty-year-old Sam jumped for joy, for he had just won 1000 times 120, or 120,000. Sam dreamily left the lottery studio. Talking excitedly on his cell phone while crossing the street, he got hit by a little sports car. Sam is slowly getting better. He was in the hospital for a month. His hospital bill was 110,000. And the insurance company for the little sports car's owner sued Sam for 9,000 worth of repairs. Also, Sam still has to pay federal taxes on his winnings. Sam doesn't play the state lottery any more.

Step 2: Analyze the language used in the statements. - The title's use of \\"rubbish\\" is a negative term, which indicates that the reviewer does not have a positive opinion of the product. - The reviewer's description of the radio coming on too loud and the light being too bright implies that they are unhappy with these features. - The comparison to their existing alarm clock, which they say is better at waking them up, further adds to the negative tone. - Stating that they returned the product after one day shows dissatisfaction with the product. - The reviewer's comment on the appearance of the product, describing it as \\"cheap and nasty,\\" is also negative.

After she takes attendance I go find my friends and we all laugh and play around. Two weeks later Elena takes my seat. She knows that I have sat there for a while but she still sits there. I ask her if she could move because I have sat there for a while. I realize my tone of voice was a little more bitchy then I wanted it to be so I kind of just awkwardly laugh it off. She says no. I get really mad and just go sit somewhere else. The next day I apologize and ask if I can sit back where I used to. She says yes and I sit there.

Passage: The Seahawks' third game was played at home ground when they played their former division rival, the San Diego Chargers. In the second quarter Seattle took the early lead when kicker Olindo Mare made a 23-yard field goal. Then QB Matt Hasselbeck completed a 9-yard TD pass to TE John Carlson. This was followed in the third quarter by RB Leon Washington returning a kickoff 101 yards to the endzone for a touchdown. The lead was broken down with QB Philip Rivers getting a 3-yard TD pass to WR Malcolm Floyd, followed by Hasselbeck getting sacked by ILB Brandon Siler in the endzone for a safety. Then kicker Nate Kaeding made a 29-yard field goal.

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (January 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1881, Edgar Rice Burroughs attends the funeral of his uncle, John Carter, a former American Civil War Confederate Army captain, who died suddenly. The body is put in a tomb unlockable only from the inside. The attorney executing the will hands Burroughs Carter's journal, which he reads, hoping to find clues about Carter's death and the reason he is the willed heir. The bulk of the film enacts what Burroughs reads. While prospecting in the Arizona Territory in 1868, just after the Civil War, Carter is arrested by Union Colonel Powell, who seeks his help in fighting the Apache and insists that Carter owes it to his country. Carter refuses, stating that any debt was paid when he lost his family. Carter escapes from his cell but is pursued by Powell and his cavalry. After encountering a band of Apaches, Carter and the wounded Powell take refuge in a cave, which turns out to be the object of Carter's earlier search: the \\"Spider Cave of Gold\\". A mysterious priestly being, a Thern, appears in the cave at that moment, and surprised by Carter's presence, immediately attacks him with a knife; Carter kills him but accidentally activates the Thern's powerful medallion, and is unwittingly transported to the ruined and dying planet of Barsoom, later revealed to be Mars. Due to Barsoom's low gravity and his own relatively high bone density, Carter is able to perform incredible jumps and feats of strength.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Two teams of researchers studied different diseases. team Alpha studied people with cholesterol, while team Beta studied people with Parkinson's disease. Which team studied fewer people with restricted blood flow to the heart muscle? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that team Beta, which studied people with Parkinson's disease, likely studied fewer people with restricted blood flow to the heart muscle compared to team Alpha, who studied people with cholesterol. This inference can be made because, as described, cholesterol is strongly associated with the development of atherosclerosis, a disorder where cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits form plaques that can restrict or block blood flow through the blood vessels, leading to reduced oxygen supply to the heart muscle and possibly resulting in high blood pressure, heart attack, or even death. Consequently, the individuals with cholesterol issues studied by team Alpha would be more prone to experiencing restricted blood flow to the heart muscle. Team Beta, on the other hand, focused on studying people with Parkinson's disease, a progressive nervous system disorder that primarily affects movement and coordination. Parkinson's disease is mainly characterized by symptoms such as tremors, stiffness, slowed movements, and balance issues. Although Parkinson's disease might be accompanied by a variety of non-motor symptoms, including cardiovascular issues, the connection between restricted blood flow to the heart muscle and Parkinson's disease is not as strong or direct as the connection between restricted blood flow and cholesterol. As a result, it is reasonable to conclude that, among the study subjects for the two teams, those with restricted blood flow to the heart muscle would be more likely to be found in the group studied by team Alpha, who investigated people with cholesterol, as opposed to team Beta, who analyzed individuals with Parkinson's disease."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Let's dig a little deeper into the details provided. The name of the university itself, \\"1 Decembrie 1918 University,\\" holds historical significance. December 1, 1918, marks the day of Romania's Great Union, the unification of Transylvania, Bessarabia, and Bukovina with the Romanian Kingdom. This monumental event in Romanian history is commemorated by the university's name, hinting at the educational establishment's origin and the spirit it aims to foster amongst its faculty and students. The name of the Rector Breaz Valer Daniel gives us an insight into the leadership of the University. The Rector is essentially the principal of the university, responsible for directing its academic activities and maintaining the educational standards of the institution. It's under the leadership of Breaz Valer Daniel that the university charts its course. The city of Alba Iulia, where the University is located, adds another dimension to this picture. Alba Iulia is a city steeped in history, especially with its association with the Great Union from which the University draws its name. Lastly, the country of Romania locates the university geographically in Eastern Europe, contextualizing the university within a specific cultural, historical, and educational landscape. The given data might seem rather simple, however, it packs a lot of information about the university in question, including its leadership, location, and the historical and cultural significance of its name."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: A:","completion":"The tone of this product review is largely positive. Several factors contribute to this positive tone, including the reviewer's enthusiasm and appreciation for the album and the artist, the mention of how often they listen to it, and the recognition of its universal appeal without the use of offensive language. Firstly, the reviewer's love for the CD is clearly stated, and their support for the artist's experimental approach displays admiration and enthusiasm. This positive sentiment is amplified as they write, \\"I love an artist who isn't afraid to experiment and he does just that,\\" which indicates the excitement and anticipation they have experienced while listening to the new and fearless sound of the artist. Secondly, the statement \\"This CD stayed in heavy rotation\\" emphasizes the reviewer's enjoyment of the album and suggests that it has a high replay value. Heavy rotation usually refers to an album or song consistently being played, indicating that the reviewer has actively listened to this album multiple times and continues to find it appealing. Additionally, the appreciation for the lack of profane lyrics highlights a positive aspect of the album as it suits a wide variety of audiences. By explaining that they can play the album around anybody without causing offense, the reviewer acknowledges the universal nature of the music, which could potentially contribute to the artist's commercial success and cater to a diverse set of listeners.

Princes of the German states gathered there to proclaim Wilhelm I of Prussia as German Emperor after the French capitulation in the Franco-Prussian War. Unofficially, the \\"de facto\\" transition of most of the German-speaking populations into a federated organization of states had been developing for some time through alliances formal and informal between princely rulersbut in fits and starts; self-interests of the various parties hampered the process over nearly a century of autocratic experimentation, beginning in the era of the Napoleonic Wars, which saw the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire (1806), and the subsequent rise of German nationalism. - The German Empire (officially ') was the historical German nation state that existed from the unification of Germany in 1871 to the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm II in November 1918, when Germany became a federal republic (the Weimar Republic). - Civil registration is the system by which a government records the vital events (births, marriages, and deaths) of its citizens and residents. The resulting repository or database has different names in different countries and even in different US states. It can be called a civil registry , civil register (but this is also an official term for an individual file of a vital event), vital records, and other terms, and the office responsible for receiving the registrations can be called a bureau of vital statistics, registry of vital records and statistics, registrar, registry, register, registry office (officially register office ), or population registry. The primary purpose of civil registration is to create a legal document that can be used to establish and protect the rights of individuals. A secondary purpose is to create a data source for the compilation of vital statistics. In most countries, there is a legal requirement to notify the relevant authority of certain life events, such as births, marriages and death. The first country to establish a nationwide population register was Sweden in 1631, which was organized by the Church of Sweden on the demand of the Swedish king. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - A republic (from ) is a sovereign state, country, or government which is organized with a form of government in which power resides in elected individuals representing the citizen body and government leaders exercise power according to the rule of law. In modern times, the definition of a republic commonly refers to a government which excludes a monarch. Currently, 147 of the world's 206 sovereign states use the word \\"republic\\" as part of their official names; not all of these are republics in the sense of having elected governments, nor do all nations with elected governments use the word \\"republic\\" in their names. - The Province of Posen was a province of Prussia from 1848 and as such part of the German Empire from 1871 until 1918. The area, roughly corresponding to the historic region of Greater Poland annexed during the 18th century Polish partitions, was about . For more than a century, it was part of the Prussian Partition, with a brief exception during the Napoleonic Wars. - Weimar Republic is an unofficial, historical designation for the German state between 1919 and 1933. The name derives from the city of Weimar, where its constitutional assembly first took place. The official name of the state was still \\"Deutsches Reich\\"; it had remained unchanged since 1871. In English the country was usually known simply as Germany. A national assembly was convened in Weimar, where a new constitution for the \\"Deutsches Reich\\" was written, and adopted on 11 August 1919. In its fourteen years, the Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including hyperinflation, political extremism (with paramilitaries both left- and right-wing); and contentious relationships with the victors of the First World War. The people of Germany blamed the Weimar Republic rather than their wartime leaders for the country's defeat and for the humiliating terms of the Treaty of Versailles. However, the Weimar Republic government successfully reformed the currency, unified tax policies, and organized the railway system. Weimar Germany eliminated most of the requirements of the Treaty of Versailles; it never completely met its disarmament requirements, and eventually paid only a small portion of the war reparations (by twice restructuring its debt through the Dawes Plan and the Young Plan). Under the Locarno Treaties, Germany accepted the western borders of the republic, but continued to dispute the Eastern border. - A Standesamt (German, plural \\"Standesämter\\") is a German civil registration office, which is responsible for recording births, marriages, and deaths. - The Prussian Partition (sometimes called the Prussian Poland) refers to the former territories of the PolishLithuanian Commonwealth acquired during the partitions of Poland in the late 18th century by the Kingdom of Prussia. The Prussian acquisition amounted to 141,400 km (54,600 sq mi) of land constituting formerly western territory of the Commonwealth. The first partitioning led by imperial Russia with Prussian participation took place in 1772; the next one in 1793, and the final one in 1795, resulting in Poland's elimination for the next 123 years. - Standesamt Margonin was a civil registration district ( Standesamt ) located in Kreis Kolmar , province of Posen of the German Empire ( 1871 -- 1918 ) and administered the communities of : Bud = Budsin ; Kol = Kolmar ; Mar = Margonin ; Wil = Wilhelmstreu Margonin was on the north end of a finger lake , where a mill stream slowly emptied the lake into the Netze ( Polish : Notec ) River .

West of Margonin , the road and railroad diverge on their way to the Kreis seat of Kolmar ( Chodziesen ; Polish : Chodzie ) . The railroad swung north to Samotschin before following the bluff overlooking the river plain farming villages . The road ran westward and then swung north to meet up with the railroad on the last few clicks on the bluff to Kolmar . In the other direction , the road and railroad ran east and a little south , towards Gollantsch and Kreis Exin , passing through the strip of Kreis Wongrowitz that pushes northward to claim its token piece of the Netze river bank . The only major road to the south , exited Margonin at the southeast , arched a little east on its way south to the town of Wongrowitz , seat of its Kreis .

As a cereal grain, it is the most widely consumed staple food for a large part of the world's human population, especially in Asia. It is the agricultural commodity with the third-highest worldwide production, after sugarcane and maize, according to 2012 FAOSTAT data. Since a large portion of maize crops are grown for purposes other than human consumption, rice is the most important grain with regard to human nutrition and caloric intake, providing more than one-fifth of the calories consumed worldwide by humans. Wild rice, from which the crop was developed, may have its native range in Australia. Chinese legends attribute the domestication of rice to Shennong, the legendary emperor of China and inventor of Chinese agriculture.

He built a hilltop house at Forio and called it La Mortella. Susana Walton created a magnificent garden there. Walton's other works of the 1950s include the music for a fourth Shakespeare film, Olivier's Richard III, and the Cello Concerto (1956), written for Gregor Piatigorsky, who gave the premiere in January 1957 with the Boston Symphony Orchestra and the conductor Charles Munch. Some critics felt that the concerto was old-fashioned; Peter Heyworth wrote that there was little in the work that would have startled an audience in the year the Titanic met its iceberg (1912). It has nevertheless entered the regular repertoire, performed by Paul Tortelier, Yo-Yo Ma, Lynn Harrell and Pierre Fournier among others. In 1966 Walton successfully underwent surgery for lung cancer. Until then he had been an inveterate pipe-smoker, but after the operation he never smoked again. While he was convalescing, he worked on a one-act comic opera, The Bear, which was premiered at Britten's Aldeburgh Festival, in June 1966, and enthusiastically received. Walton had become so used to being written off by music critics that he felt \\"there must be something wrong when the worms turned on some praise.\\" Walton received the Order of Merit in 1967, the fourth composer to be so honoured, after Elgar, Vaughan Williams and Britten.Walton's orchestral works of the 1960s include his Second Symphony (1960), Variations on a Theme by Hindemith (1963), Capriccio burlesco (1968), and Improvisations on an Impromptu of Benjamin Britten (1969). His song cycles from this period were composed for Peter Pears (Anon. in Love, 1960) and Schwarzkopf (A Song for the Lord Mayor's Table, 1962). He was commissioned to compose a score for the 1969 film Battle of Britain, but the film company rejected most of his score, replacing it with music by Ron Goodwin.

Areas with widespread creeping charlie will take a long time to manually remove, so you might consider sunlight deprivation or chemical treatment in these cases. It is recommended you wear gloves for protection if you plan to pull the plant out by hand. Gloves can prevent blisters, friction burns, and callouses from forming during manual removal. Creeping charlie is a common skin allergen that can cause itching or a rash from contact. Wearing gloves will prevent you from having an unexpected allergic response while weeding. For plants that are especially thick, you should cut off the leaves and vines to make the roots more accessible. You can do this most easily with a few snips from a pair of pruning shears. Once the protective upper foliage is removed, you'll be able to target the roots in the ground. Keep bits and pieces of creeping charlie collected together off to the side or put it in a bag for disposal later. Lost bits and pieces can reseed your plot with the plant. You may want to avoid doing this on windy days. The wind might blow a stray leaf or vine somewhere else you don't want the plant growing. It is not recommended you use a hoe to break up the soil or cut through the top layer of the plant. This can spread creeping charlie even further. In loose, loamy soil, you may find that the roots pull free with relatively little effort. However, in some cases, the roots may be very stubborn. Grasp the root by its topmost part and apply firm, steady pressure until the roots pull free. You may need to use a rooting tool, which is shaped like a long, flat-tipped screwdriver, to assist in removing difficult plants or those with deep-sunk roots. You should investigate the soil following the hand removal of roots. If you leave behind root pieces, the creeping charlie may return. The leaves and vines you have cut from the plants could serve to further seed creeping charlie, so be careful when disposing this plant. Avoid places like open compost piles where the wind might carry seeds or leaves back to your plot. Using a thin tined rake can help you sift through dirt to find remaining creeping charlie plant debris. Even small pieces can contribute to regrowth. Throwing the creeping charlie away in the garbage should be sufficient, but you could also dispose of trimmings by burning them. Be sure you have a fire permit before burning, if your region requires one. After you've weeded out the creeping, you can help prevent regrowth by adding mulch, like wood chips, over the area the plant was growing. Use a regular cover of 2 - 3 in (5 - 7.6 cm) of your mulch for the best effect. Getting the whole root system and removing every seed-carrying leaf can be a tall order. It's likely you'll miss a few and see the plant return. Every time you see the scalloped leaves of creeping charlie reappear, pull it out. Eventually it should stop coming back. You should see the creeping charlie diminish after each weeding, but it can take up to a year or longer before the plant is fully removed. Summary:","completion":"The article teaches how to carefully remove a plant called creeping charlie by hand, wearing gloves, and using tools, while making sure to clean up any pieces to prevent it from coming back, and using mulch to help stop its growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde .

Article: A yoga master made a shocking statement that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life.Lincoln delivered a proclamation setting up Thanksgiving as an American holiday in 1863.Research throws light on a possible Hindu origin for the American celebration of Thanksgiving. \\"The holiday of Thanksgiving has a Hindu origin,\\" says Richard Salva, author of a book on the reincarnation of Abraham Lincoln entitled Soul Journey: From Lincoln to Lindbergh which is based on a statement by the great master of yoga, Paramhamsa Yogananda, who declared that Abraham Lincoln had been a Himalayan yogi in a past life, and that he was reborn as the famous pilot, Charles Lindbergh. \\"During my search for signs of a past-life yoga practice,\\" SaIva said, \\"I noticed that President Lincoln repeatedly chose Thursdays as national days of prayer, fasting ,and thanksgiving.This was interesting, because Thursday is considered a holy day -- a day for prayer, fasting, and spiritual reflection -- among Hindus, who call it \\"guru day\\".\\" \\"Lincoln also set aside time on Thursdays to grieve for his son,Willie, who died in Washington.Clearly, Thursdays had a spiritual significance in Lincoln's mind. In his book, Richard Salva presents more than 500 connections between Lincoln, Lindergh, and the ancient spiritual science of yoga. The connections run through every aspect of the human condition and provide convincing evidence that Lincoln had had a Hindu past life. More than one out of every five Americans today believes in reincarnation--yet few are aware of how past-life patterns affect them. Soul Journey tries to fill this gap, by offering a substitute experience of reincarnation. Through clear and persuasive similarities between the lives of Lincoln and Lindbergh, the book discovers how the hidden laws of fate and reincarnation impact the events of his or her daily life. It addresses other issues, such as the secret spiritual history of America's greatest president, including his past life as a Himalayan yogi; the hidden clues that...

Should I validate this answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, you should validate this answer as it accurately explains the name and structure of the Jewish Bible. The Jewish Bible is indeed called the \\"TaNaKh\\" or \\"Tanakh,\\" which is an acronym derived from the initial Hebrew letters of its three primary sections: Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim. The Torah, also known as the Five Books of Moses, is the foundational text of Judaism and consists of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. These five books narrate the story of the creation of the world, the history of the Israelite people, and the establishment of the covenant between God and the Israelites. The Torah also contains the Mosaic Law, which outlines the moral, social, and religious precepts that the Israelites were to follow. The Nevi'im, or Prophets, is the second section of the Tanakh and is further divided into two parts: the Former Prophets and the Latter Prophets. The Former Prophets include the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings, which collectively provide a historical account of the Israelite people from the time of their entry into the Promised Land to the Babylonian Exile. The Latter Prophets, on the other hand, consist of books attributed to individual prophets such as Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and the Twelve Minor Prophets. These prophetic books encompass a diverse range of literary styles, themes, and messages, but they primarily focus on calling the Israelites to repentance and emphasizing God's promise to restore his chosen people. Lastly, the Ketuvim, or Writings, is the third and final section of the Tanakh. These books encompass a variety of literary genres such as wisdom literature, poetry, and historical narratives. Some of the well-known books in this section include Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Esther, Daniel, and Chronicles. The Ketuvim offers a wealth of insight into the religious, cultural, and social dimensions of ancient Israel and provides a rich resource for understanding the development of Jewish thought and practice. In summary, the answer provided accurately captures the essence of the Jewish Bible's structure and its three main divisions: Torah, Nevi'im, and Ketuvim, which together form the acronym \\"TaNaKh\\" or \\"Tanakh.\\" Therefore, you can confidently validate this answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is seen donning a disguise, and he walks to a cafe where CIA agent Jack Shaw (Donald Sutherland) is sitting at a table outdoors. He recognizes Shaw and asks for a light.

Carlos claims to actually be a US Naval officer named Annibal Ramirez whose identification was lost in the chaos of his arrest. Amos confirms his identity and lets him go, stunned that Ramirez looks exactly like Carlos. Back at home, Ramirez is visited by Shaw who tries to recruit him to play Carlos' double. Ramirez is so embittered by his rough treatment in Amos' hands, that he insists he will sue and flatly rejects the idea of portraying Carlos. Shaw persists, wooing Ramirez on several occasions. He finally convinces Ramirez by showing him a child in a hospital who he claims is a victim of one of Carlos' bombings.Amos and Shaw train Ramirez at a remote location. Much of his training is devoted to situational awareness and internalizing details of Carlos' life. His training concludes with one of Carlos' ex-mistresses training Ramirez in how to make love like Carlos. The plan to catch Carlos revolves around convincing the KGB, which supports much of his terrorism, that he has begun to work with the CIA.

A:","completion":"The original Xbox 360, developed and manufactured by Microsoft, was officially released in the United States on November 22, 2005. This gaming console represented the company's second foray into the console gaming market, following the original Xbox, which was released in 2001. Designed by Microsoft's J Allard and robustly promoted under the project codename \\"Xenon,\\" the Xbox 360 aimed to provide a significant leap in gaming performance and hardware features. Some of these features included a custom IBM-designed Xenon multicore processor, a custom ATI Xenos GPU, a detachable faceplate for customization, and support for high-definition video output. The console also boasted built-in support for Xbox Live, Microsoft's online gaming service, offering players the ability to enjoy multiplayer games, communicate via voice chat, download game demos, trailers, and digital content such as Xbox Live Arcade games. The Xbox 360 competed directly with Sony's PlayStation 3 and Nintendo's Wii as part of the seventh generation of video game consoles. It was the first of the three major consoles to be released during this generation, followed by the PlayStation 3 on November 17, 2006, and the Wii on November 19, 2006. The Xbox 360 was initially offered in two different configurations: the Core System and the Premium System. The Core System was a budget-friendly option, while the Premium System included additional features such as a wireless controller, a 20 GB hard drive, a headset for Xbox Live communication, and an HDMI output for high-definition video. The Xbox 360 had several revisions over its lifespan. In 2007, the Xbox 360 Elite model was introduced, providing a larger 120 GB hard drive and an HDMI output port. In 2008, the Xbox 360 Pro replaced the Premium System and featured improved hardware and an increased 60 GB hard drive. Later, in 2010, Microsoft launched the Xbox 360 S (also known as the Xbox 360 Slim), which featured a sleeker design, improved hardware, built-in Wi-Fi, and an integrated optical audio port for surround sound systems. The final revision of the Xbox 360 was the Xbox 360 E, released in 2013, featuring minor design changes and hardware updates. Over its lifecycle, the Xbox 360 saw a vast library of game titles, including notable exclusives such as the Halo series, Gears of War series, and Forza Motorsport series. Microsoft officially discontinued production of the Xbox 360 on April 20, 2016, after a successful run of over 10 years, having sold more than 84 million units worldwide. The company's focus had shifted toward its successor, the Xbox One, which was released on November 22, 2013, marking the beginning of the eighth generation of video game consoles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What was Dumbledore's first wand made up of? Options: a). no b). yes Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why does Dumbledore put up with Professor Umbridge's interference? Dumbledore puts up with Professor Umbridge's interference for several reasons. Firstly, Dumbledore is a firm believer in the rule of law and the structures within the wizarding world. Umbridge's appointment as the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher was the decision of then Minister of Magic, Cornelius Fudge. Despite his reservations about Umbridge's ideals and methods, Dumbledore respected the authority of the Ministry of Magic and complied with their decision. Secondly, Dumbledore is aware of the political nature of the appointment and the need for stability in Hogwarts during a time when the wizarding world is facing uncertainty. The Ministry of Magic, and Cornelius Fudge in particular, are in denial about the return of Voldemort, and Dumbledore knows that openly defying the Ministry would weaken the school's stability and potentially give rise to more fear and hysteria in the community. By allowing Umbridge to remain in her post, Dumbledore is attempting to keep some semblance of order in a situation where dark forces are stirring. Thirdly, Dumbledore is playing the long game. He knows that in order to protect his students and ensure their proper education, he must be strategic and patient. By tolerating Umbridge's presence, Dumbledore is able to observe her actions and keep her under control to a certain extent. This allows him to effectively limit the damage she can cause until a more permanent solution can be found. Lastly, Dumbledore understands the importance of resistance and the power of his own role as a leader at Hogwarts. By allowing Umbridge's extreme methods to be plainly visible to students and staff, he creates a situation where the community can unite in their disapproval of her policies. This fosters a shared resistance against her ideologies and her oppressive tactics, ultimately strengthening the bonds within the Hogwarts community and encouraging them to work together against a common enemy. Question 2: What was Dumbledore's first wand made up of? It is not clear what Dumbledore's first wand was made up of. J.K. Rowling has not revealed the specifics regarding the composition of his wand when Albus Dumbledore first started his journey as a wizard. Throughout the Harry Potter series, the most famous wand associated with Dumbledore is the Elder Wand, which is one of the Deathly Hallows. The Elder Wand is made of elder wood with a Thestral tail hair as its core. However, this was not Dumbledore's first wand, but one he obtained much later in his life after defeating Gellert Grindelwald. Regarding your options: a) No and b) Yes. The correct answer is a) No. Questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is about why Dumbledore tolerates Professor Umbridge's interference at Hogwarts, and Question 2 is about the composition of Dumbledore's first wand. These questions address different aspects of Dumbledore's life and actions, focusing on his decision-making and strategic thinking in one instance and his early life as a wizard in the other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After watching this film, I can't help but express my profound disappointment and dissatisfaction. The movie falls short on numerous levels, leaving the audience with a lingering taste of negativity. The plot, seemingly promising at first glance, rapidly deteriorates into an incoherent and clumsy mess. The attempt to weave a thought-provoking narrative falls flat, as the storyline becomes riddled with clichéd twists and lacks creativity. The characters, who should have been the movie's driving force, were unbearably shallow, leaving us with no emotional attachment or investment in their journey. The director's lack of ability to create complex, compelling, and relateable characters is evident throughout the movie. Their poor development prevents us, as viewers, from truly connecting with them on any substantial level. This stunted growth, coupled with highly predictable and occasionally cringe-worthy dialogue, only adds to the disappointment. In addition to the flawed script and under-developed characters, the acting performances failed to save this sinking ship. The lead actors delivered subpar performances, their lack of chemistry inhibiting any potential to genuinely engage with their roles. It felt as if they were merely reading from the script, rather than embodying the essence of their characters, ultimately contributing to the movie's overall lifelessness and unsuccessful immersion. One of the few redeemable qualities of the film was its visual effects, which, although visually captivating, couldn't salvage the story's lack of depth and unoriginality. The captivating cinematography and decent score simply serve as a stark reminder of the wasted potential in this movie. In conclusion, my viewing experience was overwhelmingly negative. The movie squandered any promise it had through its disjointed plot, underwhelming characters, and a lackluster acting. It's a sorrowful testament to what could have been a phenomenal piece of cinema. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone seeking a genuinely engaging and emotionally resonant experience.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Rising air currents carry water vapor into the atmosphere. As the water vapor rises in the atmosphere, it cools and condenses. Condensation is the process in which water vapor changes to tiny droplets of liquid water. The water droplets may form clouds. If the droplets get big enough, they fall as precipitation —rain, snow, sleet, hail, or freezing rain. Most precipitation falls into the ocean. Eventually, this water evaporates again and repeats the water cycle. Some frozen precipitation becomes part of ice caps and glaciers.

Detailed Instructions: The task is to generate the correct answer for a given math problem. Q: Problem: if 6 is one solution of the equation x ^ 2 + 3 x + k = 10 , where k is a constant , what is the other solution ? A:","completion":"To complete this task, we need to follow these simple steps: 1. Understand the problem: We are given an equation x^2 + 3x + k = 10, where k is a constant. One of the solutions to this equation is x = 6. Our goal is to find the other solution. 2. Use the given information: Since 6 is a solution, we can plug it into the equation and solve for k. The equation then becomes (6)^2 + 3(6) + k = 10. 3. Solve for k: Calculate the values and simplify the equation to find the value of k. (6)^2 = 36, 3(6) = 18, so the equation becomes 36 + 18 + k = 10. 4. Find the value of k: Subtract the other values from both sides of the equation. k = 10 - (36 + 18) = 10 - 54 = -44. 5. Update the equation with the value of k: Now that we have the value of k, we can rewrite the equation as x^2 + 3x - 44 = 10. 6. Rearrange the equation to a quadratic equation: To solve for the other solution, we need to rewrite the equation in the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0. In this case, subtract 10 from both sides to get x^2 + 3x - 54 = 0. 7. Use the quadratic formula to find the other solution: The quadratic formula is x = [-b ± √(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a. In this case, a = 1, b = 3, and c = -54. Plug these values into the formula to solve for the other solution. 8. Calculate the other solution: x = [-3 ± √(3^2 - 4(1)(-54))] / 2(1). Calculate the value inside the square root: 3^2 = 9, and 4(1)(-54) = -216. So, x = [-3 ± √(9 + 216)] / 2. 9. Simplify the calculations: x = [-3 ± √225] / 2. Since √225 = 15, x = [-3 ± 15] / 2. 10. Find the two possible values for x: x = (-3 + 15) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6, or x = (-3 - 15) / 2 = -18 / 2 = -9. 11. Identify the other solution: Since we were given that 6 is one solution, the other solution is x = -9. So, the other solution to the equation x^2 + 3x + k = 10 is x = -9."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Premise: \\"But with his death the empire collapsed, and the Israelite kingdom was divided into two separate, impoverished, often warring Israel, with its capital at Shechem in the north, ruled by a series of northern dynasties; and the smaller kingdom of Judah, with its capital at Jerusalem, from which the Davidic dynasty continued to rule.\\" Hypothesis: \\"The empire collapsed after his death.\\" Secondly, I need to compare key details mentioned in both the premise and the hypothesis. The premise states that after a certain individual's death, an empire collapsed, and the Israelite kingdom got divided into two. The hypothesis claims that the empire collapsed after his death. From the comparison, I can see that both mention the same sequence of events, i.e., someone's death followed by the collapse of an empire. Hence, based on the comparison, it can be concluded that the premise does entail the hypothesis. The reason is that both premise and hypothesis coincide on the event of the empire's collapse happening after the unnamed individual's death. Thus, we can say that if the premise is true, it substantiates the truth of the hypothesis. This analysis assumes that both 'his death' in the premise and 'his death' in the hypothesis point to the same individual."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Heinrich d'Arrest, a student at the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of the sky in the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.

Zhang called his device the 'instrument for measuring the seasonal winds and the movements of the Earth' (Houfeng didong yi 候风地动仪), so-named because he and others thought that earthquakes were most likely caused by the enormous compression of trapped air.

What's the most logical way to complete this passage? (CNN) -- As Michael Ballack finally calls time on his 17-year professional career, German football can bask in the knowledge they boast the best two teams in Europe. But while the Champions League final between eventual winners Bayern Munich and Borussia Dortmund showcased all that is good about German football, the 36-year-old has told CNN the domestic game may suffer as a result. As well as the continent's most glittering club prize, Bayern won the German Cup and the Bundesliga by an incredible 25 points. Dortmund, who won the championship in the previous two seasons, were their nearest challengers, and the pair have accounted for five of the last six titles.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100. Paragraph: Pam is an astronaut who has been given a mission to find a new planet for humans to live on. She is exploring the outer rims of the galaxy when she discovers two new planets that may be suitable. The atmospheric makeup of these planets is very similar to Pam's current home. After running a quick diagnostic, the only difference that Pam sees is that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which planet has more less inside its atmosphere?","completion":"Based on the given information, it is clear that planet B has more carbon dioxide in its atmosphere than planet A. In the context of global warming, this is a significant factor to consider when attempting to determine which planet may have less heat inside its atmosphere. Since carbon dioxide is a greenhouse gas, it plays a major role in the greenhouse effect, whereby such gases have the ability to trap heat inside a planet's atmosphere due to their complex molecular structure. The greenhouse effect is a critical contributor to the warming of Earth. Higher levels of greenhouse gases, specifically carbon dioxide, result in more heat being trapped in the atmosphere and thus a higher overall temperature. Hence, comparing the two newly discovered planets, it can be reasonably inferred that planet A, with lower levels of carbon dioxide, will likely have less heat inside its atmosphere compared to planet B, which has a higher concentration of carbon dioxide. Towards making a decision on the most suitable planet for human habitation, Pam should take into account the aforementioned inference, along with additional factors such as availability of water and other resources, potential for sustainable living and development, as well as any other risks or incompatibilities with human life. Based on the understanding of the greenhouse effect and its relationship with carbon dioxide levels, planet A currently appears to be the more favorable option, given that it is expected to have less heat in its atmosphere."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Bucharest, Romania (CNN) -- Romania's president Traian Basescu was suspended on Friday, after the impeachment motion filed by the ruling coalition passed the Parliament's vote. Romania's coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals argued their action by saying that President Traian Basescu has breached the Constitution and overstepped his authority. The motion passed with 256 votes, 39 more than the minimum required. The country is expected to hold a referendum on July 29, when Romanians will have to vote whether they want Basescu to remain in office. During the suspension, National Liberal Party leader Crin Antonescu, who is also the president of the Senate, will assume the interim presidency. Earlier this week, Antonescu was appointed the president of the Senate. This position allows him to assume the president's attributions, in case the latter is suspended, according to the Constitution. Crin Antonescu said on Friday he is ready to step out of politics if Basescu wins the referendum. During his speech in parliament, before the vote, Basescu accused the ruling coalition of taking control of the country's judicial system and public institutions. He also expressed concern about the country's state of law and said this political turmoil will have long-term negative impacts on Romania. \\"Take care of the country!\\" Basescu said at the end of his speech. It is the second time Basescu has faced suspension since he took the power, eight years ago. The first time was in 2007, after which he won a referendum and returned to office. Earlier on Friday, Romania's Constitutional Court gave an ambiguous statement regarding the constitutional status of this impeachment motion. The judges approved some of the points from the motion, but they didn't make it clear whether Basescu has violated the Constitution or not.

Article: Jiang Nan, a full-time mother in Beijing, keeps a dozen or so cloth bags at home, carefully selecting one or two before heading out to get groceries. \\"Most of them were giveaways from advertising marketing campaigns, but others had been handed out in the street by various environmental protection organizations,\\" she explained. Since June 2008 China has forbidden the production, sale and usage of plastic bags thinner than 0.025 millimeter , and retailers are not allowed to provide free plastic bags to their customers, no matter how thick they are. Many Chinese consumers like Jiang have learned to refuse plastic bags whenever possible in their shopping. \\"A plastic bag may only cost a few jiao, but it's more about how bad they are for the environment,\\" Jiang said. The plastic ban is for the most part well carried out in big cities, and has been obviously effective in reducing white waste. On the first anniversary of the plastic ban Global Village of Beijing, an NGO environmental organization, shows that during the year of the ban the consumption of plastic bags fell by about 40 billion pieces in chain supermarkets alone, saving more than 1.2 million tons of petrol. However, enforcement shows rather less muscle in smaller cities, towns and countryside. In a remote town like Lichuan, the awareness of environmental protection is not as strong as that in big cities. Street vendors worry that they are likely to lose customers if they charge them for plastic bags. Seeing no significance in the issue, local government often turn a blind eye to banned bag trade in the market. There are still those who don't have an interest in living green. Cui Lin, another Beijinger, often forgets to bring a cloth bag when shopping, and has to buy plastic bags. \\"Anyway I think plastic bags are neater and cleaner, and I don't mind paying a couple more jiao,\\" he shrugged.

Given the question: Generate a question that has the following answer: Homeless. for the following movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \\"undergrounders\\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \\"The Reverend\\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building.

If I tell you that Turbines are used to producing electricity, and ask you the question \\"turbines are used to what?\\", is the correct answer \\"direct energy\\"? pick from the following. (1). Yes; (2). No; Answer:","completion":"(2). No; Turbines are not used to \\"direct energy.\\" Instead, turbines are primarily used to convert one form of energy into another, specifically mechanical energy into electrical energy. To provide a more in-depth understanding, let's discuss how turbines work and produce electricity. Turbines are rotary mechanical devices that utilize the kinetic energy of a fluid (water, steam, or air) to generate mechanical energy through rotation. Different types of turbines are designed to harness energy from various sources, such as wind turbines that harness energy from wind, steam turbines that utilize energy from steam produced by heated water, and hydro turbines that capture energy from flowing water. In the context of producing electricity, the mechanical energy generated by the rotation of a turbine is then used to drive an electric generator. An electric generator is a machine that converts this mechanical energy into electrical energy. Essentially, it operates based on the principle of electromagnetic induction, which was discovered by Michael Faraday in 1831. When the turbine's rotor (consisting of conductive coils) rotates within a magnetic field (generated by stationary magnets), an alternating current (AC) is induced in the coils. This AC can then be further processed and sent to the power grid or used directly to power electrical devices. It is essential to note that the efficiency of energy conversion in turbines can vary depending on factors such as design, materials used, the energy source, and environmental conditions. However, turbines play a crucial role in the generation of electricity in different applications, from large power plants to small-scale wind or hydroelectric systems. In conclusion, the correct answer to \\"turbines are used to what?\\" would be \\"convert mechanical energy into electrical energy\\" rather than \\"direct energy.\\" The term \\"direct energy\\" is not an accurate depiction of a turbine's primary function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: “What was your worst makeup disaster?” Do fingernails count? I hope so, because this is a good one: I was 21 years old. I worked for a major commercial airline. A friend of mine and I decided to go to Puerto Rico for a long weekend. It was our first trip to Puerto Rico. The hotel at which we stayed had a lovely (classy/expensive) restaurant serving continental fare. So, we decided to have our first dinner there. We dressed to the nines. Our hair and makeup were perfect. I had fake fingernails (not acrylic - those were fairly new back then. I had the type one glues on). Those fingernails were long, and painted a very bright - and obvious - red. When the waiter came to take our drink order, we both ordered glasses of wine. The waiter brought the wine, set it down on the table, and waited to take our meal orders. I smoked back then, and at the time, smoking was still allowed in restaurants. In a 21-year-old attempt to look classy and sophisticated, at that moment I took out a cigarette, put it between my lips, picked up my lighter, and lit my cigarette - or so I thought. Unfortunately, my long, red, fake thumbnail got in the way of the flame, and it caught on fire. The waiter’s mouth dropped open, his eyes wide. He froze in place. I was horrified. The flame was literally shooting up from my nail! And smoke; the nail was plastic! Quickly scanning the table for the closest thing with which I could extinguish the flame, I spied my glass of wine. As nonchalantly as possible, I stuck my thumb in the glass. There was a sizzle as the flaming nail hit the wine. When I withdrew my thumb from the glass, the nail was melted, black, and curled under. Ever the professional, the waiter regained his composure and proceeded to take our orders without missing a beat - but I’m sure I was the talk of the kitchen for the rest of the evening.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to do this: Step 1: Initialize the variables - Assign string A to variable 's1' and string B to variable 's2' - Get the lengths of both strings and assign them to variables 'len1' and 'len2' - Create a 2D array 'dp' of size (len1 + 1) x (len2 + 1) initialized with 0s to store the length of the common suffixes that end at each position in both strings Step 2: Iterate through the strings and populate the 'dp' array - Use nested loops to iterate through each character of both strings - For each character in string s1 (outer loop), loop through each character in string s2 (inner loop) - If the characters at the current positions are equal, update the 'dp' array at the current position with the value of 'dp' at the previous diagonal position + 1, i.e., dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1 - If the characters are not equal, leave the 'dp' array value at the current position as 0 Step 3: Find the maximum value in the 'dp' array and its position - During the iteration process, keep track of the maximum value found in the 'dp' array and its position (i, j) - These values will be used later to extract the longest common substring Step 4: Extract the longest common substring - Starting from the position (i, j) found in step 3, move diagonally up-left through the 'dp' array until a 0 is reached, adding each character in the common substring to the result - The result should be reversed since the characters were added backwards Step 5: Return the longest common substring as the result Given the strings A = 'gcZobbOQjatXRBv' and B = 'WBqhvtlobbOQjatXXwPAAt', applying this algorithm would produce the longest common substring 'bbOQjatX'."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The statement only reveals the Chicago Tribune's characterization of the allegation, but it does not give any insight into their anticipations or expectations for potential backlash. It is important to remember that media outlets, like the Chicago Tribune, report on various news events and controversial topics regularly. When these organizations provide critical commentary or highlight contentious issues, they might consider the potential for backlash as an inherent part of the process. This is especially true when reporting on sensitive matters, such as allegations of sexual misconduct. It is not uncommon to see opposing views and passionate responses from different parts of the audience in such cases. However, anticipating backlash does not mean that the Chicago Tribune would refrain from making such statements or reporting on these allegations. As a reputable news organization, it is their responsibility to present the news accurately and objectively, highlighting all relevant aspects of a story, including potential issues of misconduct and controversy. The Chicago Tribune may have decided that this news item was important to share with its readership, despite any risks of backlash. Furthermore, the manner in which the Chicago Tribune framed the allegation might provide some clue to their expectations. By using terms like \\"boorish\\" and \\"immoral,\\" they picked strong words that signal a critical stance towards the alleged behavior. It might be inferred that they were aware of the possible negative reactions from some readers but still chose to maintain their tone because they deemed it necessary or appropriate. To conclude, while the statement in question does not give explicit insight into whether the Chicago Tribune expected backlash to their report on the allegation, one could make reasonable inferences based on the nature of journalism and the language used in the statement.

A similar effect of common observation is in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\\". Can you tell me what it is? A:","completion":"The unique effect of water on wood mentioned in the provided text is the softening and increased pliability of the wood substance due to its water content. This effect is particularly distinct in the context of wood when compared to other materials mentioned (rawhide, paper, or cloth) because wood, as a natural material and a primary structural component of plants, undergoes a more complex interaction with water at the cellular level. Water molecules penetrate the cell walls of the wood fibers, increasing the distance between the microfibrils that constitute the cell wall and, consequently, weakening the hydrogen bonds between them. As a result, the wood fibers become softer, more malleable, and easier to work with. This softening effect can be observed across a range of moisture content levels and becomes more pronounced as the water content increases. It is important to note that there are limits to this effect, as excessively high moisture levels can lead to the deterioration or damage of the wood material. In the case of rawhide, paper, or cloth, water also induces softening effects. However, the material composition and structure of these materials are different from that of wood. Rawhide is an animal-derived material mostly composed of collagen fibers, paper is made of cellulose fibers derived from plants, and cloth can be made from a variety of materials like cotton, wool, or synthetic fibers. The interaction between water and these materials, although similar in some aspects, does not exhibit the same complex behavior as with wood. The unique effect of water on wood, in this context, relates to the intricate relationship between the water content and overall structure of the wood fibers, which directly impacts its softness and pliability. This interplay between water and wood is not exactly the same in the mentioned materials, making the softening effect specifically distinct for wood."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the full name of the person who recognises the woman in the painting as the Marchesa Attavanti? is inside the article: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman. Cavaradossi reassures her and Tosca tries to persuade him to take her to his villa that evening: \\"Non la sospiri, la nostra casetta\\" (\\"Do you not long for our little cottage\\"). She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti.

The green jersey is a distinctive racing jersey worn by the leader in a subsidiary competition. - The Tour de France is an annual multiple stage bicycle race primarily held in France, while also occasionally making passes through nearby countries. The race was first organized in 1903 to increase sales for the newspaper \\"L'Auto\\"; which is currently run by the Amaury Sport Organisation. The race has been held annually since its first edition in 1903 except when it was stopped for the two World Wars. As the Tour gained prominence and popularity the race was lengthened and its reach began to extend around the globe. Participation expanded from a primarily French field, as riders from all over the world began to participate in the race each year. The Tour is a UCI World Tour event, which means that the teams that compete in the race are mostly UCI WorldTeams, with the exception of the teams that the organizers invite. - The Great Dividing Range, or the Eastern Highlands, is Australia's most substantial mountain range and the third longest land-based range in the world. The range stretches more than from Dauan Island off the northeastern tip of Queensland, running the entire length of the eastern coastline through New South Wales, then into Victoria and turning west, before finally fading into the central plain at the Grampians in western Victoria. The width of the range varies from about to over . - The Amaury Sport Organisation (ASO) is part of the French media group, EPA (Éditions Philippe Amaury). It organises sporting events including the Tour de France, Vuelta a España and ParisNice professional cycle road races, and the Dakar Rally. In 2008 it began the Central Europe Rally, a rally raid endurance race in Romania and Hungary. - The points classification is a secondary competition in the Tour de France, that started in 1953. Points are given for high finishes in a stage and for winning intermediate sprints, and these are recorded in a points classification. It is considered a sprinters' competition. The leader is indicated by a green jersey which has become a symbol for the points classification in the sense that when a cyclist wins the points classification. - Robbie McEwen ( born 24 June 1972 in Brisbane , Queensland ) is an Australian former professional road bicycle racer . He last rode for Orica - GreenEDGE on the UCI World Tour , . As a triple winner of the Points classification in the Tour de France , at his peak he was arguably the fastest sprinter in the world . A former Australian BMX champion , McEwen switched to road racing in 1990 at 18 . He raced as a professional from 1996 until 2012 . McEwen lives in Australia with his Belgian wife Angélique Pattyn , his son Ewan , and his daughters Elena and Claudia . In 2011 he published an autobiography , One Way Road . McEwen lived a long time in the Belgian town of Everbeek and is fluent in Dutch . He retired from the World Tour after riding the 2012 Tour of California . - The UCI ProTour was a series of road bicycle races in Europe, Australia and Canada organised by the UCI (International Cycling Union). Created by Hein Verbruggen, former president of the UCI, it comprises a number of 'ProTour' cycling teams, each of whom are required to compete in every round of the series. It was initially the basis of a season long competition for rankings points, created for 2005 to replace the UCI Road World Cup series, which ended at the end of the 2004 season (although the World Cup did not include any stage races). The ProTour was the subject of continuing disputes involving the UCI, cycling teams, and the organizers of the world's most prominent bicycle races (most notably, the Grand Tours), and in 2009 and 2010 the ranking element of the ProTour was superseded by the UCI World Ranking. For 2011, the ProTour and World Ranking were fully merged into the UCI World Tour. ProTour status for teams relabelled UCI ProTeams will continue as the highest level of registration, and will carry the right and obligation to participate in all World Tour races. - The UCI World Tour (20092010: \\"UCI World Ranking\\") is the premier annual male elite road cycling tour. It refers to both the tour of 28 events and an annual ranking system based upon performances in these. The World Ranking was launched in 2009, and merged fully with its predecessor the UCI ProTour in 2011. - Brisbane is the capital and most populous city in the Australian state of Queensland, and the third most populous city in Australia.

Q:Information: - In quantum mechanics, a boson is a particle that follows BoseEinstein statistics. Bosons make up one of the two classes of particles, the other being fermions. The name boson was coined by Paul Dirac to commemorate the contribution of the Indian physicist Satyendra Nath Bose in developing, with Einstein, BoseEinstein statisticswhich theorizes the characteristics of elementary particles. Examples of bosons include fundamental particles such as photons, gluons, and W and Z bosons (the four force-carrying gauge bosons of the Standard Model), the recently discovered Higgs boson, and the hypothetical graviton of quantum gravity; composite particles (e.g. mesons and stable nuclei of even mass number such as deuterium (with one proton and one neutron, mass number = 2), helium-4, or lead-208); and some quasiparticles (e.g. Cooper pairs, plasmons, and phonons). - A quark (or ) is an elementary particle and a fundamental constituent of matter. Quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, the most stable of which are protons and neutrons, the components of atomic nuclei. Due to a phenomenon known as \\"color confinement\\", quarks are never directly observed or found in isolation; they can be found only within hadrons, such as baryons (of which protons and neutrons are examples) and mesons. For this reason, much of what is known about quarks has been drawn from observations of the hadrons themselves. - Gravity, or gravitation, is a natural phenomenon by which all things with mass are brought toward (or \\"gravitate\\" toward) one another, including planets, stars and galaxies. Since energy and mass are equivalent, all forms of energy, including light, also cause gravitation and are under the influence of it. On Earth, gravity gives weight to physical objects and causes the ocean tides. The gravitational attraction of the original gaseous matter present in the Universe caused it to begin coalescing, forming stars and the stars to group together into galaxies so gravity is responsible for many of the large scale structures in the Universe. Gravity has an infinite range, although its effects become increasingly weaker on farther objects. - Particle physics (also high energy physics) is the branch of physics that studies the nature of the particles that constitute \\"matter\\" (particles with mass) and \\"radiation\\" (massless particles). Although the word \\"particle\\" can refer to various types of very small objects (e.g. protons, gas particles, or even household dust), \\"particle physics\\" usually investigates the irreducibly smallest detectable particles and the irreducibly fundamental force fields necessary to explain them. By our current understanding, these elementary particles are excitations of the quantum fields that also govern their interactions. The currently dominant theory explaining these fundamental particles and fields, along with their dynamics, is called the Standard Model. Thus, modern particle physics generally investigates the Standard Model and its various possible extensions, e.g. to the newest \\"known\\" particle, the Higgs boson, or even to the oldest known force field, gravity. - In particle physics , a hadron i / hædrn / ( Greek : , hadrós , \`\` stout , thick '' ) is a composite particle made of quarks held together by the strong force ( in a similar way as molecules are held together by the electromagnetic force ) . Hadrons are categorized into two families : baryons , made of three quarks , and mesons , made of one quark and one antiquark . Protons and neutrons are examples of baryons ; pions are an example of a meson . Hadrons containing more than three valence quarks ( exotic hadrons ) have been discovered in recent years . A tetraquark state ( an exotic meson ) , named the Z ( 4430 ) , was discovered in 2007 by the Belle Collaboration and confirmed as a resonance in 2014 by the LHCb collaboration . Two pentaquark states ( exotic baryons ) , named P + - In particle physics, mesons (or ) are hadronic subatomic particles composed of one quark and one antiquark, bound together by the strong interaction. Because mesons are composed of quark sub-particles, they have a physical size, with a diameter of roughly one fermi, which is about the size of a proton or neutron. All mesons are unstable, with the longest-lived lasting for only a few hundredths of a microsecond. Charged mesons decay (sometimes through mediating particles) to form electrons and neutrinos. Uncharged mesons may decay to photons. Both of these decays imply that color is no longer a property of the byproducts. Given the information, choose the subject and object entities that have the relation of 'interaction'. A:","completion":"Subject: Quarks Object: Hadrons Reasoning: From the information given, it is mentioned that quarks combine to form composite particles called hadrons, including baryons and mesons, which are held together by the strong force.

Look into a radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer. Ask your doctor about radiation therapy for locally invasive prostate cancer. Consider options for metastatic prostate cancer.\\"","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Treatment Options for Prostate Cancer Introduction: Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer among men, making it an important and prevalent health concern. With advancements in modern medicine, there are several effective treatments for prostate cancer at different stages. In this article, we will discuss the significance of consulting your doctor for a prognosis and delve into different treatment options such as radical prostatectomy, radiation therapy, and alternative options for metastatic prostate cancer. Step 1: Ask Your Doctor for a Prognosis The first significant step in addressing prostate cancer is to ask your doctor for a prognosis. A prognosis is a professional medical opinion about the likely course and outcome of your disease. It is essential to understand your prognosis to help you and your doctor make well-informed decisions regarding your treatment options. Speaking openly with your healthcare professional can provide you with valuable information about the stage of your cancer, the chances of recovery, and the best course of action. Step 2: Consider Radical Prostatectomy for Localized Prostate Cancer Radical prostatectomy is a surgical option primarily for patients with localized prostate cancer, which means the cancer has not spread beyond the prostate gland. The procedure involves removing the entire prostate gland, along with nearby tissues and, sometimes, the lymph nodes. There are different approaches to the surgery, such as open surgery, laparoscopic surgery, and robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery. This procedure is generally recommended for men who have a life expectancy of at least 10 years, as it offers a high rate of long-term survival and comparatively fewer side effects. Step 3: Explore Radiation Therapy for Locally Invasive Prostate Cancer For patients with locally invasive prostate cancer—cancer that has spread outside the prostate gland but has not yet reached distant organs—radiation therapy may be a viable option. Radiation therapy uses high-energy rays to destroy cancer cells while minimizing damage to healthy tissues. There are two common radiation therapy options for prostate cancer: external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) and brachytherapy. It is crucial to consult your doctor to determine which method is best suited to your condition, factoring in the stage of your cancer, your age, and your overall health. Step 4: Evaluate Options for Metastatic Prostate Cancer Managing metastatic prostate cancer—cancer that has spread to distant organs—can be more challenging. Treatment strategies may involve a combination of therapies to alleviate symptoms, prolong life, and improve the quality of life. Common treatment options for metastatic prostate cancer include hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, immunotherapy, and targeted therapy. It is essential to involve your healthcare team in evaluating these options and selecting the best course of action depending on your overall health, age, and personal preferences. Conclusion: Understanding your prognosis and being aware of the various treatment options for prostate cancer are fundamental in fighting this disease. By working closely with your healthcare team, you can identify the most appropriate course of action and take steps toward potentially improving outcomes. Early detection and tailored treatment plans are vital in managing prostate cancer, so always consult your doctor regarding any concerns or changes in your health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

That doesn't seem like a lot, but just think about the millions of coffees consumed around the world every single day, and you'll see the problem. Sure, some of those coffee grounds are recycled as fertilizer to enrich the soil or beauty products like face masks, but most will be buried into the ground. It was while considering this issue that German product designer Julian Lechner came up with a new way of recycling coffee grounds -- turning them into tableware. \\"We were always drinking coffee at university,\\" Lechner remembers. \\"And that's how I started to wonder. What happens to all that coffee? It was all just getting thrown away.\\" He began consulting with his professors about ways of using coffee grounds to create a solid material. \\"We tried combining with a lot of different things,\\" Lechner said, \\"We even tried sugar. That was close, but basically it was a candy cup. It just kept melting after being used three times.\\" The whole point was to make it last long, so Lechner and his partners went back to the institute to continue their research. Finally, after many failed experiments, they came up with a mix of coffee grounds and a biopolymer that seemed to behave the way Lechner had expected it. \\"The moment of knowing the cup would actually stand was super-exciting,\\" he recalls. \\"It was wonderful to drink that first coffee out of the cup. It proved to be totally worth the wait.\\" And his creation has proven commercially successful, which is just _ . The coffee cups are now present in ten shops across Europe, and the company can hardly keep up with demand, regularly selling out of its stock online. Lechner will soon launch a larger line of coffee grounds cups and also work on a travel mug. But those are just short-term plans, as Lechner hopes to one day use recycled coffee grounds to create all sort of useful stuff--like sheets and furniture in cafes and restaurants.

Keep in mind that you may not be able to register common or popular domain names for free, as many have already been claimed or can only be acquired with a fee. 3. Create an Account: Sign up for a free account with the selected provider. This typically requires your name, email address, and a password. Ensure you use a valid email address, as most providers generally require email confirmation before activating your domain. 4. Register the Domain: If your desired domain is available, proceed by clicking the \\"Get It Now\\" button or the equivalent option provided by the provider. Follow the steps to complete the registration process. This may involve selecting a registration period (usually between 1 and 12 months), entering your personal information, and agreeing to the provider's terms and conditions. 5. Set Up DNS: Once your domain is registered, set up your Domain Name System (DNS) settings. This may involve configuring your domain to point to your website, setting up email services, or configuring subdomains. Most free domain providers offer basic DNS management tools within their user dashboard. Question 2: How do I register a free domain name? Registering a free domain name involves the following steps: 1. Research free domain providers: Look for providers that offer free domain registration, such as Freenom, InfinityFree, or Dot.tk. Take note that these providers usually offer a limited range of top-level domains (TLDs) for free. 2. Check your desired domain's availability: Use the provider's search tool to check if the domain name you want is available for free registration. Keep in mind that popular or common domain names may not be available for free registration. 3. Sign up for an account: Create a free account with the chosen provider, using a valid email address for account confirmation purposes. 4. Register the domain: If the domain is available, claim it by completing the registration process, which may include selecting the registration period, providing personal information, and accepting the provider's terms and conditions. 5. Configure DNS settings: Access the provider's user dashboard to set up your Domain Name System (DNS) settings, such as pointing your domain to your website, setting up email services, or creating subdomains. Now, Are these two questions asking the same thing? Yes, both questions are fundamentally asking the same thing—how to obtain and register a free domain name. The first question focuses on how to get a free domain name, while the second question emphasizes the registration process. However, the steps and information provided in both answers are essentially the same. By following those steps, you will be able to get and register a free domain name."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In which town is the Devonshire Royal Hospital, now the Devonshire campus of the University of Derby?","completion":"The Devonshire Royal Hospital, now known as the Devonshire Campus of the University of Derby, is located in the historic town of Buxton in Derbyshire, England. Buxton is a beautiful spa town nestled within the Peak District National Park, which is famous for its stunning natural landscapes, rich cultural heritage, and numerous tourist attractions. The Devonshire Royal Hospital was originally built between 1780 and 1789 as a stable complex for the Duke of Devonshire's horses, designed by English architect John Carr. In 1859, the stables were converted into a hospital for the \\"indigent population\\" by renowned architect Henry Currey. The Devonshire Royal Hospital commenced operation as a treatment center specializing in the therapeutic use of Buxton's mineral-rich thermal springs, which have been believed to possess healing properties since Roman times. The hospital was noted for its large central dome, which for a period was the largest unsupported dome in the world, spanning 44 meters (144 feet). The Devonshire Royal Hospital continued to serve the local population for over a century until it was closed in 2000, marking the end of an era for the historic institution. In 2001, the University of Derby acquired the building and embarked on an ambitious restoration project to transform the former hospital into an educational facility. The conversion was completed in 2003, and the Devonshire Campus officially opened its doors to students in September 2003. The refurbishment preserved the original architectural integrity while incorporating modern educational amenities and resources. Today, the Devonshire Campus of the University of Derby offers a range of courses in subjects such as tourism, events, hospitality, spa management, and culinary arts, along with foundational and postgraduate options. The campus also houses several specialist facilities, including a commercial training kitchen, fine dining restaurant, and a spa and salon, which contribute to the students' hands-on learning experience. The Devonshire Campus represents not only a significant chapter in the history of Buxton and the Devonshire Royal Hospital but also demonstrates the adaptive reuse of historic buildings that are at the core of preserving and maintaining the unique character of British towns and cities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Let your cat explore the great outdoors.","completion":"Title: Engaging Your Cat's Curiosity: Distractions, Entertainment, and Explorations Introduction The curious nature of cats often drives them to explore new sights, smells, and sounds, especially near doorways. With their adventurous spirit, this can become a concern for pet owners, particularly when they want to keep their cats safe from outdoor hazards. In this article, we will discuss how to effectively distract your cat from the door, provide entertainment options that cater to their curious nature, and offer a safe environment for your cat to explore the outdoors. Distracting Your Cat from the Door 1. Providing visual stimulation: One effective way to redirect your cat's attention from the door is by offering captivating alternatives to watch. Consider setting up a bird feeder or birdbath near a window in sight of your feline friend. Cats are natural-born predators and will be enthralled with the movement of birds, allowing them to focus their attention away from the door. 2. Utilizing scents: Cats have an extraordinary sense of smell, so consider using scents to divert their interest from the doorway. Catnip, for instance, is a popular choice for cat owners. Strategically placing catnip or catnip-infused toys around the room will create a stimulating environment for your cat and distract them from the door. 3. Creating interactive playtime: Encourage active playtime by offering toys designed for interaction, such as teaser wands, laser pointers, or even a ball of yarn. By engaging in interactive play regularly, not only will your cat's focus shift from the door to the game, but it will also help tire them out, keeping them from seeking further adventure. Entertaining Your Cat with Enrichment Activities 1. Stimulating solo play: Ensure there are enough toys that allow your cat to play independently. Puzzle toys, automated toys, or treat-dispensing toys can provide mental and physical stimulation, even when no one is around to engage them in interactive play. 2. Rotating toys: Keep your cat's interest piqued by regularly replacing or rotating their toys. This will prevent boredom, as cats become more engaged when presented with new stimuli. 3. Creating a perch: Cats often enjoy observing their surroundings from above. Provide a cat perch, tree, or shelf near a window for your cat to climb and survey their environment. 4. Providing scratching posts and surfaces: Cats have a natural instinct to scratch to keep their claws healthy. By offering several scratching surfaces with different textures, you give them the opportunity to engage in this natural behavior while simultaneously diverting their attention from the door. Exploring the Great Outdoors Safely 1. Leash training: Train your cat to walk on a harness and leash, allowing them to safely explore the outdoors under your supervision. Choose a well-fitting and comfortable harness, and take time to acclimate your cat to the sensation of wearing it. Begin with short walks and gradually increase the duration and distance as your cat becomes accustomed. 2. Enclosed outdoor spaces: Create a secure enclosure, known as a 'catio,' in your backyard or on your balcony. This provides a dedicated safe space for your cat to experience the outdoors without the risk of harm from traffic, predators, or other hazards. 3. Supervised outdoor excursions: Organize occasional supervised outings for your feline companion, allowing them the freedom to explore in a controlled manner. This may involve playtime in your backyard or visits to a pet-friendly park, ensuring they are always within your sight and reach. Conclusion With a combination of distraction techniques, enrichment activities, and supervised outdoor access, you can satisfy your cat's natural curiosity, keep them entertained and reduce their focus on the door. By creating a safe and stimulating environment that caters to their unique needs, you can foster a happy and healthy relationship with your feline friend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does it follow that \\"The Roman troops looked after the citizens.\\"? OPT: a). yes b). it is not possible to tell c). no","completion":"c) No It is not accurate to say the Roman troops \\"looked after\\" the citizens of Jerusalem when discussing the destruction of the city 36 years after Jesus's crucifixion. To clarify this assertion, it is crucial to examine the historical context in which this took place. In the year 66 AD, the Jews of the province of Judaea in the Roman Empire revolted against Roman rule, primarily due to religious, political, and economic reasons. This revolt, known as the First Jewish-Roman War or the Great Revolt, lasted until 73 AD. The destruction of Jerusalem occurred at the peak of this conflict in 70 AD. The Roman army, led by the future Emperor Titus, besieged the city and employed various brutal tactics to subdue the populace. The Roman army did not spare the religious or cultural landmarks in their assault, as they razed the Second Temple of Jerusalem, which held immense significance for Jewish people. As the Roman troops surrounded the city, food supplies became increasingly scarce. Hunger and starvation were rampant, further weakening the people of Jerusalem. Alongside this, the Romans fought many intense battles against the Jewish rebels. Thousands of people perished in these confrontations, while many more fell to famine and disease. After Jerusalem's fall, no mercy was granted to those who remained. A significant number of survivors ended up executed by the Roman forces, while others faced the dreadful fate of slavery, condemned to a lifetime of servitude and hardship. Given these appalling conditions and the fact that Jerusalem's population was subjected to ruthless acts of violence, hardship, and subjugation, it does not follow that \\"the Roman troops looked after the citizens.\\" Quite the contrary, the Roman army was responsible for their suffering and the city's ultimate decimation during this tumultuous period in history."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Where would a rosebush be most likely to die due to lack of water? Possible A: canada, the desert, indiana, california, backyard Why is \\"california\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"California\\" as an answer aligned with human common sense for a rosebush most likely to die due to lack of water can be attributed to several factors, which include the state's climate, known drought history, and water management challenges. While the desert might seem like the most obvious answer, it is not as likely to be a location where a rosebush would be planted in the first place. Let's break down the factors contributing to California being a sensible answer: 1. Climate: California's climate is known for its warm, sunny weather. While the coastal areas may receive more rainfall, the inland regions can be very arid and dry. Many areas in California experience a Mediterranean climate, characterized by hot, dry summers and cool, wet winters. This means that plants like rosebushes may struggle to get enough water during the dry season. 2. Drought history: California has a history of prolonged droughts, with some lasting several years. This can exacerbate water scarcity issues, especially during summer months, when water usage typically increases due to irrigation needs. These droughts can have negative impacts on plants like rosebushes, which require a consistent water supply. 3. Water management challenges: California faces various water management challenges due to its large and diverse population, agricultural demands, and environmental needs. Sometimes, water restrictions are imposed to manage the scarce water resources, which may limit the water available for plants like rosebushes in residential gardens. In recent years, there has been an increasing emphasis on conserving water and using drought-tolerant landscaping, which can affect the overall water supply for plants like rosebushes. Taking into account these factors that are relevant to California, it aligns with human common sense to understand why a rosebush might be more likely to die due to lack of water in this state as compared to the other options like Canada, Indiana, and a backyard, which generally receive more rainfall and have fewer water scarcity issues."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Taiwan-China Saga: A Look into the Complex Relationship of Two Neighbors Introduction Taiwan, a small yet bustling island in the heart of Asia, has walked a tightrope of maintaining its sovereignty, while avoiding provocation of its powerful neighbor, China. It is essential to understand the historical roots of the unique relationship between the two entities, if one is to comprehend the political motives and claims of both sides. This article aims to explore the turbulent history between Taiwan and China, and illuminate the delicate political equilibrium that currently exists between them. Historical Background To understand the present, it is vital to look into the past. The Taiwan-China relationship traces back to the end of the Chinese Civil War in 1949. The Nationalist forces, led by the Kuomintang (KMT), suffered defeat at the hands of the Communist forces, led by Mao Zedong. Consequently, the KMT retreated to Taiwan and established a separate government, hence marking the inception of Taiwan's de facto independence from China. In 1950, the People's Republic of China (PRC) was proclaimed by the Chinese Communist Party, asserting its authority over mainland China and claiming sovereignty over Taiwan. However, Taiwan, under the leadership of the KMT, continued to self-govern as the Republic of China (ROC), having preserved the traditional Chinese political and economic systems. China's Stance on Taiwan Despite Taiwan's de facto independence since 1950, China has steadfastly maintained its claim on the island, considering it a breakaway province. The \\"One China Policy,\\" proposed by then Chinese leader, Deng Xiaoping, asserts that there is only one legitimate Chinese government, and it is the PRC. Interestingly, this policy also respects, but does not recognize, the existence of the ROC. The \\"One Country, Two Systems\\" policy, introduced by Deng Xiaoping, offered Taiwan a high degree of autonomy and preservation of the ROC system, as exemplified in the case of Hong Kong. Nevertheless, Taiwan has been hesitant to accept this proposal, fearing a gradual erosion of its autonomy and political distinctiveness. Taiwan's Struggles for International Recognition Despite its successful development and modernization, Taiwan has faced significant challenges in gaining international recognition due to China's geopolitical influence. The PRC has used diplomacy and, at times, economic pressure to ensure that other countries recognize it as the sole legitimate representative of China. As a result, many countries have been coerced to switch their diplomatic allegiance from Taiwan to China, leaving Taiwan with a sparse formal diplomatic presence in the world. However, Taiwan has continued to maintain informal relations with many nations, pursuing economic cooperation, cultural exchanges, and limited political interaction, avoiding any direct confrontation with the PRC. The Threat of Forceful Reunification China has not only pursued diplomacy and economic pressures but has also resorted to threats of military force to achieve reunification with Taiwan. For decades, China has been building its military capabilities to prepare for any potential conflict over the Taiwan Strait. Through multiple displays of military power, such as conducting naval exercises near Taiwan and flying fighter jets across the median line, China reminds Taiwan, and the world, of its unwavering determination to reunify the island with the mainland, by force if necessary. The Role of the United States In recent years, tensions across the Taiwan Strait have become increasingly precarious, as the United States continues to extend its support for Taiwan's democratization and economic progress. The US has pursued an ambiguous policy, recognizing the PRC as the sole representative of China but also maintaining the Taiwan Relations Act, which emphasizes robust informal relations with Taiwan and facilitation of Taiwan's self-defense. It is the careful maneuvering of US policy that has allowed Taiwan to survive in the shadow of its imposing neighbor, without committing to the formal recognition of Taiwan's sovereignty. Conclusion The Taiwan-China relationship is a complex and multifaceted issue, rooted in history and ethics, and brimming with political, economic, and strategic implications for the entire region. While Taiwan continues to exist as a de facto independent entity, it must navigate the turbulent waters of diplomacy and external pressures, seeking international support for its cause while maintaining its political and cultural identity. At the same time, the Chinese government persists in its efforts to reintegrate a historically significant territory, using various means such as diplomacy, economic coercion, and military threats - while also accounting for the ramifications to regional stability and international relations. As the future unfolds, it remains to be seen whether a peaceful resolution will be reached, or if tensions will culminate in a controversial reunification."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As he gets settled in he reflects on the turn of events in a flashback of his time working at Saint Benedict's Academy, a prestigious preparatory school. Twenty-eight years earlier, a younger Mr. Hundert is enthusiastic about the start of the school year. His class turns out to be a strict yet inspiring lesson for the freshmen. They include laid-back Louis Masoudi, introverted Martin Blythe, and studious Deepak Mehta. Hundert inspires his students to study hard in order to become one of the three contestants for The Emperor's Club and be crowned \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\", an academic competition between top three students of his class regarding the Classics. When the headmaster explains the contest to the students, he mentions that Blythe's father was once a \\"Mr. Julius Caesar\\". Hundert's orderly world is shaken when a new student, Sedgewick Bell, walks into his classroom late. Bell is the cocky son of a senior U.S. senator who possesses none of Hundert's principles. After Sedgewick plays the class clown, Hundert asks him to name a single Roman Emperor. When Bell cannot, Hundert has the other students perfectly recite the line of succession of the Roman Empire. Hundert also makes a trip to Washington, D.C. to meet with Senator Bell. Bell's father is uninterested in his son's character development, telling Hundert just to teach Bell so he can graduate. In a phone call, Senator Bell chastises Sedgewick for wasting his fatherâs time and money. After seeing him chastened, Hundert tries to become a mentor to Bell in order to make him a better man.

Background: Hippolytus of Rome (170 - 235 AD) was one of the most important 3rd-century theologians in the Christian Church in Rome, where he was probably born. Photios I of Constantinople describes him in his Bibliotheca (cod. 121) as a disciple of Irenaeus, who was said to be a disciple of Polycarp, and from the context of this passage it is supposed that he suggested that Hippolytus so styled himself. However, this assertion is doubtful. Context: The facts of his life as well as his writing were soon forgotten in the West, perhaps by reason of his criticism of the bishops of Rome and because he wrote in Greek. Pope Damasus I dedicated to him one of his famous epigrams, making him, however, a priest of the Novatianist schism, a view later accepted by Prudentius in the 5th century in his \\"Passion of St Hippolytus\\". In the Passionals of the 7th and 8th centuries he is represented as a soldier converted by Saint Lawrence, a legend that long survived in the Roman Breviary. He was also confused with a martyr of the same name who was buried in Portus, of which city he was believed to have been a bishop, who was put to death by drowning in a deep well. According to Prudentius' account, Hippolytus was dragged to death by wild horses, a striking parallel to the story of the mythological Hippolytus, who was dragged to death by wild horses at Athens. He described the subterranean tomb of the saint and states that he saw there a picture representing Hippolytus' execution. He also confirms August 13 as the date on which a Hippolytus was celebrated but this again refers to the convert of Lawrence, as preserved in the Menaion of the Eastern Orthodox Church. The latter account led to Hippolytus being considered the patron saint of horses. During the Middle Ages, sick horses were brought to St Ippolyts, Hertfordshire, England, where a church is dedicated to him. Question: Is this a true legend?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Okay, imagine I'm talking to a 5-year-old: Hippolytus of Rome was a very important person who taught about Christianity a very, very long time ago. Some people say he learned from other important teachers too. But later, people forgot about him and his writings, maybe because he didn't agree with some other important people in the church. There are stories about him becoming a soldier, being friends with a saint, and even being a leader in a city. One story even says that he was pulled by wild horses until he died, just like a character from a make-believe story. People started to think he could protect horses, so they asked him to help their sick horses. Now, is this all true? We don't know for sure. A lot of these stories are very old and mixed up with other stories, so it's hard to say what really happened. But, these stories are still important because they help us learn about history and connect with people from a long, long time ago."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a galaxy not so far away, a French inventor has created a replica of Han Solo’s famous spaceship, the Millennium Falcon. The amazing contraption is seen hovering and flying around the ground, complete with the aesthetics and lights inspired by the famous Star Wars ship. It is built around a standard quadcopter drone, which has been boosted to give the Millennium Falcon drone more speed. Scroll down for videos. A French inventor has unveiled a Star Wars-inspired quadcopter (shown). The Millennium Falcon drone is seen taking off and flying around. It has lights on the back to mimic famous spaceship. And it also has a shell and design that matches the original. The drone itself cost about £750, but the modifications were under £20. Olivier Caron, 40, who goes by Olivier-FR on Reddit and is from Grenoble in France, said that he ‘overpowered’ the quadcopter drone to make it ‘easily capable of 90 km/h (55mph) speed’. Rumours suggest that the California-based firm is looking to release a range of multirotor helicopters late in 2015. The devices would be fitted with GoPro cameras, controlled remotely and are expected to retail for between 500 (£317) and 1,000 (£634). At this price range, the drones would be targeted more towards consumers and hobbyists and compete with market leaders Parrot and DJI, rather than rival the likes of professional devices from senseFly. He added: ‘But with this extra hull it becomes a slow flying pig. ‘Top speed is probably around 30 km/h (19mph), if I try to go faster with more angle it’s making a cool backflip.’ He joked that it could make the ‘Kessel run’ in several thousand years, in reference to Han Solo’s boasting in Star Wars: A New Hope, when he said the Millennium Falcon could make the ‘Kessel run’ - a smuggling route - in ‘less than twelve parsecs’. Olivier said it cost him next to nothing to modify the drone into a new shape. It cost £7.50 (11.50) for the two foam planks to make the drone, and £9 (13.80) for the front and rear lights.

The video shows the replica Millennium Falcon drone zipping around the field at a height of around 20 feet and the rear of the ship is light up just as it is in the films.

Please answer this question : Would house A less likely or more likely cause brain damage than house B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, house A would be more likely to cause brain damage than house B. Here's the step-by-step reasoning: 1. House A has lead plumbing pipes and lead-based paint. These materials are known to contain lead, which can cause brain damage, particularly in small children who may ingest it. 2. House B, being built more recently, does not have lead plumbing pipes or lead-based paint.

Alexis-Charles-Henri Clerel de Tocqueville (French: [aleksi SaRl aRi kleRel d@ tokvil]; 29 July 1805 - 16 April 1859) was a French political thinker and historian best known for his works Democracy in America (appearing in two volumes: 1835 and 1840) and The Old Regime and the Revolution (1856). In both of these, he analyzed the improved living standards and social conditions of individuals, as well as their relationship to the market and state in Western societies. Democracy in America was published after Tocqueville's travels in the United States, and is today considered an early work of sociology and political science. Tocqueville was active in French politics, first under the July Monarchy (1830-1848) and then during the Second Republic (1849-1851) which succeeded the February 1848 Revolution.

(Associated Press) Supporters of ousted Egypt's President Mohammed Morsi protest as army soldiers guard at the Republican Guard building in Nasr City, in Cairo, Egypt, Wednesday, July 10, 2013. After days of deadlock, Egypt's... (Associated Press) New Prime Minister Hazem el-Beblawi, who was appointed by the interim president on Tuesday, is holding consultations on a Cabinet that will face the difficult task of guiding the deeply divided country through what promises to be a rocky transition period following the military's toppling of Morsi last week. In what is seen as an attempt at reconciliation, el-Beblawi has said he will offer the Brotherhood, which helped propel Morsi to the presidency, posts in his transitional government. A Brotherhood spokesman said the group will not take part in an interim Cabinet, and that talk of national reconciliation under the current circumstances is \\"irrelevant.\\" He spoke on condition of anonymity because of concerns for his security. Egypt's country's interim leaders and military have tried to fast-track the transition process in an effort to restore a measure of stability to the country while also reassuring the U.S. and other Western allies that the country is on a path toward democratically-based leadership. Under a timetable announced by the interim president, new elections are to be held early next year. The Brotherhood's refusal to join the new military-backed leadership was widely expected. The group has denounced the toppling of Morsi as a coup against democracy, and has vowed to continue its street protests until the deposed president is returned to power. Still, its rejection underscored how polarized the nation's politics have become, and laid bare the monumental task the interim leadership faces in trying stabilize the country. The nascent government will soon face demands that it tackle economic woes that mounted under Morsi, including fuel shortages, electricity cutoffs and inflation. Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates provided a welcome boost for the new leadership on Tuesday. The two countries, both opponents of Morsi's Brotherhood, celebrated his ouster by showering the cash-strapped Egyptian government with promises of 8 billion in grants, loans and badly needed gas and oil. In doing so, they are effectively stepping in for Morsi's Gulf patron, Qatar, a close ally of the Brotherhood that gave his government several billion in aid. During Morsi's year in office, he and his officials toured multiple countries seeking cash to prop up rapidly draining foreign currency reserves and plug mounting deficits _ at times getting a cold shoulder. As the new prime minister looks to cobble together a government, Egypt's new leadership is facing pressure from those who backed the military's move against Morsi. Several groups in the loose coalition participating in the political process were angered over the transition plan issued Monday by interim President Adly Mansour. His declaration set out a seven-month timetable for elections but also a truncated, temporary constitution laying out the division of powers in the meantime. At the heart of liberals' objections to the plan is that they wanted to write a new constitution, not amend the one written under Morsi by an Islamist-dominated panel. That constitution contained several articles that drew fierce criticism from liberal quarters, and helped sparked street protests and violence in 2012. The top liberal political grouping, the National Salvation Front, rejected the transition plan late Tuesday. It said it was not consulted _ \\"in violation of previous promises\\" _ and that the declaration \\"lacks significant clauses while others need change or removal.\\" It did not elaborate but said it had presented Mansour with changes it seeks. The secular, revolutionary youth movement Tamarod, which organized last week's massive protests against Morsi that prompted the military to step in, also criticized the plan, in part because it gives too much power to Mansour, including the power to issue laws. A post-Morsi plan put forward by Tamarod called for a largely ceremonial interim president with most power in the hands of the prime minister. Egypt remains deeply polarized with heightened fears of violence, especially after the killing Monday of more than 50 Morsi supporters outside a military building in Cairo. The Brotherhood and Islamist allies say they are under siege by a military crackdown that has jailed five of their leaders and shut down their media outlets. ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The arrest warrant for Mohamed Badie has provoked anger among his supporters according to the BBC's Jim Muir Egypt's state prosecutor has issued an arrest warrant for the leader of the Muslim Brotherhood, Mohamed Badie, and at least nine other senior figures. Mr Badie is accused of inciting the violence in Cairo on Monday in which more than 50 people were killed. Many Brotherhood members are already in detention and warrants are said to have been been issued for hundreds more. Meanwhile, a foreign ministry spokesman has said ousted President Mohammed Morsi is being held in a \\"safe place\\". Badr Abdul Atti told reporters he did not know where the 61 year old was, but that he was being treated in a \\"very dignified manner\\". \\"For his own safety and for the safety of the country, it is better to keep him in a safe place. Otherwise, the consequences will be dire,\\" he added. Mr Abdul Atti is reported to have denied that Mr Morsi was being detained at the Presidential Guard barracks in Cairo, as many believe. The Brotherhood, to which he belongs, says his ousting by the military a week ago amounted to a coup. Its supporters have since been staging protests outside the capital's Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, not far from the barracks, demanding his release and reinstatement. Analysis Muslim Brotherhood spokesmen were almost baffled by the prosecutor's move to issue arrest warrants for Mohammed Badie. Mr Badie is the movement's general or supreme guide, to whom every new member is required to pledge an oath of allegiance. So, his detention would enrage the thousands of Brotherhood supporters camped outside Cairo's Rabaa al-Adawiya mosque, where they are vowing to remain until President Mohammed Morsi is released and reinstated. Mr Badie and a handful of other Brotherhood leaders escaped arrest when the army deposed Mr Morsi a week ago. He has since addressed the crowd at the mosque and vowed not to give an inch until the democratically elected government is restored. The real danger is that the move to arrest Mr Badie completely undermines efforts by the interim president to form a government of national unity, ahead of proposed elections next year. Less than 24 hours ago, Adly Mansour's office was reporting that it had offered positions to the Brotherhood. But any attempt to arrest those senior Brotherhood figures not yet in detention would almost certainly inflame what is already a volatile situation in Egypt. The movement's political wing, the Freedom and Justice Party (FJP), has said it will not accept an offer to join the cabinet being set up by interim Prime Minister Hazem al-Beblawi, a 76-year-old economist and former finance minister who was appointed on Tuesday. The arrest warrants could scupper any attempts to persuade the Brotherhood to participate in the transitional political process. 'Remain peaceful' Spokesman Gehad el-Haddad said the charges against Mr Badie, known as the General Guide, and other senior leaders, were \\"nothing more than an attempt by the police state to dismantle the Rabaa protest\\". Prosecutors also said they had ordered 200 people - believed to be Brotherhood members - to be held in custody for at least 15 days pending further investigation into accusations of murder, incitement to violence, carrying unlicensed weapons and disrupting public order. Another 450 have been released on bail. There were conflicting reports about what happened on Monday, with the interim authorities being accused of a cover-up. The Brotherhood maintains that soldiers carried out a massacre of peaceful demonstrators, who had been taking part in dawn prayers outside the Presidential Guard barracks. But the police and the military say they acted in self-defence, and had opened fire only after being attacked by armed assailants. More than 50 Brotherhood supporters were killed, as well as a soldier and two policemen. On Wednesday, 15 leading Egyptian human rights groups expressed their \\"strong condemnation of the excessive use of force\\" against Brotherhood supporters, and called for an independent investigation into Monday's violence. The previous Friday, Mr Badie had appeared at a rally outside the mosque, telling the crowd: \\"We shall stay in the squares until we bring President Morsi back to power.\\" He said their protests would remain peaceful and called on the army not to \\"direct your arms against us\\". The BBC's Jim Muir, in Cairo, says the protest now covers several square kilometres of the capital, and to clear it out forcibly would almost certainly involve further bloodshed. There is a feeling among the protesters that they have returned to the situation they were in under former President Hosni Mubarak, when the movement was banned and its members hunted down, our correspondent adds. The timetable for new elections, announced in a constitutional declaration by interim President Adly Mansour on Monday evening, laid out plans to set up a panel to amend the suspended constitution within 15 days. The changes would then be put to a referendum - to be organised within four months - which would pave the way for parliamentary elections, possibly in early 2014. Adly Mansour's transition timeline Panel formed within 15 days to review constitution Constitutional amendments to be finalised and put to referendum in four months Parliamentary elections to be held by early 2014 Presidential elections to be called once new parliament convenes Key players in the Egyptian crisis Profile: Hazem el-Beblawi Q&A: Egypt in turmoil Once the new parliament convenes, elections would be called to appoint a new president. A spokesman for Mr Mansour said posts in the cabinet would be offered to the FJP, but senior party official Mohamed Kamal told the BBC: \\"We will never take part in any cabinet as long as Morsi is not back as a president.\\" The FJP's deputy chairman, Essam al-Erian, earlier said the constitutional declaration had been issued \\"by a man appointed by putschists\\". The text does make clear that Mr Mansour and his government draw their authority only from the commander of the armed forces, who deposed President Morsi. The main liberal coalition, the National Salvation Front (NSF), expressed reservations about the decree, saying it was not consulted and that it \\"lacks significant clauses while others need change or removal\\". The grassroots Tamarod protest movement, which organised the demonstrations that led to Mr Morsi's overthrow, said the decree gave too much power to Mr Mansour. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait - who are opponents of the Muslim Brotherhood - have promised Egypt's interim government 12bn (£8bn) in grants, loans, and gas and oil.

It was to set up an autonomous Bulgarian principality spanning Moesia, Macedonia and Thrace, roughly on the territories of the Second Bulgarian Empire, and this day is now a public holiday called National Liberation Day. The other Great Powers immediately rejected the treaty out of fear that such a large country in the Balkans might threaten their interests. It was superseded by the Treaty of Berlin, signed on 13 July, which provided for a much smaller state only comprising Moesia and the region of Sofia, leaving large populations of ethnic Bulgarians outside the new country. This significantly contributed to Bulgaria's militaristic foreign affairs approach during the first half of the 20th century.The Bulgarian principality won a war against Serbia and incorporated the semi-autonomous Ottoman territory of Eastern Rumelia in 1885, proclaiming itself an independent state on 5 October 1908. In the years following independence, Bulgaria increasingly militarized and was often referred to as \\"the Balkan Prussia\\". It became involved in three consecutive conflicts between 1912 and 1918—two Balkan Wars and World War I. After a disastrous defeat in the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria again found itself fighting on the losing side as a result of its alliance with the Central Powers in World War I. Despite fielding more than a quarter of its population in a 1,200,000-strong army and achieving several decisive victories at Doiran and Monastir, the country capitulated in 1918. The war resulted in significant territorial losses and a total of 87,500 soldiers killed.

Nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments in March filed lawsuits Wednesday against the apartment complex. They allege that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon in the aftermath of the blaze. Bernard Dempsey Jr., an attorney with Western Michigan Legal Services, the group that represents the tenants, said Alamo Hills gave the displaced families very limited opportunity to remove belongings. \\"They were given three days to get their stuff out, and if they couldn't get moved out in three days, their stuff was discarded,\\" Dempsey said. \\"Alamo Hills just threw it out.\\" Others, he said, lost possessions to looters after the March 23 blaze, which left 78 people temporarily homeless. According to the lawsuit, the tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments to retrieve possessions and were promised that the complex would provide security. A spokesperson for PM One, the company that manages Alamo Hills, could not be reached for comment. Nine separate suits were filed in 8th District Court, which handles civil claims of less than 25,000. \\"We're asking for the reimbursement of the value of their property and a small amount for stress -- 3,000 on top of their out-of-pocket expenses for their lost stuff,\\" Dempsey said. \\"They're not looking to get rich off this. A lot of this is simply because they were treated so badly.\\" Dempsey said most of the tenants who filed suits still live at the apartment complex, although many are trying to find homes elsewhere. \\"The new apartments (they were provided) were not in very good shape. That's actually one of the claims,\\" he said. Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"Tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments\\" correctly answer the question \\"In general, why did nine families who were displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments file lawsuits against the apartment complex?\\"?","completion":"Yes, the response \\"Tenants were prohibited from entering their apartments\\" is one of the reasons why nine families displaced by a fire at Alamo Hills Apartments filed lawsuits against the apartment complex. However, it is essential to mention other reasons, as well. These include the allegation that the complex could have done more to protect belongings they were forced to abandon, the limited opportunity to remove belongings (only three days), discarding the items if not removed, and possessions lost to looters. Additionally, the tenants were promised that the complex would provide security, which appears not to have been adequately provided. The tenants were also unhappy about the condition of the new apartments they were provided, as they were not in very good shape.

Paragraph: SARS-CoV membrane protein could be detected easily using Western blotting in non-denaturing condition but not regular denaturing treatment. Boiling treatment, causing the aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein in the stacking gels, results in the failure to detect the membrane protein in the separating gels. Aggregated membrane proteins could not be dissociated by 1% Triton-X 100, 6 M urea, or 2% SDS. The region with amino acid residues from 51 to 170 is responsible for thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein. Hydrophobic regions with amino acid residues from 61 to 90, from 91 to 100, from 136 to 170, are essential for this protein aggregation. Thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein is not unique among structural proteins of coronaviruses. However, SARS-CoV membrane protein seems to be more sensitive to heat treatment, since the membrane protein of MHV-JHM, another member of the Coronaviridae, would not aggregate after the same treatment. Therefore, if SARS-CoV membrane protein needs to be analyzed using SDS-PAGE, boiling should be avoided. Thermal aggregation of SARS-CoV membrane protein may be one of the reasons for the inactivation of this virus by heat. The unusual property of SARS-CoV membrane protein aggregation induced by heat also provides a model for the study of protein aggregation.

Once again, I've analysed my year of travel to see if I'm any closer to reducing it year on year. It's an annual habit, and if often kicks off new ideas that might affect my team's next year of work. The good answer is: yes, there is less travel! And not just that, but having reduced the schlepping I do, I've been able to hire more amazing people to lead on our work, and celebrate one of NoTosh's best years ever in terms of the quality, quantity and breadth of work we're doing. Key to traveling less has been a marked increase in the number of folk who see and are now reaping the value of working with us online. I've avoided as many as 20,000 miles of travel thanks to greener clients, who are also many dollars better off having not paid for the airmiles that are wrapped up in our regular fee structure. The quality of our work is better, too, thanks to this. We are doing fewer of those day-long workshops with teachers or leaders, when an hour or even thirty minutes before the day gets started is more worthwhile. We're seeing more school leaders take this up, although it's harder to get teachers into the habit of taking 30 minutes 'me time' to jump into a coaching session on the day or week ahead. But it's starting, and the value to us all is huge. Coaching is very different to 'consulting a Personal Learning Network' on Twitter. It's intense, targeted, focussed and involves a one-on-one discussion that arrives quickly at resolutions to current day challenges that will have a long-term impact. And we come back to measure whether that impact actually happened. I don't think it's a way of working that many are used to in Education, although many corporate clients have had some rare experience with it. Encouraging both groups to take more regular time out for coaching, little and often, is a real challenge, but we're beginning to see some huge impact from relatively little input (and relatively few dollars!).

Plot title: Camelot Movie plot: During the opening credits, like the Broadway production, the studio orchestra plays a potpourri overture that features the \\"Camelot March\\" and the title song. The action begins in early morning darkness as a chorus sings a few lines from \\"Guenevere.\\" Arthur (Richard Harris) talks to his unseen teacher, Merlyn (Laurence Naismith), asking him why everything that has happened to them happened. Before a battle begins at dawn with Lancelot (Franco Nero) and his Joyous Gard knights, Arthur, talking as much to himself as to Merlyn, tries to determine where he went wrong. Merlyn appears and urges the mighty King to think back to one of the most important days of his life. Almost all of the rest of the film is a flashback. It first flashes back to Arthur as a youngster (Nicholas Beauvy); he is walking in the woods in the early morning when he encounters Merlyn, who calls Arthur \\"Wart.\\" Then suddenly, Merlyn interrupts to chide Arthur for going too far back in his memory. The important day Arthur is supposed to remember, Merlyn says, is the day he met Guenevere (Vanessa Redgrave).The following scene shows Arthur in a large snow-laden tree watching people pass on the road beneath. From his perch, Arthur sings \\"I Wonder What the King Is Doing Tonight?\\" He imagines that his subjects are pondering what he is doing in the final hours before his arranged marriage. Arthur admits that even though he has faced battle bravely, he's terrified of facing his bride-to-be. As the song ends, a procession approaches (\\"Camelot March\\") carrying Guenevere. She is not at all thrilled that her wedding is an inconvenient marriage of convenience. In despair, Guenevere sings \\"The Simple Joys of Maidenhood.\\" The lyrics question how she missed the normal life of a maiden and all its simple pleasures like knights tilting for her and \\"kith not kill their kin\\" for her. The procession halts for a rest so the royal hairdresser can prepare Guenevere to meet her mate. While everyone is busy, Guenevere sneaks away into the woods. She kneels in the snow... My question: who confides to Guenevere his idea for a \\"Round Table\\"?

King Arthur, taking advantage of this anonymity, shares his vision of a new kind of kingdom based on justice, fairness, and equality, with a \\"Round Table\\" where all knights would gather as equals, void of any hierarchical structure. This idea deeply impresses Guenevere, and the two eventually fall in love with each other, setting the stage for the story of Camelot that follows."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jeff narrowly avoids colliding with a beat-up truck. Later, at a gas station, Earl, the truck's driver, confronts Jeff, exchanging hostile words. Shortly after the couple resume their journey, their car breaks down on a vacant road. Leaving Jeff with the Jeep, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big rig trucker to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that someone has tampered with the Jeep's battery connections. After reconnecting them, he drives to the diner, only to discover that no one has seen Amy. When he sees the trucker on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or Amy. Jeff then hails a passing sheriff named Boyd, but a brief search of the truck yields no sign of Amy. The trucker, Red Barr, is let go and Jeff is instructed by Boyd to see his deputy in the town of Brackett. After speaking with the deputy, Jeff goes back to the diner. Billy, a mentally-impaired mechanic, informs Jeff that Amy left with some men, but refuses to speak with the police, claiming they are involved. Jeff rushes to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl. He escapes by driving his Jeep into a river, then circles back on foot to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the river. He is then discovered and knocked out by Billy. When Jeff wakes up, he is confronted by Billy (who feigned mental impairment earlier), Earl and another accomplice named Al. Their leader is none other than Red Barr. Red informs Jeff that he wants the 90,000 in Jeff's bank account, and shows him the bank of Brackett. Realizing he has only a fraction of the assumed amount, Jeff attempts to alert the bank manager to his plight. However, paranoid that Red's group is keeping an eye on him, Jeff gives up the idea and steals marked money ribbons and a letter opener. He uses the money ribbons to pack stacks of 1 bills between two 100 bills. Jeff is then instructed to leave...

Why am I getting a strange reading in a multimeter when I test for continuity? How do we identify the emitter, collector and base of a transistor by using a multimeter? OPTIONS: a). no; b). yes; The answer is:","completion":"a). no; These two questions are not the same and pertain to different aspects of using a multimeter. Let's discuss each question briefly to bring out the differences. Question 1: Why am I getting a strange reading in a multimeter when I test for continuity? This question deals with potential issues or concerns that a person might face while using a multimeter to test for electrical continuity. Continuity is a measure of whether a circuit is complete and capable of conducting electric current. Strange readings could be caused by various factors such as a faulty multimeter, improper device settings, or an issue with the circuit being tested. The user is seeking help in understanding the reason for the strange readings and troubleshooting the problem. To respond to this question, advice would be given to identify and correct the causes of the unusual multimeter readings. Some steps to diagnose and resolve the issue could involve ensuring the multimeter is in proper working condition, using the correct settings for the measurement being taken (e.g., resistance or diode settings), ensuring good probe contact, and inspecting the circuit for broken or damaged components. Question 2: How do we identify the emitter, collector, and base of a transistor by using a multimeter? This question focuses on the process of identifying the pins (emitter, collector, and base) of a transistor using a multimeter. A transistor is a semiconductor device used to amplify or switch electronic signals and electrical power. It is composed of semiconductor material and usually has three terminals or \\"pins\\" for connection to an external circuit. To answer this question, one would provide a step-by-step method to identify the pins of a transistor with a multimeter. For example, using the multimeter on the diode setting, make a note of the resistance readings between each pair of pins (base-emitter, base-collector, and emitter-collector). The readings should help in identifying the type of transistor (NPN or PNP) and determining the correct pin arrangement. In conclusion, these two questions are different, as they pertain to separate issues and processes involved in using a multimeter. The first question deals with troubleshooting strange continuity readings, while the second question discusses the identification of transistor pins using a multimeter."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Choose from: * Use a glue stick and put it along the border of a card without its center and then press another hollowed out card onto it.; * Using a pen tip draw along the border of a card without its center and then press another hollowed out card onto it.;","completion":"Based on the presented options, the most suitable solution for gluing together cards with cutout centers is: * Use a glue stick and put it along the border of a card without its center and then press another hollowed out card onto it. There are several reasons why this method is more effective and appropriate for the given goal compared to using a pen tip: 1. Adhesive properties: Glue sticks are specifically designed for bonding purposes, containing a strong adhesive that works effectively on paper-based materials such as cards. The glue forms a firm bond between the surfaces of the cards, ensuring that they stay together. On the other hand, a pen tip would not have any adhesive properties and will not be able to bond the cards together. 2. Precision: A glue stick allows for precise application along the border of the card, ensuring that the adhesive is applied evenly to the edges and preventing any gaps or misalignments. This results in a better, more visually appealing bond between the cards. Using a pen tip to draw along the border would not achieve the same level of accuracy, leading to a less secure and less visually appealing bond. 3. Ease of use: Glue sticks are easy to apply and control, minimizing the risk of making a mess or applying too much adhesive. This ensures a clean and tidy final product. Using a pen tip to apply pressure along the border of the card would be more difficult to control, and might cause damage to the card or unwanted creases in the material. 4. Time efficiency: Glue sticks can quickly and efficiently apply adhesive to a card's border, while using a pen tip to draw along the border would be a more time-consuming process. 5. Compatibility: Glue sticks are specifically designed to bond paper-based materials, making them one of the best options for gluing together cards with cutout centers. A pen tip does not have any specific compatibility with cardstock materials, thus making it less ideal for this task. In conclusion, utilizing a glue stick for gluing together cards with cutout centers is the better choice due to its adhesive properties, precision, ease of use, time efficiency, and compatibility with cardstock materials. Using a pen tip to draw along the border would not provide the desired bonding effect and might lead to a less secure connection between the cards."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

An angry supporter of the 'Bersih' (Clean) electoral reform coalition reacts as he recovers after police fired tear gas during clashes in downtown Kuala Lumpur July 9, 2011. KUALA LUMPUR (Reuters) - Malaysian police fired repeated rounds of tear gas and detained over 1,400 people in the capital on Saturday as thousands of activists evaded roadblocks and barbed wire to hold a street protest against Prime Minister Najib Razak's government. At least a dozen people were hurt in the demonstration for electoral reform in downtown Kuala Lumpur. There were no reports of serious injuries but some analysts said the police action was excessive and would dent Najib's image. \\"We are not criminals, we are just asking for free and fair elections,\\" opposition leader Anwar Ibrahim's daughter, Nurul Izzah Anwar, told reporters after her father was knocked down and hurt in a melee when he and his supporters were tear gassed. \\"Many innocent people were injured. We condemn this act of cruelty by UMNO and Barisan Nasional,\\" she said, referring to Najib's party and the ruling coalition. Street protests are rare in this Southeast Asian nation, but foreign investors are worried that any groundswell of anti-government sentiment could delay economic reforms seen as essential to draw investment. If he is put under popular pressure, Najib may reconsider plans for a snap election and hold back on reforms such as cutting fuel subsidies or unwinding an affirmative action program for the country's Malay majority. Polls are not due until 2013 but analysts have said Najib could seek an early mandate after economic growth accelerated to a 10-year high in 2010. \\"From Najib's perspective, holding elections anytime soon would be a mistake because of the damage that has been done today,\\" said Bridget Welsh, Malaysia specialist at Singapore Management University. \\"The fact that such a large crowd turned up despite a crackdown shows that voter anger is deep and this is going to push a lot of people who are in the middle toward the opposition.\\" Reuters witnesses saw tear gas shells lobbed repeatedly at groups of protesters in downtown Kuala Lumpur as the crowds chanted \\"Long Live the People\\" and \\"Reformasi, reformasi,\\" the Malay word for reform. Several people were seen bleeding after the tear gas was fired, but police gave no details of any injuries. Crowds around the city's main bus station were also sprayed with water cannon. Malaysia's inspector-general of police, Ismail Omar, said 1,401 people were taken into custody, but many will be released after questioning. At least three senior opposition leaders were among those detained, other officials said. \\"We have made our point that we want free and fair elections,\\" said Chan Mei Yin, a 32-year old accountant who joined the protest. \\"The police are just showing that they are brutal to Malaysians. I will not vote for this government.\\" NOT THAILAND While Malaysia is far from being divided by political strife like its northern neighbor Thailand, the opposition has been steadily growing more vocal. Tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets at a November 2007 rally, which analysts said galvanized support for the opposition ahead of record gains in a 2008 general election. Analysts said the turnout of protesters on Saturday was more than 10,000, around the same as in 2007. Police, however, put the number at 5,000-6,000, while protest organizers claimed 50,000 attended. \\"Malaysian civil society is showing the government that intimidation will not work,\\" said Ooi Kee Beng, a political analyst at the Institute of Southeast Asian Studies of Singapore. \\"We're seeing a lack of will on the part of the government to try to negotiate and to defuse the situation. It's all going to look very bad outside Malaysia.\\" After Malaysia's constitutional monarch tried to defuse the situation, the government initially offered Bersih (Clean), the group that called the protest, the use of a stadium to hold its demonstration. But it baulked at allowing the group to use the main stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur, at which point Bersih said it would defy the ban. From midnight, police locked down the central shopping district of the city of 1.6 million people, setting up roadblocks and barring taxis and buses from the area. Suburban trains, however, continued to operate and other areas of the city were not affected. Bersih has vowed to bring together tens of thousands of supporters to the protest but it fell short. Still, some analysts said the government faced a problem. \\"Just looking at the crowd there were many 'first timers', young people from the Facebook generation who just wanted to have a peaceful life,\\" said Ibrahim Suffian, director of the independent opinion polling outfit Merdeka Center. \\"This is trouble for Najib as it will polarize traditionally non-political segments of society like the young even further away from him.\\" Najib took power in 2009, and inherited a divided ruling coalition which had been weakened by historic losses in the 2008 polls. He has promised to restructure government and economy and introduced an inclusive brand of politics aimed at uniting the country's different races. Najib's approval ratings have risen from 45 percent to 69 percent in February, according to independent polling outfit Merdeka Center. But analysts said recent ethnic and religious differences have undermined his popularity.

(Associated Press) At least 20,000 Malaysians defied government warnings by marching for electoral reforms Saturday, as police fired tear gas and detained more than 1,600 in the country's biggest political rally in four years. The crackdown on the opposition-backed demonstration in Malaysia's main city, Kuala Lumpur, triggered criticism that Prime Minister Najib Razak's long-ruling coalition was unwilling to allow public dissent or make election laws fairer ahead of national polls widely expected by mid-2012. Najib's administration declared the rally illegal and warned people repeatedly over the past month to avoid it. Officials insisted it was simply an opposition scheme to spark chaos and stir anti-government sentiment, while activists accused authorities of being afraid of a protest that could undermine their authority. Authorities blocked roads, shut rail stations and deployed trucks with water cannons near the Independence Stadium in downtown Kuala Lumpur where activists sought to gather. More than 200 activists had been arrested over the past two weeks for promoting the rally. The large number of demonstrators who showed up despite the threat of arrests and the disruptions in transport links bolstered claims by activists that the government had misjudged public opinion by not allowing what they insisted would have been a peaceful rally. The crackdown \\"stirred a sense of outrage against the exhibition of raw power by our government,\\" said Ambiga Sreenavasan, head of the Bersih coalition of civic groups that organized the rally. \\"What is the necessity for a show of might against right? No matter what, right will always prevail,\\" she said. Police said in a statement that they detained 1,667 people Saturday in a clampdown called \\"Operation Erase Bersih.\\" Those arrested included several senior opposition officials. Some were released after several hours, with police indicating that most would not be held overnight. Thousands tried to reach the stadium from various parts of Kuala Lumpur, chanting \\"Long live the people\\" and carrying yellow balloons and flowers as they marched. Police fired numerous rounds of tear gas and chemical-laced water in repeated attempts to disperse the crowds, causing demonstrators to scatter into nearby buildings and alleys before they regrouped. Police helicopters flew overhead as a brief downpour failed to deter the protesters. Witnesses said riot police armed with batons charged at some protesters and dragged them into trucks. Some were seen bleeding, but police could not confirm any injuries. Anwar Ibrahim, Malaysia's top opposition figure, was being treated at a hospital for a \\"minor injury\\" he said he received when his group was hit by tear gas. The Malaysiakini news website said he had a knee injury. \\"We were attacked from both corners but what was horrifying is that the police shot directly at the protesters, some of them clearly aimed at me personally, so my security assistants had to cover me and one was badly injured because the canister was shot direct, he is badly injured,\\" Anwar told Associated Press Television News. \\"This is a simple portrayal of the extent of desperation of brutal action approved by the Prime Minister Najib.\\" The demonstrators dispersed after a five-hour standoff with police. Only several hundred reached the stadium. Prime Minister Najib insisted Saturday the protesters only represent a minority, and that most Malaysians support his administration. \\"If there are people who want to hold the illegal rally, there are even more who are against their plan,\\" the prime minister was quoted as saying by the national news agency, Bernama. Organizers said 50,000 took part in the rally, but police claimed there were only up to 6,000. Other observers and participants said the total was between 20,000 and 30,000, noting that it was highly unlikely that police could have arrested a quarter of the demonstrators. An accurate count was impossible because they were scattered in various areas. The rally has galvanized the opposition and has been credited for a surge in political awareness among the public in recent weeks. Opposition leaders accuse Najib's National Front coalition of relying on fraud to preserve its 54-year grip on power, which has been eroded in recent years amid mounting complaints about corruption and racial discrimination. The government insists the current electoral policies are evenhanded. The activists' demands include an overhaul of voter registration lists, tougher measures to curb fraud and fairer opportunities for opposition politicians to campaign in government-linked media. The National Front's mandate expires in mid-2013 but many analysts expect elections to be called by next year. Supporters of the Bersih coalition were also planning solidarity marches over the weekend in foreign cities, including in Australia, Britain, France, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand and the United States. In Washington, State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said the U.S. has been communicating to Malaysia the importance of respecting human rights, including freedom of expression and assembly. \\"We consider it incumbent on all sides to refrain from violence,\\" she told a news conference Friday. ___ Associated Press writer Matthew Pennington in Washington contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, many people gathered for a big protest against the government.

Detectives Mike Parnell (David Rasche) and Danny Scalise (Richard Young) are cops specializing in drug busts who also frame people and steal drugs that should be declared evidence so that they can use it for their own recreational drug use and selling to dealers. One day Parnell takes a large hit of cocaine and becomes unable to concentrate properly about the address for the next drug bust expecting to find drugs. But instead they break into the wrong house as Jimmie walks out of the bathroom with a handheld hair dryer in hand, Parnell shoots thinking it's a weapon. Rainwood is shot in the shoulder and knocked unconscious. Realising that they could both be tested for taking drugs and charged they decide to cover up their mistake. They plant drugs in the house and place a firearm in the hand of Rainwood's unconscious body and they frame him as a drug dealer. Jimmie is pegged as a user having a prior record of marijuana possession while in college and his only defense is his word against two decorated cops. He claims the two cops framed him but no evidence proves the men are corrupt. He gets a 6-year prison sentence.

The products I’ve been trying out are Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash* and Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo and Pampering Conditioner*. Yes to Grapefruit Rejuvenating Body Wash – the grapefruit range is aimed at those with uneven or dull skintone. This pearlised white shower gel has a gentle zingy grapefruit scent to wake you up in the morning and exfoliating fruit acids help to remove dead skin cells leaving your skin glowing and smooth. The ingredients are 98% natural and the body wash gives a light foam in the shower. I really like it, grapefruit is one of my favourite fruity scents and the large 280ml tube will last me for ages. Yes to Carrots Nourishing Shampoo & Pampering Conditioner – I always avoid sodium laureth sulphate (SLS) in my haircare products as I have a very sensitive scalp and SLS makes it really itchy and sore, so I was really pleased to read that this shampoo and conditioner are SLS free.

Both products have a pleasant sweet scent although I wouldn’t say they smell of carrots!

In anticipation of this economic boon, the city and a private developer spent 13 million to renovate the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad (DL&W) station and transform it into a Hilton hotel, at a time when the unemployment rate in the city was 13 percent. Only 60,000 visitors showed up at Steamtown in 1987, and the 1988 excursions were canceled. After only three years, it was 2.2 million in debt and facing bankruptcy. Part of the problem was the cost of restoration of the new property and the deteriorating equipment. In addition, while the tourists in Vermont had enjoyed the sights of cornfields, farms, covered bridges, a waterfall and a gorge on a Steamtown excursion, the Scranton trip to Moscow, Pennsylvania, cut through one of the nation's largest junkyards, an eyesore described by Ralph Nader as \\"the eighth wonder of the world\\".In 1986, the U.S. House of Representatives, under the urging of Scranton native, Representative Joseph M. McDade, voted to approve the spending of 8 million to study the collection and to begin the process of making it a National Historic Site. By 1995, Steamtown was acquired and developed by the National Park Service (NPS) at a total cost of 66 million, and opened as Steamtown National Historic Site the same year. In preparation for its acquisition of the collection, the NPS had conducted historical research during 1987 and 1988 on the equipment that still remained in the foundation's possession. This research was used for a Scope of Collections Statement for Steamtown National Historic Site and was published in 1991 under the title Steamtown Special History Study.

His cellmate, Gerry, has smeared the walls with faeces from floor to ceiling as part of the no wash protest. The two men get to know each other and we see them living within the cell. Gerry's girlfriend sneaks a radio in by wrapping it and keeping it in her vagina. Prison officers forcibly and violently remove the prisoners from their cells and beat them before pinning them down to cut their long hair and beards, grown as part of the no-wash protest. The prisoners resist, Sands spitting into Lohan's face, who responds by punching him in the face and then swings again, only to miss and punch the wall, causing his knuckles to bleed. He cuts Sands' hair and beard; the men throw Sands in the bathtub and scrub him clean before hauling him away again.

Summarize this article: Toddlers move very quickly from one feeling to the next, so if one can distract them long enough for them to forget what they’re upset about, you’ll be set. This is called redirection. Of course, the goal is not to distract them so that they never learn, but rather to help them move on from one thing to the next without getting caught in an emotional loop. However, there are some situations where redirecting is less productive. If your child has done something really bad, a strong scolding may be better. For example, hitting or biting another child may require a scolding, while simply not wanting to share is certainly a good opportunity for redirection. Always explain that and why a toddler shouldn’t do something. When they do something wrong, they need to know that it’s wrong so that they don’t do it again. Don’t make a big production about explaining to them, as this can make it more difficult to redirect them. Just state it simply and help them move on. For example, if your child is arguing with their sibling about sharing a toy, say: “Oh, we don’t fight with our brothers. We have to share so that everyone gets a turn. You can play with that toy later. How about you and I go play with the bubbles instead?” If the tantrum is related to something that they think or feel, it may be possible to redirect the child by forcing them to think about something else. Manually guide their thought process by asking them questions and slowly move the questions away from what they were upset about, until eventually they forget what the original problem was. For example, if you see your child hit their elbow and a meltdown is on the way, ask if they hurt their toe. Their foot. Their hand. Their belly. Move from body part to body part that you know is not hurt, forcing them to think about the “not in pain” sensations in other parts of their body. Similarly, you can shift your child's attention to a new activity if they're upset about not doing what they want. Introduce the activity you want them to do, while also demonstrating it to them. You can also get their attention and encourage critical thinking by asking them questions about the activity, such as \\"What do you think?\\" Another redirection method is to create empathy while moving the child away from an action. This is helpful as a life skill, as it will help them become more considerate of the consequences of their actions for others. The empathy they have does not, necessarily, have to be for a real, living creature either. “Oh, don’t draw on the couch. That gets the couch dirty and the couch HATES to take a bath. You don’t want to take a bath, do you?” “Aww, why are you hitting the table. That hurts the table. You don’t like it when your brother hits you, so why would you hit the table? How about we find a pot for you to hit instead?” “Don’t pull the kitty’s tail, that gives him an owie. We pet the kitty gently, like this. Oh, see, the kitty loves being pet gently. Look at how happy he is. Aw, he’s so happy.” When you redirect a child, you need to always give them something else to do. This teaches them to find other things that make them happy, rather than learning to simply sit around being upset about things they can’t have or do. This can be tricky, as sometimes toddlers can be very stubborn, so you’ll just have to know what works best for your child. Save some activities that your child really enjoys for when they need to be redirected. For example, playing with playdough or blowing bubbles. During times when you expect your child to get upset, bring their favorite toy or activity to distract them. For example, you could bring their favorite game along to a doctor's appointment. If they’re having a really hard time finding something else to do, try relocating the child so that they have an easier time. Take them out of the room where the thing they want is when you give them something else to do. This way they have fewer visual reminders of what they were focused on.","completion":"Redirection is an effective technique to help toddlers move on from one emotion to the next and avoid getting caught in emotional loops. It involves distracting the child with an alternative activity or thought to help them forget what initially upset them. However, in some cases like hitting or biting, a scolding may be more appropriate. It's essential to explain why a toddler should not do something and help them move on. You can redirect the child using questions, focusing on other body parts, or suggesting empathy for objects or animals. Always give them something else to do, so they learn to find happiness in alternative activities and save some favorite activities for redirection times. If needed, relocate the child away from what they were focused on to make redirection easier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize: The 38-year-old will also play in the domestic Inter-Provincial Series and hopes to be \\"part of the team that plays Ireland's first Test match\\". The Dublin-born left-hander had been out of contract with Sussex, for whom he will remain available for part of the 2017 County Championship campaign. Joyce recently returned home and had surgery on an injured knee. He is one of 10 players to agree a central category-A contract with Cricket Ireland in the list released by the governing body on Wednesday. The former England international scored 1,026 Championship runs at an average of 64.12 for Sussex last season, but missed Ireland's one-day matches against Australia and South Africa in September because of injury. Joyce joined Sussex from Middlesex in 2009 and captained the side from July 2012 until the end of the 2015 season. \\"Coming back to play full-time for Ireland and also play in the Inter-Provincial series was a big decision but also quite an easy one in the end,\\" said Joyce, who played 17 one-day internationals for England in 2006 and 2007. \\"Test cricket is the pinnacle for any cricketer. Ireland has a huge opportunity in the next few years to play at the highest level and I want to be part of the team that plays Ireland's first Test match,\\" said Joyce. \\"With Ireland's fixture list growing year on year it makes sense to come back at this stage. \\"Also now that the inter-pros have first-class and list-A status, I wanted to be involved right from the start and lend my experience to that competition. \\"We're at the stage where we need to be more consistent and competitive as an international side and we also require the inter-pros to improve and provide a steady stream of players ready to perform well for Ireland. \\"My focus in the next few years, while I'm still playing, is to help us achieve both of these goals. It's a really exciting time to be an Irish cricketer and I can't wait for the 2017 season to get going.\\" Ireland have ODIs in 2017 against New Zealand, Bangladesh, and West Indies on home soil, as well as playing England at Bristol and Lord's. Cricket Ireland performance director Richard Holdsworth welcomed Joyce's decision to play a full role in the coming season, saying: \\"We are delighted Ed has agreed to return home to play in Ireland's inaugural season of domestic first-class cricket. \\"It has been one of our strategic objectives to bring players back home from England and for Ed to be the first is very appropriate. He has given great service to Sussex as an outstanding batsman and leader, and we are grateful for their support to Ed's Ireland career over those years. \\"Ed will not only be based here in Ireland training with the national squad, but will also help our next generation of international cricketers in a specialist batting and leadership coaching role, working with the Shapoorji Pallonji National Academy and Ireland youth squads as well as mentoring some national performance squad players.\\" There are three newcomers to full contracts in Irish Player of the Year John Anderson, Andrew Balbirnie and Jacob Mulder. Nine others players have agreed category-B contracts - those with other employers, such as county cricketers. New players include Barry McCarthy and Greg Thompson, while Niall O'Brien - no longer playing county cricket - will play his first season of Inter-Provincial cricket, as well as taking on a new specialist wicketkeeping role. Holdsworth continued: \\"Barry McCarthy has had a great start to his international career and fully deserves a contract, whilst Greg Thompson has proven his ability in the T20 format in particular. \\"It is great news for the Inter-Provincial series that Niall will be joining Ed Joyce in our new first-class competition, but also playing a key part in developing our young wicket-keepers in the national pathway.

This offensive demonstrates the commitment of the coalition to dismantle the financial backbone of the extremist organization, undermining its capability to support further terror operations. Background of Islamic State's Oil Operations Oil has played a significant role in the Islamic State's financial infrastructure. After seizing control of several oil-producing regions in Iraq and Syria, the militant group has tapped into the resources as a reliable source of income. Illicit oil sales have become their primary means of funding, with estimates suggesting that the trade generates around 1 million to 3 million per day for the organization. The Islamic State's oil operations have become lucrative by selling crude oil to local traders, who then smuggle it into neighboring countries such as Turkey, Iran, and even areas under the control of the Syrian regime. These oil sales are attractive to local traders because the crude oil is purchased at a significantly reduced price relative to international market rates. Third Night of Airstrikes In a strategic move to hit the Islamic State where it hurts, the US-led coalition carried out targeted airstrikes on oil refineries believed to be under the control of the militants. During the course of the third night of airstrikes, 12 oil refineries across Syria were bombed in a bid to weaken the group's revenue stream. The destruction of the oil refineries aims to choke the militant group's economic lifelines, hindering their ability to move and sell oil, thereby debilitating their capacity to carry out violent attacks. Reports suggest that the refineries targeted in the airstrikes have the potential to produce an equivalent of 350-500 barrels of oil per day. The US officials stated that the initial assessment of the airstrikes indicates that they were largely successful in achieving their intended objectives. These assessments suggest that the attacks significantly damaged or destroyed the oil refineries, thereby disrupting the Islamic State's illicit oil operations. Impact on Islamic State's Finances By targeting the oil refineries, the US-led coalition hopes to disrupt the Islamic State's main source of income. The loss of revenue from the destruction of these facilities is expected to profoundly affect the group's financial health. This comes as a crucial step in weakening the militant group, whose rapid expansion and military successes have previously been fueled by its vast financial resources. However, as the operation is ongoing, it remains to be seen whether the damage inflicted by the airstrikes will have a lasting impact on the Islamic State's ability to generate revenue through oil sales. Observers anticipate that the group may attempt to rebuild its oil infrastructure or explore alternative revenue sources to maintain its operations. Conclusion The targeting of oil refineries in the third night of airstrikes has intensified the coalition's efforts to disrupt and dismantle the financial infrastructure of the Islamic State. By removing a key source of funding, the international community aims to weaken the group's capacity to carry out further acts of terror. This strategic shift signals a concerted approach to undermine the Islamic State not only through military force but also by striking at the heart of its finances. The success of this strategy will undoubtedly impact the group's capabilities to terrorize and wage further war in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Title: Disappointing dining experience at XYZ Restaurant I recently dined at XYZ Restaurant, expecting an enjoyable meal with my friends. Unfortunately, our experience turned out to be quite disappointing, leaving us with a negative impression. I would like to provide a detailed account of our experience to illustrate the issues we faced. Taste and food quality: The first issue we encountered was the taste and quality of the food served. We ordered an array of dishes, and a majority of them lacked proper seasoning and flavor. The chicken dish we ordered was dry and tasted like it had been reheated multiple times. The pasta we ordered was bland and lacked the richness one would expect from a tomato-based sauce. Additionally, the vegetables in our salad were not fresh and had a wilted, unappetizing appearance. Service: Our server appeared to be inexperienced and disinterested in attending to our needs. We waited for an unreasonably long time for our drinks, and the food took even longer to arrive. When our meals finally arrived, the server had mixed up the orders, and it took further time to correct this mistake. The staff did not apologize for the inconveniences we faced. Furthermore, we were given insufficient tableware, forcing us to request additional utensils and napkins multiple times. Atmosphere: The atmosphere in the restaurant also contributed to the negative review. Although the décor and layout seemed promising, the place was uncomfortably noisy, making it difficult to carry on a conversation. Additionally, the tables were placed very close together, creating a cramped and crowded environment. We found it unsettling when fellow diners were able to overhear our conversations and vice versa. Value for money: Considering the quality of food, level of service, and the overall experience, the prices charged at XYZ Restaurant seemed unjustifiable. The portion sizes were small in relation to the high costs. There are other restaurants in the area where one can enjoy a much better meal with excellent service and ambiance at a similar or even lower price point. In conclusion, our experience at XYZ Restaurant was negative and unsatisfactory due to a combination of subpar food, inadequate service, a noisy and cramped atmosphere, and poor value for money. As it stands, I cannot recommend this restaurant, and I am unlikely to return for another visit. I hope that the management of XYZ Restaurant takes this feedback into consideration and implements necessary improvements to enhance the dining experience for future patrons."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who didn't finish the normal high magnification search before Waddle took the periscope? ? As Greeneville ascended to periscope depth, Waddle checked the sonar displays and the fire control station monitors, but reported later that he heard and saw nothing to suggest that the previously detected vessels in the area were now any closer to the submarine's position than had been reported before the submarine began the high speed maneuvers. Because the AVSDU was not working, Greeneville's executive officer, Lieutenant Commander Gerald K. Pfeifer, entered the sonar room and observed the contacts on the sonar screens. Pfeifer then stood in the doorway between the sonar and control rooms, but did not communicate any updated sonar information to Waddle in the control room. At 13:34, sonar gained a new contact, designated S-14. Because Greeneville had not maintained a steady, slow course for a sufficient amount of time, the sonar data available to the Fire Control Technician of the Watch did not allow accurate determination on Ehime Maru's range or course. Also, due to time constraints placed by Waddle, the ship did not perform normal maneuvers which would be used to obtain accurate course and range information on the sonar contacts prior to proceeding to periscope depth.At 13:38, Greeneville reached periscope depth (about 60 feet (18 m) below the surface). At this time, Ehime Maru was about 2,315 yards (2.117 km) or 1.14 nautical miles (2.1 km) away from the submarine and heading in her direction. Although sonar data began to more accurately depict Ehime Maru's true range and bearing at this point, this was not evident to the sonar operators. Lieutenant, Junior Grade Michael J. Coen, the officer of the deck, conducted an initial low magnification periscope search of the area and sighted no nearby ships. Waddle then took the periscope before Coen could complete the normal high magnification search. Since waves were washing over the periscope, Waddle ordered the submarine to go up another few feet to increase the distance the periscope can view. Waddle then looked through the periscope at the...

He has fallen in love with the beautiful young Emily Hamilton (Alice Eve) and desires to marry her but faces opposition from her father Captain Charles Hamilton (Brendan Gleeson), a military man who loathes Poe and goes to the length of threatening physical violence. Poe is brought to see Fields for questioning and is horrified to learn someone is using his stories as the backdrop for a series of murders. Fields then proposes that Poe volunteer his services to help the police catch the killer and Poe agrees to the task.The two men are called to investigate the murder of literary critic Rufus Griswold (John Warnaby), the man who became Poe's rival after a feud that was published in the Baltimore newspapers. Poe realizes the gruesome crime resembles a scene from The Pit and the Pendulum as Fields notices a red demon mask near the corpse. The two then deduce that the scene of the next crime will take place at Captain Hamilton's annual masquerade ball a scene that will resemble the Masked Ball in The Masque of the Red Death.Fields assigns several members of the Baltimore Police to go undercover as guests at the Masked Ball.

It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games.

It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by. And besides, her band could do other gigs during the week to supplement it. Question: What does Sondra plan to do after this story? Options: A. Audition for the house band at Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn B. Move home and apply for a job as a part-time receptionist C. not enough information D.

A:","completion":"Title: Informative and Convenient Weather App Review: I recently came across the India Satellite Weather app (com.shahul3d.indiasatelliteweather) and decided to give it a try. I must say that I am quite impressed with its features and performance. The app provides accurate and up-to-date weather information for various regions across India, which has proven to be quite helpful for planning my daily activities and travel. The user interface is simple and easy to navigate, making it a breeze to find the information I need. I particularly enjoy the real-time satellite images, which offer a comprehensive view of current weather patterns. While the app may not have as many customization options as some other weather apps on the market, it provides all the essential information I need with minimal fuss. One minor drawback is the occasional delay in loading satellite images, which can lead to some momentary frustrations. However, keeping in mind the complex nature of the data being processed, I am willing to overlook this minor issue in favor of the overall usefulness of the app. In conclusion, the India Satellite Weather app is a reliable and informative source of weather information for those residing in or traveling to India. Despite a few minor shortcomings, it has earned a solid 4 out of 5 stars from me.

I have a new situation: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. But I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. What is an answer for this question: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles more? Answer:","completion":"To answer the question, let's go through the given information step by step: 1. Usain used to be a competitive swimmer but has switched to running very frequently. 2. Asafa, Usain's brother, doesn't really like running and hardly runs much at all. 3. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood; this strengthens and increases the efficiency of the cardiac muscles. 4. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles; if a muscle isn't used, it will get smaller and weaker. Given this information, we can deduce that Usain, who runs frequently, is engaging in an exercise that strengthens his cardiac muscles. On the other hand, Asafa hardly runs at all, which means he doesn't engage in the same level of exercise that contributes to stronger cardiac muscles.

It was delivered to the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs by Chunky's owners and Maxine Berry, who launched the petition.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Girls Just Want to Have Fun Context: Janey Glenn is an army brat who is thrilled when her father, Robert, is transferred to Chicago, the home of her favorite dance show Dance TV. At her Catholic girls school, she quickly makes a new friend in Lynne Stone due to their shared love of dance and Dance TV. When Robert nixes the idea of her traveling to downtown Chicago to try out, Janey accompanies Lynne to the auditions. At the auditions, an enemy is made of spoiled rich girl Natalie Sands when she rudely parks her car where Lynne is walking. The auditions are going well until Lynne's partner gets her cut (it is later found out that Natalie paid him to have her kicked out). Janey and a dreamboat named Jeff both shine, albeit partnered with others at first. They are later paired once the final cut is made. Jeff loves to dance although his father is drilling him to go to trade school and is following his heart instead of his father's wishes. The two butt heads initially due to their disparate upbringings. Despite Jeff's natural ability to dance, he has never taken a class. Janey has been taking both gymnastics and dance classes for ten years. Helping them to get off on the wrong foot is also Janey's inability to practice when it's convenient for Jeff. Things are further complicated by Natalie's meddling (she finds out that Janey skipped choir practice to meet Jeff and calls her father to tell, posing as \\"Sister Natalie\\"). An excellent opportunity for both girls to get back at Natalie presents itself when Jeff is invited to her coming out party. They make copies of her invitation (provided by Jeff's best friend Drew) and pass them out to strangers all over town. Jeff and Drew attend the party and watch the chaos ensue when all of the extra invited people show up (as do Lynne, Janey and Jeff's sister Maggie, watching from the window). Janey and Jeff have become close through their rehearsals. One night, he tells her to meet him not at the rehearsal studio but at a club. While they are enjoying some unstructured dance time, Jeff is taken away by a girl... Answer:","completion":"Jeff becomes close to Janey Glenn through their rehearsals. As they spend time together practicing for the Dance TV competition, they bond over their shared passion for dance despite their different backgrounds and initial disagreements.

Joan Agnes Theresa Sadie Brodel was born on January 26, 1925, in Highland Park, Michigan, the youngest child of John and Agnes Brodel. John was a bank clerk and Agnes was a pianist. Joan's two older sisters, Betty and Mary Brodel, shared their mother's musical interest and started to learn how to play instruments, such as the saxophone and the banjo, at an early age. They began performing in front of audiences in acts that included singing and dancing. In 1936, Leslie caught the attention of a talent scout from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) when the three Brodel sisters were performing in New York. She was given a six-month contract with the studio, earning 200 per week. While working at the studio, she attended MGM's Little Red Schoolhouse with other child actors like Mickey Rooney and Freddie Bartholomew. Her first film role was in Camille (1936), a romantic drama starring Greta Garbo and Robert Taylor. She played Taylor's younger sister Marie Jeanette, but her speaking scenes were deleted and she was uncredited. MGM had trouble finding suitable roles for her, and she was let go by the studio along with Deanna Durbin. Leslie returned to New York, working on the radio and as a model. During this time, her older sister Mary was signed to Universal Studios. Leslie returned to Hollywood with the rest of her family, working for different studios as a freelancer. She mainly worked for RKO Pictures. Leslie was selected to play a small role in Men with Wings (1938). While shooting the film, director William A. Wellman discovered that Leslie's mother had lied about her daughter's age and that she was only thirteen years old. For the remainder of the filming schedule, Wellman replaced her with Mary. Leslie gained her first credited role in Winter Carnival (1939) as Betsy Phillips. She was chosen for the part because the director was searching for an actress with a southern accent. She was billed as Joan Brodel. Later that year, she co-starred with Jimmy Lydon in Two Thoroughbreds, in which she played the daughter of a horse owner.

Answer the following question: Manny had Bob Marley cranking on the stereo, his van was full of passengers, and the air conditioning was working after a long week of giving him trouble. The sun beat down on the wet-looking asphalt road that ran along the harbor, next to the concrete waterfront. It curved along in front of the brightly colored Dutch Colonial warehouses of Charlotte Amalie, which were now converted restaurants and jewel shops. Tourists in day-glo shirts and daubs of sunscreen rubbed over peeling skin crowded both sides of the waterfront road. Manny slowed somewhat, keeping an eye on them. On the sidewalk by the shops a tall black man stood by a food cart. The hand-painted wooden sign hanging from the cart's side had faded letters. The man wore a grand suit with tails, like an orchestra conductor, and a top hat perched on his shaved head. A cigar burned in his mouth. For a brief second he held Manny's attention. Then the food cart's owner stepped forward and the strangely dressed man disappeared. Manny looked at the other side of the road. A white girl with oval shaped sunglasses and pink leather pants stepped off the sidewalk into the road in front of his van. He slammed on the brakes, trying to dodge her, but the van couldn't respond that fast. Her ponytail flew up towards the windshield and her head struck the star-shaped hood ornament. She bounced along the asphalt. Manny weaved the van to a stop, with swearing from the passengers in the back. He opened the door and stepped out into the heat.

So why have some patients walked away healthy while others in the West died? Dr. Kent Brantly, Nancy Writebol and Dr. Rick Sacra all contracted the disease while working in Liberia -- and all survived. Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos got the virus while tending to stricken patients. She too lived. But like the patients above, Thomas Eric Duncan and Spanish priest Miguel Pajares also received treatment in the West. Yet they died. While there might not be a single, conclusive answer, a series of factors may contribute to survival. This may be the most critical factor in beating Ebola. The survivors in the United States all have one thing in common -- they were rushed to two of the country's four hospitals that have been preparing for years to treat a highly infectious disease such as Ebola. Brantly and Writebol were successfully treated at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta; Sacra was released from the Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha. Duncan didn't go to one of those four hospitals. He went to Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas with a fever and told them he'd recently returned from Liberia. Yet the hospital initially sent him home with antibiotics. Then, after he returned to the hospital much more ill, two nurses became sick with the virus. They have since been moved to more specialized facilities such as Emory and the National Institutes of Health in Maryland. But that doesn't mean patients are doomed just because they go to a different hospital. \\"Keep in mind that this is still a very deadly disease,\\" said Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent. \\"In West Africa, the mortality rates are above 60%. I think it is better in the United States. But they're not going to be zero, I think no matter where somebody is.\\" Spanish nurse's aide found to be Ebola-free in third test After finding a hospital capable of treating Ebola, those who survive are usually rehydrated quickly. \\"The most important care of patients with Ebola is to manage their fluids and electrolytes, to make sure that they don't get dehydrated,\\" said Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\"And that requires some meticulous attention to detail and aggressive rehydration in many cases.\\" Who's who in the Ebola outbreak?

Who's who in the Ebola outbreak? Who's who in the Ebola outbreak? Who's who in the Ebola outbreak? And if an infected patient getting proper care normally has a strong immune system, the chance of surviving goes up. But what may seem basic in the United States can be difficult to come by in West Africa, where Ebola has already killed more than 4,500 people -- largely because access to health care is limited. Yet Nigeria has successfully eradicated Ebola from the country, the World Health Organization said Monday. Unlike in Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone -- the combined epicenter of the oubreak -- all identified contacts in Nigeria were physically monitored every day for 21 days, WHO said. Three Ebola patients -- Sacra, NBC cameraman Ashoka Mukpo and Texas nurse Nina Pham -- all received plasma donations from Brantly. And all three have survived. The theory is that Brantly's plasma contains the antibodies necessary to fight the virus. \\"It's very fortunate that the three patients I've been able to donate to, they and I share the same blood type,\\" Brantly told CNN's Anderson Cooper. \\"I'll keep doing it as much as it's needed, as much as I can.\\" There was some controversy about why Brantly didn't give plasma to Duncan. But the problem came down to blood type, Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital said. WHO to review Ebola response amid criticism of its efforts Medication that hasn't gone through clinical trials can be risky. But with a mortality rate of 50% in the current Ebola outbreak, a WHO panel said it is ethical to offer drugs to fight the virus -- even if their effectiveness or adverse effects are unknown. The experimental drugs at the center of this Ebola outbreak are ZMapp, Favipiravir, Brincidofovir and TKM-Ebola. Brantly and Writebol both took ZMapp, and both survived. But Pajares also took ZMapp, and he died. The director of Emory's Infectious Disease Unit cautioned against viewing ZMapp as a surefire cure. \\"They are the very first individuals to have ever received this agent,\\" Dr. Bruce Ribner said. \\"There is no prior experience with it, and frankly, we do not know whether it helped them, whether it made no difference, or even, theoretically, if it delayed their recovery.\\" Spanish nurse's aide Teresa Romero Ramos took the anti-viral drug Favipiravir and also received antibodies from a survivor in West Africa. She is now free of the virus. In addition to getting a blood transfusion, Sacra received an experimental drug called TKM-Ebola, which the Food and Drug Administration recently approved for wider use. Duncan took a different untested drug, Brincidofovir. But he didn't receive it until six days after being admitted to the Texas hospital. Had he taken it earlier, the outcome might have been different. CNN's Al Goodman, Elizabeth Cohen, Faith Karimi and Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report. Summary:","completion":"The article discusses the various factors that contribute to the survival of some Ebola patients while others do not survive, despite the fact that there is no known cure for the disease.

Experimental drugs, such as ZMapp, Favipiravir, Brincidofovir, and TKM-Ebola, have been used with mixed results and are considered ethical to use due to the high mortality rate of the current Ebola outbreak.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who, in 1663, made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland? The Netherlands provided William Bruce with many of his influences. He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House. Konrad Ottenheym concludes that Bruce employed an \\"international style\\", which was fashionable in France, Holland, and England, and that he was pivotal in disseminating this style in Scotland.

To that end, he studied Sun's radiations, which he labeled as rad A. Then he studied Earth's radiations, which he labeled as rad B. He also learned that longer wavelength radiations would produce heat. Would rad A have longer or shorter wavelengths than rad B? Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, we must consider key information from your given context alongside some key principles of physics, particularly those concerning radiation and sunlight. Radiation, to begin with, is a method of energy transfer. The Sun being a star emits what's known as thermal radiation because it's a hot object. This thermal radiation spans a specific range of the electromagnetic spectrum, and it includes ultraviolet, visible light, and infrared radiation. These are classified as 'Rad A' or the Sun's radiation in your context. Radiation 'Rad B' denotes the Earth's radiations. The Earth itself is not a source of light like the Sun. However, it does produce radiation, albeit subtly different. The Earth absorbs the Sun’s radiation, some of which heats the Earth's surface and in turn re-emits it back into space as thermal (infrared) radiation. The core principle that you mentioned is that longer wavelength radiations produce heat. This is partially correct. It's true that longer wavelengths, such as those found in infrared radiation, are indeed associated with heat. However, shorter wavelengths, like ultraviolet rays, can also produce heat through absorption and re-emission by the Earth. The wavelengths of these forms of radiation are much shorter than those of the infrared radiation emitted by Earth. Based on the principle that 'longer wavelength radiations produce heat', the ‘Rad B’ or the Earth’s emissions would have longer wavelengths in comparison to 'Rad A' or the Sun’s radiations. This is because the Sun emits shorter wavelength radiation (including visible light and UV) which the Earth absorbs and re-emits as longer wavelength infrared radiation back into the space. Remember, shorter wavelengths have higher energy and longer wavelengths have lower energy. Infrared radiation is less energetic than visible and ultraviolet light, which is why Earth's radiated energy is of longer wavelength. In conclusion, given the context and after considering the principles of radiation emission and absorption, 'Rad B' or Earth's radiations usually have longer wavelengths compared to 'Rad A' or the Sun’s radiations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Cynthia made some noni juice for Megan to try, because","completion":"Megan was always curious about trying new and exotic things. She had recently come across an article about the health benefits of noni juice, and since Cynthia was well-known for her extensive knowledge of interesting and unusual remedies, Megan knew that Cynthia would be the perfect person to ask. Surprisingly, when Megan expressed her desire to try it with Cynthia, she offered to prepare some noni juice for Megan to sample. Little did Megan know that this simple exchange would lead to a long-lasting friendship and a delightful series of adventures. It was a warm and sunny morning when Cynthia invited Megan over to try the noni juice. Megan entered Cynthia's cozy little home that was adorned with colorful plants, unique trinkets, and the smell of a dozen healthy herbs mingled in the air. Cynthia welcomed her into the kitchen, where various jars and canisters filled with unusual ingredients lined the countertops. \\"I've had this noni fruit fermenting for just the right amount of time,\\" Cynthia said with a glint of excitement in her eyes as she held up a glass jar filled with a dark and mysterious liquid. \\"Shall we see if it holds up to its magical reputation?\\" It had been a grueling week for Megan, and she could not wait to receive a potential boost in energy from this peculiar concoction. Megan cautiously took a small sip from the glass that Cynthia handed her, and her taste buds were immediately met with a potent and pungent flavor. It was unlike anything she had ever tasted before, and while she couldn't say that she enjoyed the taste, there was something undeniably invigorating about it. Over the next few weeks, Megan began to notice that the noni juice Cynthia had shared with her seemed to be living up to its promises. She felt more energized, her immune system appeared stronger, and she had a newfound sense of focus and clarity. Megan couldn't help but be intrigued by the mysterious world that Cynthia introduced her to, and she found herself eager to learn more about these fantastic health remedies. Together, the two of them began to explore the latent powers of herbs, fruits, and various natural elements. They experimented with different combinations and learned from their successes and failures, all the while strengthening their friendship and building an unbreakable bond. As the seasons changed, Cynthia introduced Megan to her network of friends who likewise had a passion for living a holistic and natural lifestyle. They attended gatherings that offered meditative sound baths, Reiki healing sessions, and even made a trip to the local apiary to learn about beekeeping and the fascinating properties of honey. Megan began to notice positive changes in her life – a deeper connection with nature, a clearer mind, and a much-improved level of overall well-being. Cynthia was delighted to see her friend taking to this new lifestyle with such eagerness and openness. Together, they fueled each other's thirst for knowledge and experiences. One day, Megan decided to try her hand at preparing a tonic for Cynthia. Inspired by the array of natural treasures they had discovered together, Megan carefully crafted a soothing blend of chamomile, lavender, and just a touch of honey. She excitedly presented the concoction to Cynthia, who tried it, nodding her approval with a warm smile. The two friends laughed and reminisced about the day Megan first posed the question about noni juice to Cynthia, and they marveled at the unexpected adventures that this humble fruit had brought into their lives. As the years went by, Cynthia and Megan continued to support each other, sharing their knowledge and experiences with others who sought a more vibrant and harmonious lifestyle with nature. It all began one sunny morning when Megan sampled her first taste of noni juice, unaware of the stimulating path and the lifelong camaraderie that lay ahead. And so Cynthia and Megan's journey continued, their lives enriched by the beautiful amalgamation of traditional wisdom and their passion for exploration. With each passing season, their bond grew stronger, and their names became a beacon of hope and inspiration for those who sought to rediscover the potent healing powers of nature."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Meir David HaKohen Kahane (; Hebrew: myr dvd khn; August 1, 1932 - November 5, 1990) was an American-Israeli ordained Orthodox rabbi, writer, and ultra-nationalist politician who served one term in the Israeli Knesset. His work is influential on most modern Jewish militant and far right-wing political groups. Kahane spent years reaching out to Jews through published works, weekly articles, speeches, and debates on college campuses and in synagogues throughout the United States, and appearances on various televised programs and radio shows. In the 1984 legislative elections, Kahane's Kach party received 25,907 votes, enough to give the party one seat in the Knesset, which was taken by Kahane. Kahane refused to take the standard oath of office, and insisted on adding a Biblical verse from Psalms, to indicate that when national laws and the Torah conflict, the Torah (Biblical) law should have supremacy over the laws of the Knesset. Kahane's legislative proposals focused on Jewish education, an open economy, transferring the Arab population out from the Land of Israel, revoking Israeli citizenship from non-Jews, and banning Jewish-Gentile marriages and sexual relations, based on the Code of Jewish Law compiled by Maimonides in the Mishneh Torah. As his political career progressed, and his popularity in the streets began growing, Kahane became increasingly isolated in the Knesset. His speeches, boycotted by nearly all Knesset members, were often made to an empty parliament, except for the duty chairman and the transcriptionist. Kahane's legislative proposals and motions of no-confidence against the government were ignored or rejected by fellow Knesset members. Kahane often pejoratively called other Knesset members \\"Hellenists\\" (a reference to Jews who assimilated into Greek culture after Judea's occupation by Alexander the Great). In 1987, Kahane opened a yeshiva (\\"HaRaayon HaYehudi\\") with funding from US supporters, to teach \\"the Authentic Jewish Idea\\". Despite the boycott, Kahane's popularity grew among the Israeli public, especially among working-class Sephardi Jews. Polls showed that Kach would have likely received anywhere from four to twelve seats in the coming November 1988 elections. In 1985, the Knesset passed an amendment to Israel's Basic Law, barring \\"racist\\" candidates from election. The Central Elections Committee banned Kahane a second time, and he appealed to the Israeli Supreme Court. This time, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the committee, disqualifying Kach from running in the 1988 elections. Kahane was thus the first candidate in Israel to be barred from election for racism. The move was criticized as being anti-democratic by Alan M. Dershowitz.

Answer the following question: Short general knowledge question: what did kenny everett die off? Answer:","completion":"Kenny Everett, a British comedian, radio DJ, and television presenter, passed away due to complications related to the AIDS (Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome) virus. Born on December 25, 1944, as Maurice James Christopher Cole, he adopted the stage name Kenny Everett and rose to fame for his work in radio and television, which showcased his unique blend of humor, wit, and creativity. In 1985, Everett was diagnosed as HIV positive, a virus that eventually develops into AIDS by damaging the immune system at a progressive rate. AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks the body's immune system and makes it difficult for someone with the disease to fight off infections and diseases. Following his diagnosis, Everett continued to work in the entertainment industry while privately managing his medical condition. However, as is often the case with individuals who have AIDS, his health deteriorated over time due to opportunistic infections and illnesses. In 1993, his condition worsened, and he was admitted to a London hospital. Kenny Everett passed away on April 4, 1995, at the age of 50, from an AIDS-related illness. In this case, he succumbed to bronchial pneumonia, an infection that targets the lungs and can prove fatal for those with weakened immune systems, such as AIDS patients. Everett's death brought further attention to the ongoing AIDS epidemic and raised awareness about the importance of HIV prevention and education. Throughout his career, he greatly impacted British broadcasting and comedy, and his innovative contributions continue to inspire countless artists.

Write a title for this article: I am a fan of the Ames Straw Poll. The Ames Straw Poll, says Mike Huckabee, is the “most important meaningless event in American politics.” Never have so few generated so much hoopla from so many, except possibly the more than 800 voters who wrote in Rick Perry’s name today. Maybe “voter” isn’t the right word. “30 payer and dinner eater and tent stander-in” might be a bit more accurate. I am a fan of noisy and meaningless things, so I sat by my laptop eagerly waiting for the poll results and rewatching the Perry presidential campaign announcement video. If you watch it backwards, it’s the 2008 election! If you watch it forwards, it’s a man with a blue-collar job who gets a white-collar job by giving everyone around him blue-collar jobs. It’s also got some divine lightning in it. It’s very inspiring, in the sense that it actively made me nostalgic for the Bush era, a feat that I thought was impossible. But, never mind. I was, apparently, not supposed to be watching this. I was supposed to be watching the straw poll, where everyone was palavering to beat the band. Based on the speeches, I think elections were devised by our founders because they realized we did not hear enough inane platitudes about the “fruit of our labor” in the course of our daily lives and would need an injection every four years to counterbalance this. “Yes,” the crowds moaned, in wild abandon. “Please, say our name again. IOWA! There it is! That’s what I call speechmaking! I don’t know what you want to do to the country, but tell me again how much you learned by meeting me! Say you love me! Blow us a kiss! Yes! I’m going to pour all my votes into your ballot box!” That’s basically how it went. Watching the speeches and then hearing that Bachmann had prevailed (narrowly beating Ron Paul with 4823 to his 4671 votes) made me think that it really is possible to fool all the people all the time if you just say ”Iowa” enough times. Or maybe no one heard the speech because they were too busy lining up to vote. For our sake, I hope so. I don’t know how she stands on wind-power, although I’m sure I could find out, but her speech could have filled several Hindenburg-scale blimps. So much for Pawlenty. He’s going to be an also-also ran. Mike Murphy said that “to win Ames, you have to lose the general election.” He calls this “an impossible choice” for Pawlenty — I assume with tongue in cheek, since Pawlenty’s options right now seem limited to losing Ames and not making it to the general. With so many Big Names definitely not in attendance, winning the Ames Straw Poll is akin to being crowned King of the Ames Prom — nice, but not a title that amounts to much in the real world. So, hurray: The current designated king is… Bachmann! Also, Rick Perry, by write-in, for getting more votes than Romney and that other guy who was actually on the ballot and might have been speaker of the House at some point. All 1,400 or so of the people whose homes Rick Santorum visited repeatedly late at night seem to have taken pity on him and given him their votes in the hope he might go away. So it’s Bachmann versus Perry, say some, who are probably not Ron Paul supporters. The news everyone will fret about is the 800+ votes for Perry by write-in and Bachmann’s narrow victory, but none of it surprises me. Ron Paul will never quite make it into the prom court, because no one else passionately cares about the gold standard. They say it’s better to be nine people’s favorite thing than 100 people's ninth favorite thing. Ron Paul manages to be both, which is why he will never make it in the general election. I know that I should find this riveting. And yet all I can think of is that we, as a country, used to have something better to do, like contract small pox. It would probably be about as pleasant. On the one hand, I am delighted that we are not actually placing The Hope And Future of America in the hands of people who want to buy a 30 dinner and walk into a tent.

It is the most widely spoken and officially recognized language in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, South Tyrol (Italy), the German-speaking Community of Belgium, and Liechtenstein. German is also one of the three official languages of Luxembourg and a co-official language in the Opole Voivodeship in Poland.

Known for its word order flexibility and for the extensive use of compound words, German vocabulary is greatly influenced by Latin, Greek, English, French, and most notably, derived from the shared linguistic ancestry, Old Saxon. The German language is written using the Latin script. Due to the diversity of dialects in German-speaking regions, a standardized form of the language, Hochdeutsch, is used in formal contexts and education system to ensure mutual intelligibility among German speakers.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the specific titles of the three works that are all based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant? Apart from a single early work for unaccompanied choir (\\"Chanson à boire\\", 1922), Poulenc began writing choral music in 1936. In that year he produced three works for choir: Sept chansons (settings of verses by Éluard and others), Petites voix (for children's voices), and his religious work Litanies à la Vierge Noire, for female or children's voices and organ. The Mass in G major (1937) for unaccompanied choir is described by Gouverné as having something of a baroque style, with \\"vitality and joyful clamour on which his faith is writ large\\". Poulenc's new-found religious theme continued with Quatre motets pour un temps de pénitence (1938–39), but among his most important choral works is the secular cantata Figure humaine (1943). Like the Mass, it is unaccompanied, and to succeed in performance it requires singers of the highest quality. Other a cappella works include the Quatre motets pour le temps de Noël (1952), which make severe demands on choirs' rhythmic precision and intonation.Poulenc's major works for choir and orchestra are the Stabat Mater (1950), the Gloria (1959–60), and Sept répons des ténèbres (Seven responsories for Tenebrae, 1961–62). All these works are based on liturgical texts, originally set to Gregorian chant. In the Gloria, Poulenc's faith expresses itself in an exuberant, joyful way, with intervals of prayerful calm and mystic feeling, and an ending of serene tranquillity. Poulenc wrote to Bernac in 1962, \\"I have finished Les Ténèbres. I think it is beautiful. With the Gloria and the Stabat Mater, I think I have three good religious works. May they spare me a few days in Purgatory, if I narrowly avoid going to hell.\\" Sept répons des ténèbres, which Poulenc did not live to hear performed, uses a large orchestra, but in Nichols's view it displays a new concentration of thought. To the critic Ralph Thibodeau, the work may be considered as Poulenc's own requiem and is \\"the most avant-garde of his sacred compositions, the most emotionally demanding, and the most interesting musically,...

This was demonstrated in the 1600s by a scientist named Robert Boyle. Boyle placed a ticking clock in a sealed glass jar. The clock could be heard ticking through the air and glass of the jar. Then Boyle pumped the air out of the jar. The clock was still running, but the ticking could not be heard. Thats because the sound couldnt travel without air particles to transfer the sound energy. Is there any other place where sound cannot be heard? Here is a hint: is there any other place that does not have air molecules? Thats right, in space sound cannot be transferred. So can astronauts hear each other? Yes, they can, because they are in enclosed space stations or pressurized suits.In both cases, they are surrounded by air molecules. If they left their space ship and did not use their electronics, they would not be able to hear each other. Next time you watch a science fiction movie, think about this factoid.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Polar bears are born in dens on land and their mother stays with them for the whole winter without eating anything. The mother and the babies come out from the dens around March, _ from a long winter and must immediately go hunting to find food to stay alive. Now, the only hunting they know is to catch seals from floating ice in the open ocean. In March, polar bear mothers and babies have to swim from the land in Spitsbergen to the edge of the polar ice cap. Normally this is a short swim, since in March the polar ice cap is very close to the land, and the polar bears, and even the babies, are good swimmers. However, last year we saw that the polar ice cap had become smaller in size due to global warming. Swimming hundreds of miles, especially when they are hungry and have babies following them, is really hard, and many bears are dying because of starvation. The polar bear population in the Spitsbergen area was once threatened by hunters. In the 1970s, a ban on hunting was imposed and the polar bear population has been steadily increasing from just a few hundred to about 2,000 to 3,000. This was a great success story. However, now, because of global warming, the population is again in danger. If we do not stop making so much carbon dioxide, we will lose these beautiful animals forever. The polar bears are just one example of animals that have become endangered because of man's appetite for energy obtained by burning fossil fuels. All life on earth could be in danger unless we change our ways. What can we do? To reduce the amount of carbon dioxide in the air we must save and make energy without burning coal and oil. Instead, we can use the sun or the wind to generate electricity. We must also cut down on needless driving and turn off things that use electricity when we are not using them. In addition, we have to stop cutting down forests and start planting more trees. Question: Now that the polar ice cap is smaller, _ . Options: A: it is easy for polar bears to find food B: it takes them less time to catch seals C: they have to swim farther to get food D: fewer seals will come to the shore A:","completion":"C: they have to swim farther to get food The article states that due to global warming, the polar ice cap has become smaller in size. This has made it more difficult for polar bears, especially mothers and their babies, to find food. Since the ice cap is further away from the land in Spitsbergen, they have to swim greater distances to reach the edge of the polar ice cap, where they can hunt for seals. Swimming hundreds of miles without food is extremely challenging, and many bears are dying due to starvation. The shrinking ice cap thus forces polar bears to swim farther to find food, which poses a significant threat to their survival."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

This question asks about how water animals, like fish, can live in lakes that are covered by ice. When a lake freezes, the ice forms on the top, but there's still water underneath. Aquatic animals can still breathe and find food in this water, so they can survive. 2. Can carnivorous animals not survive without meat? This question asks if meat-eating animals, like lions or tigers, can live without eating meat. Since these animals need certain nutrients found in the meat, they usually cannot survive without it.

While observing an exercise designed to evaluate Delta candidates, Scott meets a recruit, Curtis, as well as Sergeant Jacqueline Black, a knife-fighting instructor. Scott is drawn into a clandestine operation to find Laura Newton, the President's daughter, who is missing. Their search takes them to a bar where girls are recruited as prostitutes, and Scott's team follows a middleman to a bordello that funnels some of these girls to an international sex slavery ring. The madam gives them a contact number leading to a pay phone. Calls placed to the pay phone are traced back to Tariq Asani, a Lebanese national currently in federal prison. They plan to intercept Asani during a prisoner transport and gain information from him about the sex trafficking operation. When the car carrying Asani and another prisoner stops en route to its destination, Scott shows up and appears to kill the transport guard, then kills the other prisoner (who was on death row). He spares Asani when Asani says he can get them on a plane out of the country that night and confirms the sex slavery ring is based in Dubai. Scott stops at a convenience store to relay the information to the team. Curtis provides him with more ammunition, but Asani, waiting in the car, happens to spot the badge of another agent talking with Curtis and opens fire. Curtis is wounded and Scott has to kill Asani. As the team prepares an assault in Dubai, a news broadcast reports that Laura and her college professor were discovered drowned while sailing off the coast of Martha's Vineyard. The rescue operation is called off. Scott returns home, but Curtis tracks him down and persuades him that Laura is alive and shows Scott an earring that was caught in his mat from the beach house identical to those Laura is wearing in a news photograph. When they return to the beach house, Curtis is killed by a sniper. Scott evades the sniper and finds Laura's unique sign in a window in the beach house indicating she was there, he realizes that she is not dead. He takes his pager and phone apart and finds a tracking device. He tries to contact Laura's mother but he is intercepted by a female Secret Service agent assigned to guard the First Family. When he shows the agent the earring, the agent explains that for years the President has used visits to his daughter as a cover for extramarital affairs, and that he pulled Laura's Secret Service detail to use as extra protection for himself during the latest trip. Scott enlists Sergeant Black to help him rescue the girl from Dubai and turns to Avi, a former Israeli operative. Avi agrees to get him into Dubai and smuggle Laura out concealed in a cargo container, obtaining weapons for him and support from a man known as Jones. Jones is killed during the rescue and Scott flees with Laura to a safe house, where he persuades her that although he is alone, he is acting under orders. Correctly guessing that he is really acting on his own, Laura says that King Leonidas of Sparta would respond to requests for help from neighboring kingdoms by sending one man, and decides to trust him. When he takes Laura to the airport to seal her in the cargo container, Scott discovers he is being tracked when he finds a transmitter hidden in his knife. He rushes her out of the container just as his old team arrives to apprehend them. Scott is shot and Laura is captured. Her captor reveals herself as Sgt. Black, who shows her the earring and photos from the Secret Service agent, convincing Laura to stop struggling. A Swedish news crew witnesses the struggle as they are about to board their own plane nearby, and recognize Laura. Black is shot by Stoddard, and a hysterical Laura is hustled to safety aboard the journalists' plane. Just as the jet takes off, Stoddard's throat is slit by Scott. An injured Black then asks Scott if Laura is now safe, which Scott confirms. Later, on a London city street, a stubbled Scott is shown watching an evening news broadcast regarding Laura's return on a television in a shop window. The government spins the story of Laura's kidnapping as an opportunity for the President to take action to end the trafficking of American girls as sex slaves. A British man watching the news broadcast with Scott then says, \\"Time to go home,\\" and walks away. Scott watches him leave and says, \\"Lucky man.\\" Scott is then seen walking off into Piccadilly Circus.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer: The Common Noctule is the largest type in Britain of what creature?","completion":"The Common Noctule (Nyctalus noctula) is the largest type of bat species found in Britain. Bats belong to the order Chiroptera and are the only mammals capable of sustained flight. The Common Noctule is one of the 18 species of bats recorded in the UK and has an important role in the ecosystem, primarily as a natural pest controller due to their diet consisting of insects. The Common Noctule is often considered one of the most widespread and abundant bat species in Europe and is well-known for its agility and speed while in flight. The wingspan of a Common Noctule ranges from 32 to 40 centimeters (12.6 to 15.7 inches), and they have a body length of around 6.5 to 8 centimeters (2.5 to 3.1 inches). The fur coloration varies from golden to reddish-brown on the back, with a paler underbelly. Like most bat species, the Common Noctule is nocturnal and uses a sophisticated echolocation system to navigate and find prey. They emit high-pitched sounds, usually beyond the range of human hearing, which bounce off nearby objects and return to the bat, helping them create a mental map of their surroundings. This allows the Common Noctule to avoid obstacles and locate insects efficiently. Common Noctules primarily consume flying insects, including moths, beetles, midges, and mosquitoes. They are known for their impressive aerial acrobatics which help them catch prey in mid-flight. Their foraging habitats include open habitats, forests, farmland, parks, and gardens, and they can be found roosting in hollow trees, buildings, and bat boxes during the day. The mating season typically occurs in the autumn, with the females giving birth to a single pup in late spring or early summer. The females form maternity colonies while raising their pups, and the males will roost alone or in small bachelor groups. The young bats are typically able to fly and forage independently after about a month. As the largest type of bat in Britain, the Common Noctule is an important indicator species, with their population trends reflecting the overall health of the ecosystem. In recent years, their numbers have been affected by habitat loss, pesticide use, and disturbance of roosting sites from human activity. Conservation efforts are crucial in protecting these fascinating creatures and ensuring their continued presence in the UK and other parts of Europe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Answer the following question: Given the background: Law enforcement officers are often unfamiliar with information technology, and so lack the skills and interest in pursuing attackers. There are also budgetary constraints. It has been argued that the high cost of technology, such as DNA testing, and improved forensics mean less money for other kinds of law enforcement, so the overall rate of criminals not getting dealt with goes up as the cost of the technology increases. In addition, the identification of attackers across a network may require logs from various points in the network and in many countries, the release of these records to law enforcement (with the exception of being voluntarily surrendered by a network administrator or a system administrator) requires a search warrant and, depending on the circumstances, the legal proceedings required can be drawn out to the point where the records are either regularly destroyed, or the information is no longer relevant. and the situation: Two neighboring police Departments took different approaches to fighting crime, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures of that nature. Answer the following question: Which P.D. took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime? Answer:","completion":"Greenville P.D. took a less comprehensive approach in fighting crime. Justification: This conclusion is drawn based on the provided background and situation. According to the information given, Greenville P.D. did not invest in DNA testing, improved forensics, and information technology, while Grayville took extensive measures in these technological areas. In contemporary law enforcement methodologies, the utilization of advanced forensics, information technology, and DNA testing are considered comprehensive and efficient means to solve and prevent crimes. These methods provide more precise evidence and help track criminals more effectively. Investing in these advanced techniques are considered comprehensive because they cover crime fighting from multiple aspects apart from traditional methods. Therefore, by not leveraging such technological measures, Greenville P.D.'s approach to crime fighting could be considered less comprehensive compared to Grayville's."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I’ve learnt a great amount throughout this studio, first and foremost I was taught: how the art world functions, how specific galleries such as Gertrude St Contemporary run and how artists earn a living. The studio also provided me with basic filmmaking skills such as how to: create a shooting schedule, write a shooting script, set up three-point lighting, conduct an interview, utilise visual storytelling and edit a short film. Throughout the shooting process with my artist I also developed my abilities regarding how to use a: Sony Zoom H2N (and other such handy recorders), a lapel mic, my own Canon EOS 60D and Adobe Premiere Pro editing software. Overall I think the studio functioned quite successfully, it was great to be in a studio with nineteen people who all were interested in the same topics as you. I felt that overall, the studios had a very happy and supportive environment, and you walked away knowing a great deal about the art world and how to make short documentaries. The project itself taught me a great deal about how to work with talent, as well as my group members. Having to work independently forced me to be completely all over every aspect of the shoot, whether that be choosing which questions to ask, deciding what to focus on, where I wanted the shoot to happen, deciding what gear to use, getting to the shoot, carrying all the gear, what I wanted to shoot, managing the audio, managing the lighting, managing the camera set-ups, managing the talent, editing the film, and finding a great soundtrack for it. I’m a pretty self-conscious person and I often doubt the decisions I make or ask someone else for their opinion (should I shoot this angle, or what do you think of this question etc.). Working independently pushed me to go with my gut instincts, to make decisions and to not seek others approval.

Which uncle takes an inhibitor that induces the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver? Uncle Tom and uncle Sam both have high cholesterol. Uncle Tom is on statin drugs and uncle Sam is not. Hint: Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different.

Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Scientists may have found a way to banish flu, after developing a drug that saw mice unaffected by lethal doses of the virus. The drug blocks a molecule called PGE2, and saw mice survive a dose of H1N1 – also known as swine flu - after administration. This could see development of a pill to beat flu in humans, an illness which kills thousands every year. Soon just a memory?: The new discovery means that science is one step closer to developing a pill against flu. It is hoped that the drug which blocked PGE2 in mice could also block the molecule in the human body. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 49,000 people die from flu-related illnesses every year. In 2009 alone, up to 575,000 people died from swine flu (H1N1). Emerging strains continually threaten to spread to humans and cause even deadlier pandemics. The new finding published in the journal Immunity paves the way for an urgently needed therapy that is highly effective against flu and maybe other viral infections. ‘Drugs that specifically target PGE2. pathways have already been developed and tested in animals, so our. results have excellent potential for clinical translation, not only for. the treatment of influenza, but other viral respiratory infections that. interact with similar host immune pathways,’ author of study Dr Maziar. Divangahi, of McGill University, Montreal, said. Mice genetically engineered to lack the. PGE2 (prostaglandin E2) molecule were more resistant to flu infections. than others and the vast majority survived after being injected with a. deadly dose of H1N1. Scientists in Montreal, Canada found that by blocking a molecule called PGE2, mice survived lethal doses of H1N1, also known as swine flu. Similarly, mice treated with a compound that blocks PGE2 showed enhanced antiviral immunity and produced better survival rates following infection with the lethal shot compared with untreated animals. In spite of the worldwide use of vaccination and other antiviral interventions, flu remains a persistent threat to human health. By inhibiting a molecule called COX (cyclooxygenase), ibuprofen and other NSAIDs (nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs) lower the production of the five prostanoids such as PGE2, immune molecules that contribute to pain and fever. Francois Coulombe, a PhD student in Dr Divangahi’s lab who led the study, said: 'But since these drugs inhibit all prostanoids, each may contribute differently towards the immunity against influenza virus. Understanding their individual role is crucial in developing a new therapy.' Highlights:","completion":"Scientists have found a new way to help protect against the flu virus by making a special medicine. They tested this medicine on some mice and it helped them not get sick from a really bad type of flu called H1N1 or swine flu. This discovery is important because it could help make a pill that fights flu in people, which could save many lives. Each year, lots of people get sick and some even die from the flu, so this new medicine could be very helpful for everyone's health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze any additional relevant factors, such as career longevity, awards, and impact on team success. 5. Make a final decision based on the gathered data and comparisons. Step 1: Criteria - Career rushing yards - Rushing touchdowns Step 2: Gather data - I'll start by looking at historical statistics for quarterbacks in the NFL. Step 3: Compare top players - Some of the top rushing quarterbacks in history include Michael Vick, Cam Newton, Randall Cunningham, Steve Young, and Lamar Jackson. Step 4: Analyze additional factors - Michael Vick: 6,109 career rushing yards, 36 rushing touchdowns, four Pro Bowls, and played 13 seasons. - Cam Newton: 5,398 career rushing yards, 70 rushing touchdowns, three Pro Bowls, one MVP, and played 10 seasons (and still active). - Randall Cunningham: 4,928 career rushing yards, 35 rushing touchdowns, four Pro Bowls, one MVP, and played 16 seasons. - Steve Young: 4,239 career rushing yards, 43 rushing touchdowns, seven Pro Bowls, two MVPs, and played 15 seasons. - Lamar Jackson: 2,906 career rushing yards, 19 rushing touchdowns, two Pro Bowls, one MVP, and played four seasons (and still active). Step 5: Make a final decision - Based on the combination of career rushing yards and touchdowns, as well as considering their impact on team success, I would say that Michael Vick is the best rushing quarterback of all time.

Today, we're going to talk about a story of a man named Jon Seymour, who used to help kids cross the road. Jon was 46 years old and worked as a crossing guard for 20 years in Kentish Town, London. Crossing guards make sure that kids like you are safe when they cross the road on their way to school or back home. One day, Jon went to a big building called Camden Town Hall. He was trying to talk on the phone to fix a problem with his parking meter so he could get his money back. Sometimes, grown-ups need to put money in a special machine called a parking meter when they park their cars on the street. While Jon was talking on the phone, a worker from the town council asked him to be quiet because Jon's conversation was interrupting his own conversation. This made Jon upset, and he started arguing with the worker, who was a black man. During the argument, Jon used some words that were not very nice. He said \\"King Kong,\\" which can be seen as mean and hurtful, especially when talking to a black person. It's important to be kind and considerate to everyone, no matter what they look like. Because Jon used mean words and was aggressive during the argument, the people who work at the town council decided that he should not be a crossing guard anymore. They said that Jon did something very wrong, called \\"gross misconduct,\\" and that's why he got sacked, which means he lost his job. This story teaches us that it's important to be respectful and kind to everyone we meet. Using mean words can hurt people's feelings and can even lead to losing a job, like what happened to Jon.

The drinks are delicious, the bar service is timely, it's a cost-effective night out (only 5 cover!!! Crazy low-cost!) with real talent, courteous staff all around, and old-fashioned fun as you sing along to tunes you/the crowd requests. Just don't tell them it's your birthday if you don't want to be put front and center (or top and center? - on top of the pianos!) and sung to with an interesting rendition of Happy Birthday. ;) Oh, and I've been to the old location and the new (yes, I liked the old one, but they had to expand) and have been there multiple times.","completion":"This review is very positive. If we think of it like happy and sad faces, this review has a big happy face. The person really enjoyed the cozy atmosphere, thought the drinks were delicious, liked the musician Josh Dupont, and had fun singing along to tunes.

Here is an article: NEW YORK Writer Jordan Belfort's debut book is about a depraved and despicable stock swindler addicted to drugs and high-priced hookers. Belfort, 45, knows his subject well. \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" is about him. The real-life Belfort, before drug rehab and a 22-month stretch in a federal prison camp, makes Sherman McCoy, the \\"master of the universe\\" immortalized in Tom Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\", look like a Boy Scout. By his own estimate, Belfort cheated investors out of as much as 200 million as chairman of the defunct brokerage firm Stratton Oakmont Inc, one of the famous boiler rooms that pumped up stocks in the 1990s. He signed off on a midget tossing event, took turns having sex with a female subordinate and woke up in restraints on a flight to Switzerland after groping a flight attendant, according to his memoir, published by Random House Inc.'s Bantam Books. \\"I'm not going to pass the buck on what I did,\\" Belfort told Reuters in an interview in New York. \\"If I didn't feel bad and was embarrassed, I'd be a sociopath.\\" Belfort said he is not so sure he should have written the book and dreads the day when his two children might read a memoir replete with lurid, drug-induced scenes involving a Quaalude-addled Belfort and their mother. \\"Maybe I should have just buried that part of my life and moved on and kept in the background,\\" Belfort said. There is no looking back now. \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" hit bookstores on Tuesday. His original 1,200 page manuscript was cut in half after seven edits and legal vetting. Belfort wants it to be a success, and so does the federal government. In 2003, a U.S. District Judge in Brooklyn ordered Belfort to pay 110.4 million in restitution to investors as part of his punishment. Belfort and Daniel Porush, the former president at Stratton Oakmont, also forfeited about 11 million in properties, court records show. Half of Belfort's monthly income goes toward restitution and U.S. District Judge John Gleeson has ordered Belfort to file an affidavit with the court detailing the financial arrangements surrounding the book and a movie deal. Belfort confirmed Academy Award-winning director Martin Scorsese is interested in making the movie, with Leonardo DiCaprio playing Belfort. In his twenties, Belfort made millions of dollars a year taking companies public. He said he could have made even more if he had run the Long Island brokerage legitimately. Instead, he paid his rowdy salesmen handsomely to pump up the prices of small stocks with fraudulent pitches. In the initial public offering of shoe company Steven Madden Ltd., Belfort pocketed some 20 million. A big chunk of the shares of the offering went into what Belfort describes as ratholes, or accounts held by his cronies at 5 or 6 a share. Then he used the power of his boiler room operation at Stratton Oakmont to drive up the price of Madden's stock to around 20 a share. Belfort then pounced, selling the stock stashed in the ratholes to produce most of his profit. Belfort thought he was too clever to get caught by what he describes as bumbling investigators with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Besides, his mentors were cunning teachers. One lawyer kept pens for a dozen or so years to backdate documents so they would later pass a gas chromatography test administered by the FBI. But when you take as many drugs as Belfort says he did, you do a lot of stupid things. For one, he was obsessed with smuggling money into Switzerland so he could skirt U.S. securities laws and expand his illegal empire. \\"It was the stupidest thing I ever did,\\" Belfort said. A Swiss banker busted in an unrelated case offered up Belfort to get leniency with prosecutors. In 1999, Belfort pleaded guilty to criminal charges of securities fraud and money laundering in connection with manipulating the stock prices for 34 public companies. Belfort faced a maximum of 30 years in prison, but got a lenient sentence in exchange for his role as a witness for the government. In prison, Belfort found that nothing burned time like writing. His bunkmate at California's Taft Correctional Facility, Tommy Chong of the Cheech and Chong stoner comedy movies, encouraged him to write a book after they spent nights swapping stories. Belfort didn't know how to write, but he said he used Wolfe's \\"Bonfire of the Vanities\\" as his textbook. He now writes several hours a day. His second book will be about the aftermath of his downfall. He said he is also trying to right past wrongs. \\"I believe I have a shot at being redeemed by living a good life today,\\" Belfort said.

Please answer the following question: Extract the answer to the question from the following context. Question: When was Prince Albert in France? Context: In February 1918, he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the Royal Naval Air Service's training establishment at Cranwell. With the establishment of the Royal Air Force two months later and the transfer of Cranwell from Navy to Air Force control, he transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force. He was appointed Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918, before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at St Leonards-on-Sea where he completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing. He was the first member of the royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot. During the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's Independent Air Force at its headquarters in Nancy, France. Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918, he remained on the Continent for two months as a staff officer with the Royal Air Force until posted back to Britain. He accompanied the Belgian monarch King Albert on his triumphal reentry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and gained a promotion to squadron leader on the following day. Answer:","completion":"Prince Albert was in France during the closing weeks of the war, which ended in November 1918."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

They convey different information about the origin and influence of dumplings in Indonesia. I'll break down each sentence to clarify the difference between them. 1. Indonesian dumplings were influenced and brought by Chinese immigrants to Indonesia. This sentence tells us that the Indonesian dumplings have been influenced by Chinese immigrants, implying that the Chinese immigrants were the ones who introduced and brought the concept or the recipe of dumplings to Indonesia. It suggests that the Chinese version of dumplings was adapted to local Indonesian tastes and ingredients, resulting in a unique Indonesian-style dumpling. 2. Chinese dumplings were influenced by Indonesian immigrants and brought to Indonesia. This sentence implies that it was the Chinese dumplings that were influenced by Indonesian immigrants. It suggests that the interaction between Indonesian and Chinese people led to some modifications in the traditional Chinese dumplings, possibly by incorporating Indonesian flavors and ingredients. These modified dumplings were then carried to Indonesia. However, it does not clarify whether the original dumplings came from China, or if the Indonesian immigrants merely influenced the Chinese dumplings during their interactions. In conclusion, the first sentence emphasizes that the Chinese immigrants introduced the concept of dumplings to Indonesia and that the local Indonesian version was influenced by them. In contrast, the second sentence focuses on the influence of Indonesian immigrants on the Chinese dumplings and their eventual introduction to Indonesia. Both sentences suggest a cultural exchange between the two nations, but they describe different aspects and directions of that exchange."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Explanation: If there is less pollution in the air, it means there is a higher percentage of oxygen in the air that we breathe. Although the process of oxygen absorption remains the same, this cleaner air allows the lungs to take in a greater amount of oxygen per breath, which can lead to increased oxygen delivery to the bloodstream. The decrease in pollution does not directly alter any specific step in the process but rather influences the overall efficiency of the respiratory process by increasing the available oxygen content."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are presented with the question \\"What help prokaryotes to move?\\" and the following answer choices: - organisms - tentacles - glucose - feet - Energy. - Energy - Mitosis - cilia Now knowing that flagella help prokaryotes move and flagella are elongated cilia which moves like a whip or a tail, choose the best answer. Answer:","completion":"In the given answer choices, the one closest to the correct answer is cilia. Flagella are the primary structures responsible for the movement of prokaryotes, specifically bacteria. While flagella could be considered elongated cilia, they are, in fact, distinct structures with important differences regarding their functions and overall structure. Cilia are hair-like structures found in eukaryotic cells (which have a nucleus), such as the cells of the human respiratory system. They function as a means of locomotion for the cell and move with a coordination that resembles a synchronized wave. The primary function of cilia, however, is often to move substances over the surface of the cell for various purposes, such as keeping airways clear of mucus and debris. On the other hand, flagella are whip-like structures found in both prokaryotes (single-celled organisms without a nucleus) and eukaryotes. They are usually longer and fewer in number compared to cilia. The primary function of flagella is to provide locomotion for the cell, propelling it through its environment. In prokaryotes, bacterial flagella are helical, and their rotation, which is powered by a special motor mechanism present at the base of the flagellum, helps the organism to move forward. In conclusion, the best answer choice among the given options, considering that flagella help prokaryotes move, is cilia. However, it is important to note that flagella, not cilia, are the ultimate correct answer for what helps prokaryotes to move."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Article: Taste is such a subjective matter that we don't usually conduct preference tests for food. The most you can say about anyone's preference is that it's one person's opinion. But because the two big cola companies--Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola are marketed so aggressively, we've wondered how big a role taste preference actually plays in brand loyalty. We set up a taste test that challenged people who identified themselves as either Coca-Cola or Pepsi fans: Find your brand in a blind tasting. We invited staff volunteers who had a strong liking for either Coca-Cola Classic or Pepsi, Diet Coke, or Diet Pepsi. These were people who thought they'd have no trouble telling their brand from the other brand. We eventually located 19 regular cola drinkers and 27 diet cola drinkers. Then we fed them four unidentified samples of cola one at a time, regular colas for the one group, diet versions for the other. We asked them to tell us whether each sample was Coke or Pepsi; then we analyzed the records statistically to compare the participants' choices with what mere guess-work could have accomplished. Getting all four samples right was a tough test, but not too tough, we thought, for people who believed they could recognize their brand. In the end, only 7 out of 19 regular cola drinkers correctly identified their brand of choice in all four trials. The diet-cola drinkers did a little worse----only 7 of 27 identified all four samples correctly. While both groups did better than chance would predict, nearly half the participants in each group made the wrong choice two or more times. Two people got all four samples wrong. Overall, half the participants did about as well on the last round of tasting as on the first, so tiredness, or taste _ , was not a factor. Our preference test results suggest that only a few Pepsi participants and Coke fans may really be able to tell their favorite brand by taste and price.

O'Brien, who was brought up in Blairgowrie and now lives in Glasgow, said: \\"When I first heard about the role of Kate McPherson I was very excited. \\"The Highland Clearances is a subject that interests me greatly, especially in the light of the fact that although they took place hundreds of years ago, similar examples of people having to leave their homes and go elsewhere can be seen all over the world today. \\"It is a privilege to be involved in a project that is telling Kate McPherson's story in this way. \\"She really was an amazing woman - her life inspires me and symbolises the determination of we as Scots in the quest for a better life.\\" Starting in the late 18th Century and running into the 19th Century, the Highland Clearances saw townships occupied by generations of families cleared to make way for large-scale sheep farming and the rearing of deer. Landowners were seeking to \\"improve\\" their estates in line with the industrial revolution. Their hope was to make more capital from the land by running shooting estates, or starting industrial-scale livestock farming. In some cases people who had lived on the land for generations left voluntarily, while others were forcibly evicted and their homes burned and demolished. Once in Canada, Ms McPherson and the others cleared from Sutherland had to walk 100 miles (161kms) to the colony in wintry conditions in handmade snowshoes. They were eventually settled in the Red River colony. Summary:","completion":"Molly O'Brien will play Kate McPherson, a young woman from the 1800s, in the film Last Footsteps of Home, which focuses on the Highland Clearances, a historical event where people were forced off their land in Scotland. The film will be shot in various locations including Brora, Golspie, and the Strath of Kildonan. O'Brien, who has experience in theater, film, and TV, expressed her excitement about playing the role and the relevance of the story to contemporary global issues. The Highland Clearances involved the displacement of families to make way for large-scale farming, and those affected, like Kate McPherson, faced challenges in their new lives, such as walking long distances in difficult conditions to settle in new territories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The new chef from Hell's Kitchen hadn't started yet. The pastry touching the beef was soggy and a doughy blood. Waiter was not attentive and offer to fix dish. I booked reservation 6 months in advance and told them the occasion. The waiter said :\\" anniversary? Happy Anniversary. Would you like to see a dessert menu or just the bill?\\" WTF. I am a huge fan of all of Chef Ramsey's shows but this was a miss. We were all dressed up for the occasion and had people just walking in with shorts without reservations who looked like they had better service. I hope the winning chef turns it around. We had a better steak dinner at the Wynn's steak house overlooking waterfall(name?) where we stayed on a last minute dinner.

As Amelia flipped through the pages, she found a picture of a sunny beach with palm trees and crystal clear water. The word \\"Mexico\\" was written in big, colorful letters above the picture. Amelia's eyes sparkled with excitement as she imagined herself swimming in that clear water, sipping on a sweet, refreshing drink under a tall palm tree. She shared her idea with her mom, who was equally excited about visiting Mexico. They started to plan their trip together. Amelia counted down the days on her calendar, eagerly waiting for their adventure to begin. When the day finally arrived, Amelia and her mom packed their bags, said goodbye to their small town, and hopped on an airplane that took them far away to Mexico. The moment Amelia stepped off the plane, she felt the warm sun on her face and the soft sand beneath her feet. She couldn't wait to explore this new paradise. Every day, Amelia and her mom had exciting adventures in Mexico. They went snorkeling in the clear waters, hiked through lush jungles, and even learned about ancient histories by visiting old ruins. Amelia collected many treasures during their vacation, like beautiful seashells and fun postcards to send to her friends back home. As their vacation neared its end, Amelia realized how much she loved visiting Mexico. The friendly people, the delicious food, and the beautiful scenery had all made her feel happy and relaxed. When it was time to go home, Amelia hugged her mom and said, \\"This was the best trip ever!\\" She couldn't help but think about how much fun she had during their vacation, and couldn't wait to come back again. So with a big smile on her face and a happy heart, Amelia decided to vacation to Mexico more often."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was originally published in China in 1999. The English translation was published in 2001. - Early life and teen years. Born only three years after the founding of the People's Republic of China, as the son of a school teacher, Jia Yanchun (), Jia had an early role model for his later decision to become a writer. Due to a shortage of qualified teachers in Shaanxi at the time, however, Jia's father was often away from home and so he spent much of his early childhood with his mother, Zhou Xiao'e (). With the advent of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Jia Yanchun was accused of being a counter-revolutionary and he spent the next ten years in a labor camp. Three years later, with the closing of all schools in China following the excesses of the Red Guards, Jia was dispatched with his classmates to build reservoirs in the countryside. - Chinese culture is one of the world's oldest cultures, tracing back to thousands of years ago. The area in which the culture is dominant covers a large geographical region in eastern Asia with customs and traditions varying greatly between provinces, cities, and even towns as well. Important components of Chinese culture include ceramics, architecture, music, literature, martial arts, cuisine, visual arts, philosophy and religion. - Mian Mian (born August 28, 1970 in Shanghai) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer. She writes on China's once-taboo topics and she is a promoter of Shanghai's local music. Her publications have earned her the reputation as China's literary wild child. - Zhou Weihui (born Ningbo, 1973) is a Chinese Post 70s Generation writer, living and working in Shanghai and New York City. Her novel \\"Shanghai Baby\\" () (1999) was banned in the People's Republic of China as \\"decadent\\". Her latest novel \\"Marrying Buddha\\" () (2005) was censored, modified and published in China under a modified title. She is often associated with Mian Mian, another slightly older member of the \\"New Generation\\". - The Cultural Revolution, formally the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, was a sociopolitical movement that took place in China from 1966 until 1976. Set into motion by Mao Zedong, then Chairman of the Communist Party of China, its stated goal was to preserve 'true' Communist ideology in the country by purging remnants of capitalist and traditional elements from Chinese society, and to re-impose Maoist thought as the dominant ideology within the Party. The Revolution marked the return of Mao Zedong to a position of power after the Great Leap Forward. The movement paralyzed China politically and negatively affected the country's economy and society to a significant degree. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Shaanxi, formerly romanized as Shensi, is a province of the People's Republic of China.

Study links sexual content on TV to teen pregnancy (CNN) -- Sexual content on television is strongly associated with teen pregnancy, a new study from the RAND Corporation shows. New information linking sexual content on television with teen pregnancy will help develop prevention programs. Researchers at the nonprofit organization found that adolescents with a high level of exposure to television shows with sexual content are twice as likely to get pregnant or impregnate someone as those who saw fewer programs of this kind over a period of three years. It is the first study to demonstrate this association, RAND said. A central message from the study is that there needs to be more dialogue about sex in the media, particularly among parents and their children, said Anita Chandra, the study's lead author and a behavioral scientist at RAND. \\"We know that parents are busy, but sitting down and watching shows together with their teen, talking about the character portrayals, talking about what they just witnessed, and really using it as a teachable moment is really, I think, a good recommendation from this research,\\" Chandra said. To measure exposure, the researchers used a method developed by another research group evaluating 23 shows for sexual content. Then, they asked teenagers how frequently they watched each of those shows, and developed a score based on exposure to the shows. \\"We know that if a child is watching more than an hour of TV a day, we know there's a sexual scene in [the] content every 10 minutes, then they're getting a fair amount of sexual content,\\" Chandra said. Melody Monroe of Norfolk, Virginia, who had her first child when she was 17, said she agrees that sex on television contributes to teen pregnancy. Monroe, who shared some of her views on iReport.com, recalls watching shows on Lifetime Television with her mother that were \\"almost soft porn,\\" with kissing and bedroom scenes. \\"Oh, the guy gets the girl, they fall in love, happily ever after, babies come, I thought that was one way of being loved,\\" said Monroe, now 26. \\"Happily ever after doesn't happen.\\" iReport.com: Were you a teenage parent? Share your story But Sandy Tomlinson of Glendale, Arizona, who had her son at age 15, said she doesn't think television affects teen pregnancy -- rather, teen pregnancy has to do with the way parents raise their children. \\"I feel that if my parents would have been more involved in my life that I would have made different choices,\\" said Tomlinson, now 27, who also shared her story with iReport.com. \\"It gets old hearing all these studies that blame everything and everybody but the parents.\\" The RAND study, published in the November edition of the journal Pediatrics, looked at the results of three surveys of about 2,000 adolescents ages 12 to 17 from 2001 to 2004. It focused on the results from more than 700 participants nationwide who had engaged in sexual intercourse by the third survey. Researchers asked adolescents about a mix of sitcoms, dramas, animated shows and reality shows known to have sexual content. Chandra declined to name any specific programs, but said sexual content is \\"pretty pervasive.\\" While this is one of many factors that influence teen pregnancy, the study is compelling, given that adolescents spend a significant amount of time watching television, Chandra said. The information will help develop prevention programs for kids that focus on media literacy, she said. Even when accounting for other related factors such as demographics and risk-taking behaviors, the correlation between televised sexual content and teen pregnancy persisted, she said. The study also found that adolescents living in a two-parent household had a lower probability of pregnancy. African-Americans, girls, and adolescents with behavioral problems had a higher likelihood of getting pregnant or impregnating someone, as did youths who intend to have children early, the study showed. A strong association between sexual content on television and teen pregnancy is not surprising, said Dr. Yolanda Wimberly, an assistant professor of clinical pediatrics at the Morehouse School of Medicine and the medical director for the Center for Excellence in Sexual Health. Wimberly, who works in an adolescent clinic, was not involved in the study. \\"You cannot expect to have a sexually saturated society with all of your media outlets, but then, at the same time, be surprised when this influences people and their behaviors,\\" she said. \\"If you're going to do it, then you need to make sure you follow it up with education that people need to make responsible decisions.\\" It's crucial that parents and guardians talk to their kids about these topics and teach morals and values, but they can do only so much in limiting the amount of sexual content that their teenagers see on television, Wimberly said. Youths will have exposure to these programs outside of the home, such as at friends' houses or on the Internet. Experts say television shows rarely portray the risks of sex and often don't mention contraception. But previous research from RAND showed that content that includes negative consequences, such as sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies, can be educational for teens. Previous RAND research also showed that teens who watch a lot of television with sexual content are more likely to initiate intercourse the following year. The National Institutes of Health reported in July that teen pregnancies rose in the United States from 2005 to 2006 for the first time since 1991.

Understanding the assignment: Here, I have to analyze if the word 'torrent' carries the same meaning in the two sentences given: (1) \\"They endured a torrent of inquiries.\\" and (2) \\"A torrent of abuse.\\" 2. Analyzing the term 'torrent': In both cases, 'torrent' is a noun. Its primary meaning is a strong and fast-moving stream of water or other liquid, but metaphorically it is frequently used to depict an overwhelming outpouring amount of something. 3. Analyzing Sentence (1): In \\"They endured a torrent of inquiries.\\", 'torrent' is used metaphorically - it refers to a large number of inquiries coming in quick succession. 4. Analyzing Sentence (2): In \\"A torrent of abuse.\\", 'torrent' again is used metaphorically. Here it denotes a flood or surge of verbal abuse. 5. Comparing and concluding: In both sentences, although the context differs – one refers to inquiries, and the other to abuse, the meaning of 'torrent' remains the same.

Traditional ally China increasingly irritated by regime under Kim Jong Un. President Xi Jinping: No country should be allowed to throw region into chaos. Analysts believe Kim is under pressure to justify his position at home. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Tensions Escalate as North Korea Prepares for Multiple Missile Launch, Straining Relations with China As new intelligence reports surface, tensions are mounting in East Asia as North Korea is allegedly planning a multiple missile launch in the near future. This development is not sitting well with China, as President Xi Jinping has voiced his disapproval, stating that no country should be allowed to throw the region into chaos. Under the leadership of Kim Jong Un, the relationship between North Korea and its traditional ally, China, has become increasingly strained, which could have significant ripple effects across the region and the international stage. North Korea’s missile activities have long raised concerns around the world, and this latest intelligence serves as another reminder of the unpredictable nature of the regime under Kim Jong Un. Analysts believe that Kim is under considerable pressure to fortify his position at home, which could mean an increased likelihood of provocative and hostile acts that raise the stakes for nations in the region and beyond. As North Korea's closest ally and largest trading partner, China has played an essential role in moderating the regime's behavior in the past. However, under Kim Jong Un, the relationship between China and North Korea has become more complicated, marked by Beijing's growing frustration with Pyongyang's unwillingness to denuclearize or cease its destabilizing activities. President Xi Jinping's latest statement highlights this unease, as he emphasizes the importance of regional stability and calls for a renewed commitment to peace and diplomacy. Analysts point to several factors that could explain Kim Jong Un's current need to showcase power and military capabilities. On the domestic front, the young leader may be combating internal challenges to his authority. Given North Korea's secretive nature and the opaqueness of its political system, it is difficult to assess the true extent of threat to Kim's position, but the risk cannot be discounted. Furthermore, with the nation's deteriorating economy and ongoing food shortage crises, heightened missile activities could also serve as a means to divert national attention away from internal struggles. On the international front, Kim Jong Un's decision to ramp up missile testing and the inflammatory rhetoric could be a way to signal his regime's determination and strength against mounting international pressures. With the United States and the West continually pushing for stronger sanctions and denuclearization, North Korea's missile development program and provocative actions might be designed to counteract ongoing diplomatic and economic pressures. Navigating the evolving dynamics between North Korea, China, and the international community will be a crucial aspect of managing this delicate situation. As Pyongyang seeks to assert its power, the role of China as a mediator and balancing force becomes even more significant. However, with Beijing's patience seemingly wearing thin, the potential for the diplomatic breakdown and escalation of tension should not be taken lightly. In conclusion, the latest intelligence suggesting North Korea's plans for multiple missile launches adds another layer of complexity to the already tense international relations in the region. China's increasing irritation with Kim Jong Un's regime and the young leader's need to assert his power, both domestically and internationally, make for an uncertain and precarious future. Effective diplomacy, a commitment to peace, and continued engagement with all stakeholders will be essential to address and mitigate the risks posed by North Korea's missile program and the strain it places on regional stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Richards IV was convicted of rape, the wealthy heir to the du Pont family fortune was spared prison by a Delaware court in 2009 because he would \\"not fare well\\" behind bars, according to court documents CNN obtained Tuesday. Richards is a great-grandson of the chemical magnate Irenee du Pont. He received an eight-year prison sentence in 2009 for raping his toddler daughter, but the sentencing order signed by a Delaware judge said \\"defendant will not fare well\\" in prison and the eight years were suspended. Richards was placed on eight years' probation and ordered to get treatment and register as a sex offender, the documents show. He was also prohibited from having contact with children under 16, including his own children. The documents were never sealed, yet the ruling managed to go unnoticed until March, when Richards' former wife, Tracy Richards, filed a lawsuit in Delaware Superior Court on behalf of their children alleging \\"personal injuries arising from the childhood sexual abuse.\\" The 11-page suit alleges that not only was their daughter abused, but Richards abused their son, too. The suit seeks unspecified monetary damages. While he was convicted of raping his daughter, Richards has never been charged with sexually molesting his son, according to Jason Miller, a spokesman for the Delaware attorney general's office.

Article:","completion":"Title: Scotland's College Lecturers Choose to Take Action for Better Pay Hi kids! Today, I am going to tell you a story about some teachers in a place called Scotland. Scotland is a beautiful country with lots of hills, castles, and people who wear skirts called kilts. These teachers are called college lecturers. College lecturers teach older students in special schools called colleges or universities. They help these students learn more about the world and prepare for jobs. Just like how your teachers at school help you learn how to read, write, and all sorts of things. Now, these college lecturers in Scotland are not very happy at the moment. They feel that they are not being paid enough money for the important work they do. Just like how your parents work and get money to buy food and toys, these teachers also need money for themselves and their families. So, they are having a big disagreement with the people who decide how much money they should be paid. Because they are unhappy and want more money, the college lecturers decided to do something about it. They talked with other teachers and agreed that they should take action together. This is called \\"industrial action.\\" It means that they will work together to let the people who decide their pay know that they want more money. When we say \\"overwhelmingly backed,\\" it means that a lot of teachers said \\"Yes, we want to do this!\\" More than just a few teachers, but lots and lots of them! It's like when your friends all want to play the same game at school and everyone says, \\"Yay! Let's do it!\\" So, what will happen next? The college lecturers in Scotland will try their best to let the people who decide their pay know that they want more money for their hard work. They might strike (stop working for a while) or protest (gather together and hold signs to show their feelings). Kids, what we can learn from this story is that sometimes we need to stand up for ourselves and our friends when we feel that something is not fair. Just like these college lecturers who think they deserve more money, we can also let others know when we think something needs to change.

What similar tissue connects two bones?","completion":"A similar tissue that connects two bones is called a ligament. While tendons connect muscles to bones, ligaments play a crucial role in maintaining the stability and integrity of joints by connecting bones to other bones. Ligaments are composed of dense, fibrous connective tissue, primarily made up of collagen fibers. These fibers are very strong, flexible, and can withstand significant tensile forces. Although not as elastic as tendons, ligaments have some degree of flexibility, which allows them to provide stability without limiting the normal range of motion of a joint. There are different types of ligaments, all with varying functions: 1. Capsular ligaments: These are thickened parts of the joint capsule, a fibrous structure that surrounds synovial joints. Capsular ligaments connect the articulating bones and help resist excessive movements that may cause injury to the joint. 2. Intracapsular ligaments: These lie within the joint capsule and mainly contribute to the stability of the joint while preventing excessive movements. For example, the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL) in the knee joint are intracapsular ligaments. 3. Extracapsular ligaments: These are situated outside the joint capsule and provide additional support and stability to the joint. An example of this type of ligament is the lateral collateral ligament (LCL) of the knee joint. Ligaments play a critical role in maintaining the stability of joints during various movements and physical activities. They facilitate the smooth and coordinated functioning of bones and muscles, allowing the body to perform a wide range of motions without any significant limitations. In addition to providing stability, ligaments also contribute to proprioception, which is the body's ability to sense its position, movement, and actions in space. Injuries to ligaments can occur due to overstretching, sprains, or traumatic events. When a ligament is damaged, the joint may become unstable and painful, leading to decreased function or even disability. Depending on the severity of the injury, treatment may include rest, physiotherapy, immobilization, or in some cases, surgical repair. Proper rehabilitation, including strengthening and flexibility exercises, is essential for ensuring that the joint regains its optimal function and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a text based on this summary: u.s. defense chief not budging from opposition to expanding the size of the military Text:","completion":"U.S. Defense Chief Firm on Opposition Against Expansion of Military Forces In recent discussions surrounding national security and defense, the United States Defense Chief has held a strong stance against increasing the size of the U.S. military. The debate on whether or not to expand the military has been a topic of contention amongst lawmakers, experts, and military personnel for years. Despite various opinions and proposals suggesting the benefits of a larger military force, the Defense Chief's unwavering opposition to the idea stands out. The rationale behind the Defense Chief's stance is based on the current level of military preparedness and the effectiveness of existing forces in facing contemporary threats. According to the Defense Chief, rather than investing in a larger military, it would be more beneficial to focus on upgrading technology, infrastructure, and equipment of the present forces. The modernization of the military is crucial in putting the U.S. at a strategic advantage and in better positioning the forces to address both conventional and unconventional threats. An expanding military force would also bring additional fiscal concerns, which the Defense department has made an effort to manage prudently. The costs associated with an expansion include recruiting, training, infrastructure, equipment, and benefits for soldiers. By concentrating on refining current capabilities and making strategic decisions, it is believed that the United States can maintain a strong defense without significantly increasing its military personnel numbers. In times of financial instability, the country must find a balance between national security and fiscal responsibility. Furthermore, the Defense Chief highlights the significance of focusing on other aspects of national security beyond traditional military power. This would involve collaborative efforts with international partners, intelligence agencies, and diplomacy to form a comprehensive security framework. In a world where threats are not only limited to physical warfare but also encompass cyber-attacks, terrorism, and other unconventional dangers, the Defense Chief argues that the United States must employ a diverse and holistic approach to security, which does not merely involve increasing the number of soldiers. The opposition to military expansion also reflects the Defense Chief's philosophy of building a highly capable and technologically advanced military force. This perspective emphasizes the quality of personnel, training, and equipment over sheer numbers. Lessons from previous conflicts have shown that superior technology and tactics can often compensate for numerical disadvantages and make a decisive impact on the outcome of battles. Despite the concerns about expanding the size of the military, it is important to recognize that the United States remains one of the most prominent military powers in the world. With a network of allies, extensive defense capabilities, and modern technologies, the U.S. military continues to stand as a critical factor in maintaining global stability and addressing threats to national security. In conclusion, the U.S. Defense Chief's firm opposition to expanding the size of the military emphasizes the importance of focusing on modernization, technological advancements, and innovative approaches to national security. While many arguments favor an increased military presence, it is crucial to evaluate the strategic advantages that can be achieved through enhancing the capabilities of current forces and fostering international cooperation. By maintaining a well-equipped and battle-ready military, the United States can effectively manage its defense without the need for a larger force."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer a question about this article: From the 1970s onward, Stuart Hall's pioneering work, along with that of his colleagues Paul Willis, Dick Hebdige, Tony Jefferson, and Angela McRobbie, created an international intellectual movement. As the field developed it began to combine political economy, communication, sociology, social theory, literary theory, media theory, film/video studies, cultural anthropology, philosophy, museum studies and art history to study cultural phenomena or cultural texts. In this field researchers often concentrate on how particular phenomena relate to matters of ideology, nationality, ethnicity, social class, and/or gender.[citation needed] Cultural studies has a concern with the meaning and practices of everyday life. These practices comprise the ways people do particular things (such as watching television, or eating out) in a given culture. This field studies the meanings and uses people attribute to various objects and practices. Specifically, culture involves those meanings and practices held independently of reason. Watching television in order to view a public perspective on a historical event should not be thought of as culture, unless referring to the medium of television itself, which may have been selected culturally; however, schoolchildren watching television after school with their friends in order to \\"fit in\\" certainly qualifies, since there is no grounded reason for one's participation in this practice. Recently, as capitalism has spread throughout the world (a process called globalization), cultural studies has begun[when?] to analyze local and global forms of resistance to Western hegemony.[citation needed] Globalization in this context can be defined as western civilization in other ways, it undermines the cultural integrity of other culture and it is therefore repressive, exploitative and harmful to most people in different places.

A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"What structure moves the genetic material of a cell during cell division?\\" is \\"microtubules.\\" During cell division, the genetic material within a cell is organized into structures called chromosomes. Each chromosome contains tightly coiled DNA and various proteins that help to compact and organize the genetic material. The primary purpose of compacting the DNA into chromosomes is to facilitate the equal distribution of genetic material to the two new daughter cells produced during cell division. Microtubules are essential components of the cell's cytoskeleton, which helps maintain the structure, shape, and organization of a cell. They play a critical role in several cellular processes, including the movement of organelles and vesicles, intracellular transport, and cell division. During cell division, particularly in the process of mitosis and meiosis, microtubules form a specialized structure called the mitotic spindle. The mitotic spindle is a bipolar structure composed of several microtubules extending from two opposing poles within the cell. The spindle fibers connect to a region within each chromosome known as the centromere. As cell division progresses, the microtubules that form the mitotic spindle act to move and position the chromosomes in an organized manner within the dividing cell. In the metaphase stage, the microtubules align the chromosomes at the cell's equator in the center, ensuring that each daughter cell will receive the same amount of genetic material. The microtubules then exert force on the centromeres and physically separate the sister chromatids of each chromosome, pulling them to opposite poles during anaphase. This ensures that each daughter cell receives a complete and identical set of chromosomes. Once the chromosomes have been separated and reached the poles, cytokinesis occurs, dividing the cell into two daughter cells. In conclusion, microtubules are the most accurate answer choice for the question. They are the critical structures responsible for moving chromosomes (which contain the genetic material) during cell division, ensuring the proper segregation of genetic material into daughter cells."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One of his last ideas was to draft plans for an elected parliament, or Duma, which were completed the day before he died but not yet released to the Russian people. In a matter of 48 hours, Alexander II planned to release his plan for the duma to the Russian people. Had he lived, Russia might have followed a path to constitutional monarchy instead of the long road of oppression that defined his successor's reign. The first action Alexander III took after his father's death was to tear up those plans. A Duma would not come into fruition until 1905, when Alexander II's grandson, Nicholas II, commissioned the Duma following extreme pressure on the monarchy as a result of the Russian Revolution of 1905. The assassination triggered major suppression of civil liberties in Russia, and police brutality burst back in full force after experiencing some restraint under the reign of Alexander II, whose death was witnessed first-hand by his son, Alexander III, and his grandson, Nicholas II, both future emperors who vowed not to have the same fate befall them. Both of them used the Okhrana to arrest protestors and uproot suspected rebel groups, creating further suppression of personal freedom for the Russian people. A series of anti-Jewish pogroms and antisemitic legislation, the May Laws, were yet another result. Finally, the tsar's assassination also inspired anarchists to advocate \\"'propaganda by deed'--the use of a spectacular act of violence to incite revolution.\\" With construction starting in 1883, the Church of the Savior on Blood was built on the site of Alexander's assassination and dedicated in his memory.

What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Many programs will teach you how to market yourself so you can build your business. One thing that you can do is build a website. This website will help people in your area who need a relationship coach find you. On your website, you need to list all of your education, qualifications, and certifications. You should also list all your relative experience. Emphasize any of your specializations and areas of focus. Social media is a great way to build your brand and your business. You can put your relationship coaching business on different social media sites to help build network and professional connections. You can use Facebook and Twitter to help get the word out about your new business. Encourage friends, family, and acquaintances to share your page and spread the word about the services you offer. Use professional social media sites like LinkedIn to help meet other relationship coaches. Meeting other people in the field can help you make professional connections and potentially grow your business. You may also find out about professional development opportunities, relationship coaching events, and other opportunities through these sites. You should also try to get your name listed on relationship coaching websites. Look for national directories you can place your name so potential clients in your area can search for you. You set the amount you charge for each session. Sessions can range from 60 to 150 for a session. The amount you choose to charge may depend on various circumstances. At first, you may not want to charge too much since you are a new relationship coach who is trying to build a client list. If you are providing coaching to single people, you may choose to charge less than couples or families. The amount you charge may depend on the length of the session. Some sessions may run 45 minutes while others might last for 90 minutes. You may decide to charge more for longer sessions. To start a career in relationship coaching, you have to take on clients. Don’t get discouraged if it takes a few weeks or months to get your business off the ground. Keep advertising on social media and placing your name on relationship coaching directories. Once you start building a client list, decide how many clients you want to take on at once. You may want to focus on a few people at first, or try to get a full-time load. If you are struggling to gain new clients at first, offer reduced rates to your family and friends. Try offering reduced rates for new clients or the first ten clients who sign up for coaching sessions. You may decide to offer a free introductory session. This gives someone the option of meeting and talking with you to decide if you are a good fit. This might be good for people who are hesitant to spend money to find a relationship coach they may not like or if they are nervous because you are new to the field.

They grow food that we eat, like rice and wheat, from a land called \\"farm.\\" But, for a very long time, there was no rain. When there is no rain, the plants on the farm don't get enough water to grow properly.

So, the farmers decided to come together to ask the people in charge, called the \\"government,\\" for help. They started a \\"protest.\\" A protest is when a group of people say things loudly or hold signs with words on them, to show they are not happy with something. The farmers' protest was to ask the government for help and tell them their problems. The government listened to the farmers carefully. They understood how hard it is for farmers to grow food without enough rain. The people in charge then made a big promise. They said they will help the farmers and find a solution for their problems. The farmers became happy. They believed that the government will keep their promise. So, the farmers decided to stop their protest.

Define key terms: \\"Abandoned pets\\" refers to animals that have been left by their owners or caretakers and are no longer cared for. \\"Stray pets\\" are animals that roam public spaces without owners or caretakers. 3. Compare the terms: Abandoned pets can become stray pets if they are left in public spaces, as they have no owner or caretaker. Therefore, there is a connection between abandoned pets and stray pets.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. François Hollande, the newly-inaugurated President of France, may be as notable for what he has not done as for what he has. He has never held national elective office despite being at the center of French politics for more than a decade, and he has never been married despite a three-decade relationship and four children with Ségolène Royale, another of the country's top Socialist politicians. Hollande led the Socialist Party for 11 years and was leader when Royale ran unsuccessfully for president against Nicolas Sarkozy in 2007. Hollande and Royale split up a month before that election, and he is now seeing journalist Valérie Trierweiler, who appeared, smiling with him, as he celebrated his victory Sunday. He immediately spooked markets, and Germany, France's key ally in the European Union, with his victory speech. \\"Austerity can no longer be something that is inevitable,\\" he said, apparently undercutting the belt-tightening that his predecessor and German Chancellor Angela Merkel have urged on European countries beset by debt. Hollande emerged as his party's candidate for president after the downfall of Dominique Strauss-Kahn, who was once considered the Socialist favorite to defeat Sarkozy. But Strauss-Kahn was arrested in May 2011 after a New York hotel maid alleged that he tried to rape her. Charges against the former IMF chief were later dropped in the United States, but he has been warned he could be investigated in France over accusations he participated in a prostitution ring. But Hollande was not an accidental candidate despite the way he has come to power, one commentator said. \\"He's been preparing this campaign for 18 months now, much before DSK's demise,\\" journalist Agnès Poirier said, referring to Strauss-Kahn. \\"Some say that he knew, like actually many others in the party, that DSK was doomed: His colorful private life was always bound to prevent his running for president,\\" Poirer told CNN before the final vote. \\"In that respect, he's not a candidate by default. He's simply a less charismatic personality than DSK and less antagonistic than Sarkozy.\\" Born in 1954 in the northern city of Rouen, Hollande was the son of a doctor and a social worker. He was educated at the elite Ecole Nationale d'Administration, where he met Royale in 1978. Hollande has represented the southern Corrèze region in parliament since 1988 but has never held higher elective office than that post. The 57-year-old's electoral appeal is built around his affability, but the candidate was dogged during the campaign by questions from even within his own party about whether he has the charisma and decisiveness to be president. Hollande said: \\"There's always a risk when the candidate becomes president: Will he deliver what is expected of him? \\"It's a choice, it's always an important moment for a country because it has to choose between two risks: Either you keep the candidate who is on his way out or take the new candidate that we don't know. It's a gamble.\\" But after five years of Sarkozy's hyperactive presidency, during which time France's economic status has taken a knock, polls suggested voters were keen for a change from the president's flamboyancy. Before the first round of voting, former President Jacques Chirac added his support to Hollande, though Chirac was a center-right president, like Sarkozy. Chirac biographer Jean-Luc Barré told French TV channel BFM TV: \\"He said last June that he will vote for François Hollande. ... He has said it a few times since and then again 10 days ago.\\" During the campaign, Hollande admitted that half of those who declare they will vote for him were primarily voting against Sarkozy. \\"What the French want is coherence, stability and justice,\\" Hollande said. \\"If I am in a favorable position today, it's because my fellow citizens want to make the effort to straighten out the country, and at the same time they want it to be just and equitable -- no one left out of national solidarity and no one left out of the contributions which must be made.\\" To his critics that sounded as if Hollande wants to revive left-wing tax and social policies of the past, a view reinforced in the first speech of his campaign when he attacked the financial community. \\"I don't want to drive the markets crazy, I don't want to create trouble but rather order and rules and norms. We have to struggle against financial excesses ... those who speculate with sovereign debt, those who develop financial products which have done so much harm,\\" he said. But given the constraints of international finance and economic structures, observers said Hollande will not really have room to maneuver to shift France radically to the left. Hollande has been criticized for declining to spell exactly what his economic policies will be, although he has pledged to increase taxes on the rich, boost social spending and create thousands of state jobs. He has also vowed to renegotiate the eurozone fiscal agreement, but analysts said Hollande will likely be a pragmatic leader. Economy: Unspoken issue in election. The word one hears most often to describe Hollande's style is \\"sympa,\\" French slang for sympathetic, but his victory also owes a great deal to Strauss-Kahn's misfortune.

Q:Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: At Denver there was an crowd of passengers into the coaches on the eastbound B. & M. express. In one coach there sat a very pretty young woman dressed in elegant taste and surrounded by all the luxurious comforts of an experienced traveler. Among the newcomers were two young men, one of handsome presence with a bold, frank face expression and manner; the other a ruffled, glum-faced person, heavily built and roughly dressed. The two were handcuffed together. As they passed down the aisle of the coach the only available seat offered was a reversed one facing the attractive young woman. Here the linked couple seated themselves. The young woman's glance fell upon them with a distant, swift disinterest; then with a lovely smile brightening her face and a tender pink tingeing(,) her rounded cheeks, she held out a little gray-gloved hand. When she spoke her voice, full, sweet, and deliberate, proclaimed that its owner was accustomed to speak and be heard. \\"Well, Mr. Easton, if you will make me speak first, I suppose I must. Don't you ever recognize old friends when you meet them in the West?\\" The younger man aroused himself sharply at the sound of her voice, seemed to struggle with a slight embarrassment which he threw off instantly, and then clasped her fingers with his left hand. \\"It's Miss Fairchild,\\" he said, with a smile. \\"I'll ask you to excuse the other hand; \\"it's otherwise engaged just at present.\\" He slightly raised his right hand, bound at the wrist by the shining \\"bracelet\\" to the left one of his companion.

In 1972, still undefeated and with an impressive knockout record, Foreman was set to challenge undefeated and Undisputed World Heavyweight Champion Joe Frazier. Despite boycotting a title elimination caused by the vacancy resulting from the championship being stripped from Muhammad Ali, Frazier had won the title from Jimmy Ellis and defended his title four times since, including a 15-round unanimous decision over the previously unbeaten Ali in 1971 after Ali had beaten Oscar Bonavena and Jerry Quarry. Despite Foreman's superior size and reach, he was not expected to beat Frazier and was a 3:1 underdog going into the fight. The Sunshine Showdown took place on January 22, 1973, in Kingston, Jamaica, with Foreman dominating the fight to win the championship by technical knockout. In ABC's re-broadcast, Howard Cosell made the memorable call, \\"Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier! Down goes Frazier!\\" Before the fight Frazier was 29-0 (25 KO) and Foreman was 37-0 (34 KO). Frazier was knocked down six times by Foreman within two rounds (the three-knockdown rule was not in effect for this bout). After the second knockdown, Frazier's balance and mobility were impaired to the extent that he was unable to evade Foreman's combinations. Frazier managed to get to his feet for all six knockdowns, but referee Arthur Mercante eventually called an end to the one-sided bout. Foreman was sometimes characterized by the media as an aloof and antisocial champion. According to them, he always seemed to wear a sneer and was not often available to the press. Foreman later attributed his demeanor during this time as an emulation of Sonny Liston, for whom he had been an occasional sparring partner. Foreman defended his title successfully twice during his initial reign as champion. His first defense, in Tokyo, pitted him against Puerto Rican Heavyweight Champion Jose Roman. Roman was not regarded as a top contender, and it took Foreman only 2 minutes to end the fight, one of the fastest knockouts in a Heavyweight Championship bout.

Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. Let me provide a detailed explanation for each question to help you understand them better: 1. Fast and slow moving averages stock market? Moving averages are a popular technical indicator used in stock market analysis to help traders and investors identify trends and potential entry or exit points for trades. Moving averages are used to smooth out the noise and fluctuations in stock prices by calculating the average price of a security over a specific time period. There are two types of moving averages commonly referred to as fast and slow moving averages: - Fast Moving Average: A fast moving average is calculated using fewer data points, typically a shorter time period. For example, a 5-day or 10-day moving average. A fast moving average reacts more quickly to recent price changes and is more sensitive to short-term market movements. Fast moving averages are commonly used by short-term traders for identifying trend reversals and entry/exit points for trades. - Slow Moving Average: A slow moving average uses more data points, typically a longer time period. For example, a 50-day, 100-day, or 200-day moving average. A slow moving average provides a smoother representation of the long-term trend by minimizing the impact of short-term price fluctuations. It is more suitable for long-term investors as it helps in determining the overall direction of the market or a specific security. Some traders and investors use a combination of fast and slow moving averages, known as moving average crossovers, to generate buy or sell signals. When a fast moving average crosses above a slow moving average, it suggests that the short-term momentum is stronger and may indicate a potential buying opportunity. Conversely, if a fast moving average crosses below a slow moving average, it signifies that the short-term momentum is weakening and may serve as a sell signal. 2. Indian stock market moves with which international stock market? The Indian stock market does not move in tandem with a single international stock market. However, it is influenced by various global factors and has correlations with major markets around the world. Some of the key international markets that can impact the Indian stock market include: - US Markets: The United States stock markets, such as the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ, play a significant role in influencing global markets, including India. US economic data, Federal Reserve policies, and major corporate earnings announcements can impact investor sentiment and market movements across the globe. - European Markets: The major exchanges in Europe, such as the London Stock Exchange (LSE), Euronext, and Deutsche Börse, can also impact the Indian stock market through their influence on global trade, economic policies, and market trends. Events like Brexit and the European financial crisis have had ripple effects on other markets around the world. - Asian Markets: Other Asian stock markets, such as the Japanese (Tokyo Stock Exchange), Chinese (Shanghai and Shenzhen Stock Exchanges), and Hong Kong (Hong Kong Stock Exchange) markets, can also exert influence on the Indian market due to their geographical proximity and interconnected economies. Regional events, trade agreements, and economic policies can cause movement in the Indian stock market. It's important to note that the correlation between the Indian stock market and other international markets can vary over time. While some events might cause synchronized movements, stock markets can also diverge or move independently based on domestic factors such as local economic indicators, political developments, and company-specific news. In summary, these questions focus on different aspects of the stock market. The first question relates to technical analysis using moving averages to analyze stock trends, while the second question highlights the interconnectedness between the Indian stock market and other global markets."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"No. The statement provided, \\"Within weeks, the major powers were at war and, via their colonies, the conflict soon spread around the world,\\" describes the rapid escalation and global reach of World War I. However, it does not directly answer the question of who started the war. World War I was initiated with the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, 1914, by Gavrilo Princip, a member of the Bosnian Serb nationalist group known as the Black Hand. The assassination took place in Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which was then a part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. This incident led to a series of events and a complex web of alliances that culminated in the declaration of war against Serbia by Austria-Hungary on July 28, 1914. As the conflict escalated, the opposing sides formed two major alliances: the Triple Entente (also known as the Allies), which comprised Russia, France, and the United Kingdom, and the Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottoman Empire. As a result, the localized conflict between Austria-Hungary and Serbia eventually expanded into a world war that lasted from 1914 to 1918."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

WASHINGTON — President Obama will issue new guidelines on Friday to curtail government surveillance, but will not embrace the most far-reaching proposals of his own advisers and will ask Congress to help decide some of the toughest issues, according to people briefed on his thinking. Mr. Obama plans to increase limits on access to bulk telephone data, call for privacy safeguards for foreigners and propose the creation of a public advocate to represent privacy concerns at a secret intelligence court. But he will not endorse leaving bulk data in the custody of telecommunications firms, nor will he require court permission for all so-called national security letters seeking business records. The emerging approach, described by current and former government officials who insisted on anonymity in advance of Mr. Obama’s widely anticipated speech, suggested a president trying to straddle a difficult line in hopes of placating foreign leaders and advocates of civil liberties without a backlash from national security agencies. The result seems to be a speech that leaves in place many current programs, but embraces the spirit of reform and keeps the door open to changes later. The decision to provide additional privacy protections for non-American citizens or residents, for instance, largely codifies existing practices but will be followed by a 180-day study by the director of national intelligence about whether to go further. Likewise, instead of taking the storage of bulk data out of government hands, as recommended by a review panel he appointed, Mr. Obama will leave it in place for now and ask lawmakers to weigh in. The blend of decisions, to be outlined in a speech at the Justice Department and in a presidential guidelines memorandum, will be Mr. Obama’s highest-profile response to the disclosures about the National Security Agency made in recent months by Edward J. Snowden, a former N.S.A. contractor who has fled to Russia. But as intelligence officials have sorted through Mr. Obama’s evolving position, they have been divided about how significant his adjustments will be. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some officials complained that the changes will add layers of cumbersome procedure that will hinder the hunt for potential terrorists, while others expressed relief that Mr. Obama is not going further and confidence that they could still work within the new guidelines without sacrificing much. “Is it cosmetic or is there a real thumb on the scale in a different direction?” asked one former government official who worked on intelligence issues. “That’s the question.” The White House said the president’s review is incomplete and would not comment further Tuesday. The developments came as the nation’s judiciary waded into the highly charged debate. In a letter made public on Tuesday, a judge designated by Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. to express the views of the judicial branch warned that some changes under consideration would have a negative “operational impact” on a secret foreign intelligence court. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Judge John D. Bates, a former chief judge of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, urged Mr. Obama and Congress not to alter the way the court is appointed or to create an independent public advocate to argue against the Justice Department in secret proceedings. Any such advocate, he wrote, should instead be appointed only when the court decided one was needed. Judge Bates objected to the workload of requiring that courts approve all national security letters, which are administrative subpoenas allowing the F.B.I. to obtain records about communications and financial transactions without court approval. And he raised concerns about greater public disclosure of court rulings, arguing that unclassified summaries would be “likely to promote confusion and misunderstanding.” The judge’s letter, versions of which he sent to the leaders of several congressional committees, was released as all five members of Mr. Obama’s surveillance review group testified Tuesday before the Senate Judiciary Committee, seeking support for their recommendations. Illustrating the cross-pressures on the president, the advisers argued for the appointment of the independent version of a public advocate, a recommendation the president is expected to follow, though it is not clear how he will structure the position. “We admire Judge Bates and respect his views,” said Cass R. Sunstein, of Harvard Law School and a former Obama White House official who served on the review panel. “We respectfully disagree with that one, on the ground that the judge sometimes is not in the ideal position to know whether a particular view needs representation and that in our tradition, standardly, the judge doesn’t decide whether one or another view gets a lawyer.” The judge’s objection to the proposal on national security letters dovetailed with that of the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, who argued it would be inefficient to have to go to a judge each time records were sought. Mr. Obama has decided not to require court approval in every case, but might still require it in some circumstances, according to one administration official. Mr. Obama will cut back on the number of people whose phone records can be examined by the N.S.A. through its bulk data program. Currently the agency can scrutinize call records of people as far as three steps, or “hops,” removed from a suspect. Mr. Obama’s review panel proposed limiting searches to people just two steps removed. He is also likely to cut down the number of years such data can be retained; currently it is deleted after five years. But the president will not, at least for now, back the panel’s suggestion that telecommunications firms keep such data and that the government be allowed to tap into those databases only when necessary. Intelligence officials complained it would be inefficient to have to go to multiple companies, so some officials proposed creating an independent consortium to store the data instead. Mr. Obama has decided against keeping the data at the private providers because they do not want that responsibility, officials said, and no independent consortium currently exists. As a result, he will ask Congress to work with him to determine the best way to store the data. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story He also appears likely to reject the idea of separating code breakers and code makers. Some critics of the N.S.A. were disturbed that the agency’s encryption team charged with bolstering online security systems against hackers was working with the team that tries to penetrate computer systems used by terrorists. The letter by Judge Bates was accompanied by 15 pages of often specific comments about possible surveillance reforms. It is highly unusual for judges to weigh in on public policy debates involving the other two branches of government, but Judge Bates, the director of the Administrative Office of the United States Court, said that Chief Justice Roberts had designated him to “act as a liaison” and that he had consulted other judges. The judge emphasized that his comments were meant to address smooth operation of the court and were “not intended as expressions of support or opposition to particular introduced bills.” Still, his comments went beyond workload issues. He objected to a proposal by Mr. Obama’s review group to take away Chief Justice Roberts’s sole power to appoint the 11 judges of the surveillance court and have them picked instead by the chief judges of the appeals courts. Ten of the 11 current judges were appointed by Republican presidents, and critics have called for more diversity. “The chief justice is uniquely positioned to select qualified judges,” Judge Bates argued. ||||| WASHINGTON — Judges on the federal government's secret surveillance court have strongly rejected any proposed changes to their review process, putting unexpected pressure on the White House on Tuesday as President Obama prepares a speech aimed at bolstering public confidence in how the government collects intelligence. In a blunt letter to the House and Senate intelligence and judiciary committees, U.S. District Judge John D. Bates made it clear that the 11 judges on the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court are united in opposition to key recommendations by a presidential task force last month aimed at increasing transparency and judicial oversight, including at least one that Obama has tentatively endorsed. The surveillance court judges have not previously gone public so it is difficult to gauge how much weight their opposition carries. But their skepticism adds to a list of hurdles for those advocating significant reforms following former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden's massive disclosures of domestic and foreign surveillance programs. Most surprisingly, Bates said the judges opposed adding an independent advocate for privacy and civil liberties to the court's classified hearings, saying the proposal was \\"unnecessary — and could prove counterproductive.\\" PHOTOS: Politics in 2014 Obama and some intelligence officials have publicly signaled support for creating an adversarial legal process in the court, which now hears only from government lawyers, and aides have suggested the president will create an advocate's position or call for legislation to do so in a speech scheduled for Friday morning at the Justice Department. The proposal was widely viewed as among the least controversial of the changes under consideration at the White House. But Bates disagreed sharply, arguing that \\"the participation of an advocate would neither create a truly adversarial process nor constructively assist the courts in assessing the facts, as the advocate would be unable to communicate with the target or conduct an independent investigation.\\" Adding an advocate to \\"run-of-the-mill FISA matters would substantially hamper the work of the courts without providing any countervailing benefit in terms of privacy protection,\\" he added. Bates is the former presiding judge of the court, which was created under the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and reviews applications from intelligence and law enforcement agencies for classified surveillance warrants and programs. He now serves as liaison for the federal judiciary on FISA issues. Bates said he had consulted with current and former judges on the secret court and one above it that reviews its decisions, and thus speaks for them. His three-page letter was accompanied by 15 pages of judicial comments and legal footnotes. The judges were uniformly against making the secret judicial review more transparent, a practice that Obama has espoused. \\"Releasing freestanding summaries of court opinions is likely to promote confusion and misunderstanding,\\" Bates wrote. His letter said the judges also opposed broadening the selection process of FISA court judges, who now are chosen only by the chief justice of the Supreme Court. Obama has not signaled whether he is considering changing that system to add diversity to the FISA court. Not unexpectedly, the judges announced their reluctance to drastically expand their caseload by being required to review and approve so-called national security letters. The FBI currently uses the letters and needs no warrant to issue administrative subpoenas to gain access to customer records from telephone, credit card and other companies more than 20,000 times a year. Even if they were given extra resources, requiring a judge's approval for each subpoena \\"would fundamentally transform the nature of the [court] to the detriment of its current responsibilities,\\" Bates wrote. Senior FBI and intelligence officials already had lined up in opposition to requiring warrants for the national security letters, and Obama has shown no sign of planning to upend that system. The most sweeping recommendation by the presidential task force would force the NSA to stop collecting and archiving Americans' telephone toll records, and shift responsibility for the vast database back to the telephone companies or a private entity. White House aides have said Obama is strongly considering some variation of the proposal, which would require action by Congress. But telecommunications officials and some members of Congress are sharply opposed to ordering private companies to hold records of billions of American telephone calls for government use because of potential legal liability and the cost. At a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing Tuesday, some lawmakers worried whether the records would be secure in private hands. Among those who testified was Cass Sunstein, a former Obama advisor who served on the task force. Asked about Bates' opposition to naming a privacy advocate, Sunstein told the committee: \\"We respectfully disagree with that one.… In our tradition, the judge doesn't decide whether one [side] or another gets a lawyer.\\" Privacy activists don't expect Obama to announce major reforms in his speech Friday, said Fred Cate, a law professor at Indiana University. \\"I don't think anyone is expecting this to be good news,\\" he said. Given that Snowden's leaks to the media have caused an uproar overseas, \\"I don't see that this is likely to get him out of hot water with Europe or with the privacy community.\\" ken.dilanian@latimes.com Twitter: @kendilanianLAT ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"President Obama issued new guidelines to reduce government surveillance but did not agree to the most extensive proposals made by his advisers.

Background: DC-SIGNR (also called CD209L) has been extensively studied on its role in host genetic predisposition to viral infection. In particular, variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) of the neck-region of DC-SIGNR is highly polymorphic and the polymorphism has been investigated for genetic predisposition to various infectious diseases, though conflicting results had been reported. As infection is a major cause of human death and a mechanism of natural selection, we hypothesized that VNTR polymorphism of DC-SIGNR might have an effect on human life span. Here we collected 361 peri-centenarian individuals (age ≥94 for female and age ≥90 for male) and 342 geographically matched controls (age 22-53, mean 35.0 ± 12.0) from Han Chinese. The VNTR polymorphism of the neck region was determined by PCR and genotype was called by separating the PCR products in agarose gel. Results: A total of 11 genotypes and 5 alleles were found in our population. The genotype distribution, allele frequencies and homozygote proportion did not show a significant difference between peri-centenarian and control group. As gender differences in lifespan are ubiquitously observed throughout the animal kingdom, we then stratified the samples by gender. There was more 6/7 genotypes in female peri-centenarian group than that in female control group, at a marginal level of significance (5.56 vs. 1.28%, p = 0.041). The difference was not significant after correction by Bonferroni method. It suggests a possible differential effect of DC-SIGNR VNTR genotypes between sexes. Further studies are warranted to confirm our preliminary findings and investigate the mechanisms of the underlying functions. Our study indicated that there was absence of association between the neck region polymorphism of DC-SIGNR and longevity in Han Chinese population. But the question of whether the DC-SIGNR could affect longevity in a gender-specific pattern remains open.

Question: \\"Why is the nickname possibly not very valid?\\" Context: \\"Whereas the chromosomes of prokaryotes are relatively gene-dense, those of eukaryotes often contain regions of DNA that serve no obvious function. Simple single-celled eukaryotes have relatively small amounts of such DNA, whereas the genomes of complex multicellular organisms, including humans, contain an absolute majority of DNA without an identified function. This DNA has often been referred to as \\"junk DNA\\".

I had suspected the first part of the twist but what really threw me was when he touches the agent and sees the agent murder his mother and the fact that the agent too (without any words spoken, simply by touch) sees it again with Adam and asks him how he knew. My dilemma was not that it was yet another twist thrown in but the almost ungraspable idea that this man and his father were not crazy but actually picked out 'bad guys' so to speak, knowing their sins and crimes already. I don't endorse an eye for an eye so I didn't leave the film being able to believe that they were doing God's work. Instead I chose to believe that they were both clairvoyant and that the father had gone off the deep end one day from it and through the things that he subjected his sons to, disturbed them permanently also. That was my interpretation but the vexing thing about the film was it's like a house of cards and a never-ending circle and what is the correct interpretation of the disturbing events you've sat through. It's definitely one of those movies where I'd love to be able to meet the writer so I could just ask him what the real meaning was to it all. Were they crazy and psychotic? Were they simply telepathic and took license because of it? Or did they have some sort of appearance from God? And if so, was it God or the Devil disguising himself as God. My friends and I found ourselves talking about it all night trying to figure out what was what and what the filmmakers had thought was the answer when they made this movie. A definitely perplexing and thought invoking film with some very disturbing but certainly not sensationalistic elements to it. It's not a perfect film, but it definitely is it's own thing. Great directorial work and acting by Bill Paxton and the child that played Fenton was extremely good. I hope he doesn't end up relegated to the child actor syndrome as he seems to have a lot of promise. I gave this movie a good vote for the majority of the components that make a film, but I would have voted higher if wasn't for the feeling that something (although I can't pinpoint what) was off and if it hadn't have been, the movie would have gone to an even higher level. Still, a definite recommend, especially for those that are inquisitive. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is primarily positive with some mixed feelings. The reviewer praises the screenplay, pacing, editing, directing, and acting, specifically, the performance of Bill Paxton and the child actor who played Fenton. The reviewer appreciates the film's thought-provoking and perplexing nature, as well as its ability to generate discussion among their friends. However, they also express dissatisfaction with the cinematography and a sense that something was missing that could have elevated the film even higher. Overall, the reviewer recommends the movie, especially for those who enjoy inquisitive films."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The chemical used are usually a mixture of compounds containing several carbon atoms in a chain. When the material is ignited, a massive amount of gas is created almost instantaneously. This increase in volume will move the pistons in an internal combustion engine to provide power. A jet plane works on a similar principle. Air comes into the front of the engine and mixes with the jet fuel. This mixture is ignited and the gases formed create a lot of pressure to push the plane forward. The idea can be seen even more clearly in the case of a rocket launch. The ignition of the fuel (either solid-state or liquid) creates gases produced under great pressure that pushes the rocket up. I am facing a new situation today: Company A was a refinery and managed petroleum products. Another company, named company H, produced and distributed electricity using wind power.

Article: One event that helps educate young people about things they can do for others is National Youth Service Day (NYSD). Every year on this day, organizations all over the country celebrate young volunteers, educate young people about how they can help their country, and invite them to participate in service projects. Former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, \\"National Youth Service Day honors young volunteers and is an invitation to others to join hands and do our part as Americans.\\" Founded in 1988, NYSD originally took place on a Tuesday. Now the event lasts from Friday until Sunday so that more people can participate in it. More than 200 organizations work together to create thousands of projects each year. Millions of young people across the United States take part in these service projects. Long before the event, people, community groups, schools, and nonprofit organizations think of ways to meet their communities' needs. Then, they plan projects for young volunteers. Projects include bringing food to hungry people, tutoring younger children and helping senior citizens. During the event, young people from the community do things like planting neighborhood gardens and cleaning up local parks. The organizations that contribute to NYSD believe that volunteering and community service are important activities for people of all ages, but especially for young people. Young people who volunteer are more likely to do well in school, vote, and contribute to charities. More important, they help other people and make the world a better place for everyone.

Though the proportions were always important in Greek art, the appeal of the Greek sculptures eludes any explanation by proportion alone. The statues of Apollo were thought to incarnate his living presence, and these representations of illusive imaginative reality had deep roots in the Minoan period, and in the beliefs of the first Greek speaking people who entered the region during the bronze-age. Just as the Greeks saw the mountains, forests, sea and rivers as inhabited by concrete beings, so nature in all of its manifestations possesses clear form, and the form of a work of art. Spiritual life is incorporated in matter, when it is given artistic form. Just as in the arts the Greeks sought some reality behind appearances, so in mathematics they sought permanent principles which could be applied wherever the conditions were the same. Artists and sculptors tried to find this ideal order in relation with mathematics, but they believed that this ideal order revealed itself not so much to the dispassionate intellect, as to the whole sentient self.

Question: Why would someone be unable to be bringing suit? Options: - going to court - financially unable - aggravation - randomness - great expense Explain why a human would choose \\"great expense\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"A human might choose \\"great expense\\" as the reason someone would be unable to bring a suit due to multiple factors incurring high costs associated with legal proceedings and how it may deter individuals from pursuing a case in court. 1. Legal fees: Hiring a lawyer to represent a case in court can be costly. Lawyers charge for their time in different ways, such as hourly or on a contingency basis. Depending on the case's complexity and length, legal fees can accumulate significantly over time. If someone does not have the financial means to afford these expenses, they may be unable to bring a suit. 2. Court costs: Apart from legal fees, there can be various court-associated costs that need to be paid, such as filing fees, transcript fees, witness fees, and other related expenses. These costs may increase depending on the case's duration and additional procedural steps. 3. Expert witness fees: In some cases, expert witnesses might be needed to testify and provide specialized knowledge in a court proceeding. Hiring experts can be expensive, as they will need to be compensated for their time in reviewing the case, preparing an opinion, and appearing in court. 4. Time commitment: Taking legal action requires a significant time commitment and missed opportunities as parties involved need to be present during court proceedings. The time spent on litigation can affect a person's work and daily life, indirectly contributing to the total expense involved. 5. Potential loss: There is no guarantee that pursuing a lawsuit will result in a favorable outcome for the plaintiff. The person bringing the suit may still lose despite the significant investment of time and resources. This risk factor might discourage individuals from pursuing legal action due to the potential loss on top of the incurred expenses. 6. Emotional toll: Legal disputes can be emotionally draining on individuals and their families. The added stress caused by the court proceedings can have harmful effects on mental well-being, relationships, and overall life satisfaction. The prospect of prolonged emotional strain may affect the decision-making process, leading the person to choose not to bring a suit. 7. Alternative dispute resolution: In some cases, individuals might prefer alternative dispute resolution methods like mediation or arbitration to resolve conflicts outside the court system. These methods could be less expensive, faster, and less contentious than litigation, making them more attractive options for those who cannot afford the great expense typically associated with suing. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"great expense\\" as a reason someone would be unable to bring a suit due to the multitude of costs involved in pursuing legal action. The financial strain, time commitment, stress, and risks associated with litigation might deter individuals from going to court. Therefore, these substantial expenses can represent a major obstacle that prevents someone from engaging in legal disputes."},{"prompt":"Title: Not firm enough nor durable Review: Although this body briefer IS soft and comfortable, it does NOT provide the \\"firm control\\" it claims.

Information: - The Wars of Scottish Independence were a series of military campaigns fought between the Kingdom of Scotland and the Kingdom of England in the late 13th and early 14th centuries. - The Duke of Roxburghe (pronounced ) is a title in the peerage of Scotland created in 1707 along with the titles \\"Marquess of Bowmont and Cessford\\", \\"Earl of Kelso\\" and \\"Viscount Broxmouth\\". John Ker, 5th Earl of Roxburghe became the first holder of these titles. The title is derived from the royal burgh of Roxburgh in the Scottish Borders, which was captured and destroyed by the Scots in 1460. - The Battle of Renfrew in 1164 was a significant engagement near Renfrew, Scotland. The army of King Malcolm IV of Scotland (Malcolm the Maiden) led by Walter fitz Alan was attacked by forces led by Somerled mac Gillebride (Somerled), the Norse-Gaelic King of Mann and the Isles, Lord of Argyll, Cinn Tìre (Kintyre) and Lorne. Somerled was killed and his forces were defeated. - Sir James Douglas (also known as Good Sir James and the Black Douglas) (c. 1286 1330) was a Scottish knight and feudal lord. He was one of the chief commanders during the Wars of Scottish Independence. - Floors Castle, in Roxburghshire, south-east Scotland, is the seat of the Duke of Roxburghe. Despite its name it is a country house rather than a fortress. It was built in the 1720s by the architect William Adam for Duke John, possibly incorporating an earlier tower house. In the 19th century it was embellished with turrets and battlements by William Playfair for Duke James. Floors has the common 18th-century layout of a main block with two symmetrical service wings. Floors Castle lies on the River Tweed and overlooks the Cheviot Hills. - The First War of Scottish Independence was the initial chapter of engagements in a series of warring periods between English and Scottish forces lasting from the invasion by England in 1296 until the \\"de jure\\" restoration of Scottish independence with the Treaty of Edinburgh-Northampton in 1328. \\"De facto\\" independence was established in 1314 at the Battle of Bannockburn. England attempted to establish its authority over Scotland while the Scots fought to keep English rule and authority out of Scotland. - Bathgate is a town in West Lothian, Scotland, on the M8 motorway west of Livingston. Nearby towns are Armadale, Blackburn, Linlithgow, Livingston, West Calder and Whitburn. Situated south of the ancient Neolithic burial site at Cairnpapple Hill, Bathgate and the surrounding area show signs of habitation since about 3500 BC. - Tiree is the most westerly island in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. The low-lying island, southwest of Coll, has an area of and a population of around 650. The land is highly fertile, and crofting, alongside tourism, and fishing are the main sources of employment for the islanders. Tiree, along with Colonsay, enjoys a relatively high number of total hours of sunshine during the late spring and early summer compared to the average for the United Kingdom. Tiree is a popular windsurfing venue and is a proposed location for an offshore wind farm. Tiree is sometimes referred to as \\"Hawaii of the north\\" - The Battle of Bannockburn (\\"Blàr Allt nam Bànag\\", often mistakenly called \\"Blàr Allt a' Bhonnaich\\" in Scottish Gaelic) (24 June 1314) was a significant Scottish victory in the First War of Scottish Independence, and a landmark in Scottish history. - De jure (adjective, adverb) (; Classical Latin: de iure ; (lit. 'concerning law') means 'a state of affairs that is in accordance with law', i.e. that is officially designated. In contrast, \\"de facto\\" (lit. 'concerning fact'), means 'a state of affairs that is true in fact, but that is not officially designated'. In law, and in government, the terms \\"de jure\\" and \\"de facto\\" are used instead of 'in law' and 'in practice', respectively. In a legal context, \\"de jure\\" (laws) are contrasted to \\"de facto\\" practices, where, for example, the people obey a contract as though there were a law enforcing it, yet there is no such law. A process known as 'desuetude' may allow \\"de facto\\" practices to replace \\"de jure\\" laws that have fallen out of favour locally. - Robert II (2 March 1316 19 April 1390) reigned as King of Scots from 1371 to his death as the first monarch of the House of Stewart. He was the son of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland and of Marjorie Bruce, daughter of Robert the Bruce and of his first wife Isabella of Mar. - A royal burgh was a type of Scottish burgh which had been founded by, or subsequently granted, a royal charter.

The Clan MacDougall takes its name from Dougall, the son of Somerled who was killed at the Battle of Renfrew in 1164. After Somerled's death, Dougall held most of Argyll as well as the islands of Mull, Lismore, Jura, Tiree, Coll and others. - Roxburgh , also known as \\"Rosbroch\\", is a civil parish and now-destroyed royal burgh, in its eponymous historic county of Roxburghshire in the Scottish Borders. It was an important trading burgh in High Medieval to early modern Scotland. In the Middle Ages it had at least as much importance as Edinburgh, Stirling, Perth, or Berwick-upon-Tweed, for a time acting as \\"de facto\\" capital (as royal residence of David I). - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - Somerled (died 1164), known in Middle Irish as Somairle, Somhairle, and Somhairlidh, and in Old Norse as Sumarliði, was a mid-12th-century warlord who, through marital alliance and military conquest, rose in prominence and seized control of the Kingdom of the Isles. Little is certain of Somerled's origins, although he appears to have belonged to a NorseGaelic family of some substance. His father, GilleBride, appears to have conducted a marriage alliance with Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair, son of Alexander I of Scotland, and claimant to the Scottish throne. Following a period of dependence upon David I of Scotland, Somerled first appears on record in 1153, when he supported kinsmen, identified as the sons of Malcolm, in their insurgence against the newly enthroned Malcolm IV of Scotland. Following this unsuccessful uprising, Somerled appears to have turned his sights upon the kingship of the Isles, then ruled by his brother-in-law, Godred Olafsson. Taking advantage of the latter's faltering authority, Somerled participated in a violent coup d'état, and seized half of the kingdom in 1156. Two years later, he defeated and drove Godred from power, and Somerled ruled the entire kingdom until his death. - Walter Stewart (c. 1296 9 April 1327 at Bathgate Castle) was the 6th hereditary High Steward of Scotland. He was also the father of King Robert II of Scotland. - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides. - Edinburgh is the capital city of Scotland and one of its 32 local government council areas. Located in Lothian on the Firth of Forth's southern shore, it is Scotland's second most populous city and the seventh most populous in the United Kingdom. The 2014 official population estimates are 464,990 for the city of Edinburgh, 492,680 for the local authority area, and 1,339,380 for the city region as of 2014 (Edinburgh lies at the heart of the proposed Edinburgh and South East Scotland city region). Recognised as the capital of Scotland since at least the 15th century, Edinburgh is home to the Scottish Parliament and the seat of the monarchy in Scotland. The city is also the annual venue of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland and home to national institutions such as the National Museum of Scotland, the National Library of Scotland and the Scottish National Gallery. It is the largest financial centre in the UK after London. - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - Coll is an island located west of Mull in the Inner Hebrides of Scotland. Coll is known for its sandy beaches, which rise to form large sand dunes, for its corncrakes, and for Breacachadh Castle. It is in the council area of Argyll and Bute. - Lord is an appellation for a person or deity who has authority, control, or power over others acting like a master, a chief, or a ruler. The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the peerage in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to courtesy titles. The collective \\"Lords\\" can refer to a group or body of peers. - A Scottish clan (from Gaelic \\"\\", \\"children\\") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing. - The title of High Steward or Great Steward was given in the 12th century to Walter Fitzalan, whose descendants became the House of Stewart. In 1371, the last High Steward inherited the throne, and thereafter the title of High Steward of Scotland has been held as a subsidiary title to that of Baron of Renfrew & Duke of Rothesay, held by the heir-apparent. Thus, currently, The Prince of Wales is High Steward of Scotland, sometimes known as the Prince and Great Steward of Scotland. - Argyll, archaically Argyle (\\"Earra-Ghàidheal\\" in modern Gaelic ), is an ancient shire of western Scotland. Its area corresponds with most of the modern council area of Argyll and Bute, excluding the island of Bute and the Helensburgh area, but including the Morvern and Ardnamurchan areas of the Highland council area. At present, Argyll (sometimes anglicised as Argyllshire) is one of the registration counties of Scotland. - De facto is a Latin expression that means \\"in fact, in reality, in actual existence, force, or possession, as a matter of fact\\" (literally \\"of fact\\"). In law, it often means \\"in practice but not necessarily ordained by law\\" or \\"in practice or actuality, but not officially designated or established\\". It is commonly used in contrast to \\"\\" (which means \\"according to law\\"; literally \\"from law\\"), when referring to matters of law, governance, or technique (such as standards) that are found in the common experience as created or developed without or contrary to a regulation. When discussing a legal situation, \\"de jure\\" designates what the law says, while \\"de facto\\" designates what happens in practice. - The Siege of Roxburgh was a siege that took place in 1313 . It was a major conflict in the First War of Scottish Independence . Sir James Douglas , Lord of Douglas , after his victory over the Clan MacDougall had been capturing several castles back from the English , but the mere thought of taking Roxburgh Castle was one that daunted him . It was on impregnable ground , and was guarded well . He and Walter Stewart , 6th High Steward of Scotland disguised their few men as cows , so the garrison was unaware of their presence . Then they used ladders to climb to the top . Then they took the castle by total surprise . They inflicted heavy casualties on the garrison , including wounding their leader in the face with an arrow . This siege was a prelude to the Battle of Bannockburn . The Lanercost Chronicle records that \`\` all that beautiful castle the Scots pulled down to the ground , like the other castles that they had succeeded in capturing , lest the English should ever again rule the land by holding the castles . '' - Roxburgh Castle is a ruined royal castle that overlooks the junction of the rivers Tweed and Teviot, in the Borders region of Scotland. Its castleton developed into the royal burgh of Roxburgh, which the Scots destroyed along with the castle after capturing it in 1460.

Answer the above question based on the context below: By October 9, Cos had taken over San Antonio de Béxar. Stephen F. Austin sent an advance scout troop of 90 men under James Bowie and James Fannin to observe the Mexican forces. While taking refuge at Mission Concepción on October 28, they repelled an attack by 275 Mexicans under Domingo Ugartechea during the battle. Austin continued to send troops to Béxar. Bowie was ordered on November 26 to attack a Mexican supply train alleged to be carrying a payroll. The resulting skirmish became known as the Grass Fight, after it was discovered that the only cargo was grass to feed the horses. When Austin was selected to join Branch T. Archer and William H. Wharton on a diplomatic mission to seek international recognition and support, Edward Burleson was named as commander. On December 5, James C. Neill began distracting Cos by firing artillery directly at the Alamo, while Benjamin Milam and Frank W. Johnson led several hundred volunteers in a surprise attack. The fighting at the Siege of Béxar continued until December 9 when Cos sent word he wanted to surrender. Cos and his men were sent back to Mexico, but would later unite with Santa Anna's forces.Approximately 300 of the Texian garrison at Béxar departed on December 30 to join Frank W. Johnson and James Grant on the Matamoros Expedition, in a planned attack to seize the port for its financial resources. Proponents of this campaign were hoping Mexican Federalists would oust Santa Anna and restore the 1824 constitution. When Sesma crossed the Rio Grande, residents of the Gulf Coast began fleeing the area in January 1836. Santa Anna ordered General José de Urrea on February 16 to secure the Gulf Coast. About 160 miles (260 km) north of Matamoros at San Patricio, Urrea's troops ambushed Johnson and members of the expedition on February 27 at the Battle of San Patricio. Sixteen Texians were killed, six escaped, and 21 were taken prisoner. Urrea's troops then turned southwest by some 26 miles (42 km) to Agua Dulce Creek and on March 2 attacked a group of the expedition...

Available choices: +Megan liked the safety harness for the child and felt more secure.. +Katrina liked the safety harness for the child and felt more secure..","completion":"Megan liked the safety harness for the child and felt more secure. As Megan had anticipated, the day at the mall was hectic. There were people everywhere, rushing from store to store, all trying to grab the latest deals and discounts. Megan and Katrina were no exception. Their little child, Charlie, happily walked beside them as they scoured the mall for bargains. Megan was well aware of Katrina's tendency to panic in a crowded place, especially with their child in tow. She had heard Katrina mention stories of parents losing their children in crowded malls and the anxiety that came with it. So, in a bid to ensure that their shopping experience remained fun-filled and stress-free, Megan had decided to use a safety harness for little Charlie. Rather than seeing it as a superficial restraint, Megan and Katrina considered the safety harness as a practical measure. It helped them maintain their peace of mind while also allowing Charlie to have a sense of freedom. It was specifically designed for young children to ensure that they didn't feel constricted. As they walked from store to store, Megan held the rein that was attached to the safety harness. Charlie was free to roam, but he stayed close by, knowing that he was safe under the watchful eyes of his parent. On a few occasions, Charlie tried to dash towards the toy shops. Megans quick reflexes, aided by the safety harness, ensured that Charlie didn't stray too far and was protected from the stampede of shoppers. Katrina, who was initially reluctant to use the safety harness, began to appreciate its benefits as she noticed how secure it kept Charlie. She acknowledged Megan's foresight and expressed her gratitude for bringing along the harness. It had become abundantly clear how effective it was at mitigating the risk of losing Charlie in a bustling, crowded place like the mall. As the day wore on, the trio visited multiple stores and purchased clothes, electronics, and other items they had on their shopping list. The atmosphere remained lighthearted and focused more on the joy of spending time together as a family, rather than worrying about potential dangers. Towards the end of their shopping expedition, Megan, Katrina, and Charlie decided to take a break and grabbed a bite to eat at the food court. As they sat together, munching on their snacks, they exchanged stories and laughs about their day. Both Megan and Katrina expressed their relief and delight at how seamless and enjoyable the day had been, all thanks to the safety harness that had provided them with a sense of security. With full hearts and shopping bags, the family decided it was time to head back home. As they walked towards their car, Megan and Katrina felt a renewed sense of appreciation, not just for the safety harness, but for each other. They had successfully navigated a challenging day, and their teamwork had ensured that their family remained safe and happy. And as they loaded their purchases into the trunk before driving home, they knew that introducing the safety harness had not only reinforced the security and well-being of their little boy but had also helped strengthen the bond they shared as a family. Megan and Katrina knew that taking the time to plan and implement safety measures was integral to ensuring that every adventure together can be a positive one, filled with pleasant memories and moments of pure joy."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Can we infer the following? The first truly successful airship was built by a Brazilian.","completion":"Yes, based on the given information, it is accurate to infer that the first truly successful airship, the Santos-Dumont No. 6, was built by a Brazilian pioneer aviator, Alberto Santos-Dumont. Alberto Santos-Dumont was a highly influential figure in the early years of aviation. Born in Brazil in 1873, he moved to France to pursue his aspirations and interests in aeronautics. Santos-Dumont was especially fascinated by the idea of controlling flight through the use of lighter-than-air craft, such as balloons and airships. As a result, he started designing a series of airships during the late 19th century and early 20th century, with a primary focus on stability, maneuverability, and performance. The Santos-Dumont No. 6 was the culmination of these efforts, with performance and capabilities far beyond those of its predecessors. In making its historic flight on October 19, 1901, the airship was able to fly from Parc Saint Cloud to the Eiffel Tower, and then return, in a total flight time of just under 30 minutes. This flight demonstrated the airship's ability to provide a stable, reliable, and efficient form of air transportation, an impressive accomplishment given the constraints of the time. Santos-Dumont's success with the No. 6 helped to cement its status as the first truly successful airship and solidified the Brazilian's position as a leading innovator in the early history of aviation. His contributions laid the groundwork for future technological advancements in air travel, and his pioneering spirit inspired many other aviators and engineers to follow their ambitious dreams. In summary, as the Santos-Dumont No. 6 is considered the first truly successful airship and was designed and built by Alberto Santos-Dumont, it can be inferred that the first truly successful airship was built by a Brazilian."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, by 1944 his important businesses are needed by the Nazis and Hitler's 'Final Solution' is sweeping through Europe. The Nazis are greedy to accumulate wealth as easily as possible, and under the terms of the Third Reich's \\"Europa Plan\\", Krauzenberg arranges with Nazi leaders to exchange his fortune, his business holdings (textile plants, steel mills, ownership of several banks) and a collection of rare art for safe passage to Switzerland for himself, his wife Rachel, and their family.

The movie was to be shown here in Bangkok with all the fanfare and even in the theater, it failed miserably. Apparently the story writer just don't hold water. Something was definitely missing. In my opinion people must have a reason why they watch it other than historical glimpse of the past. Accuracy of history is not what we look for in entertainment. The movie just lack any substance. The only way to do this movie right was somehow make changes where it stands as some kind of a legend instead of just a story. And a legend will have certain elements that tries to tell you something that people have forgotten through time, such as the meaning of sacrifice, nationalism, etc. It is called the central theme. The movie fails to answer, why would I watch it anyway? At least some strange legendary Flying Elephants, psychic king, or the eccentric king such as \\"The King and I\\" would have been lovely, something would have added greatly to the movies' appeal. I guess there was no appeal other than a plain vanilla movie. Once you got the appeal, then the story is the next thing we concentrate on. In marketing terms, we call it \\"must see\\". Upon hearing the title of the movie people would say, Oh, I must see it. Now where's the appeal in Kingmaker? Why not just redo the title and call it, \\"How NOT to be a King?\\" and make a black comedy of the old Siamese days, to the style of \\"Dr. Strangelove\\". That would have been much more interesting. Narrative-like experiences of the foibles of the King from first persons goofs off would have made the movie extremely funny. Most movies today have that \\"must see\\" appeal, such as Spiderman, Men X, these titles speak for themselves. If they don't have familiar characters, some other movies such as, The Island, had an appeal itself when the advertising asks \\"Do you still believe there is an Island?\\".

Energy pyramids are discussed at http://www. youtube. com/watch?v=8T2nEMzk6_E (1:44). Q: What can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass or numbers within an ecosystem? A: Answer:","completion":"Ecological pyramids can demonstrate the decrease in energy, biomass, or numbers within an ecosystem. These pyramids are graphical representations that illustrate the distribution of energy, biomass, or the number of organisms at different trophic levels in an ecosystem. There are three main types of ecological pyramids: energy pyramids, biomass pyramids, and pyramid of numbers. An energy pyramid represents the flow of energy through an ecosystem, starting with primary producers (plants or photosynthetic organisms) at the base, followed by primary consumers (herbivores), secondary consumers (carnivores and omnivores), and tertiary consumers (top predators) at the higher trophic levels. The width of each bar in the pyramid represents the amount of energy available at each trophic level, which is typically expressed in units of energy per unit area or volume per unit time (e.g., kilocalories per square meter per year). As energy is transferred between trophic levels, roughly 90% of the energy is lost due to respiration, heat, and other metabolic processes, while only about 10% is stored in the organisms' tissues and becomes available to the next trophic level. Therefore, the energy pyramid shows a decrease in available energy as we move upward through the trophic levels. A biomass pyramid is similar to an energy pyramid but displays the amount of biological material (biomass) present in each trophic level. Biomass is the total mass of all living organisms in a given ecosystem, and it is usually measured in units of mass per unit area or volume (e.g., grams per square meter). Like energy pyramids, a decrease in biomass can be observed as we move from lower to higher trophic levels due to the inefficiency of energy transferred between levels. Since a smaller percentage of the biomass is available to higher trophic levels, fewer organisms can be supported, leading to a decline in overall numbers of species. The pyramid of numbers shows the number of individual organisms present at each trophic level of an ecosystem. This pyramid can vary in shape, depending on the specific ecosystem or habitat, but it generally demonstrates a decrease in the number of individual species as we move from primary producers to consumers and predators. This decrease in numbers can be attributed to the fact that higher trophic levels require more energy to be sustained, and there is less available energy and biomass higher up in the pyramid. In addition, species at higher trophic levels generally have larger body sizes and need to consume more resources to meet their energy demands. In conclusion, ecological pyramids, encompassing energy pyramids, biomass pyramids, and pyramid of numbers, are useful tools in visually representing and understanding the decrease in energy, biomass, or numbers within an ecosystem. These diagrams highlight the limited resources and inefficiencies of energy transfer among trophic levels, as well as the importance of maintaining balance within an ecosystem for its overall health and stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Review title: Cheap and good but utterly unreliable Product review: I've owned four pairs of these over the years. My cat chewed through the cord of the first one, and since they're so cheap I decided to buy another pair. In the second pair, the sound went dead in the left ear after a month or so. I figured maybe the cat had been at that one, too, although I couldn't see any bite marks, so like a fool I bought a third pair, a fourth for my girlfriend as well. These we were very careful to store away from any felines, and both had the same problem within a month.For the price, sure, these sound fine and are perfectly comfortable. But considering that in my (admittedly anecdotal) experience they have a 75% failure rate within the first month or two, well, how cheap does it have to be before having to buy a new pair every time they break catches up to you?

Justification: Directly impacting a step would mean that the poor planning would have physically interfered with any of the specific steps mentioned (e.g., building the dam, opening/closing floodgates, etc.). However, poor planning might cause issues such as improper design or infrastructure, inadequate resources, or inefficient communication systems, which affects the overall process of managing floodwaters, but not necessarily a specific step in the process. Indirectly impacting a step means that the poor planning has consequences that influence the process in a less direct way, causing it to potentially degrade the safety from flooding. For instance, poor planning could lead to insufficient capacity of the dam to hold the water, resulting in unplanned overflow and potential flooding. It also could cause improper scheduling or delay in opening/closing the floodgates, affecting overall safety without directly interacting with a specific step. Not impacting any step of the process would mean that the poor planning by city engineers does not affect the flood management process at all, which is unlikely if poor planning takes place since the process as a whole is meant to protect against flooding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is a news article: Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) are large expulsions of plasma and magnetic field from the Sun’s corona. They can eject billions of tons of coronal material and carry an embedded magnetic field (frozen in flux) that is stronger than the background solar wind interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength. CMEs travel outward from the Sun at speeds ranging from slower than 250 kilometers per second (km/s) to as fast as near 3000 km/s. The fastest Earth-directed CMEs can reach our planet in as little as 15-18 hours. Slower CMEs can take several days to arrive. They expand in size as they propagate away from the Sun and larger CMEs can reach a size comprising nearly a quarter of the space between Earth and the Sun by the time it reaches our planet. The more explosive CMEs generally begin when highly twisted magnetic field structures (flux ropes) contained in the Sun’s lower corona become too stressed and realign into a less tense configuration – a process called magnetic reconnection. This can result in the sudden release of electromagnetic energy in the form of a solar flare; which typically accompanies the explosive acceleration of plasma away from the Sun – the CME. These types of CMEs usually take place from areas of the Sun with localized fields of strong and stressed magnetic flux; such as active regions associated with sunspot groups. CMEs can also occur from locations where relatively cool and denser plasma is trapped and suspended by magnetic flux extending up to the inner corona - filaments and prominences. When these flux ropes reconfigure, the denser filament or prominence can collapse back to the solar surface and be quietly reabsorbed, or a CME may result. CMEs travelling faster than the background solar wind speed can generate a shock wave. These shock waves can accelerate charged particles ahead of them – causing increased radiation storm potential or intensity. Important CME parameters used in analysis are size, speed, and direction. These properties are inferred from orbital satellites’ coronagraph imagery by SWPC forecasters to determine any Earth-impact likelihood. The NASA Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (SOHO) carries a coronagraph – known as the Large Angle and Spectrometric Coronagraph (LASCO). This instrument has two ranges for optical imaging of the Sun’s corona: C2 (covers distance range of 1.5 to 6 solar radii) and C3 (range of 3 to 32 solar radii). The LASCO instrument is currently the primary means used by forecasters to analyze and categorize CMEs; however another coronagraph is on the NASA STEREO-A spacecraft as an additional source. Imminent CME arrival is first observed by the Deep Space Climate Observatory (DSCOVR) satellite, located at the L1 orbital area. Sudden increases in density, total interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) strength, and solar wind speed at the DSCOVR spacecraft indicate arrival of the CME-associated interplanetary shock ahead of the magnetic cloud. This can often provide 15 to 60 minutes advanced warning of shock arrival at Earth – and any possible sudden impulse or sudden storm commencement; as registered by Earth-based magnetometers. Important aspects of an arriving CME and its likelihood for causing more intense geomagnetic storming include the strength and direction of the IMF beginning with shock arrival, followed by arrival and passage of the plasma cloud and frozen-in-flux magnetic field. More intense levels of geomagnetic storming are favored when the CME enhanced IMF becomes more pronounced and prolonged in a south-directed orientation. Some CMEs show predominantly one direction of the magnetic field during its passage, while most exhibit changing field directions as the CME passes over Earth. Generally, CMEs that impact Earth’s magnetosphere will at some point have an IMF orientation that favors generation of geomagnetic storming. Geomagnetic storms are classified using a five-level NOAA Space Weather Scale. SWPC forecasters discuss analysis and geomagnetic storm potential of CMEs in the forecast discussion and predict levels of geomagnetic storming in the 3-day forecast. *Images courtesy of NASA and the SOHO and STEREO missions ||||| Focused crawls are collections of frequently-updated webcrawl data from narrow (as opposed to broad or wide) web crawls, often focused on a single domain or subdomain. ||||| Early this morning (Sept. 6), the sun released two powerful solar flares—the second was the most powerful in more than a decade. At 5:10 a.m. EDT (0910 GMT), an X-class solar flare—the most powerful sun-storm category—blasted from a large sunspot on the sun's surface. That flare was the strongest since 2015, at X2.2, but it was dwarfed just 3 hours later, at 8:02 a.m. EDT (1202 GMT), by an X9.3 flare, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's Space Weather Prediction Center (SWPC). The last X9 flare occurred in 2006 (coming in at X9.0). According to SWPC, the flares resulted in radio blackouts: high-frequency radio experienced a \\"wide area of blackouts, loss of contact for up to an hour over [the] sunlit side of Earth,\\" and low frequency communication, used in navigation, was degraded for an hour. [The Sun's Wrath: Worst Solar Storms in History] Solar flares occur when the sun's magnetic field—which creates the dark sunspots on the star's surface—twists up and reconnects, blasting energy outward and superheating the solar surface. X-class solar flares can cause radiation storms in Earth's upper atmosphere and trigger radio blackouts, as happened earlier this morning. During large solar flares, the sun can also sling a cloud of energetic plasma from its body, an event called a coronal mass ejection (CME). \\"It was accompanied by radio emissions that suggest there's a potential for a CME,\\" SWPC space scientist Rob Steenburgh told Space.com. \\"However, we have to wait until we get some coronagraph imagery that would capture that event for a definitive answer.\\" The sunspot responsible for this morning's flares, active region 2673, is the smaller of two massive spots on the sun's surface, at only seven Earths wide by nine Earths tall, according to astrophysicist Karl Battams. Yesterday, that same sunspot emitted an M-class solar flare—one-tenth the size of an X-class flare—leading to a coronal mass ejection aimed toward Earth that could cause auroras tonight as far south as Ohio and Indiana. The orbiting Solar and Heliospheric Observatory, a joint project between NASA and the European Space Agency, is currently out of contact with Earth because of its location, so observers will not be able to see any coronal mass ejections caused by this morning's flares until 10:30 p.m. EDT (1830 GMT), Battams wrote on Twitter. If aimed toward Earth, such an ejection could lead to even more spectacular auroras, but could also damage satellites, communications and power systems. That cloud of charged plasma would arrive within 1 to 3 or 4 days, Steenburgh said, although CMEs triggered by energetic flares generally come quickly. The surge of activity might seem surprising, as the sun is approaching its solar minimum, with the lowest levels of activity in its 11-year cycle. \\"We are heading toward solar minimum, but the interesting thing about that is you can still have events, they're just not as frequent,\\" Steenburgh said. \\"We're not having X-flares every day for a week, for instance—the activity is less frequent, but no less potentially strong.\\" \\"These kind of events are just part of living with a star,\\" Steenburgh added.

The flare, which peaked at 8.02am EDT, caused a radio blackout following the “shock arrival” of radiation from the sun. The solar flare was the largest recorded since September 2005, when an X17 was released. X-class represents the most intense solar flares, with an X2 being twice as intense as an X1. The largest solar flare ever recorded was an X20 in April 2001. The latest flare—an X9.3—was the second in a series of solar flares, with another smaller X2.2, recorded three hours earlier. Both were captured by NASA’s Solar Dynamics Observatory, which is constantly monitoring the sun and its activity. “Harmful radiation from a flare cannot pass through Earth's atmosphere to physically affect humans on the ground, however—when intense enough—they can disturb the atmosphere in the layer where GPS and communications signals travel,” the space agency said in a statement. The strong geomagnetic storm warning issued by NASA is, as of September 7, still in effect and will continue to be over the next few days. This is in anticipation of the arrival of the coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with the X9.3 flare. “Analysis indicates likely CME arrival late on 8 September into early 9 September,” NASA said. CMEs and solar flares are different phenomena but often occur at the same time when it comes to the strongest solar flares. Both are created when the sun’s interior contorts its own magnetic fields—as the magnetic field snaps like a rubber band it releases a huge amount of energy into space. The flash of light and high energy particles released is the solar flare, while the solar matter from the magnetic contortions are CMEs. A huge solar storm in 1859—known as the Carrington Event—caused telegraph systems across Europe and North America to fail and auroras associated with the solar winds could be seen as far south as the Caribbean. If a similar sized storm hit today, it is estimated it could cost around 2 trillion. NASA/Goddard/SDO The X.9 flare is the biggest to be recorded in the current solar cycle—an 11 year period where the sun’s activity increases and decreases. At the moment, we are headed towards a solar minimum. This is the phase where eruptions from the sun become increasingly rare. The next solar minimum is expected at some point between 2019 and 2020. But the last few solar cycle have been baffling scientists. Over the last solar minimum (in 2010), sunspots were almost completely absent for a period of two years—something that had not been recorded for almost 100 years. A recent study of the last 30 years’ worth of data on the solar cycle indicates that the magnetic field distribution, where a lot of the magnetic activity is recorded, had become thinner in recent years. Scientists also found rotation rate of the sun has changed. \\"This is not how it used to be and the rotation rate has slowed a bit at latitudes around about 60 degrees,” study author Yvonne Elsworth, from the University of Birmingham, U.K, said. “We are not quite sure what the consequences of this will be but it's clear that we are in unusual times.\\" ||||| A summary of this is?","completion":"The Sun has released its most powerful solar flare in over a decade, followed by a second, slightly less powerful flare three hours later. The flares disrupted high-frequency radio communications on Earth. Although solar flares do not directly affect humans on the ground, they can interfere with the Earth's upper atmosphere, having an effect on GPS and communication signals. The Sun's activity is approaching its solar minimum, where activity is at its lowest in its 11-year cycle, but powerful incidents can still occur at this stage.

The problems can be enumerated with a prim scowl and a wagging finger. The movie, in addition to being expectedly vulgar, is noisy and preposterous, and its humor flirts with racism, goes steady with misogyny and pretty much marries homophobia. There are guns, drugs, several references to sex acts involving urine, and gross insults — unless they are extravagant compliments; I’ll get back to you — to the respected profession of dentistry. So here is the evident puzzle: “Horrible Bosses” is also frequently very funny. One reason is that it does not bother to cut its coarseness with a hypocritical dose of sweetness or respectability. Nor, however, does it make a big show of being provocative, of pretending that its forays into offensiveness are acts of bravery. It takes the ordinary human traits of stupidity, selfishness, lust and greed (and also stupidity), embeds them in a human condition that is confusing, unfair and also stupid, and turns the whole sorry spectacle into a carnival. The laughter is mean but also oddly pure: it expels shame and leaves you feeling dizzy, a little embarrassed and also exhilarated, kind of like the cocaine that two of the main characters consume by accident. The scene of their hapless nose-candy binge exemplifies this movie’s spirit. On the one hand, the guys — Dale (Charlie Day) and Nick (Jason Bateman), along with their friend Kurt (Jason Sudeikis) — have broken into a house to do a little recon for one of three murders they plan to commit. This is a bad thing to do. On the other hand, there is something endearing about their utter hysterical ineptness, and their excursion into vice and criminality seems as innocent as it is desperate. The desperation allows “Horrible Bosses” to graze ever so lightly against some unpleasant social realities and to find a glimmer of class consciousness in an avalanche of crude gaggery. Dale, Nick and Kurt are all stuck in terrible jobs, at the mercy of employers whose power is absolute and arbitrary. “I own you,” says Mr. Harken, Nick’s smug, sadistic boss, played by — one guess! — Kevin Spacey with all the lethal smarm he brought to “Swimming With Sharks” and more. Sure, it’s an easy bit of casting, but so is Colin Farrell as a twitchy, amoral playboy and Jennifer Aniston as a sexy dentist. I mean a sexually predatory dentist, though the distinction is lost on Kurt, who thinks she’s hot. But he doesn’t work for her. Dale does, and her constant barrage of innuendo and solicitation — she’s as subtle as a plumber making a house call in a porn film — makes him uncomfortable. The sheer tastelessness of this situation is what makes it work, coupled with its almost surreal improbability. Dale, in addition to being a devoted almost-husband (his briefly glimpsed fiancée is played by Lindsay Sloane) is a ball of rodentlike, idiotic nervous energy. He’s the designated annoying-dimwit-friend, Zach Galifianakis shrunk down to Gilbert Gottfried size. As his pals, Mr. Bateman and Mr. Sudeikis do not exactly break ground. Mr. Bateman is uptight, anxious and asexual, firing darts of weary sarcasm with his eyes, while Mr. Sudeikis is a genial, excitable doofus who also happens to be catnip for the ladies. At least the two ladies with substantial speaking roles — Ms. Aniston and Julie Bowen, who should have more and better things to do. But to go further on this theme would ruin a few jokes, as well as leading me back toward the sour, complaining tone of the first paragraph. The sexual politics of “Horrible Bosses” are less obnoxiously retrograde than those of, oh, “The Hangover: Part II,” partly because of Ms. Aniston’s comic skill and partly because they are beside the point. To extent that there is a point, beyond sheer silliness — which is fine on its own, by the way — it has something to do with the unfairness of work at a time of high unemployment, when everything seems to be tilted in favor of those who already have power. Harken teases Nick with a phantom promotion, making a cruel game of his underling’s modest ambitions. Mr. Farrell’s feckless character, who inherits the company where Kurt works, is a monster of irresponsibility. Dale is subjected to escalating harassment and blackmail. These predicaments are as exaggerated as the bumbling homicidal response they inspire, but then again, in times like these, what are abused and humiliated workers going to do? Join a union? Go to court? That would be a different movie. This one is content to make a show of the kind of skills that are unlikely to get anyone very far in the workplace but that are nonetheless essential to the functions of farce. The verbal humor is more a matter of riffing than of delivering neatly defined jokes, but the timing of the cast — notably including Jamie Foxx, as well as the others already mentioned — is impeccable. And Mr. Gordon and the writers, Michael Markowitz, John Francis Daley and Jonathan Goldstein, allow the hilarity to build, escalate and swerve off course. You are in the hands of professionals, which means that, in the ways that count and even when it shouldn’t, “Horrible Bosses” works. “Horrible Bosses” is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian).

Ensemble developed many real-time strategy games, including the \\"Age of Empires\\" game series, \\"Age of Mythology\\", and \\"Halo Wars\\". In addition to game development, Ensemble Studios also made the Genie Game Engine used in \\"Age of Empires\\", \\"\\", and \\"\\". The studio sold 20 million games and was worth an estimated 500 million. - JoWooD Entertainment AG (formerly JoWooD Productions Software AG, commonly referred to as JoWooD) was an Austrian video game publisher that was founded in 1995. JoWooD went into administration and all assets were purchased by Nordic Games. - An expansion pack, expansion set, supplement, or simply expansion is an addition to an existing role-playing game, tabletop game or video game. These add-ons usually add new game areas, weapons, objects, characters and/or an extended storyline to complete an already released game. While board game expansions are typically designed by the original creator, video game developers sometimes contract out development of the expansion pack to a third-party company, (see \\"\\" for \\"Diablo\\"), it may choose to develop the expansion itself or it may do both (Ensemble Studios developed the real-time strategy game Age of Empires III and the first expansion called itself, but contracted Big Huge Games for the second expansion pack, the Asian Dynasties). Board games and tabletop RPGs may have been marketing expansions since the 1970s, and video games have been releasing expansion packs since the 1980s, early examples being the \\"Dragon Slayer\\" games \\"\\" and \\"Sorcerian\\". - Gothic II : Night of the Raven ( German : Die Nacht Des Raben ) , often abbreviated as NotR , is the official expansion pack of the German role - playing video game Gothic II. The expansion focuses on further enlarging the story already presented in the original Gothic II game , by adding a new world called Jharkendar , new attributes , items , and weapons . Upon its first release in 2003 the game was available in the German language only , the English version only being released in 2005 , as part of the Gothic II Gold package . - Big Huge Games is a video game developer located in Timonium, Maryland. The company was founded in February 2000 by four veteran game industry developers: Tim Train, David Inscore, Jason Coleman and Brian Reynolds (lead designer of \\"Alpha Centauri\\", et al.). Their first game, \\"Rise of Nations\\", was a critical and commercial hit. The original studio became defunct in May 2012, but the name \\"Big Huge Games\\" was later reacquired by Reynolds and Train for their new venture (previously known as SecretNewCo). The revived studio released the mobile game \\"DomiNations\\" on Android and iOS in April 2015. - In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Forever\\" for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In , Falcom released \\"Sorcerian Original\\", a remake of Sorcerian for Microsoft Windows-based PCs. In addition, console versions of Sorcerian with somewhat differing content from their PC counterparts were developed: A version for the Mega Drive was developed by Sega, a version for the PC Engine CD was developed by Victor Musical Industries, and a version for the Dreamcast was developed by Victor Interactive Software. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - A role-playing video game (commonly referred to as role-playing game or RPG, and in the past was also known as computer role-playing game or CRPG) is a video game genre where the player controls the actions of a character (and/or several party members) immersed in some well-defined world. Many role-playing video games have origins in pen-and-paper role-playing games (Including \\"Dungeons & Dragons\\") and use much of the same , settings and game mechanics. Other major similarities with pen-and-paper games include developed story-telling and narrative elements, player character development, complexity, as well as replayability and immersion. The electronic medium removes the necessity for a gamemaster and increases combat resolution speed. RPGs have evolved from simple text-based console-window games into visually rich 3D experiences. Since the 1980s, Role-playing is the most commercially viable video game genre in Japan, and has more market share of any other genre in the japanese gaming industry, although in the 2010s first-person shooters and western iOS and Android games were becoming rapidly and increasingly popular in that country. - Gothic II is a role-playing video game and the sequel to \\"Gothic\\", by the German developer Piranha Bytes.

(CNN) -- TIME magazine's cover story, which hit the newsstand Thursday, argues that Latino voters will cast the deciding vote in the upcoming election. After watching the Republican candidates lock the kryptonite that is the immigration issue around their necks during the Arizona debate, my bet is that President Barack Obama could win another term -- even if he loses key swing states such as Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and Wisconsin -- but he must make sure he accomplishes one thing first: Connect with Latinos. Republicans have not connected with Hispanics; the candidates' approaches to immigration are not compelling and lack substance, from talk of double 30-foot electrified fences to anchor babies and self-deportation. In fact, it could very well be that the 20 Arizona Latino voters on the cover of TIME and half a million more will turn out to vote in Arizona and flip the state to Obama. The refusal of all the GOP candidates to really look at immigration and offer a plan -- despite the glad-handing and tepid avowals of commitment -- makes it clear that the GOP just doesn't have the deep connection with OPTIONS: - Arizona necessary to pull off a win in November. - Arizona Latino necessary to pull off a win in November. - Barack Obama necessary to pull off a win in November. - CNN necessary to pull off a win in November. - Charles Garcia necessary to pull off a win in November. - Florida necessary to pull off a win in November. - Garcia necessary to pull off a win in November. - Hispanics necessary to pull off a win in November. - Iowa necessary to pull off a win in November. - Latino necessary to pull off a win in November. - Latinos necessary to pull off a win in November. - New Hampshire necessary to pull off a win in November. - Obama necessary to pull off a win in November. - Ohio necessary to pull off a win in November. - Pennsylvania necessary to pull off a win in November. - Republican necessary to pull off a win in November. - Republicans necessary to pull off a win in November. - TIME necessary to pull off a win in November. - TIME magazine necessary to pull off a win in November. - Virginia necessary to pull off a win in November. - Wisconsin necessary to pull off a win in November.","completion":"The appropriate choice for the next sentence in this context would be: - \\"Hispanics necessary to pull off a win in November.\\" The context of the paragraph primarily centers around the important role of Latino voters in the upcoming election, and the critique of GOP candidates' efforts to resonate with this demographic.

Bob Ewell and Mr. Radley represent a form of masculinity that Atticus does not, and the novel suggests that such men as well as the traditionally feminine hypocrites at the Missionary Society can lead society astray.

It was an alliance between Country Club Episcopalians and twice born followers of the Old Time Gospel, all firmly opposed to mass Catholic immigration from Europe.

But this year's GOP front-runners are a Mormon and two Catholics -- Rick Santorum (a cradle of Italian descent) and Newt Gingrich (a convert). Roughly one-quarter of Republican primary voters are Catholic. Notable Catholic GOP leaders include John Boehner, Paul Ryan, Christine O'Donnell, Marco Rubio and Jeb Bush.

There are several indicators in the text that point towards this conclusion. First, mentioning rain and storms suggests that the area has been affected by heavy precipitation, which could lead to flooding or be the consequence of a hurricane. Additionally, the need to turn on the air conditioning after not having power to make the home comfortable implies that it might have been flooded or exposed to heavy moisture, causing humidity inside the house. Furthermore, the mention of pulling up carpets and cleaning fallen insulation also points towards the possibility of a natural disaster like a hurricane or flood damaging the house. When a hurricane or flood affects a home, the walls, floors, carpets, and insulation are often damaged by water and wind, necessitating repairs and replacements. The other options provided do not align with the given information as well as the flood or hurricane scenario. Option (B) about vandalism does not correspond with the mention of rain, storms, and the need to clean up insulation. Option (C) about the home being new and waiting to move in does not match with turning on the AC and dealing with carpets and fallen insulation, both of which indicate the presence of damage. Finally, option (D) is not suitable since there are clear issues linked to weather and home damage described in the text.

It is home to the Caucasus Mountains, which contain Europe's highest mountain, Mount Elbrus, , located on the west of the Greater Caucasus mountain range. The Greater Caucasus acts as a natural barrier separating Europe from Southwest Asia, the latter including the Transcaucasus and Anatolia regions. The Caucasus region is separated between northern and southern partsthe North Caucasus and Transcaucasus, respectively.

Write some highlights for the following article: By. Becky Evans. PUBLISHED:. 11:32 EST, 10 April 2013. |. UPDATED:. 14:30 EST, 10 April 2013. A midwife has apologised today for telling an Indian woman who was suffering a miscarriage that she could not have a termination in Ireland because it was a 'Catholic thing'. Ann Maria Burke admitted she made the remark to Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway but insisted she meant it in kindness. The patient later died of septicemia. The senior midwife said she used the reference to Catholic teaching after the 31-year-old dentist said she was Hindu and she would have ended her pregnancy in her home country. Midwife Ann Maria Burke, pictured outside Galway Coroners court, apologised for telling Savita Halappanavar she could not have a termination because it was a 'Catholic thing' Savita Halappanavar died of a heart attack caused by septicaemia after being refused an abortion and delivering a dead baby. 'I did mention it’s a Catholic country,' Ms Burke told Galway coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin. 'I didn’t mention it in a hurtful context. It was in a conversation we had.' Ms Burke said she regrets making the statement, which the coroner said 'went around the world'. 'I’m sorry that I said it,' she added. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was admitted to hospital on Sunday, October 21 and delivered a dead baby daughter three days later. She died the following Sunday of a heart attack caused by septicaemia due to E.coli. The inquest, in its third day at Galway courthouse, has heard claims that a consultant obstetrician, Dr Katherine Astbury, made the remark to Mrs Halappanavar and her husband Praveen, and also that the midwife said it. Dr Astbury, who was cross-examined over her treatment of Mrs Halappanavar for several hours today, denies using the phrase. But the consultant has admitted there were system failures in her care and she also warned of a lack of legal clarity for doctors treating pregnant women who suffer health risks. Mrs Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital in pain. Asked by Mr Gleeson if it would have been. insensitive, uncivilised and wrong to use the word Catholic to the. patient, Dr Astbury said: 'It’s certainly not something I would say.' Dr Astbury revealed there is confusion over how her patient was cared for, including that she had been unaware of blood test abnormalities and that the patient’s vitals should have been checked more regularly after her foetal membrane ruptured. The senior medic was asked by coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin if the two aspects of Mrs Halappanavar’s care could be seen as system failures and she replied 'yes'. Dr Astbury revealed that she initially refused a request from the Halappanavars to terminate the pregnancy two days after her admission to hospital as at that time there was no risk to her life. Praveen Halappanavar, pictured arriving at the inquest, collapsed and vomited after his wife's death. 'She was well,' said Dr Astbury under cross-examination. 'There was no risk to her life. If you need to give somebody medication to deliver and there’s a foetal heartbeat, my understanding is that legally you are considered to be terminating.' Dr Astbury spoke in a loud, clear voice as widower Praveen Halappanavar, who claims she made the Catholic remark, sat with his friend, a Galway-based consultant Dr CVR Prasad. She addressed the Irish Medical Council guidelines on abortion which refer to terminating a pregnancy if there is a risk to the mother’s life. She said her understanding was that they relate to conditions such as cancer, such as women getting radiotherapy, cervical care or a hysterectomy. 'My understanding is that this is a case where a woman is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, usually unrelated to the pregnancy,' she said. Dr MacLoughlin asked if there was confusion over the interpretation of the guidelines. 'There’s no law to tell you what you what is permitted or not permitted,' she replied. Dr Astbury admitted there were system failures in her care at Galway University Hospital (pictured) Savita Halappanavar and Praveen Halappanavar at an event for the Indian community in Galway. Dr Astbury insisted that when she told. Mrs Halappanavar she could not abort the baby on the Tuesday, she used. the words: 'In this country it is not legal to terminate a pregnancy on. grounds of poor prognosis of the foetus.' The. doctor agreed that in other jurisdictions Mrs Halappanavar would have. been offered the option of a termination if the prognosis of her foetus. was poor. 'The law in Ireland does not permit termination even if there’s no prospect of viability,' she said. Dr Astbury saw Mrs Halappanavar at. 8.30am on the Wednesday during her morning round, about two hours after a. junior colleague raised concerns over her vitals and condition and. suspected sepsis chorioamnionitis, an infection of the foetal membrane. She. said the patient’s temperature and pulse rate had fallen in that time. and that she had not been told of an earlier entry on the medical notes. highlighting a sign of chorioamnionitis. Dr. Astbury said that had she known this she would then have started the. steps for a termination, instead of ordering tests to check for a urine. infection. 'A medical termination usually takes several hours, but I would have started it,' she said. Highlights:","completion":"1.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the song that is considered Lennon's best known solo work?, using the article: Lennon played a mouth organ during a bus journey to visit his cousin in Scotland; the music caught the driver's ear. Impressed, the driver told Lennon that he could have a harmonica if he came to Edinburgh the following day; the harmonica had been stored in the Edinburgh bus depot after a passenger had inadvertently left it on a bus. The professional instrument quickly replaced Lennon's toy. He would continue to play the harmonica, often using the instrument during the Beatles' Hamburg years, and it became a signature sound in the group's early recordings.

At 16, he played rhythm guitar with the Quarrymen.As his career progressed, he played a variety of electric guitars, predominantly the Rickenbacker 325, Epiphone Casino and Gibson J-160E, and, from the start of his solo career, the Gibson Les Paul Junior. Double Fantasy producer Jack Douglas claimed that since his Beatle days Lennon habitually tuned his D-string slightly flat, so his Aunt Mimi could tell which guitar was his on recordings.

Man on Fire is a 2004 British-American crime thriller film directed by Tony Scott from a screenplay by Brian Helgeland, and based on the 1980 novel of the same name by A.J. Quinnell. The novel had previously been adapted into a feature film in 1987. In this film, Denzel Washington portrays John Creasy, a despondent, alcoholic former Special Activities Division operative/U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance officer-turned bodyguard, who goes on a revenge rampage after his charge, nine-year-old Lupita \`\`Pita'' Ramos (Dakota Fanning), is abducted in Mexico City. The supporting cast includes Christopher Walken, Radha Mitchell, Giancarlo Giannini, Marc Anthony, Rachel Ticotin and Mickey Rourke. Based on the above text, what's the best answer to this question: was the movie man on fire a true story?","completion":"To determine whether the movie \\"Man on Fire\\" is a true story, I need to analyze the given information and focus on the source of the story. Step 1: Identify the basis of the movie. The text states that the movie is based on a 1980 novel of the same name by A.J. Quinnell. This indicates that the film has a literary source. Step 2: Consider the mentioned genre. The movie is described as a \\"crime thriller,\\" which suggests a fictional narrative rather than a factual account. Step 3: Analyze the plot and characters. The plot involves a former Special Activities Division operative/U.S. Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance officer-turned bodyguard seeking revenge after a nine-year-old girl is abducted. Although it's not impossible for such events to occur in real life, the plot and characters seem more like the product of a fictional narrative than a true story. Based on these steps, the best answer to the question is that the movie \\"Man on Fire\\" is not a true story, but rather a fictional narrative based on a novel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To find the missing angle of a triangle using the cosine rule, you need to know the length of all three sides of the triangle. For example, you might have triangle RST. Side SR is 8 cm long. Side ST is 10 cm long. Side RT is 12 cm long. What is the measurement of angle S? The formula is c2=a2+b2−2abcos⁡C{displaystyle c^{2}=a^{2}+b^{2}-2abcos {C}}. In this formula, cos⁡C{displaystyle cos {C}} equals the cosine of the angle you are trying to find. The variable c{displaystyle c} equals the side opposite the missing angle. The variables a{displaystyle a} and b{displaystyle b} are the lengths of the other two sides. Plug these values into the formula. For example, since side RT is opposite the missing angle, angle S, side RT will equal c{displaystyle c} in the formula. The other two side lengths will be a{displaystyle a} and b{displaystyle b}. It doesn’t matter which side is which variable. So, your formula should look like this: 122=82+102−2(8)(10)cos⁡C{displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-2(8)(10)cos {C}}. You are multiplying 2ab{displaystyle 2ab} times the cosine of the missing angle, which you don’t know yet. So, the variable should remain. For example, 122=82+102−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 12^{2}=8^{2}+10^{2}-160cos {C}}. Remember that to square a number, you multiply the number by itself. For example, 144=82+102−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=8^{2}+10^{2}-160cos {C}} Make sure you square each number first, and then add them together. For example:144=64+100−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=64+100-160cos {C}}144=164−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144=164-160cos {C}} To do this, subtract the sum of a2{displaystyle a^{2}} and b2{displaystyle b^{2}} from both sides of the equation. Then, divide each side of the equation by the coefficient of the missing angle’s cosine. For example, to isolate the cosine of the missing angle, subtract 164 from both sides of the equation, then divide each side by -160:144−164=164−164−160cos⁡C{displaystyle 144-164=164-164-160cos {C}}−20=−160cos⁡C{displaystyle -20=-160cos {C}}−20−160=−160cos⁡C−160{displaystyle {frac {-20}{-160}}={frac {-160cos {C}}{-160}}}0.125=cos⁡C{displaystyle 0.125=cos {C}} This will give you the measurement of the missing angle. On a calculator, the inverse cosine key is denoted by COS−1{displaystyle COS^{-1}}. For example, the inverse cosine of .0125 is 82.8192. So, the missing angle, angle S, is 82.8192 degrees. Summary:","completion":"Using the cosine rule formula, the missing angle (S) of a triangle with sides SR (8 cm), ST (10 cm), and RT (12 cm) can be found, resulting in an angle measurement of 82.8192 degrees."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. Choose your answer: According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"How much are the year's returns projected to cover for the income in interest?\\" is \\"It will cover 750,000 and 1 million\\"?

It is a commonly used phrase in daily communication. 2. \\"We're just gonna have to win\\" can be translated to \\"Prostě budeme muset vyhrát.\\" In this phrase: - \\"We're\\" (a contraction of \\"we are\\") translates to \\"Budeme\\". \\"Budeme\\" is the future tense of the verb \\"být\\" (to be) for the first-person plural (we). - \\"Just gonna\\" is an informal way of saying \\"going to\\" or \\"simply have to\\". In Czech, this can be translated as \\"Prostě\\". \\"Prostě\\" is an adverb used to emphasize that something must be done or will happen, indicating a sense of inevitability. - \\"Have to\\" can be translated to \\"muset\\" in Czech, which is an auxiliary verb to express necessity or obligation. In the context of the phrase, it should be used in the infinitive form \\"muset\\". - \\"Win\\" can be translated to \\"vyhrát\\" in Czech. \\"Vyhrát\\" is the infinitive form of the verb, which means to win or achieve victory in a competition, game, or battle. So, the complete translation \\"Dobře. Prostě budeme muset vyhrát.\\" carries the same meaning as the original English phrase \\"All right.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides a brief connection between the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress and the earlier Declaration of Rights and Grievances, it lacks sufficient detail and context for a full understanding. Here is a more detailed and comprehensive answer to help in verifying the accuracy of the information provided: The Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress, also known as the \\"Declaration of Colonial Rights,\\" were a set of resolutions adopted by the First Continental Congress on October 14, 1774, in response to British colonial policies that had led to increasing tensions between the American colonies and Great Britain. The First Continental Congress was a gathering of 56 delegates from 12 of the 13 British colonies in North America (only Georgia was not represented) that took place from September 5 to October 26, 1774, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Much like the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier in 1765, the Declaration and Resolves aimed to articulate the colonists' rights and grievances with respect to the British government. However, the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress was a more comprehensive and detailed document compared to the earlier declaration. The Declaration and Resolves consisted of four main elements: 1. A preamble that asserted the colonists' loyalty to the British Crown and their commitment to defending their rights as Englishmen. 2. A declaration of the colonists' rights, which included the rights to life, liberty, property, and self-government. This section also asserted that the British Parliament had no authority to legislate for the American colonies, as they were not represented in that body. 3. A list of grievances detailing the ways in which the colonists believed their rights had been violated by British policies, such as the Intolerable Acts (the Coercive Acts and the Quebec Act), the imposition of taxes and duties without colonial consent, and restrictions on colonial trade and manufacturing. 4. A series of resolutions that called for a coordinated response from the colonies, including a boycott of British goods and an agreement not to export American products to Britain until their grievances were addressed. In conclusion, it is partially accurate to say that the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress were similar to the Declaration of Rights and Grievances passed by the Stamp Act Congress a decade earlier, as both documents expressed colonial opposition to British policies and sought to assert the rights of the colonies. However, the Declaration and Resolves of the First Continental Congress went further in detailing specific grievances and providing resolutions for a unified colonial response. This more comprehensive document represents a significant evolution in the development of American colonial thought and resistance to British rule."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Demand is identified and then satisfied through a supply chain. Attempts are made to increase demand through advertising. In the 2000s, an increasing amount of retailing began occurring online using electronic payment and delivery via a courier or via postal mail. Retailing as a sector includes subordinated services, such as delivery. The term \\"retailer\\" is also applied where a service provider services the small orders of a large number of individuals, rather than large orders of a small number of wholesale, corporate or government clientele. Shops may be on residential streets, streets with few or no houses, or in a shopping mall. Shopping streets may restrict traffic to pedestrians only. Sometimes a shopping street has a partial or full roof to create a more comfortable shopping environment protecting customers from various types of weather conditions such as extreme temperatures, winds or precipitation.

In this question, the key terms are \\"chief organ\\" and \\"urinary system.\\" Step 2: Recall the basic function of the urinary system. The urinary system's main function is to filter waste products and excess substances from the blood, maintain electrolyte balance, and produce urine as a way to excrete these waste products from the body. Step 3: Evaluate the choices based on their roles in the urinary system. - Liver: The liver plays a role in detoxifying the body, but it is not part of the urinary system. Therefore, the liver is not the right answer. - Bladder: The bladder is part of the urinary system and functions as a temporary storage unit for urine. However, it does not filter waste products from the blood, so it isn't the chief organ. - Lung: The lung is not part of the urinary system. Its primary function is to facilitate gas exchange for respiration. Therefore, it's not the right answer. - Kidney: The kidneys are the primary organs responsible for filtering waste products and excess substances from the blood.

Read this: In the immediate aftermath of World War II, there occurred several armed incidents between Yugoslavia and the Western Allies. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of Istria as well as the cities of Zadar and Rijeka. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate Trieste into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on US transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the west. From 1945 to 1948, at least four US aircraft were shot down.[better source needed] Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when US had operational nuclear weapons whereas USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the Greek Civil War, while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council.

King: Conservatives hit low by politicizing Paris attacks Last week, two college students in Missouri, Hunter Park and Connor Stottlemyre, were arrested for making death threats to black students and staff members at the University of Missouri. “I’m going to stand my ground tomorrow and shoot every black person I see,” read one sickening post. “Some of you are alright,” another ominous message stated. “Don’t go to campus tomorrow.” Yet another said, “Well tomorrow mizzou will really make national news.” Early reports are already revealing that Hunter Park expressed to police his “deep interest” in an earlier school shooting this year in Oregon. Paris is what the real enemies of diversity and freedom look like. It’s not your college presidents, students. THIS is hatred, oppression. Understandably, these threats, combined with the reality that students on campus have a long, documented history of facing racism, caused a sincere panic. The following day, the campus was a ghost town as students decided by the thousands to stay in their dorms or off campus housing. Over 319 days so far in 2015, the United States has had 325 mass shootings, so it’s not quite like students were imagining the possibility of a threat to their lives. Someone wanna tell the Mizzou students what happened in Paris? They could use a lesson in what real oppression and hatred is. Somehow, though, just minutes after the mass shootings in Paris, several popular conservatives decided to use the French tragedy, which was still an active hostage situation at the time, as a starting point to critique students at the University of Missouri. Steve Krakauer, a former producer for CNN and Glenn Beck, weighed in early on how Missouri students weren’t really facing real hatred and oppression, implying that ISIS, and not education officials, were the only true enemies of cultural diversity. \\"Paris is what the real enemies of diversity and freedom look like. It's not your college presidents, students,\\" Krakauer Tweeted Friday evening just minutes after the first first shots were fired. \\"THIS is hatred, oppression.\\" Four minutes later, as if they were reading from the same talking points, popular conservative conspiracy theorist Mark Dice waded in with the same sentiment. \\"Someone wanna tell the Mizzou students what happened in Paris?\\" wrote Dice. \\"They could use a lesson in what real oppression and hatred is.\\" What’s wild about how Steve Krakauer and Mark Dice handled this is that the shootings were still unfolding and a manhunt was still underway when they quickly began politicizing the terrorist attack for unrelated cultural commentary at home. Not only that, but the notion that students being called racial slurs to their faces and threatened to be shot on sight is not real hatred or oppression is about as outrageous and offensive as it gets. In essence their argument is either that oppression and hatred aren’t real unless you are killed or oppression and hatred aren’t real unless you are French. Obviously, both arguments are ignorant. Hunter Park and Connor Stottlemyre both fully intended to terrorize and induce panic among African Americans at the University of Missouri when they said what they said. When students on campus, including the student body president, have been called racial slurs on campus, if that wasn’t hatred, what was it? While it’s despicable that these conservatives are politicizing this tragedy, it’s equally sick that they are attempting to erase the very real pain and terror experienced by students in our own country. I’m not sure if Steve or Mark are parents, but I wonder if someone threatened to kill their children or if strangers called their kids horrific names to their faces, if they’d simply ignore it and move on. I doubt it.

We can do this by adding 17*r to both sides of the equation: (-17*r + 17*r) = (32*r + 17*r) - 931 0 = 49*r - 931 4. After that, we want to isolate the \\"r\\" term, so let's add 931 to both sides: 931 = 49*r 5.

Review: Election marks the 2nd trial society theme movie directed by Johnnie To. To marvellously casted Simon Yan and Tony Leung Kar Fai as Lok and Big D, as the two trial members who were chosen as candidates for the position of chairman for Ho Sing society, a 100 year old trial society. While Lok is a man who keeps his cool at all times, Big D is not only impatient, but also thinks that he is on top of everything. Lok was chosen as the next chairman for 2 years. To have the total control of the gang, the newly elected chairman must be passed down with a Dragon Baton, which represents power and authority. Big D was extremely unhappy with the results that he was not chosen to be the next chairman after paying a handsome figure of bribes to the council members. He ordered his man to get the Baton before it falls onto the hands of Lok. While Big D is getting the Baton, Lok has other plans for him. This is one of the trial society theme movies where not much bloodshed is needed. Johnnie To puts the greed of the human beings in the movie, where bloodshed is commonly used in other trial society theme movies to show how the greed of human beings can caused the death or the downfall of one. However, no single bullet is used, hardly any gangfights are involved in Election. It's the battle of the wits that makes Election stands out of the rest. Apart from Maggie Shiu, the only actress in Election with less than 5 lines to talk in the whole movie, masculinity rules the whole movie. Louis Koo and Nick Cheung, who was seen in To's previous film, are casted as an undercover cop and a gangster who sold his life to the gang respectively.

The friction will be greater between the sandpaper and the glass table or or the sandpaper and the gravel.? A:","completion":"Given the fact that rougher surfaces have more friction between them than smoother surfaces, the friction will be greater between the sandpaper and the gravel. The reason for this is that both the sandpaper and the gravel have rough surfaces with many small irregularities. When these irregularities are in contact with each other, they experience a higher resistance to motion due to the increased number of contact points between the surfaces. On the other hand, the glass table has a relatively smooth surface. When the sandpaper is rubbed across the glass table, there are fewer contact points between the surfaces, resulting in less friction compared to the sandpaper and gravel situation.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment. This may explain why they seem to be especially sensitive to pollution. Monitoring the health and survival of amphibians may help people detect pollution early, before other organisms are affected. Choices: - fish - mammals - reptiles - amphibians A: The answer is:","completion":"amphibians. The paragraph clearly states that amphibians have permeable skin that easily absorbs substances from the environment, making them particularly sensitive to pollution. This unique characteristic of their skin allows substances, including pollutants, to pass through it more easily than other groups of animals. As a result, amphibians serve as valuable bioindicators for environmental health, meaning that monitoring their well-being can help detect pollution early on before it impacts other organisms. In comparison, fish, mammals, and reptiles do not possess the same degree of permeability in their skin, which makes them less vulnerable to pollution than amphibians. Fish typically have scales that offer some protection against chemicals in the water, while mammals and reptiles have less permeable skin, which limits the absorption of environmental substances. Consequently, they do not serve as effective bioindicators for pollution as amphibians do. Amphibians, which include frogs, toads, salamanders, and newts, play a crucial role in helping humans understand the health of ecosystems. They occupy various habitats, such as forests, grasslands, wetlands, and even urban settings, and they form an important part of the food chain, being prey and predators to several species. As a consequence, their sensitivity to pollution can signal potential threats to biodiversity, ecosystem balance, and human health, making it essential for researchers and policy-makers to focus on preserving their populations and habitats. In conclusion, the answer to the question is amphibians. Their permeable skin makes them uniquely vulnerable to pollution, enabling them to serve as early warning systems for environmental contamination. By monitoring their health and survival, humans can better understand the state of ecosystems and work towards preserving our shared environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Watford Secure Signing of Rennes Midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure and Loan Him to Granada English Premier League side Watford FC have announced the signing of Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure for an undisclosed fee. Doucoure will not be joining the Hornets' squad immediately, as he has been loaned out to Spanish La Liga team Granada for the remainder of the season. Step 1: Research on Doucoure's background and career highlights The 27-year-old French midfielder started his professional career at Rennes in 2012 and has been instrumental in their midfield ever since. He has made over 100 appearances for the Ligue 1 side, contributing goals and assists throughout his tenure at the club. Step 2: Analyze the impact of the signing on Watford Doucoure's signing is a significant acquisition for Watford, highlighting their ambition to strengthen the squad and compete at the highest level in the English Premier League. The midfielder's strengths include his ability to control the pace of the game, accurate passing, and defensive awareness, which will undoubtedly benefit the team once he is integrated into the squad. Step 3: Discuss why Watford is loaning Doucoure to Granada The decision to loan Doucoure to Granada, which is part of Watford's affiliated clubs, appears to be a strategic move. This will allow the player to familiarize himself with the club's playing style and demonstrate his ability to adapt to new environments before ultimately joining Watford in the future. Step 4: Evaluate Granada's need for Doucoure and the benefits of the loan to both teams Granada, currently fighting for a stable position in La Liga, will undoubtedly benefit from Doucoure's presence, as he brings experience and skill to the midfield. Conversely, this loan spell will provide Doucoure the opportunity to gain valuable experience playing competitive football in one of Europe's top leagues, preparing him for his eventual arrival at Watford and his journey in the Premier League. Step 5: Predict Doucoure's future at Watford As the undisclosed fee indicates a considerable investment by Watford, the club will certainly have high expectations for Doucoure. His performances at Granada will likely be closely monitored, and both the fans and the management will be optimistic about the contributions he can make once he rejoins the team. In conclusion, Rennes midfielder Abdoulaye Doucoure's signing by Watford and his subsequent loan to Granada seem to present mutual benefits for both clubs, as well as the player. While Doucoure will not be playing in the English Premier League immediately, his time in La Liga will be a valuable learning experience, preparing him to make an impact for Watford upon his return."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review title: Nice seatpost binder bolt Product review: This is an awesome keyed Allan-headed seatpost binder bolt. It is well made and the chrome plating is bright and doesn't chip.Pros:* Very low price and high value.* Keyed notch fits into the keyed hole in your seatpost binder so that you only need one Allan key to loosen/tighten this binder.* Good chrome doesn't seem to chip or flake and is nice and bright without any serious flaws like some cheaper chrome-plated parts.* Somewhat more secure, but anyone with an Allen key wrench can still take your seat.* Strong and doesn't seem to strip or bend even when tightened very securely. You don't have to worry about stripping this bolt or bending/stretching it as long as you don't go berserk on this fastener.Cons:*Very limited usable size. Be sure to measure your seat binder lug to make sure this fits: 19mm to about 22mm is about all you can get this bolt to fit.*Not 100% secure or as safe as an specifically-keyed tamper-proof binder bolt.

The reviewer highlights several positive aspects of the seatpost binder bolt, such as its low price, high value, the convenience of needing only one Allen key, good quality chrome plating, and its strength without easily stripping or bending. The pros of the product seem to outweigh the cons, which are its limited usable size and not being 100% secure.

Given the question: This article: As an artist, Francis Bacon was a late starter. He painted sporadically and without commitment during the late 1920s and early 1930s, when he worked as an interior decorator and designer of furniture and rugs. He later admitted that his career was delayed because he had spent so long looking for a subject that would sustain his interest. He began to paint images based on the Crucifixion in 1933, when his then-patron Eric Hall commissioned a series of three paintings based on the subject. These abstract figurations contain formal elements typical of their time, including diaphanous forms, flat backgrounds, and surrealist props such as flowers and umbrellas. The art critic Wieland Schmied noted that while the early works are \\"aesthetically pleasing\\", they lack \\"a sense of urgency or inner necessity; they are beautiful, but lifeless\\". The sentiment is echoed by Hugh Davies, who wrote that Bacon's 1933 paintings \\"suggest an artist concentrating more on formal than on expressive concerns\\". Bacon admitted that his early works were not successful; they were merely decorative and lacking in substance. He was often harshly self-critical during this period, and would abandon or destroy canvasses before they were completed. He abandoned the Crucifixion theme, then largely withdrew from painting in frustration, instead immersing himself in love affairs, drinking and gambling.When he returned to the topic of the Crucifixion eleven years later, he retained some of the stylistic elements he had developed earlier, such as the elongated and dislocated organic forms that he now based on Oresteia. He continued to incorporate the spatial device he was to use many times throughout his career—three lines radiating from this central figure, which was first seen in Crucifixion, 1933. Three Studies was painted over the course of two weeks in 1944, when, Bacon recalled, \\"I was in a bad mood of drinking, and I did it under tremendous hangovers and drink; I sometimes hardly knew what I was doing.

This device can be first seen in his painting Crucifixion, 1933, and was employed by Bacon as a means of creating a sense of space, movement, and tension in his work.

What is the answer for the question: What does Mr. Lomax's reanimated corpse need to hear in order to move? from the following article ? Larry Wilson and Richard Parker are at a Manhattan morgue where they see their deceased CEO Bernie Lomax. Larry falsely claims Bernie as his uncle, so he can get some of Bernie's possessions including Bernie's credit card. At the insurance company, Larry and Richard are quizzed by their boss and Arthur Hummel, the company's internal investigator, who ask the two if they have the US2 million that Bernie embezzled. They deny knowing where the money is, but their boss believes they're lying and fires them. He also sends Hummel after them, giving him two weeks to prove their guilt. Over dinner (paid for with Bernie's credit card, in one of its many uses), Larry tells Richard he found a key to a safe deposit box in St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands and asks Richard if he will use the computer at work to see if the 2 million is in Bernie's account. At first Richard refuses but ultimately gives in. Meanwhile, in the Virgin Islands, a voodoo queen named Mobu is hired by mobsters to find the money Bernie stole. She sends two servants—Henry and Charles (Tom Wright)—to go to New York, get Bernie's body, use a voodoo ceremony to reanimate him, and bring him back to her so he can lead her to the money. Their attempts to bring Bernie back are plagued by accidents. They prepare in a bathroom at a sleazy porno theater for the voodoo ceremony, but having lost the sacrificial chicken, they use a pigeon instead.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: The word \\"slut\\" is a sexual slur used almost exclusively against women. It's a way to say that a girl or woman is a bad person because she has too much sex or too many sexual partners. Sometimes it is used in a bantering way between friends, and other times it is used to bully or put a woman down. Sometimes girls and women call each other \\"sluts\\" as a way to take back that word from its negative use, in an effort to make light of it and drain it of some of its power. It's a way for girls to take the shame out of enjoying their sexuality. There are many oppressed groups that have \\"reclaimed\\" words once used against them in this way. If you have friends who call you a slut, think about their intent: they may mean it in an endearing way. You can ask them to stop if it bothers you, and since they are your friends, they should understand and do their best to stop. If someone is using the word \\"slut\\" against you in a way that makes you feel belittled, hurt, or harassed, it doesn't matter what her intention is. She is bullying you. Although the term slut is usually associated with someone who has a lot of sex, or who expresses her sexuality in ways that other people don't approve of, in reality it is often used in other ways by girls themselves. One study of college women found that the word had very little to do with the target's sexual behaviors. Instead, in the study, higher social class women used the term against lower social class women as a way of saying that they didn't want to include them in their social group. That study found that white, middle-to upper-class college women used the word \\"slut\\" against poorer women and women of color most often, and that the bullies themselves often had more sexual experience than the targets. This might seem silly, especially if you're not a little kid and you think bullying belongs in elementary school. Actually, people of all ages can experience bullying, which really just means that a person is mean to another person over and over again. Calling names like \\"slut\\" is a very common form of girl-on-girl bullying. They may be calling you a slut because gossip has spread about your relationships or sexuality (possibly started by someone who wants to increase his own reputation as a \\"stud\\"), but this word and others like it (such as \\"whore,\\" \\"hoe,\\" or \\"skank\\") may simply be your bullies' way of humiliating you with little or nothing to do with your sexual behavior. Technology makes bullying easier than ever, so if you are active on social networking sites, you may need to take some precautions to keep bullies from having access to your information. Lock down your privacy settings and ensure that your only friends on social media are people you know and trust in real life. If you are friends with your bully, unfriend her; you might also consider unfriending mutual friends, or at the very least limiting what they can see on your profile. Never post anything — text or photos — that you wouldn't want circulated among your family, friends, workplace, or school. Report any bullying or threatening messages you receive to your parents, teachers, and even the police if the messages happen frequently or contain any threats. You might be tempted to return like-for-like when it comes to bullying behavior, but fighting with your bully by calling her names, spreading rumors about her, or getting into physical fights will not help your situation. In fact, it might result in you getting into trouble, when she's the one who started the whole thing. If you have one bully, consider approaching her and asking her to stop. Be the bigger person. This can be incredibly hard in the moment, but give your bully a sincere smile, and say something like, \\"I'm not sure why you said that, but I really want you to stop.\\" Then walk away. Sometimes a bully can be so taken back by a genuine response that she won't know what to do. If you think your bully is an otherwise reasonable person, ask her if she wants to talk. You might say, \\"Is there something I did that made you angry at me? Would you like to have lunch and talk about it?\\" Sitting down and having a conversation can help get at the root of her behavior, if she's willing. She may have heard a rumor about you or may have some other explanation for why she is targeting you. Even if she doesn't want to sit down and talk, knowing that you're a reasonable person who is open to discussion might make her less upset with you and less likely to target you. Think about the relationship as a balloon that is not fully filled with air. If you don't put any air into the balloon, it will continue to not have substance to it. If you do put air into the balloon, it will get bigger and bigger. Engaging a bully is a lot like this. If you refuse to feed into the bullying dynamic, you refuse to put air into the balloon. Eventually, the bully will pick on someone else in order to \\"inflate her balloon.\\" Girl bullies often travel in groups, working together to pick on other girls to make themselves feel more powerful. It is not usually helpful to confront a group of several girls at once all by yourself. Avoid the situation as much as possible. Try to avoid running into your bullies if possible, and ask a friend to go with you if you have to go somewhere you know the clique will be. Don't react. Remember what your parents told you as a child, about how reacting to a bully is just giving them what they want? It turns out your parents were right. Bullies thrive on power, so if you don't respond by getting angry or crying, you'll drain the experience of fun for the bullies and they will hopefully move on. Try to stay calm and focus on something else if it happens again. If you are feeling targeted by girls at school or women at work, you don't have to suffer in silence. Talking about it can help you figure out strategies to overcome it. Talk to your parents or other trusted adult. Explain the situation and ask them to help you figure out a solution. Sometimes having a parent intervene is the only way to get it to stop. Your parent might contact the bully's parents, the principal, or help you come up with strategies to use in the moment if it happens again. Parents should familiarize themselves with the school's harassment policy. Talk to a counselor or therapist to help you separate the criticisms other people might throw at you from your actual value as a human being. Talk to a teacher, school counselor, or supervisor if you are being bullied or harassed at school or work. That behavior is illegal in a workplace and almost always against the code of conduct in a school or university setting, and should be dealt with at an administrative level to be sure it doesn't keep happening.

Feminists should end their distrust of science Scientists at the universities of Exeter and York have revealed new details about the menopause in killer whales. Studying orcas in the wild has shown that females live unusually far beyond their fertile years because of the benefits their accumulated knowledge bring to the group, as well as the lifelong support they give their sons. Related: The Guardian view on granny orcas: nothing to do with humans | Editorial Evolutionary researchers have been quick to draw comparisons between orcas and humans. Could early human societies also have evolved to rely on the invaluable wisdom and help of female elders? These comparisons, though, have been a little too quick for some. A Guardian leader column, for example, concluded that scientific conundrums like these are “irrelevant” to feminist theory. Human values have nothing to do with what science tells us about how we evolved. And whale research tells us only about whales. Feminism and science have long had an uneasy relationship. That’s hardly surprising. Charles Darwin expressed as scientific theory his opinion that women are the less evolved sex, and other Victorian biologists claimed women could never catch up to men in the evolutionary race to higher intelligence and creativity. Likewise, through the 20th century, male scientists suggested that women had tiny sex drives, that the orgasm was an evolutionary vestige of male anatomy, and that women had smaller brains corresponding to smaller intellects. Scientists have often looked at women as the inferior sex (some still do), threatening the cause of women’s rights with biological determinism. So it makes sense that feminists have returned their gaze with suspicion. The problem is that dismissing science as a body of knowledge means ignoring the best means we have of understanding ourselves. Like all sets of ideas, we need to see science for what it is: an imperfect but promising road to the facts. Correcting itself along the way – and there’s no doubt that corrections are needed – it explains our bodies, minds and place in the universe. Far from irrelevant, then, science should be a useful resource for feminists. When we are told that women are natural homemakers, it can tell us what “natural” really means. When people claim women are intellectually less able, science can expose this as nonsense. The more research, the more we learn just how much the gaps we see are rooted in society and culture, not in biology. Scientists have often looked at women as inferior, threatening the cause of women’s rights with biological determinism Evolutionary biology offers us the long view. Animal data is important because humans didn’t evolve independently. We share common ancestors with other species. When the menopause – practically unknown among other species – happens to orcas as well as to us, we must pay attention. They provide clues that may help explain how we adapted to our ancient environments. They are part of our history. Very distant history, maybe, but history nonetheless. Being as far removed as we are now from how our earliest ancestors lived, we may assume our evolutionary story doesn’t matter. The societies we’ve constructed, which bear testament to humankind’s mastery over nature, have nothing to do with hunting, gathering, or cavewomen crouched over fires. But the story does have the power to answer that dark, niggling question that is still asked: is the sexual inequality we see today rooted in something biological? Is it an essential difference, dating back to the dawn of human life? The old ideas of Darwin’s time are already giving way to more accurate accounts of our evolutionary history. The menopause represents one of the most exciting areas of research about women. Here, we see cruel notions about older women being useless to society, or sexually unwanted, are being superseded by compelling new theories. According to anthropologist Kristen Hawkes at the University of Utah, who has done the most work on this, women evolved to survive so far past menopausal age because, in our past, they were crucial to our survival – much like female orcas. The evidence so far backs her up. Science can help rewrite the story of woman. This is where the final frontier of feminism really lies. As Hawkes says: “If you’re really paying attention to biology, how can you not be a feminist?” What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text discuss: 1. The new study on menopause in killer whales (orcas), suggesting that evolutionary researchers draw comparisons between orcas and humans, particularly regarding the wisdom and help of female elders in both species. 2.

Information: - Madchester is a broad genre label popularized by the British music press in the early 1990s, referring to the music scene that developed in the Manchester area towards the late 1980s and into the early 1990s. The music that emerged from the scene mixed alternative rock, psychedelic rock and electronic dance music. Artists associated with the scene included the Happy Mondays, the Stone Roses, the Inspiral Carpets, Northside, 808 State, James and The Charlatans, amongst others. At that time, the Haçienda nightclub, co-owned by members of New Order, was a major catalyst for the distinctive musical ethos in the city that was called the Second Summer of Love. The scene is widely seen as heavily influenced by drugs, especially ecstasy (MDMA). - The Second Summer of Love is a name given to the period in 198889 in Britain, during the rise of acid house music and the euphoric explosion of unlicensed MDMA-fuelled rave parties. The term generally refers to the summers of both 1988 and 1989 when electronic dance music and the prevalence of the drug MDMA fuelled an explosion in youth culture culminating in mass free parties and the era of the rave. LSD was also widely available and popular again. The music of this era fused dance beats with a psychedelic, 1960s flavour, and the dance culture drew parallels with the hedonism and freedom of the Summer of Love in San Francisco two decades earlier. Similarities with the Sixties included fashions such as Tie-dye. The smiley logo is synonymous with this period in the UK. - 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), commonly known as ecstasy (E), is a psychoactive drug used primarily as a recreational drug. Desired effects include increased empathy, euphoria, and heightened sensations. When taken by mouth, effects begin after 3045 minutes and last 36 hours. It is also sometimes snorted or smoked. , MDMA has no accepted medical uses. Adverse effects of MDMA use include addiction, memory problems, paranoia, difficulty sleeping, teeth grinding, blurred vision, sweating, and a rapid heartbeat. Use may also lead to depression and fatigue. Deaths have been reported due to increased body temperature and dehydration. MDMA increases the release and slows the reuptake of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine in parts of the brain. It has stimulant and psychedelic effects. The initial increase is followed by a short-term decrease in the neurotransmitters. MDMA belongs to the substituted methylenedioxyphenethylamine and substituted amphetamine classes of drugs. MDMA was first made in 1912. It was used to improve psychotherapy beginning in the 1970s and became popular as a street drug in the 1980s. MDMA is commonly associated with dance parties, raves, and electronic dance music. It is often sold mixed with other substances such as ephedrine, amphetamine, and methamphetamine. In 2014, between 9 and 29 million people between the ages of 15 and 64 used ecstasy (0.2% to 0.6% of the world population). This was broadly similar to the percentage of people who use cocaine, amphetamines, and opioids, but fewer than for cannabis. In the United States, about 0.9 million people used ecstasy in 2010. MDMA is generally illegal in most countries. Limited exceptions are sometimes made for research. Researchers are investigating whether a few low doses of MDMA may assist in treating severe, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). In November 2016, phase 3 clinical trials for PTSD were approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration to assess effectiveness... - Shaun William George Ryder (born 23 August 1962) is an English musician, singer-songwriter, actor, television personality, author, and newspaper columnist.

The expensive fashion design houses such as Channel, Yves Saint Laurent, and Christian Dior, which earned money by designing and making very expensive custom clothes, had lost many of their wealthy customers. To stay in business, they started selling more reasonably priced ready-to-wear clothing along with a wide range of accessories , that is, related products such as shoes, bags, watches. All of these products needed to blend with the clothing and with each other so that they made up a brand that everyone would recognize and wanted to buy. Though they did not use that name, each company needed a \\"master designer.\\" Born in Texas and growing up in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Ford had a diverse background in the arts. Soon after completing high school, he moved to New York, where he studied art history, trained as an actor, and worked as a model. Following that, Ford completed a program in indoor design, but later decided that he was more interested in designing clothes than in decorating house. He was hired by the firm Cathy Hardwick in 1986, where he began to work as a fashion designer. His talent stood out from the rest and soon he moved to Perry Ellis, where he became design director. Then in 1990 he made an important move by taking a position with the New York branch of Gucci, the famous design house based in Milan, Italy. During his first years at Gucci, the company was going through a very difficult period. Its products were once considered highly desirable, and were worn by famous women such as Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn, and Jacqueline Kennedy. However, by the early 1990s they had lost their reputation for quality. Other producers had started making cheap, widely available imitations of the brand, and the sales of Gucci's own products had dropped. Things were so bad at one point that Ford was almost fired. However, some people at the company believed in his talent, and in 1994 they hired him to work in Milan as the creative... Question: Why did the author most likely write this passage?

Basic plot summary - man with redhead fetish goes invites such women to his flat only to go into some kind of freakish coma and proceeds in offing them to various degrees of success. Only the cutting crew behind the scenes must have thought the movie was as ad as I did and chopped the heck out of the movie. Nothing flows, you get lost on which redhead he is with at the time (didn't he off that one earlier??), and most of the time it looks like the camera man passed out and resumed filming when he awoke. Not that I can blame him I passed out 2-3 times and had to rewind and resume to try to regain what little plot that does exist. Warning when you see the ending DO NOT try to connect it with anything that happens before -- you will just get an aneurysm. Not worth the time, effort, or God forbid money. Only reason to get a 2 instead of a 1 - the slim chance that the hacking occurred between film release and the horrible version that I watched.","completion":"Based on the description and criticisms mentioned, the correct sentiment for this text is: (1). negative"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 2005, three out of five Manhattan residents were college graduates, and one out of four had a postgraduate degree, forming one of the highest concentrations of highly educated people in any American city. New York City is home to such notable private universities as Barnard College, Columbia University, Cooper Union, Fordham University, New York University, New York Institute of Technology, Pace University, and Yeshiva University. The public CUNY system is one of the largest universities in the nation, comprising 24 institutions across all five boroughs: senior colleges, community colleges, and other graduate/professional schools. The public State University of New York (SUNY) system also serves New York City, as well as the rest of the state. The city also has other smaller private colleges and universities, including many religious and special-purpose institutions, such as St. John's University, The Juilliard School, Manhattan College, The College of Mount Saint Vincent, The New School, Pratt Institute, The School of Visual Arts, The King's College, and Wagner College.
