Please briefly summarize this news article: Sienna Miller abruptly cut from Johnny Depp film 'Black Mass' Sienna Miller’s scenes in the upcoming Johnny Depp movie, \\"Black Mass,\\" have been suddenly given the chop. The 33-year-old actress was slated to play Catherine Greig, a girlfriend of real life gangster Whitey Bulger (played by Depp) in the crime thriller, but producers decided to go in a different direction at the last minute. Director Scott Cooper told The Boston Globe although Miller was “fantastic” alongside Depp and the slew of big names who appear in the film, it “came down to narrative choices.” \\"Black Mass\\" is due to hit cinemas September 18. Click here to subscribe to FOX411’s YouTube channel Miller opened up last year about the lengths she went to in preparation for the role, revealing that she even worked with a dialect coach to make her Boston accent believable. “Up until the day before I flew here, I couldn’t do it and it sounded stupid,” she said. “And I was sort of religiously watching every film ever set in South Boston: 'Good Will Hunting,' 'Gone Baby Gone,' 'The Town.' Catherine had a thick accent, so I hope I do it justice.” Depp is unrecognizable as Whitey Bulger, the Boston mobster who was sentenced to life in prison after a 16-year manhunt, found guilty of 11 murders. \\"Black Mass\\" also stars Benedict Cumberbatch, Kevin Bacon, Joel Edgerton, Dakota Johnson, Adam Scott and Corey Stoll.

The following article contains an answer for the question: Who said they used to be cruel to women? , can you please find it? Lennon met Cynthia Powell (1939–2015) in 1957, when they were fellow students at the Liverpool College of Art. Although Powell was intimidated by Lennon's attitude and appearance, she heard that he was obsessed with the French actress Brigitte Bardot, so she dyed her hair blonde. Lennon asked her out, but when she said that she was engaged, he screamed out, \\"I didn't ask you to fuckin' marry me, did I?\\" She often accompanied him to Quarrymen gigs and travelled to Hamburg with McCartney's girlfriend to visit him. Lennon was jealous by nature and eventually grew possessive, often terrifying Powell with his anger and physical violence. Lennon later said that until he met Ono, he had never questioned his chauvinistic attitude toward women. He said that the Beatles song \\"Getting Better\\" told his own story, \\"I used to be cruel to my woman, and physically – any woman. I was a hitter. I couldn't express myself and I hit. I fought men and I hit women. That is why I am always on about peace.\\"Recalling his July 1962 reaction when he learned that Cynthia was pregnant, Lennon said, \\"There's only one thing for it Cyn. We'll have to get married.\\" The couple wed on 23 August at the Mount Pleasant Register Office in Liverpool, with Brian Epstein serving as best man. His marriage began just as Beatlemania was taking off across the UK. He performed on the evening of his wedding day and would continue to do so almost daily from then on. Epstein feared that fans would be alienated by the idea of a married Beatle, and he asked the Lennons to keep their marriage secret. Julian was born on 8 April 1963; Lennon was on tour at the time and did not see his infant son until three days later.Cynthia attributed the start of the marriage breakdown to Lennon's use of LSD, and she felt that he slowly lost interest in her as a result of his use of the drug.

The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, an American country rock band, has existed in various forms since its founding in Long Beach, California in 1966. The group's membership has had at least a dozen changes over the years, including a period from 1976 to 1981 when the band performed and recorded as the Dirt Band. Constant members since the early times are singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and drummer Jimmie Fadden. Multi-instrumentalist John McEuen was with the band from 1966 to 1986 and returned during 2001 departing once again in November 2017. The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band was founded around 1966 in Long Beach, California by singer-guitarist Jeff Hanna and singer-songwriter guitarist Bruce Kunkel who had performed as the New Coast Two and later the Illegitimate Jug Band. Trying, in the words of the band's website, to \\"figure out how not to have to work for a living,\\" Hanna and Kunkel joined informal jam sessions at McCabe's Guitar Shop in Long Beach. There they met a few other musicians: guitarist/washtub bassist Ralph Barr, guitarist-clarinetist Les Thompson, harmonicist and jug player Jimmie Fadden, and guitarist-vocalist Jackson Browne. As Nitty Gritty Dirt Band, the six men started as a jug band and adopted the burgeoning southern California folk rock musical style, playing in local clubs while wearing pinstripe suits and cowboy boots. Their first paying performance was at the Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, California. Browne was in the band for only a few months before he left to concentrate on a solo career as a singer-songwriter. He was replaced by John McEuen on banjo, fiddle, mandolin, and steel guitar. McEuen's older brother, William, was the group's manager, and he helped the band get signed with Liberty Records, which released the group's debut album, The Nitty Gritty Dirt Band during 1967. The band's first single, \\"Buy for Me the Rain,\\" was a Top 40 success, and the band gained exposure on The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, as well as concerts with such disparate artists as Jack Benny and The Doors. A second album, Ricochet, was released later during the year and was less successful than their first. Kunkel wanted the band to \\"go electric\\", and include more original material. Bruce left the group to form WordSalad and Of The People. He was replaced by multi-instrumentalist Chris Darrow. By 1968, the band adopted electrical instruments anyway, and added drums. The first electric album, Rare Junk, was a commercial failure, as was their next, Alive. The band continued to gain publicity, mainly as a novelty act, making an appearance in the 1968 film, For Singles Only, and a cameo appearance in the 1969 musical western film, Paint Your Wagon, performing \\"Hand Me Down That Can o' Beans\\". The band also played Carnegie Hall as an opening act for Bill Cosby and played in a jam session with Dizzy Gillespie.

If the gases are less harmful, they are less likely to prevent the heat from dissipating into space, meaning less heat is trapped within the Earth's atmosphere.

One no-nonsense we user has gone back to basics to post a recipe for Marmite on toast on the BBC's Good Food website - sparking a wave of hilarious responses. User Benno Himself posted the recipe two years ago but only in the past few days has it seen a surge of interest and comments from fellow BBC Good Food users who appreciate his sense of humour. Twitter users have also gone mad for this amusing recipe. User Benno Himself posted this recipe back in 2010 but has seen a revival in sarcastic and ironic comments.

Anyone can sign up to the website in seconds and be posting recipes immediately, so as one can imagine the website is a minefield for joke (or very bad) recipes. The step-by-step instructions for Marmite on toast go: 'put. bread in toaster', 'get out butter and marmite [sic]', 'get toast out of toaster. when done', 'spread butter on toast', 'spread marmite [sic] on toast', 'serve with. bay leaf (optional)', and, 'eat it'. There's really no arguing with this tried and tested technique for the perfect Marmite on toast. It has even been rated an average five out of five stars. People are impressed. Though on closer inspection, it appears some of the gushingly positive response to this recipe might be peppered with a hint of irony. This amateur chef goes back to basics with his step by step guide to making this very simple dish. 'This. is one of my personal favorites! The assemblage of this dish only took. about 10 minutes despite drilling a hole in the middle of the bread with. my rock-solid unsalted butter.

I've. been using a fork to spread the butter but the toasted bread seams to. break up, is there a special kitchen implement to spread butter? - Tim Messanger. This. looks great but as a hardworking unemployed layabout, I don't have time. for complicated recipes like this after a long day in the pub/down the. bookies. Does anyone know if this is available as a ready-meal in any of. the supermarkets? - cmtarpey. This is a recipe my mother handed down to me, I've always been reluctant to do it as I was nervous it wouldn't taste as good as hers... no need for me to worry, turned out perfectly Thank You so much for bringing back some childhood memories. - Tilly.

Identify each distinct part: The phrase consists of three separate parts: \\"Feeding Three\\", \\"Reflecting God\\", and \\"Embrace Holy Living\\". Each part needs to be translated separately for accuracy. 2. Translate each part: - \\"Feeding Three\\" is translated into Spanish as \\"Alimentando a Tres\\". Here, 'Feeding' translates to 'Alimentando', and 'Three' translates to 'Tres'. We use 'a' before 'Tres' to indicate to whom the action applies. - \\"Reflecting God\\" can be translated as \\"Reflejando a Dios\\". 'Reflecting' is translated as 'Reflejando', and 'God' as 'Dios'. Again, we use 'a' before 'Dios' to indicate the object of the reflection. - \\"Embrace Holy Living\\" is translated as \\"Abraza la Vida Santa\\". 'Embrace' could be translated as 'Abraza', 'Holy' as 'Santa', and 'Living' as 'Vida'. 'La' is used as the article before 'Vida Santa' in Spanish. 3. Combine all parts together: \\"Alimentando a Tres - Reflejando a Dios - Abraza la Vida Santa\\".

Summarize this article: Start by sawing a 2x4 board into 2 pieces that are the same width as your desktop, minus the width of the two legs that will go on either side. These pieces will serve as supports to brace the desk from beneath. Once you’ve done this, cut your remaining wood into 4 identical legs. Their length should correspond to the desired height of your desk, minus the width of the boards making up the desktop. Note that 2x4 boards are actually only 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) thick, not a full 2 inches (5.1 cm). This means that if your desktop is 24 inches (61 cm) wide, each of your support pieces will need to be 21 inches (53 cm) to allow enough room for a leg on either side. Similarly, you’ll need to subtract 1.5 inches (3.8 cm) from your initial table leg measurements to reflect the thickness of the desktop—you want your desk to sit 28 inches (71 cm) off of the ground, for example, each of your legs will need to be 26.5 inches (67 cm) long. Paint or stain your table legs to match your desktop, or leave them unfinished to provide some visual contrast. You can find premade desk and table legs at most hardware stores and home improvement centers, as well as certain specialty furniture stores like IKEA. They’re available in a variety of lengths, shapes, and materials, which means you’re sure to find the perfect set to complete the style of desk you’ve envisioned. Metal legs, for instance, could give a lightly-stained wooden desk a sleek, minimalistic modern air, while square frames can keep the underside of a desk from looking so open without sacrificing valuable storage space. Keep in mind that you’re not limited to simple 2x4 or premade legs. You might also turn a few old wooden pedestals into one-of-a-kind decorative stands to lend your desk added personality, or even just secure your desktop to a pair of sawhorses for a clever, no-fuss solution. The possibilities are virtually endless! Think outside the box and keep your eyes peeled for interesting materials and objects that you think might make good legs for a homemade desk. Examples of other unusual items you could utilize as legs include plywood sheeting, bamboo, industrial pipe, telescopic metal poles, or even modified wooden crates or pallets. To fasten legs cut from 2x4 boards, drill 2 screws through the outer edge of each leg and into the end of the central support piece on each side of the desk. Then, sink another screw every 7 inches (18 cm) along the length of the support. Jostle your desk gently when you’re finished to confirm that it’s stable. Store-bought desk legs typically have screw holes molded into the ends to make the assembly process a cinch. You may need to get creative when it comes to putting on legs made from converted or salvaged materials, depending on the general shape and configuration of the pieces. Summary:","completion":"The article provides a detailed guide on how to build a desk using 2x4 boards, focusing on constructing and attaching the legs. The process involves cutting the 2x4 board into support pieces and legs. The support pieces should be measured by considering the width of the desktop and the width of the legs. The leg length should account for the thickness of the desktop. Painting or staining legs to match or contrast with the desktop is optional. Premade desk and table legs can be found at hardware stores, home improvement centers, and furniture stores. Metal legs, square frames, wooden pedestals, and sawhorses can be used for desired desk styles. Additionally, other unconventional materials and objects, such as plywood sheeting, bamboo, industrial pipe, telescopic metal poles, wooden crates, or pallets, can be used as legs. Fastening the legs involves drilling screws through the outer edge of each leg into the support piece and sinking a screw every 7 inches along the support.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What did Mozart hear in Mannheim? During the 1750s Messiah was performed increasingly at festivals and cathedrals throughout the country. Individual choruses and arias were occasionally extracted for use as anthems or motets in church services, or as concert pieces, a practice that grew in the 19th century and has continued ever since. After Handel's death, performances were given in Florence (1768), New York (excerpts, 1770), Hamburg (1772), and Mannheim (1777), where Mozart first heard it. For the performances in Handel's lifetime and in the decades following his death, the musical forces used in the Foundling Hospital performance of 1754 are thought by Burrows to be typical. A fashion for large-scale performances began in 1784, in a series of commemorative concerts of Handel's music given in Westminster Abbey under the patronage of King George III. A plaque on the Abbey wall records that \\"The Band consisting of DXXV [525] vocal & instrumental performers was conducted by Joah Bates Esqr.\\" In a 1955 article, Sir Malcolm Sargent, a proponent of large-scale performances, wrote, \\"Mr Bates ... had known Handel well and respected his wishes. The orchestra employed was two hundred and fifty strong, including twelve horns, twelve trumpets, six trombones and three pairs of timpani (some made especially large).\\" In 1787 further performances were given at the Abbey; advertisements promised, \\"The Band will consist of Eight Hundred Performers\\".In continental Europe, performances of Messiah were departing from Handel's practices in a different way: his score was being drastically reorchestrated to suit contemporary tastes. In 1786, Johann Adam Hiller presented Messiah with updated scoring in Berlin Cathedral. In 1788 Hiller presented a performance of his revision with a choir of 259 and an orchestra of 87 strings, 10 bassoons, 11 oboes, 8 flutes, 8 horns, 4 clarinets, 4 trombones, 7 trumpets, timpani, harpsichord and organ. In 1789, Mozart was commissioned by Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to re-orchestrate several... Answer:","completion":"When Mozart first heard Handel's \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim in 1777, he experienced a significant and renowned piece of work that had been growing in popularity and performed all over Europe and beyond, even reaching the American continent with concerts in New York, Florence, and Hamburg. At that time, \\"Messiah\\" had already established a presence in various religious establishments and music festivals, as well as expanded its influence through the practice of featuring its individual choruses and arias in church services or concerts. By the time Mozart encountered \\"Messiah,\\" there was an emerging trend of large-scale performances, such as the commemorative concerts held in Westminster Abbey in 1784. These performances boasted an extensive lineup of performers and instrumentalists, exceeding 500 participants under the direction of Joah Bates. Although many of these large-scale performances claimed to follow Handel's original intentions, they often incorporated grandiose orchestral arrangements, which may or may not reflect the original vision of the composer. In addition to impressive performances in England, the \\"Messiah\\" was being adapted on the European continent to suit the shifting musical tastes by re-orchestrating Handel's score. For instance, Johann Adam Hiller produced a reimagined version of the work performed at Berlin Cathedral in 1786, and later in 1788, a rendition with an orchestra that included unique and unconventional elements like clarinets, trombones, and multiple timpani. As Mozart began to engage with \\"Messiah,\\" he himself received a commission from Baron Gottfried van Swieten and the Gesellschaft der Associierten to create a re-orchestrated version of Handel's work. Van Swieten, an Austrian diplomat and music patron, contributed significantly to popularizing Baroque music during the Classical period. Therefore, Mozart's introduction to the \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim led him to be an integral part of the evolving legacy of Handel's piece, with his adaptations further extending its reach and influence across Europe. In conclusion, when Mozart first heard Handel's \\"Messiah\\" in Mannheim, he experienced a monumental composition that had already garnered widespread acclaim and undergone various transformations according to the evolving tastes and preferences of its listeners. This encounter with \\"Messiah\\" prompted him to contribute his own version of the work, carrying on the tradition of re-interpretation and adaptation, as well as solidifying the piece's enduring influence on the world of music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Set up your tent according to the instructions once you’ve decided where you’d like to place it, and lay out your sleeping pads, bags, blankets, and pillows. If you’ve never set up a tent before, it might be a good idea to take a stab at it before your trip. Most tents come with detailed instructions and aren’t very difficult to erect, so just be patient and it’ll get done in no time!

Dig down into the dirt 3 to 4 inches (7.6 to 10.2 cm) and create a mound of dirt around the hole to act as a wall. You can also put rocks around the dirt area to enclose it and keep the fire in place. Every fire needs tinder, kindling, and firewood. Tinder is something small, like pieces of cardboard, lint, or wood shavings. Kindling is made up of small twigs and branches. Firewood can be whole or split logs, and it always needs to be dry. Once you have your campsite set up, take a moment to say “hi” to anyone who is camping near you. You might make some new friends, and it’s helpful to be familiar with who is nearby in case either of you needs help at some point. It can be exhausting just setting up camp, so take a load off, have a snack, and rest for a little while before moving on to your first activity. If you’re camping with pets, take them around the campsite and let them smell everything. There are lots of new scents and it’ll help them calm down if they can explore a little. Summary:","completion":"Setting up your campsite starts with identifying where to pitch your tent and where to place your cooking station, ideally about 200 feet (61 m) apart to deter wildlife from your sleeping area. Familiarize yourself with tent setup using instructions provided, and prepare your sleeping gear. You might need to check local camping rules about food storage for wildlife safety. Ensure all food containers are closed when not in use and dispose of trash responsibly. Bring clothes specifically for cooking, particularly if you're grilling meat, to keep food smells away from sleeping areas. Explore your campsite to locate amenities, especially if you're backpacking, and establish areas for bathroom use, water sources, and collecting firewood before it gets dark. For males, they could opt for peeing on trees, provided it's 200 feet away from a water source and done with common sense. You might need to create your own fire pit in the wilderness, ensuring it's safely distanced from dead grass and other vegetation. Gather tinder, kindling, and firewood, all of which need to be dry. Finally, introduce yourself to other campers nearby because it can facilitate cooperation in case of emergencies. Camping can be tiring, so take breaks, your next step would be to start your first activity. If you have pets, allow them to explore the campsite to adapt to new environments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The vast majority of cats in the United States are Type A, but the percentage of Type B cats increases in other countries, such as Australia. In a study conducted in England, 87.1% of non-pedigree cats were type A, while only 54.6% of pedigree cats were type A. Type A and B cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies to the opposite blood type, although the reaction of Type B cats to Type A blood is more severe than vice versa. Based on this, all cats should have a simple blood typing test done to determine their blood type prior to a transfusion or breeding to avoid the haemolytic disease (or neonatal isoerythrolysis). It is also important to check donor cats for FeLV/FIV status. Is this statement correct \\"do all cats have the same blood type\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"do all cats have the same blood type?\\" is incorrect. Cats have different blood types, primarily classified as Type A, Type B, and Type AB. The majority of cats in the United States belong to Type A, though the percentage of Type B cats increases in other countries. Cats possess naturally occurring alloantibodies against the opposite blood type. A reaction between Type B cats and Type A blood tend to be more severe compared to the reverse scenario. Given this, it is essential to perform a blood typing test on cats before any transfusion or breeding to prevent haemolytic disease (neonatal isoerythrolysis).

Following the accession of James VII in 1685, Bruce gradually fell from favour, and was distrusted by the new regime. After the Revolution of 1688, and the accession of William of Orange as King, he was once again at odds with his Protestant rulers, and he refused to take up his seat in Parliament. As a staunch Episcopalian, Bruce was considered a potential Jacobite threat. In 1693 he was briefly imprisoned in Stirling Castle for refusing to appear before the Privy Council. He was incarcerated again at Stirling in 1694, and from 1696 in Edinburgh Castle. Bruce was expelled from parliament in 1702, his seat passing to his son John Bruce. Despite these imprisonments, he continued his architectural work, indeed the 1690s and 1700s were his most prolific years. Bruce was imprisoned at Edinburgh Castle again in 1708 and was only released a short time before his death, at the beginning of 1710.He was buried in the family mausoleum at Kinross Kirk. The ruins of the church still stand beside Kinross House, the mausoleum remains intact in the churchyard. Dating from 1675 it is probably by William Bruce in design, initially to house his parents. Bruce's surviving account books show purchases of books on music, painting and horticulture, as well as numerous foreign-language works, suggesting that William Bruce was a learned man. He studied horticulture extensively, and applied his knowledge of the subject in his own gardens at Kinross. He was a friend of James Sutherland of the Edinburgh Botanic Garden, and may have known John Evelyn and other English horticulturalists.

Article: A few years ago, Priscilla and I visited Kaua\`i and fell in love with the island. We kept coming back with family and friends, and eventually decided to plant roots ourselves. We bought land near Pila'a and our family is dedicated to preserving its wildlife and natural beauty. We've heard from many in the community and learned more about the cultural and historical significance of this land. Over the past week, we've spoken with community leaders and shared that our intention is to achieve an outcome that preserves the environment, respects local traditions, and is fair to those with kuleana lands. To find a better path forward, we are dropping our quiet title actions and will work together with the community on a new approach. We understand that for native Hawaiians, kuleana are sacred and the quiet title process can be difficult. We want to make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach. The land is made up of a few properties in Waipake, Pila'a, and several kuleana within them. As this community knows, the history of this land is complex. Many of you have shared your families' stories, and we want to honor their history. Before we acquired land in Waipake, it was set to be sub-divided by a commercial developer and built into about 80 homes, which could have impacted endangered monk seals and albatross. As soon as we bought this land, we formally withdrew this process. Now the land will be preserved with minimal development, and large portions will be maintained for farming by the community. Pila'a has an even more complex history. Years before we bought the land, the Environmental Protection Agency had to step in to establish a consent decree to protect it. We are committed to being good stewards of this beautiful land. We hope to build a home for our family here. There are also several kuleana across Pila'a. Some belong to descendants of Manuel Rapozo, and others have had no inhabitants for many decades. Over generations, there are not always clear records of ownership, and many families with a stake in these kuleana may not even be aware. For the kuleana descended from Manuel Rapozo, the only inhabitant is his great grandson, Carlos Andrade, who has lived on and cared for these lands for more than forty years. He is 72 years old, retired, and wants to clear up the titles of these kuleana so he can pass the land on to his children. He will continue his quiet title action and upon completion his family will have ownership of those kuleana. He has been a steward of his family lands and we support him in this effort. Other kuleana have no dwellings or inhabitants at all. In some cases, it is unclear whether any other families are partial owners. We reached out to families on Kaua\`i and off island to discuss this directly. After that, we initiated the quiet title process to identify any other partial owners so we could also pay them their fair share. Upon reflection, I regret that I did not take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history before we moved ahead. Now that I understand the issues better, it's clear we made a mistake. The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward. We will continue to speak with community leaders that represent different groups, including native Hawaiians and environmentalists, to find the best path. Beyond this process, we are also looking for more ways to support the community as neighbors. We have contributed to community organizations and will continue to do so. We work with wildlife experts to preserve endangered species. We hope to do much more in the future. We love Kaua\`i and we want to be good members of the community for the long term. Thank you for welcoming our family into your community. Mark Zuckerberg ----- Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO and founder of social media network Facebook. ||||| Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will no longer pursue litigation intended to buy up small parcels of land on Kauai from kamaaina families to enhance the seclusion of his 700-acre estate on the Garden Isle. SHARE ADVERTISING Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg will no longer pursue litigation intended to buy up small parcels of land on Kauai from kamaaina families to enhance the seclusion of his 700-acre estate on the Garden Isle. Zuckerberg announced his decision to drop eight quiet title lawsuits in a letter to the editor sent to The Garden Island newspaper on Kauai. “Upon reflection, I regret that I did not take the time to fully understand the quiet title process and its history before we moved ahead,” he wrote. “Now that I understand the issues better, it’s clear we made a mistake.” Zuckerberg filed the lawsuits Dec. 30. The complaints targeted 13 parcels that are mostly one acre in size or smaller and are known as kuleana lands, which give every owner rights that include access to the property and water as well as residential use. These kuleana parcels, originally awarded to residents of Hawaii by Hawaiian government officials under the Kuleana Act of 1850, are all within the 700 acres Zuckerberg purchased two years ago for around 100 million. The billionaire co-founder of Facebook said he heard from many community members who conveyed the cultural and historical significance of these kuleana lands after he filed the lawsuits in state court. “We understand that for Native Hawaiians, kuleana are sacred and the quiet title process can be difficult,” he said in his letter, which the newspaper published today. “We want to make this right, talk with the community, and find a better approach. To find a better path forward, we are dropping our quiet title actions and will work together with the community on a new approach.” Zuckerberg’s decision came after an initial story in the Honolulu Star-Advertiser last week that was first to publicly disclose and detail one of the eight lawsuits. On Tuesday, Zuckerberg announced that he was “reconsidering” his litigation. On Thursday, the Star-Advertiser published details of the other seven lawsuits that involved adverse possession claims, a contention that people before Zuckerberg who claimed to own some kuleana parcels or surrounding lands had acquired possession of the kuleana parcels just by openly using them for 10 or 20 years without opposition. “The right path is to sit down and discuss how to best move forward,” Zuckerberg said in his letter. “We will continue to speak with community leaders that represent different groups, including Native Hawaiians and environmentalists, to find the best path. We love Kauai and we want to be good members of the community for the long term. Thank you for welcoming our family into your community.” ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has decided against pursuing litigation that intended to purchase small plots of land on Kauai from native Hawaiian families to expand the seclusion of his 700-acre estate.

Information: - Plant cells are eukaryotic cells that differ in several key aspects from the cells of other eukaryotic organisms. Their distinctive features include: - Volvox is a polyphyletic genus of chlorophyte green algae in the family Volvocaceae. It forms spherical colonies of up to 50,000 cells. They live in a variety of freshwater habitats, and were first reported by Antonie van Leeuwenhoek in 1700. \\"Volvox\\" diverged from unicellular ancestors approximately . - Cyanobacteria , also known as Cyanophyta, is a phylum of bacteria that obtain their energy through photosynthesis. The name \\"cyanobacteria\\" comes from the color of the bacteria (= blue). Sometimes, they are called blue-green algae, and incorrectly so, because cyanobacteria are prokaryotes and the term \\"algae\\" is reserved for eukaryotes. - Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells to provide energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth. - Pandorina is a genus of green algae composed of 8 , 16 , or sometimes 32 cells , held together at their bases to form a sack globular colony surrounded by mucilage . The cells are ovoid or slightly narrowed at one end to appear keystone - or pear - shaped . Each cell has two flagella with two contractile vacuoles at their base , an eyespot , and a large cup - shaped chloroplast with at least one pyrenoid . The colonies coordinate their flagellar movement to create a rolling , swimming motion . Pandorina shows the beginnings of the colony polarity and differentiation seen in Volvox since the anterior cells have larger eyespots . Molecular sequencing has shown that Pandorina is paraphyletic with respect to Volvulina . Asexual reproduction is by simultaneous division of all cells of the colony to form autocolonies that are liberated by a gelatinization of the colonial envelope . Sexual reproduction occurs by division of each cell of the colony into 16 - 32 zoogametes . Zoogametes show indications of heterogamy , a slight difference in the size and motility of the pairs that fuse to form the smooth walled zygote . ( Smith , 1920 , p. 95 ) . - Pyrenoids are sub-cellular micro-compartments found in chloroplasts of many algae, and in a single group of land plants, the hornworts. Pyrenoids are associated with the operation of a carbon-concentrating mechanism (CCM). Their main function is to act as centres of carbon dioxide (CO) fixation, by generating and maintaining a CO rich environment around the photosynthetic enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco). Pyrenoids therefore seem to have a role analogous to that of carboxysomes in cyanobacteria. - The Volvocaceae are a family of unicellular or colonial biflagellates, including the typical genus \\"Volvox\\". The family was named by Ehrenberg in 1834, and is known in older classifications as the Volvocidae. All species are colonial and inhabit freshwater environments. - Chloroplasts are organelles, specialized subunits, in plant and algal cells. Their discovery inside plant cells is usually credited to Julius von Sachs (18321897), an influential botanist and author of standard botanical textbooks sometimes called \\"The Father of Plant Physiology\\". - In taxonomy, Volvulina is a genus of colonial green algae, specifically of the Volvocaceae. The colony (coenobium) is broadly ellipsoidal or spherical and consists of a fixed number of cells, usually 16 in mature individuals (rarely 4, 8 or 32). The cells are located at periphery of the coenobium and separated from each other by being embedded in a swollen sack. The cell body is lens-shaped or half spherical when mature with two flagella. The chloroplast is dish- or bowl-shaped. Pyrenoids may be present or absent, the stigma large. The nucleus is centrally located and there may be 4 to 8 contractile vacuoles. Sexual reproduction is by isogamy. - Mucilage is a thick, gluey substance produced by nearly all plants and some microorganisms. It is a polar glycoprotein and an exopolysaccharide. Mucilage in plants plays a role in the storage of water and food, seed germination, and thickening membranes. Cacti (and other succulents) and flax seeds especially are rich sources of mucilage. - Hornworts are a group of non-vascular plants comprising the division Anthocerotophyta. The common name refers to the elongated horn-like structure, which is the sporophyte. As in mosses and liverworts, the flattened, green plant body of a hornwort is the gametophyte plant. - Algae (singular \\"alga\\" ) is an informal term for a large, diverse group of photosynthetic organisms which are not necessarily closely related, and is thus polyphyletic. Included organisms range from unicellular genera, such as \\"Chlorella\\" and the diatoms, to multicellular forms, such as the giant kelp, a large brown alga which may grow up to 50 m in length. Most are aquatic and autotrophic and lack many of the distinct cell and tissue types, such as stomata, xylem, and phloem, which are found in land plants. The largest and most complex marine algae are called seaweeds, while the most complex freshwater forms are the Charophyta, a division of green algae which includes, for example, \\"Spirogyra\\" and the stoneworts. - Germination is the process by which a plant grows from a seed. The most common example of germination is the sprouting of a seedling from a seed of an angiosperm or gymnosperm. In addition, the growth of a sporeling from a spore, such as the spores of hyphae from fungal spores, is also germination. Thus, in a general sense, germination can be thought of as anything expanding into greater being from a small existence or germ.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the equation 4426*a + 66 = 4393*a for a, we can follow these steps: Step 1: Isolate the variable \\"a\\" by subtracting the smaller coefficient of a from both sides of the equation. 4426*a - 4393*a + 66 = 4393*a - 4393*a This simplifies to: 33*a + 66 = 0 Step 2: Now, we need to isolate \\"a\\" further by eliminating the constant term. We can do this by subtracting 66 from both sides. 33*a + 66 - 66 = 0 - 66 This simplifies to: 33*a = -66 Step 3: Solve for \\"a\\" by dividing both sides by the coefficient of \\"a\\" which is 33. 33*a / 33 = -66 / 33 This simplifies to: a = -2 So, the answer is a = -2."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Don't be in a hurry to start dating once you have lost your spouse. You have spent many years with this person, and whether your relationship was happy or not, you should fully grieve before moving on. Remember, there is no right or wrong way to grieve, and there is no exact time when grieving ends. If you are unable to discuss your spouse without an extreme emotional display, you may need to wait longer before getting back in the dating game. In the meantime, take good care of yourself by eating well, getting physical activity, and avoiding behaviors that jeopardize health, such as drinking or using drugs. Join a grief support group or see a counselor. Yes, you will have to move on and live a life without your loved one. But, you don’t necessarily have to “get over” the loss. “Getting over” a death implies that you will somehow return to normal at some point. Considering how closely interconnected your life was with your spouse’s, returning to normal is impossible. What you want to strive for is acceptance. Learn how to integrate the loss into a new identity in which you plan for a future without your beloved. It can help to fill your social calendar with new and exciting activities, such as checking out books from the library, getting a part-time job if you are retired, taking up a new hobby, participating in group fitness classes, or adopting a pet. The object of dating is not to replace your spouse. You may long for someone just like your previous love, but having such a desire will only lead to disappointment. Think about what qualities you would like to find in a new partner. Be realistic – having a laundry list of desired traits will make it hard for you to find a match. For example, consider some things you would like to do, such as traveling, and look for a partner who shares that same passion. It’s common for widow(er)s to feel a sense of guilt for wanting get back out on the market. You believe it is a betrayal of your spouse to smile at a new man or enjoy coffee with a new woman. You must release these feelings and recognize that you are, indeed, single. Your spouse would want you to enjoy the remainder of your life as you see fit.","completion":"The article emphasizes the importance of giving yourself time to grieve after losing a spouse before moving on to dating again, suggesting self-care, support groups, new social activities, realistic expectations for a new partner, and acknowledging your single status as key steps towards reentering the dating world without forgetting your lost loved one."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions.

Answer choices: - use greater resources - one celled organisms - they are lazy - conserve energy - When it's cold - hard outer covering - hydration - more sleep A:","completion":"Bears hibernate primarily to conserve energy during the winter months when food resources are scarce. Hibernation is an adaptation that allows them to survive in their environment by reducing their metabolism and conserving energy. This helps them overcome the challenge of limited food availability during winter. In this state, they can survive on their stored body fat, which they accumulate during the warmer months when food is plentiful. To summarize, bears hibernate for the following reasons: 1. Conserve energy: Hibernation helps bears preserve energy by slowing down their metabolism and body functions. 2. Limited food resources: During winter, their main food resources are scarce, leading them to rely on their body fat for sustenance. 3. Surviving harsh weather conditions: Hibernation provides bears protection from the extreme cold and harsh conditions during winter months. It's important to note that not all bears hibernate, and it mainly depends on the species and availability of food in their specific region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That “66”indicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter. Question: How long ago was the women involved in the crime deemed young?

According to Trump spokesperson Hope Hicks, West requested a 15-minute meeting with the president-elect, but the reasons for the meeting remain unclear. \\"We were delighted to host him,\\" Hicks said, as reported by the New York Times. \\"They had a very positive and productive conversation.\\" Following their discussion, West and Trump addressed reporters, but the rapper did not divulge any details about the meeting. Instead, Trump offered a rather vague summation, stating, \\"Life. We discussed life.\\" He went on to refer to Kanye West as a \\"good man\\" and claimed that they have been friends for a long time. As West prepared to leave the venue, Trump said, \\"You take care of yourself; I'll see you soon.\\" Speculations are rife as to whether Kanye West may perform during Trump's inauguration ceremony, but there have been no confirmations on that matter yet. Kanye West has recently been making headlines with his controversial statements and actions. The rapper was hospitalized last month for what first-responder dispatchers termed a \\"psychiatric emergency,\\" which was later attributed to extreme exhaustion. This incident followed a concert where West expressed that had he voted in the 2020 presidential elections, he would have voted for Trump. West, who has declared his intention to run for president in 2020, also canceled the remaining tour dates for 2016. The public meeting at Trump Tower has raised many questions and speculations, especially considering West's recent events. The overall impact of this surprising interaction between the president-elect and the rapper remains to be seen. However, the seemingly friendly rapport between Trump and West may challenge the notion that the president-elect only engages with a select group of people, opening the possibility to other high-profile meetings as his term draws closer. On the other hand, the timing of the meeting, amidst controversial Cabinet choices and brewing international tensions, could be viewed as a diversionary tactic. Regardless of the motivations and reasons behind their meeting, the alliance between West and Trump may hint at the rapper's endorsement of the future president's administration. Moreover, Kanye's announcement to run for presidency in 2020 adds an intriguing dynamic to the possibilities of future political interactions and relationships. Whether it was an intentional distraction, the basis for a genuine collaboration, or simply a meeting between friends, Kanye West and Donald Trump's encounter at Trump Tower has undoubtedly captured the attention of many around the world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Administrative divisions are granted a certain degree of autonomy and are usually required to manage themselves through their own local governments. Countries are divided up into these smaller units to make managing their land and the affairs of their people easier. For example, a country may be divided into provinces, which, in turn, are divided into counties, which, in turn, may be divided in whole or in part into municipalities; and so on.

A federal judge on Thursday rejected efforts by Texas to stop the resettlement of Syrian refugees within its borders. The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council.

Mueller III, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, by two years, the White House said in a statement Thursday. Mr. Mueller’s tenure is scheduled to end on Sept. 4. Mr. Mueller, who took office a week before the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, has overseen the transformation of the F.B.I. from an agency dedicated to criminal investigations to one that is a major player in the nation’s global antiterrorism effort. “In his 10 years at the F.B.I., Bob Mueller has set the gold standard for leading the bureau,” Mr. Obama said in the statement. “Given the ongoing threats facing the United States, as well as the leadership transitions at other agencies like the Defense Department and Central Intelligence Agency, I believe continuity and stability at the F.B.I. is critical at this time.” While it is unclear how Congress will respond, Mr. Mueller enjoys widespread bipartisan support on Capitol Hill — appointed by President George W. Bush, Mr. Mueller won unanimous confirmation from the Senate in 2001 and was appointed to previous jobs by President George H.W. Bush, a Republican, and President Bill Clinton, a Democrat — and Mr. Obama’s request is likely to get deference. The announcement comes after Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. began conducting a high-level search for a replacement. F.B.I. directors are limited by law to a single 10-year term, and Mr. Mueller has been traveling globally on what has been characterized as his farewell tour. While a two-year extension would keep Mr. Mueller in place past the 2012 election, White House press secretary Jay Carney said considerations of presidential politics were not a factor in setting two years as the length of the extension. He cited instead the difficulty of the director’s job, and the fact that Mr. Mueller had held it for nearly 10 years in particularly stressful times.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Earth rotates on its north-south axis. Which statement best describes one complete rotation?","completion":"One complete rotation of Earth on its north-south axis is best described as the process in which the planet makes a full 360-degree spin around this imaginary line connecting its north and south poles. This rotation results in the phenomena we experience as day and night and is a critical element in determining time, geographical coordinates, and the planet's climatic patterns. To better understand this concept, let's break down the key aspects of Earth's rotation: 1. Duration: One full rotation of Earth on its axis is not precisely 24 hours as is commonly believed. Instead, it takes approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds for Earth to complete a full 360-degree rotation. This duration is known as a sidereal day and is measured with respect to the background stars. However, since Earth is also orbiting around the Sun, an additional 4 minutes is needed for the same spot on Earth to align with the Sun again. This brings the total time for a solar day to about 24 hours. 2. Direction: Earth's rotation occurs from west to east, in a counterclockwise direction when viewed from above the North Pole. This is why the Sun appears to rise in the east and set in the west. 3. Axial Tilt: The Earth's axis is tilted at an angle of approximately 23.5 degrees relative to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. This tilt, combined with the Earth's rotation, plays a significant role in causing the seasonal changes we experience throughout the year, as different parts of the planet receive varying amounts of sunlight due to the changing angle of solar radiation. 4. Effects on Climate: Earth's rotation also causes the Coriolis effect, which influences global wind patterns. This effect is caused by the different rotation speeds at the equator and the poles; as a result, it deflects moving objects, such as air and water masses, leading to the formation of large-scale weather systems like cyclones and anti-cyclones. 5. Timekeeping: Because the planet's rotation is closely associated with the cycle of day and night, it has been historically used as a basis for our timekeeping system. The Earth's surface is divided into 360 longitudinal lines, called meridians, that extend from the North Pole to the South Pole. These lines, together with the 24 time zones, enable us to accurately measure time all over the world. In summary, one complete rotation of Earth on its north-south axis involves the planet executing a 360-degree spin around the line connecting its poles in approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, and 4.1 seconds. This rotation is responsible for the alternating day and night cycle, the planet's timekeeping system, and various climatic and weather phenomena."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

He was the son of a revolutionary officer, Thomas Macdonough, Sr. who lived near Middletown, Delaware. He was the sixth child from a family of ten siblings and was raised in the countryside. He entered naval life at an early age, receiving a midshipman's commission at the age of sixteen. Serving with Stephen Decatur at Tripoli, he was a member of \\"Preble's Boys\\", a select group of U.S. naval officers who served under the command of Commodore Preble during the First Barbary War. Macdonough achieved fame during the War of 1812, commanding the American naval forces that defeated the British navy at the Battle of Lake Champlain, part of the larger Battle of Plattsburgh, which helped lead to an end to that war. - The United States Army (USA) is the largest branch of the United States Armed Forces and performs land-based military operations.

A British army under Lieutenant General Sir George Prévost and a naval squadron under Captain George Downie converged on the lakeside town of Plattsburgh, which was defended by New York and Vermont militia and detachments of regular troops of the United States Army, all under the command of Brigadier General Alexander Macomb, and ships commanded by Master Commandant Thomas Macdonough. Downie's squadron attacked shortly after dawn on 11 September 1814, but was defeated after a hard fight in which Downie was killed. Prévost then abandoned the attack by land against Macomb's defences and retreated to Canada, stating that even if Plattsburgh was captured, any British troops there could not be supplied without control of the lake. - Napoleon Bonaparte (\\"Napoléon Bonaparte\\"; , born \\"\\"Napoleone di Buonaparte\\"\\"; 15 August 1769 5 May 1821) was a French military and political leader who rose to prominence during the French Revolution and led several successful campaigns during the French Revolutionary Wars. As Napoleon I, he was Emperor of the French from 1804 until 1814, and again in 1815. Napoleon dominated European and global affairs for more than a decade while leading France against a series of coalitions in the Napoleonic Wars. He won most of these wars and the vast majority of his battles, building a large empire that ruled over continental Europe before its final collapse in 1815. One of the greatest commanders in history, his wars and campaigns are studied at military schools worldwide. Napoleon's political and cultural legacy has ensured his status as one of the most celebrated and controversial leaders in human history. - Plattsburgh Bay was the site of the Battle of Plattsburgh , a naval and land engagement on September 11 , 1814 . During the battle , U.S. land and naval forces repulsed the last foreign invasion attempt on the northern states during the War of 1812 . It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 . - Lieutenant-General Sir George Prévost, 1st Baronet (19 May 1767 5 January 1816) was a British Army officer and colonial administrator. Prévost wrongfully became known as the \\"defender of Canada\\" for his alleged leadership during the War of 1812. See \\"Letters of Veritas\\" as written by various high ranking officials of the time. Born in Hackensack, New Jersey, the eldest son of Swiss French Augustine Prévost, he joined the British Army as a youth and became a captain in 1784. Prévost served in the West Indies during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars, and was commander of St. Vincent from 1794 to 1796. He became Lieutenant-Governor of Saint Lucia from 1798 to 1802 and Governor of Dominica from 1802 to 1805. He is best known to history for serving as both the civilian Governor General and the military Commander in Chief in British North America (now part of Canada) during the War of 1812 between Britain and the United States of America. See letters of Veritas by Sewell take note of allegations of treason around p 84. Many concrete examples of questionnable activities, and described as a coward with no honor on p.120. Comments were made in writing by multiple high ranking military personnel - George Downie (19 January 1778 11 September 1814) was a Scottish officer of the British Royal Navy who, during the War of 1812, commanded a British squadron which fought an American squadron on Lake Champlain in the Battle of Plattsburgh, during which he was killed. - The Napoleonic Wars (1803-1815) were a series of major conflicts pitting the French Empire and its allies, led by Napoleon I, against a fluctuating array of European powers formed into various coalitions, primarily led and financed by the United Kingdom. The wars resulted from the unresolved disputes associated with the French Revolution and the Revolutionary Wars, which had raged on for years before concluding with the Treaty of Amiens in 1802. The resumption of hostilities the following year paved the way for more than a decade of constant warfare often categorized into five conflicts: the War of the Third Coalition (1805), the War of the Fourth Coalition (1806-7), the War of the Fifth Coalition (1809), the War of the Sixth Coalition (1813), and the War of the Seventh Coalition (1815). The Napoleonic Wars had profound consequences for global and European history, leading to the spread of nationalism and liberalism, the rise of the British Empire as the world's premier power, the independence movements in Latin America and the collapse of the Spanish Empire, the fundamental reorganization of German and Italian territories into larger states, and the establishment of radically new methods in warfare. - The War of 1812 was a military conflict that lasted from June 1812 to February 1815, fought between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, its North American colonies, and its Native American allies. Historians in the United States and Canada see it as a war in its own right, but the British often see it as a minor theatre of the Napoleonic Wars. By the war's end in early 1815, the key issues had been resolved and peace returned with no boundary changes.

Article: Dragons are not real animals, but look like a combination of many animals such as snakes, fish and deer. They have two horns and a long moustache . With fantastic powers, they fly in the sky or swim in the sea. They can make rain, too. The Chinese dragon is a symbol of strength and good luck. The emperors of ancient China loved dragons. Their clothes were covered with pictures of dragons. We are proud to call ourselves the \\"descendants of the dragon\\". In Chinese, \\"excellent\\" people are often called \\"dragon\\". A number of Chinese sayings and idioms talk about dragons, for example, \\" _ ,\\" which means he or she will be successful. It is said that people born in the Year of the Dragon have certain characteristics. They are creative, confident, brave and quick-tempered. There are some famous \\"dragons\\" who have done excellent things, for example, Deng Xiaoping, the famous businessman, Li Jiacheng and the movie star Zhao Wei. They are all successful. There are also some traditional festivals about dragons in China, such as Dragon Head Raising Day and the Dragon Boat Festival. We have different kinds of activities to celebrate them. These two festivals come every year, but the Year of the Dragon comes every twelve years. The dragon is very important in Chinese culture. As the \\"descendants of the dragon\\", it is necessary for us to know the views on dragons in our culture. It can help us understand why our parents always want us to be \\"dragons\\".

The dragon is a potent symbol in Chinese culture, embodying traits of power and good fortune. According to the article, the Chinese dragon is a visual synthesis of various animal characteristics, such as those found in snakes, fish, and deer. Yet, its true significance extends past its physical aspects. It is considered a bearer of formidable abilities and good luck. The ancient Chinese emperors, appreciating their magnificence and symbolic connotations, wore garments embellished with dragon designs. Even in modern times, the dragon retains its revered status, with individuals of exceptional abilities or potential often referred to as \\"dragons\\" in Chinese vernacular. Moreover, the article reveals that the dragon interweaves itself into numerous Chinese sayings and idioms, often symbolizing success. For instance, a certain Chinese phrase, left blank in the text but concerning dragons, implies a future of success. Besides, the practice of calling ourselves the \\"descendants of the dragon\\" underscores the pride and respect accorded to the dragon in Chinese culture. According to the Chinese Zodiac, those born in the Year of the Dragon are believed to bear certain attributes associated with this mythical creature, including creativity, confidence, bravery, and impetuousness. Every twelfth year marks the Year of the Dragon, the next occurrence being in 2024. Thus, while the dragon is indeed associated with the elements contained in the other answer options - a combination of many animals (i.e., its physical form), Chinese sayings and idioms (as a metaphor for success), and traditional festivals (like Dragon Head Raising Day and the Dragon Boat Festival) - in symbolic terms, the Chinese dragon most accurately represents D: Strength and good luck."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: When Jeff Sparkman draws his cartoon superheroes with colored pencils, he often has to ask other people to tell him what color his masked men turned out to be because he's color-blind. Now, a new smart phone application (app) can help him figure out what colors he's using and how the picture looks to most everyone else. The DanKam app, available for iPhone and Android for 2.99, is an application that turns the vague colors that one percent of the population with color-blindness sees into the \\"true\\" colors as everyone else sees them. In America, an estimated 32 million color-blind Americans--95% are males--can soon have their life improved. \\"DanKam takes the stream of data coming in through the phone's camera and changes the colors slightly so they fall within the range that people who are color-blind see,\\"developer Dan Kaminsky told CNET. He came up with the idea after watching the 2009 film Star Trek with a color-blind friend. It was then that he got to know more about colorblindness like its varying types and degrees. A vast majority, for instance, have trouble seeing red or green due to a genetic defect . Blue-yellow colorblindness, however, is rarer and develops later in life because of aging, illness or head injuries, etc. He started experimenting with one of the most common representations of points in the RGB color model. What the DanKam app attempts to do is to clean up the color space of the image or video signal so that colors can be _ to those suffering from viewing problems. \\"You can adjust the app to fit your needs. There is a range and not everyone who is color-blind sees things the same.\\" Says Kaminsky. Sparkman, a copy editor at CNET, tried out the app and was pleased with the results. \\"It would be useful for dressing for a job interview,\\" he said. But using it for his art is \\"the most practical application.\\" It worked well on LED and other lights on electronic gadgets, which means Sparkman can now identify the power light on his computer display as green.

Question: Process: - Bees first secure the perfect spot, such as hollow areas of trees - Bees will begin to chew max until it becomes softened - The chewed up wax will be stored inside of a honeycomb - Worker bees continue chewing and softening wax from within - The chewed up wax is steadily added, making the hive bigger and bigger - The bees will house nectar, honey and pollen within the honeycomb's cells - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose more honey is made happens, how will it affect a bigger hive is formed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis you mentioned suggests that if more honey is produced, it will lead to the formation of a bigger hive. This perturbation can indeed have both direct and indirect effects on the process of hive formation and the overall functioning of the bee colony. Direct effects: 1. Space requirements: As honey production increases, the need for more space to store the honey becomes necessary. Consequently, bees will have to build a larger hive to accommodate the additional honey. This will make worker bees invest more time and energy in constructing and expanding the honeycomb structure. 2. Increased wax production: To build a bigger hive, bees require more wax for the honeycomb construction. Worker bees will have to consume more nectar and pollen to produce additional wax required for the expansion of the hive. Indirect effects: 1. Increased foraging activity: Higher honey production means that bees will need to collect more nectar and pollen from flowers. As a result, the foraging activity of the bees will increase, leading to the bees visiting a greater number of flowers, which might enhance the pollination process. 2. Colony population: The increased honey storage might support a larger population of bees in the colony. This could result in more nurse bees taking care of the brood, more foragers collecting resources, and an overall increase in the division of labor within the colony. 3. Colony health: A larger hive with an increased store of honey might improve the colony's resistance against harsh environmental conditions, such as extreme weather, pests, or diseases. With more honey reserves, bees can better withstand these challenges and have a greater chance of survival. 4. Potential risk: While a larger hive may provide more resources and space, it can also be more difficult to protect from predators and adverse environmental factors. The colony might need extra investment in maintaining the hive's temperature and humidity, and the bees might have to expend more energy to defend the hive from threats. In summary, the perturbation of increased honey production can lead to both direct and indirect effects on hive formation, colony behavior, and overall health. Bees will likely adapt to these changes in various ways to ensure the sustainability and survival of the colony."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Digital technology -- email and smart phones especially--have vastly improved workers' ability to be productive outside of a traditional office. Even so, most white-collar work still happens in an office. One reason is that, according to findings of a new survey of office workers conducted by Wakefield Research for the IT company Citrix, most bosses are doubtful about remote working. Half of the workers say their boss doesn't accept it, and only 35 percent say it's tolerated. Skeptical bosses will likely have their doubts reinforced by the same survey, which shows that 43 percent of workers say they've watched TV or a movie while \\"working\\" remotely, while 35 percent have done housework,and 28 percent have cooked dinner. It is true, however, that working at home makes people much more efficient , because it allows workers to take care of annoying housework while still getting their jobs done. It's much faster, for example, to shop for groceries at a quarter to three than to stand in line during the after-work rush. The fact that such practices remain officially unaccepted reflects how far we haven't come as a society from the days when we expected every full-time worker to be supported by a full-time homemaker. More broadly the Wakefield survey suggests that employers may be missing a low-cost way to give workers something of value. Sixty-four percent of those survey participants who haven't worked remotely would rather give up some bonus in order to get even one day a week working from home. Under such circumstances, smart firms need to find ways to let their employees have enough ability to change or be changed easily to suit a different situation to manage their time efficiently. Question: What does the author suggest smart firms do? Options: A: Shorten their office hours. B: Give employees a pay raise. C: Adopt flexible work patterns. D: Reduce their staff's workload. A:","completion":"The author suggests that smart firms should adopt flexible work patterns (Option C). According to the article, the author believes that remote work or flexible work schedules can help employees manage their time more efficiently. The author cites the Wakefield survey that shows workers might appreciate the ability to work from home sometimes, even over a bonus. Thus, smart firms need to consider these factors and possibly allow more flexibility in their work arrangements. The other options mentioned, such as shortening office hours, giving employees a pay raise, or reducing their staff's workload aren't directly suggested in the article."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I married young, at 19, bright-eyed and hopeful, and in a few months, we will celebrate our 29th anniversary. Like all marriages, we have had our share of happy and sad, growing together as the years passed us by. My husband is my best friend, a wonderful father, a hard worker, a great provider, treats me like a queen, and loves me unconditionally. He is my soul mate in many ways. My husband is also gay. I had no idea when I married him. I was a virgin on our wedding night and had never had any type of physical relationship prior to my husband. Having nothing to compare it to, I thought our sexual intimacy was normal. It was fun, sexy, enjoyable. My husband was a giving partner, and I almost always experienced orgasm. But as the years went by, the frequency of our sexual activity became less. It was not unusual to go months without sex — not for lack of trying on my part. We rarely fought, but we would fight about the growing lack of intimacy. I often wondered what it was about me that made my husband not want to have sex with me. And then one day, shortly after our 25th anniversary, I found gay porn on his computer. At first he denied everything, but finally, through tears, he confessed that he’d had these same-sex attractions as long as he could remember. In his teens, a church counsellor had told him marriage would “cure” him. Feeling as though I had just been punched in the gut, I was heartbroken. I felt betrayed, confused, angry, sad, and yet, miraculously relieved. There was nothing wrong with me — I was just not his type. The emotions flew through me leaving my head and heart confused.

In the build-up to this Aviva Premiership match, there had been talk of demonstrations following the confirmation that Wasps will be based at the Ricoh Arena from December. Yet, any groundswell of angst was well disguised. There was one banner describing the nomadic club as a ‘franchise’, but even that had vanished by the second-half as Dai Young’s team stormed into a commanding lead. Ultimately, Wasps had to withstand a late Bath rear-guard action as the visitors recovered from 29-0 down to earn a losing bonus point, but there was a collective desperation among the home players to end a turbulent week on a high, which they duly did.

Olajuwon, often simply known as \\"The Dream,\\" is a retired professional basketball player who is considered one of the greatest centers in the history of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Born on January 21, 1963, in Lagos, Nigeria, Olajuwon moved to the United States to play basketball at the University of Houston. He was then drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the 1984 NBA Draft, a draft class that would later include fellow NBA legends Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. Olajuwon is recognized as a prolific shot-blocker. His blend of quickness, strength, and instinct made him an excellent interior defender. He was adept at timing opponents' shots and often surprised them with his speed and agility, particularly given his size. Throughout his career, he established a reputation for making his defensive presence felt by rejecting shot attempts in the paint. Over the course of his 18-year career in the NBA, Hakeem Olajuwon accumulated a total of 3,830 blocks. This is the most ever in the league, as no other player in NBA history has surpassed this number. Moreover, Olajuwon had several other defensive accomplishments as well. He won the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year award twice and was also selected to the NBA's All-Defensive First and Second Teams multiple times throughout his career. Additionally, he led the league in blocks in three different seasons. Despite having retired in 2002, Olajuwon's legacy as the all-time blocks leader in the NBA continues to endure. His record is a testament to his skill and impact on the game, illustrating his ability to not only score points but also prevent opponents from doing the same. It is also noteworthy that Olajuwon excelled in several other areas throughout his career. He was a twelve-time All-Star, won two NBA championships, and was awarded the league's Most Valuable Player (MVP) in 1994.

Curator: Curators work in museums, galleries, and cultural institutions, overseeing exhibitions, selecting and organizing artwork, managing collections, and developing programs that engage the public with the institution's mission. An MFA degree can provide valuable insight into both the artistic and business aspects of this role. 5. Art Therapist: With additional training and certification, graduates of an MFA program can pursue a career in art therapy. In this field, you would use the creative process to help individuals address emotional, mental, and physical issues through various therapeutic methods. 6. Art Critic or Writer: Individuals with a Master of Fine Arts degree can apply their knowledge and expertise to write reviews, essays, and articles about art, artists, exhibitions or various topics within the field, contributing to newspapers, magazines, blogs, or academic journals. 7.

Khadi, which is hand-spun cotton, was used by Gandhi as a symbol of self-reliance and protest against British rule. The commission traditionally uses Gandhi's pictures in its official calendars and stationery. The decision to not include Gandhi this year has caused anger, despite a statement saying that he could \\"never be replaced\\". Some workers on Thursday refused to accept the new stationery and held a silent protest in the KVIC headquarters in Mumbai. \\"We are not against inclusion of Modi's picture on the dairies and calendars, but are pained not to find Gandhi's picture,\\" the PTI news agency quoted a worker as saying. \\"We simply want to know why Gandhi has not been given the space here? Is Gandhi no more relevant for khadi industry?\\" But the KVIC has defended the new calendar, which shows Mr Modi emulating Gandhi in a classic pose, spinning cotton at an old-fashioned wheel. \\"The entire khadi industry is based on Gandhi's philosophy, ideas and ideals, he is the soul of KVIC, so there is no question of ignoring him,\\" the IANS news agency quoted KVIC Chairman Vinai Kumar Saxena as saying. Mr Saxena said the commission chose to use Mr Modi's pictures because he was \\"the biggest brand ambassador of khadi (hand woven) clothes\\". \\"His [Mr Modi's] vision matches KVIC's, of 'Make In India' by making villages self-sufficient,\\" he said. He also said that this was not the first time KVIC had left out Gandhi's pictures on official stationery.

Given the question: Miguel Diaz-Canel has been named Cuba's next president, marking the first time in 60 years the communist-run country has had a president outside the Castro family. The 57-year-old Diaz-Canel, the only candidate for the job, won a five-year term, according to state media. The move was not expected to usher in drastic change. Upon being sworn in Thursday, Diaz-Canel promised to continue the Castros' socialist revolution. \\"The mandate given by the people to this house is to give continuity to the Cuban revolution in a crucial historic moment,\\" Diaz-Canel said. Diaz-Canel, a former first vice president, appears to be socially liberal and is considered an acceptable successor to the retiring elderly leaders who fought in the revolution. He succeeds 86-year-old Raul Castro, who is resigning after 10 years in office. Raul Castro's late brother, Fidel, served as prime minister and president after the armed Cuban Revolution in 1959 until he became ill in 2006. While the leadership transition is elevating younger leaders, Raul Castro and other older revolutionaries are expected to retain their power, due to their hold on the Communist Party. Castro will remain party leader. \\"Raul Castro, as first secretary of the Communist Party, will lead the decisions about the future of the country,'' Diaz-Canel said in his speech. \\"Cuba needs him, providing ideas and proposals for the revolutionary cause, orienting and alerting us about any error or deficiency, teaching us, and always ready to confront imperialism.'' Castro told members of the National Assembly that Diaz-Canel could serve two years as president, and that he will likely eventually take his place as head of the Communist Party. Diaz-Canel will face pressure to bring greater prosperity to the Caribbean country and revitalize its economy, which is weaker than it was in 1985 when it was supported by the former Soviet Union.

First question: How can I display point cloud retrieved by Kinect? Second question: Where can I buy a Kinect? Are these two questions asking the same thing?","completion":"First question: How can I display point cloud retrieved by Kinect? To display a point cloud retrieved by a Kinect sensor, you should follow these general steps: 1. Install required software: Firstly, you need to install some software libraries for retrieving and processing data from the Kinect. Microsoft Kinect SDK is the official software development kit corresponding to the sensor. For non-Microsoft platforms or open-source solutions, OpenNI and the Point Cloud Library (PCL) are popular choices. 2. Connect the Kinect: Connect the Kinect to your computer using the appropriate cables and adapters. The Kinect for Xbox 360 requires a USB power adapter, whereas the Kinect for Xbox One uses a standard USB 3.0 connection. 3. Retrieve point cloud data: Using the installed software libraries, write a program to capture depth data from the Kinect. This program should initialize the Kinect sensor, fetch depth frames per specified intervals (e.g., every 30ms), and convert the depth values into 3D coordinates for each point in the scene. This can typically be achieved using the provided functions in the SDK or libraries. For example, using Microsoft Kinect SDK in C#, you can access depth data as follows: \`\`\` KinectSensor sensor = KinectSensor.GetDefault(); DepthFrameReader depthFrameReader = sensor.DepthFrameSource.OpenReader(); depthFrameReader.FrameArrived += DepthFrameReader_FrameArrived; sensor.Open(); \`\`\` 4. Preprocess the point cloud data: Before visualization, it is often useful to preprocess the point cloud to remove noise, unwanted background, or to optimize file size. You can use Point Cloud Library (PCL) for various algorithms like filtering, downsampling, and segmentation. 5. Visualize the point cloud: To visualize the point cloud, use an appropriate library or tool that supports point cloud rendering. Common options include PCLVisualizer (a part of the Point Cloud Library), OpenGL, and MeshLab, which can read point cloud files and display them in 3D. For example, using PCLVisualizer in C++: \`\`\` #include <pcl/visualization/pcl_visualizer.h> // Assuming 'cloud' contains the point cloud data pcl::visualization::PCLVisualizer::Ptr viewer(new pcl::visualization::PCLVisualizer(\\"3D Viewer\\")); viewer->setBackgroundColor(0, 0, 0); viewer->addPointCloud<pcl::PointXYZ>(cloud, \\"sample_cloud\\"); viewer->setPointCloudRenderingProperties(pcl::visualization::PCL_VISUALIZER_POINT_SIZE, 1, \\"sample_cloud\\"); viewer->addCoordinateSystem(1.0); viewer->initCameraParameters(); \`\`\` This will create a visualizer window displaying the point cloud in 3D. Second question: Where can I buy a Kinect? The Microsoft Kinect has seen two primary versions, the Kinect for Xbox 360 and the Kinect for Xbox One. The Kinect for Xbox 360 (originally Kinect for Windows) has been discontinued, while the Kinect for Xbox One (originally Kinect v2 for Windows) is also challenging to find at retail stores as it has been officially discontinued since 2017. However, you can often find used or refurbished Kinects at the following places: 1. Online marketplaces: The Kinect is often available on eBay, Amazon, and other online marketplaces where individuals or third-party sellers list their products. You can search for the sensor itself or find bundles with console accessories or adapters. 2. Local electronic stores: Check with local electronics retailers, as some might still have older stock on hand. Used video game stores may also have Kinect sensors for sale. 3. Social media groups or local classifieds: Facebook Marketplace, Craigslist, and other online classifieds often have listings for used video game consoles and accessories, including Kinect sensors. 4. Online forums and communities: There are various forums and communities dedicated to Kinect development and projects. Members of these groups may have Kinect sensors available for sale or trade. Remember to check compatibility and ensure you purchase any additional necessary cables or adapters depending on your intended use, e.g., Kinect for Xbox 360 requires a USB power adapter for PC connectivity. Are these two questions asking the same thing? No, these two questions are not asking the same thing. The first question focuses on the process of displaying point cloud data retrieved from a Kinect sensor, while the second question deals with purchasing options for a Kinect sensor itself. The first question discusses the technical aspects related to working with the Kinect, and the second one is concerned with the acquisition of the device."},{"prompt":"The larger the animal, the heavier the exoskeleton, making movement more difficult.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who was given his first lessons on the organ by George Cooper?, using the article: Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

As she lies quietly with her newborn litter, her father, Sir Gregory, walks inside, not realizing she had her puppies until she summons his attention and he spots them curled up next to her. She has already named two of them Storm and Drift but she thinks Sir Gregory should name the third. He looks out of the window and names her Mist after the \\"misty\\" night she was born. All the other dogs, Swift, her son Ernie, and Jake, are delighted to meet the puppies at last but Fern doesn't seem to like puppies and is not happy to be their auntie. When the puppies realize they can finally see things, Mist looks out of a nearby window and sees a flock of sheep pass by, but does not exactly know what they are. She points them out to Storm and Drift, but by the time they come to the window, the sheep are gone. They think Mist is making it up, and they playfully tease and wrestle each other around the barn. This soon tires them out, and they slowly fall asleep side by side. Mist seems to like the idea of working the flock more than her brother and sister. Later that day, Sir Gregory talks with Gail about how well Mist is doing compared to Storm and Drift. Gail realises it is finally time to choose which of the puppies will stay on Borough Farm to be trained as a working sheepdog, and which have to leave.

Question: suppose less water evaporates from the ground happens, how will it affect LESS snow. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect Answer:","completion":"B: Less If less water evaporates from the ground, it will have a direct impact on the formation of clouds, which in turn will affect the formation of snow. Here's a step-by-step explanation to support this answer. 1. Water evaporation from the ground: During the process of evaporation, water present on Earth's surface (in the form of water bodies such as oceans, rivers, lakes, and also soil moisture) gets converted into water vapor due to heat from the sunlight. This water vapor rises up into the atmosphere. 2. Formation of clouds: When the water vapor reaches the cooler upper atmosphere, it undergoes condensation and turns back into tiny water droplets. These water droplets come together to form clouds. The higher the amount of water vapor in the atmosphere, the greater the potential for cloud formation. 3. Cold air and ice crystals: As clouds move across the sky and encounter colder air, the temperature inside the cloud drops. If the cloud reaches an area with temperatures below freezing, water droplets begin to freeze and turn into ice crystals. This is the beginning of the snow formation process. 4. Ice crystals and formation of snowflakes: Inside the cloud, ice crystals come together and stick to each other, creating a snowflake structure. As more ice crystals join the snowflake, it grows in size. Once the snowflake becomes heavy enough, it starts to fall from the cloud towards the ground. Now, if there is less water evaporation from the ground, it means there is less water vapor in the atmosphere. This will result in fewer and smaller clouds, as there is not enough water vapor for cloud formation. With fewer clouds in the colder temperatures required for snow formation, there will be a reduced chance for the development of ice crystals and snowflakes. Hence, less water evaporating from the ground will lead to less snow."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction. Your job is follow the instructions as faithfully as you can.

Summarize this article: Learning proper form is essential to lifting weights. If you're unsure of the proper form or exercises to help build and tone muscle, learning from an expert may be helpful. Many gyms offer free classes to members. Try attending an intro to weight lifting class. These classes are geared towards beginners and will have a fitness professional there to provide hands on coaching. Your gym may also offer sessions with a personal trainer. You may even be able to get a few free when you first sign up for a gym membership. However, there are many personal trainers that work on a consultant basis and can offer individual help at a local gym, your home or other facility. Spot-training or losing weight in one specific area of your body is impossible. However, including regular cardio can help you lose weight, decrease body fat and achieve thinner or smaller arms. It's recommended to include at least 150 minutes or 2.5 hours of cardiovascular activity each week. To burn more fat or to lose more weight include more exercise or increase the intensity. Include exercises such as: walking, jogging/running, using the elliptical, swimming or aerobic classes. Including cardio and taking a day off from weight lifting is essential for proper recovery. Intervals with dynamic exercises that work your entire body can reduce inches on arms, waist, hips, legs and more. In addition, intervals help burn calories which can decrease body fat and support the look of smaller arms. The following are good exercises to do in intervals of 1 to 2 minutes with 15 to 30 seconds of rest in between: Jump rope. High impact exercise like jumping and using your arms to turn the jump rope mean that this exercise burns a lot of calories. Start with 20 seconds and work your way up to 1 minute or more. Rest and repeat 3 times. Do burpees. Stand with your arms high in the air. Place your arms by your feet and jump back into a plank position. Jump back to a squat and stand, raising your arms. Do this for 30 seconds, rest and repeat 3 times. For added benefit, do a push up when you land in the plank position.

Is the premise \\"Three brown-haired women in brown and green skirts lean against a metal fence staring to the left.\\" true if \\"Three woman are leaning on a fence watching a concert\\"?","completion":"The relationship between the premise \\"Three brown-haired women in brown and green skirts lean against a metal fence staring to the left\\" and the statement \\"Three women are leaning on a fence watching a concert\\" can be assessed from two different angles: one in which the premise is true for the statement and the other where it is false. First, let's consider the possibility that the premise is true for the statement. In this case, we must evaluate whether the specific characteristics outlined in the premise apply to the broader statement: 1. The number of women: Both the premise and the statement involve three women. 2. The setting: Both scenarios involve a fence that the women are leaning against. 3. The direction they're looking: If the concert is to the left of the women, then the premise aligns with the statement. However, there are some details in the premise that are not specified in the statement, such as the women's hair color, the color of their skirts, and a more precise description of the fence. Therefore, in this case, it is possible that the premise is true if the given information about the three women in the statement matches the description in the premise. On the other hand, let's consider the possibility that the premise is not true for the statement. There are certain aspects that can create discrepancies between the premise and the statement: 1. Hair color: The statement makes no mention of hair color, so there is no guarantee that the three women in the statement have brown hair like in the premise. 2. Clothing: The statement does not specify the outfits worn by the women, so their skirts may or may not be brown and green as described in the premise. Additionally, the women in the statement could be wearing pants or other clothing items instead of skirts. 3. Direction they're looking: The statement only mentions that the women are watching the concert rather than specifying the direction they're looking. It's uncertain whether the concert is situated to their left as mentioned in the premise. Based on these two angles, it is inconclusive whether the premise is true or false. It can only be determined with certainty if the additional information aligns with the description provided in the premise. The premise could be considered true if it is confirmed that all the details in the premise apply to the three women watching the concert in the statement. Conversely, if the additional details do not match, the premise would be considered false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Based on the premise \\"that's true there's not too many basements in Texas\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"In Texas it's not common to find a basement.\\" is true?","completion":"Yes, based on the premise \\"that's true there's not too many basements in Texas,\\" we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"In Texas it's not common to find a basement\\" is likely to be true. However, it is essential to gather more evidence and information to strengthen this conclusion. There could be several reasons as to why basements are not common in Texas, including geological, economic, or cultural factors. First, let's consider the geological factors. Texas has diverse geology, with certain areas having shallow water tables or bedrock close to the surface, and other areas composing of expansive clay soils. The construction of basements can become complicated and costly due to these underlying conditions. In regions with high water tables, basements are prone to flooding, and waterproofing them becomes challenging. On the other hand, expansive clay soils can lead to significant foundational movement, causing damage to basement walls and creating structural problems. In such geological conditions, it is understandable that basements are not a popular choice in Texas. Next, we can explore economic factors. Generally, the construction of basements entails more significant financial investment than building structures with a concrete slab foundation or a crawlspace. Since basements often require additional excavation, waterproofing, reinforcements, and more extensive work on plumbing and electrical systems, the cost of building a basement in Texas may outweigh the benefits. Texas is known for its affordable housing market, and eliminating basements from construction can further help keep costs low for homeowners. Cultural factors can also play a role in the rarity of basements in Texas. Architecture and housing styles vary across different states and regions within the United States. In Texas, the predominant architectural styles include ranch, Spanish colonial, and modern farmhouse, which do not necessitate the inclusion of basements. Additionally, the use of space in Texas may not demand basements as they do in other states, owing to the state's relatively large land area, which enables wider and open-concept floor plans to be built. While the premise \\"there's not too many basements in Texas\\" does support the hypothesis \\"In Texas it's not common to find a basement,\\" it's essential to consider various factors contributing to this scenario. Geological, economic, and cultural factors all help us better understand why basements are not as prevalent in Texas compared to other states. However, it is vital to gather more data and evidence to solidify the conclusion further."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

First, the review mentions that the performance of Tchaikovsky by Ozawa and Saito Kinen is exceptional. This indicates that the reviewer has positive feelings towards the ensemble's performance in this particular piece. 2. However, the reviewer expresses a fundamental issue with their expression of Mozart. The issue is rooted in tying music expression only to the functionality of the orchestra. This leads to a clean and balanced performance, which works well for some pieces like Tchaikovsky and Mahler's Symphony No. 2. 3. The reviewer questions if this approach could result in further artistic richness and suggests artistic expression might lie in discarding the beauty ensured by functionality. 4. The reviewer then positions Saito Kinen within the context of contemporary culture, arguing that their artistic stance shares a similarity with the sterile, standardized, inorganic, and impersonal art often associated with modern urban culture. 5. Finally, the reviewer proposes that if Ozawa and Saito Kinen continue to prioritize this artistic stance, they should focus on refining urban-themed Romantic and modern music from Southern and Eastern Europe and Russia. Based on these points, the review has a mix of both positive and negative sentiments. It praises the ensemble's performance in certain pieces but criticizes their approach to music expression in others. The reviewer also suggests some areas for improvement in the future. While it's hard to classify the sentiment as strictly positive or negative, the overall tone of the review leans more towards criticism and skepticism, with the reviewer questioning the ensemble's artistic stance and potential for further artistic development.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Picture a wasteland of old computer monitors and TVs, stretching as far as the eye can see. Imagine towers of boxes, all of them filled with broken glass and discarded electronic devices. Technology graveyards like this can be found in communities across the country. Experts say that landfills and warehouses will overflow unless a plan for the disposal and reuse of electronics is put into place . \\"We can't put electronics and glass aside and tell ourselves we'll deal with them later ,\\" Lauren Roman , managing director of Transparent Planet said. Roman's group works to improve the disposal of electronic waste. She says about 660 million pounds of tech-trash is produced each year in the U.S. What's behind the tech trash pile-up ?About ten years ago ,major advances were made in computer and television technology . Manufacturers began producing devices like flat -paneled LCDs and plasma screen monitors. These new products provide a clearer image and take up less space than older models. It goes without saying that consumers choose them rather than heavy glass-based technologies. The new electronics are built with materials that are difficult to recycle. In addition, the new products have decreased the demand for recycled parts from the older monitors and screens. Older, heavier computer monitors and TVs used glass-based components called CRTs. CRTs have a high lead content and can be environmentally hazardous if not recycled properly . If crushed and put in landfills, the lead from CUTs could seep into groundwater and rivers, harming the water supply. For many years, plants and recycling programs safely processed CRTs. The recycled CRTs were reused in the construction of new monitors. Monitors being made today do not use glass tubes . \\"People are returning old -style TVs with CRTs , but no new ones are being made ,\\" said Linnell. This is creating an imbalance in the amount of glass being disposed of and recycled properly. Many recycling companies have shut down. Others no longer have the resources or space... Question: What is the main idea of the passage? Answer: A:","completion":"The main idea of the passage is the increasing problem of tech-trash, particularly related to old computer monitors and TVs, and the need for proper disposal and reuse solutions to prevent detrimental effects on the environment and overflowing landfills. Newer technologies have made it difficult to recycle old devices, and the demand for recycled parts has decreased, resulting in an imbalance in glass disposal and recycling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dr John Lamb, an advisor stoned to death in 1628, was also buried there. It is also the site of Britain's first mental asylum, Royal Bedlam Hospital. Skeletons of patients cannot be distinguished from others, experts said. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Crossrail Excavation in London Reveals Cemetery, Names of Thousands Buried, and a Link to Britain's First Mental Asylum Subheading: Researchers discover names of over 5,000 buried at Liverpool Street in London, including notable historical figures like Sir Ambrose Nicholas and Dr John Lamb. The ongoing Crossrail project at Liverpool Street in London has unearthed a vast and historically significant cemetery. Researchers working on the site, with the help of historical records, have managed to identify the names of more than 5,000 people buried at the location. Notable among those names is Sir Ambrose Nicholas, a former mayor of London, and Dr John Lamb, an advisor subjected to a brutal death by stoning in 1628. The site also holds a fascinating connection to the Royal Bedlam Hospital, Britain's first-ever mental asylum. Uncovering a Hidden Past As researchers delve deeper into the burial site, they have been able to unlock long-forgotten stories and link them to the grand narrative of London's history. The excavation of Sir Ambrose Nicholas, who was the Lord Mayor of London in 1575, will provide valuable information and insight into the city's past and its historical figures. Similarly, the remains of Dr John Lamb, known for his dedication to the then unconventional science of alchemy and brutally stoned to death for his beliefs, will contribute to a broader understanding of the historical attitudes and the life of a prominent scholar. Britain's First Mental Asylum: The Royal Bedlam Hospital Further adding to the intrigue of this site is its connection to the Royal Bedlam Hospital, known as the Bethlehem Royal Hospital today. Established in the 13th century, the hospital stands as a monument to the early attempts at understanding mental health and providing care for those afflicted with psychological disorders. The cemetery, which was used for the interment of hospital patients, is now a significant point of interest for researchers to learn more about the treatment of mental health patients during that era. Challenges in Identifying Skeletons Despite unearthing the skeletons of thousands of individuals, experts have faced significant challenges in distinguishing the remains of former hospital patients from others buried at the site. The lack of any discernible markers or distinguishing factors on the skeletons makes it difficult to identify which remains are associated with the Royal Bedlam Hospital. Nevertheless, researchers believe that this discovery will lead to a wealth of information on the lives of Londoners and the patients of Britain's first mental asylum. As history and modernity collide with the presence of the Crossrail project, the Liverpool Street cemetery site serves as a vital window into London's past. Through the painstaking efforts of researchers and archaeologists, the world is being offered a glimpse into the lives of people who lived centuries ago and a unique opportunity to learn about the history of mental healthcare in Britain. The uncovering of the Liverpool Street cemetery, along with the history behind its inhabitants, serves as a testament to the ever-evolving nature of London and a symbol of the layers of history hidden beneath our feet. It stands as an invaluable resource for researchers to learn about historical medical practices and the social dynamics of a bygone era. Now, with the Crossrail project bringing together engineering and history, it shows how progress can uncover the past, even as it paves the way to the future."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Rob always confuses the terms climate and weather. He found it's better to compare them if he needs to learn more about their characteristics. To make things easier, he labeled the weather of his city as char A. Then he labeled the climate of this city as char B. Once finished with learning their characteristics, Rob focused on climate change issues. For that, he labeled the climate of present time as char C and climate just before industrial revolution as char D. Does char A represent longer or shorter time period than char B? Hint: Weather conditions include air temperature, humidity, wind speed and direction, and precipitation. Weather is temporary. People in many states have the joke, \\"if you don't like the weather, wait five minutes and it will change.\\" One way to change the weather is to have a different air mass move over the region. Interactions between air masses bring about a lot of weather. For example, thunderstorms and tornadoes form along a front. A front is where air masses meet. Fronts can bring about blizzards, thunderstorms, tornadoes and other types of weather. Weather prediction is much better than it was in past years. This is due in part to information from satellites. Climate is the long-term average of weather. The climate of a location depends on its latitude, position relative to the atmospheric circulation cells, position on a continent, altitude, and position relative to mountains. Areas with roughly the same climate make up a climate zone. The organisms that live within a climate zone create a unique biome. Earth's climate has changed throughout the planet's history. Earth was frigid at the end of the Pleistocene ice age, but has been warming since then. Since the Industrial Revolution the pace of warming has increased. In the past few decades the rate has really intensified. This is related to greenhouse gas emissions, primary from fossil fuel burning. The destruction of forests also increasing warming. The effects of global warming are already being seen. Treaties and voluntary actions are needed to reduce emissions to lessen the amount of global warming that will take place in the future.

Born prematurely with only one functioning lung, Edwin spent his school years in special education classes, Robert said. He remembered his brother as soft-spoken, humble and kindhearted. \\"When he left, he just took off,\\" Robert told CNN by phone last Saturday. \\"He was in love and ran away.\\" He last saw his brother in 1999. Neighbors and friends would tell Robert they thought they spotted Edwin around the city. \\"It was like a bigfoot sighting,\\" he said. \\"Every time they said they saw him it went nowhere. The information led to a dead end.\\" Then","completion":", in an unexpected turn of events in early 2021, Robert received a message through social media from a woman claiming to have information about Edwin's whereabouts. The woman, Carla Martinez, said she had been in contact with Edwin for several years and that he was living under a different name in a small town outside of Philadelphia. Initially skeptical, Robert cautiously began corresponding with Martinez, exchanging details about Edwin's past that only those closest to him would know. As the evidence mounted, Robert could no longer deny the possibility that his long-lost brother was indeed alive. \\"It felt like a miracle, a dream come true,\\" he said. \\"I was finally given a glimmer of hope that I might be able to reconnect with my brother after all these years.\\" Despite the elation, Robert's journey to be reunited with Edwin would prove to be both emotionally and logistically challenging. Under the guidance and support of Martinez, they began the painstaking process of piecing together Edwin's life from the past two decades, uncovering a complex web of relationships, hardships, and personal growth. As they delved further into Edwin's story, it became apparent that his disappearance was not simply the result of a fleeting romance, but rather an arduous path of self-discovery and the pursuit of a new identity. Nevertheless, Robert remained undeterred in his determination to find his brother, drawing strength from both the love and the concern he harbored for him. \\"Even though I was still grappling with the range of emotions that came with the news, I knew that I had to do whatever it took to bring the puzzle of his life back together and to be by his side once again,\\" he recounted. Now, with a renewed sense of purpose and optimism, Robert and Carla embark on a journey that has the potential to not only reunite them with Edwin but also to heal the wounds of a long-divided family. As they venture down this uncertain road, Robert clings to the memories of his brother's kindness and soft-spoken nature, hopeful that they still hold true and can be the foundation for a new beginning. \\"Every step we take brings us closer to understanding who Edwin is now and what led him to leave all those years ago. But more importantly, it brings us closer to finding a way to rebuild our bond and our family,\\" Robert said, his voice filled with resolve. \\"I'll never give up until I can call him my big brother again, to have him back in my life and to make up for the lost time.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Remove the outer coating. Melt the butter. Sauté the garlic. Sauté the fava beans. Season and serve. Article:","completion":"Title: A Flavorful Guide to Preparing and Cooking Fava Beans Introduction Fava beans, also known as broad beans, are a versatile and nutritious addition to any meal. Packed with protein and fiber, they can be used in various dishes, ranging from salads to stews. But, if you have never cooked fava beans before or simply want to refresh your culinary skills, this article is here to guide you through the process. With the help of this comprehensive guide, you will be able to enjoy perfectly cooked fava beans in no time. Prepare the Fava Beans Step 1: Remove the Outer Shell The first and most crucial step is to remove the outer shell of the fava beans. To do this, use your thumb and index finger to gently pinch the end of the bean. This should create an opening through which the beans can be pushed out. Repeat the process until all the beans have been removed from their outer shells. Step 2: Parboil for 30 Seconds Parboiling is a cooking technique that involves boiling an ingredient briefly before transferring it to another cooking method. To parboil the fava beans, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Add the shelled beans to the boiling water and let them cook for 30 seconds. This process will loosen the outer coating of the bean and make it easier to remove. Step 3: Remove the Outer Coating Once you have parboiled the beans, use a slotted spoon to transfer them to a bowl of ice water to stop the cooking process. This will also help to firm up their outer skin, making it easier to peel off. Once the beans are cool enough to handle, gently hold each bean between your thumb and index finger using a slight pinching motion and the outer coating should slip right off. Discard the removed skins. Cook the Fava Beans Step 4: Melt the Butter Now that your fava beans are prepped, it's time to cook them. Start by melting a generous amount of butter in a large skillet or frying pan over medium heat. The butter not only adds a rich and creamy flavor to the dish but also helps in sautéing the beans to perfection. Step 5: Sauté the Garlic Once the butter is completely melted but not browned, add in finely minced garlic. Cooking garlic in butter not only mellows its sharp, pungent taste but also gives it a chance to infuse the butter with its flavors. Sauté the garlic for about 30 seconds to one minute, or until it becomes fragrant and slightly golden. Step 6: Sauté the Fava Beans Add the fava beans to the pan and cook them with the garlic for about 3-5 minutes. The length of time depends on the size of the beans and your desired level of tenderness. Stir frequently to ensure they are evenly coated in the butter and garlic mixture. Step 7: Season and Serve As the fava beans finish cooking, it's time to season the dish. Add salt and pepper according to your taste preference. For an extra burst of flavor, consider adding a dash of fresh lemon juice or a sprinkle of chopped parsley. The acidity from the lemon juice or vibrancy of the parsley will elevate and balance the rich flavors of the butter and beans. Conclusion With this detailed guide on how to prepare and cook fava beans, you are now equipped with the knowledge to bring this nutritious and flavorful ingredient into your kitchen. Whether you want to enjoy them as a side dish or incorporate them into a main course, fava beans are the perfect addition to any meal. Happy cooking!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: In 1874, Disraeli's ambitious foreign policy, aimed at creating a British empire, is voted down by the House of Commons after a speech by his great rival, William Gladstone. Later, Disraeli receives the welcome news that the spendthrift Khedive of Egypt is in dire need of money and is willing to sell the controlling shares in the Suez Canal. The purchase of the canal would secure control of India, but Michael Probert, head of the Bank of England, makes it clear to Disraeli that he is vehemently opposed to any such plan. Disraeli then summons Hugh Myers, a leading Jewish banker. Meanwhile, Lord Charles Deeford proposes to Lady Clarissa Pevensey. Although she is in love with him, she turns him down. He is content to enjoy his wealth and high social standing, and lacks the ambition she wants in a husband; further, she is a great admirer of the Prime Minister and Charles has no strong opinion about him. Disraeli, seeing promise in the young man and wanting Clarissa to be happy, convinces Charles to come work for him, and tells him about the canal purchase. But he does not tell him about the spies. Russia, eager to seize India for itself, has assigned two spies to watch Disraeli: Mrs. Travers, who has entree to the highest social circles, and Mr. Foljambe. Disraeli was not fooled; he has hired Foljambe as his personal government secretary, the better to deceive him. When Foljambe asks Charles if Myers is there to provide financial backing for the purchase of the canal, Charles says nothing, but his manner makes it clear that Foljambe has guessed correctly. Mrs. Travers orders Foljambe to leave the country and warn their masters. Disraeli soon discovers what has happened. When he decides to send an agent to the khedive immediately, Clarissa suggests he send Charles.

Scruffing is one of the most popular ways to stop your ferret from biting. Grab your ferret by the loose skin on the back of the neck, and lift it to your eye level.","completion":"While lifting your ferret to eye level, maintain a gentle yet firm grip on the scruff, ensuring that it feels secure, and be careful not to cause any harm or discomfort to the animal. As you do this, establish eye contact and speak in a calm, assertive voice, conveying your disapproval for the biting behavior. At the same time, be attentive to your ferret's body language and reactions, as this will help you gauge if it is understanding your message and if any adjustments to your approach are necessary. Once you have effectively communicated your displeasure, slowly lower your ferret back onto the ground, allowing it to regain its equilibrium and natural posture. During this entire process, keep in mind that patience and consistency are key, as the ferret may require numerous repetitions of this disciplinary action before it fully grasps the correlation between the scruffing and the cessation of biting. Moreover, it is crucial to scruff your ferret immediately after a biting incident to create a clear connection between the unwanted behavior and the consequence; any delay in scruffing may lead the ferret to be confused about the reason for the disciplinary action. In addition to scruffing, other complementary training techniques can be employed to reinforce the message that biting is not acceptable. For instance, you can utilize diversion tactics, such as providing your ferret with appropriate toys to chew on as an alternative to human fingers. Rewarding your ferret with treats when it exhibits non-biting behavior or responds positively to the scruffing and rebuke is another effective way to help your pet internalize the lesson. Always bear in mind that every ferret is unique, and its progress in learning not to bite may vary depending on various factors, including its temperament, age, and previous experiences. Therefore, it is essential to tailor your training approach to your individual ferret's needs, adjusting the techniques and methods as necessary to achieve the desired outcome. In conclusion, while scruffing is an essential component of training your ferret not to bite, it is crucial to employ a comprehensive and patient approach that combines this disciplinary action with additional techniques such as diversionary tactics and positive reinforcement. Remember to be gentle, assertive, and consistent in your interactions with your ferret, and always be attentive to its unique needs and characteristics. In doing so, you will be able to establish a strong bond with your pet while effectively discouraging biting behavior."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aluminum in waterways may affect water quality and aquatic ecosystems, including the chemistry and concentration of various ions in the water. While it does not directly influence the steps involved in the formation of ice crystals or snowflakes, it could indirectly affect the process by changing the conditions under which these steps occur, such as altering the freezing point of water due to changes in ion concentration. This might result in slightly different conditions for the formation of ice crystals, potentially affecting the size or rate at which they form and stick together. However, it is important to note that this would be a relatively minor perturbation, and the overall process of cold air, water vapor turning into ice crystals, and eventual snowfall would still take place.

When the Navy put a Pacific fleet through maneuvers on a 12 million cocktail of biofuels this summer, it proved that warships could actually operate on diesel from algae or chicken fat. Jonathan Greenert, chief of naval operations, left, and Navy Secretary Ray Mabus, in the blue shirt, watch the biofuel delivery. “It works in the engines that we have, it works in the aircraft that we have, it works in the ships that we have,” said Ray Mabus, secretary of the Navy. “It is seamless.” The still-experimental fuels are also expensive — about 27 a gallon for the fuel used in the demonstration, compared with about 3.50 a gallon for conventional military fuels. And that has made them a flash point in a larger political battle over government financing for new energy technologies. “You’re not the secretary of energy,” Representative Randy Forbes, a Republican from Virginia, told Mr. Mabus as he criticized the biofuels program at a hearing in February. “You’re the secretary of the Navy.” The House, controlled by Republicans, has already approved measures that would all but kill Pentagon spending on purchasing or investing in biofuels. A committee in the Senate, led by Democrats, has voted to save the program. The fight will heat up again when Congress takes up the Defense Department’s budget again in the fall. The naval demonstration — known as the Great Green Fleet — was part of a 510 million three-year, multiagency program to help the military develop alternatives to conventional fuel. It is a drop in the ocean of the Pentagon’s nearly 650 billion annual budget. But with the Defense Department facing 259 billion in budget cuts over the next five years, some lawmakers argue that the military should not be spending millions on developing new fuel markets when it is buying less equipment and considering cutting salaries. This phase of the military’s exploration of alternative fuels began under President George W. Bush and grew out of a task force that Donald Rumsfeld, then the secretary of defense, convened in 2006 to explore ways to reduce dependence on petroleum. If the military had less need to transport and protect fuel coming from the Middle East, the thinking went, the fighting forces could become more flexible and efficient, with fewer lives put at risk. In addition to biofuels, early efforts included developing liquid fuels from coal and natural gas for the Air Force, the largest energy user of the armed services. But the gas and coal fuels would not meet cost or environmental requirements, officials said. The Defense Department focused on advanced biofuels, which are generally made from plant and animal feedstocks that don’t compete with food uses, which is a concern with common renewable fuels like the corn-based ethanol used in cars. The federal Renewable Fuel Standard, which sets targets for renewable fuel production and requires a certain amount to be blended into conventional gasoline and diesel, has been the main catalyst for the growth of several companies exploring new technologies. Investors, however, have been leery of the enormous amounts of cash it can take to bring the fuels from the lab to the gas tank. Industry officials say that having a large, steady customer like the military could attract other investors to help finance large refineries that would bring costs down through economies of scale. Military officials say that their purchases of small amounts for testing has already helped reduce the cost. In 2009, the Pentagon spent roughly 424 a gallon on algae oil from Solazyme. “Finding a user like the military can rapidly help to scale technologies that then are used in the civilian marketplace — it becomes a catalyst,” said Bob Johnsen, chief executive of Primus Green Energy, which is developing fuels from biomass and natural gas. “If the military becomes a buyer, that becomes a means by which the production facilities can be financed.” The Defense Department is always vulnerable to charges of overspending — remember the 7,600 coffee maker? — but military leaders argue that what they are putting into biofuels is a blip given the potential benefits of reducing their need for Middle Eastern oil, with all its volatilities. “Our primary rationale is not economic,” said Sharon E. Burke, assistant secretary of defense for operational energy plans and programs. “Our job is to defend the country.” She said biofuel spending was just 4 percent of the 1.6 billion budget the military was requesting for efforts to improve energy usage in field operations in the next fiscal year. Most of the measures are aimed at reducing the need for fuel in the first place, including using diesel electricity generators more efficiently, putting greener engines into vehicles and aircraft, and using hybrid solar generators and batteries in the field. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about how the US military has been testing biofuels to use in their ships and airplanes. They did a big test called the Great Green Fleet demonstration with a special mixture of biofuels and regular fuel, and it worked well. But, these biofuels are much more expensive than regular fuel, which is causing some people to argue that the military shouldn't spend money on this while they have to make budget cuts in other areas. The debate over whether to continue funding biofuels in the military will continue soon when the Defense Department's budget gets discussed again."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

First, let me provide a brief explanation of the rating scale used for this evaluation. A rating of 1 indicates a least favorable review, typically signifying strong dissatisfaction, criticism, or negative feedback. A rating of 5 represents a most favorable review, with praise, satisfaction, and positivity. Ratings 2-4 fall in between, expressing varying degrees of satisfaction or dissatisfaction. In the case of the review \\"Cool app,\\" I have rated it a 2 due to several reasons: 1. Lack of detail: The review is too short and vague to provide any helpful insight about the app's features, advantages, or disadvantages. It offers little valuable information that potential users or the app developers can learn from. 2. Ambiguity: The word \\"cool\\" can be seen as a positive adjective, but its meaning is subjective, as different people may have different interpretations of what \\"cool\\" means. Consequently, potential users cannot clearly gauge how this app will suit their needs or preferences. 3. No context: The absence of context means we cannot determine which aspect of the app the reviewer found impressive or enjoyable. It may refer to the app's appearance, functionality, or user experience, but the lack of specification leaves this unclear. While the sentiment expressed in the review is positive, it falls short in providing helpful, detailed feedback that benefits potential users and app developers.

At a recent campaign-style rally in Washington, Michigan, Trump turned up the heat on opposition Democrats: \\"A vote for a Democrat in November is a vote for open borders and crime. It's very simple,\\" he said. Opinion polls give Democrats an edge looking ahead to the balloting in November, and Trump is trying to get his supporters excited about turning out at the polls. \\"You know what it is? You get complacent,\\" he said. \\"We cannot be complacent. We have to go out, right?\\" The president also told supporters not to pay attention to Democrats who insist they have the House all but won in November. \\"We've got to go out and we've got to fight like hell and we have got to win the House and win the Senate,\\" Trump told the audience. \\"And I think we are going to do great in the Senate and I think we are going to do great in the House because the economy is so good.\\" According to the website RealClearPolitics, the Democrats enjoy a generic ballot advantage of nearly 7 percentage points over the Republicans looking ahead to November.

Gabriel Omar Batistuta (Spanish pronunciation: [ga'brjel o'mar batis'tuta]; born 1 February 1969), nicknamed Batigol [bati'gol] as well as El Angel Gabriel [el ,aNGxel ga'brjel] (Spanish for Angel Gabriel), is a retired Argentine professional footballer. After beginning his career in Argentina in 1988, where he won titles playing for Newell's Old Boys, River Plate, and subsequently Boca Juniors, the prolific striker played most of his club football with Fiorentina in Italy; he is the twelfth-highest scorer of all-time in the Italian Serie A, with 184 goals in 318 matches. When his club Fiorentina was relegated to Serie B in 1993, Batistuta stayed with the club and helped it return to the top-flight league a year later. While playing for Argentina in the 1991 Copa America, the vice-president of Fiorentina was impressed by Batistuta's skills and signed him. He had a fine start in Serie A, scoring 13 goals in his debut season. However, the following season, in 1992-93, Fiorentina lost in the relegation battle and were demoted to Serie B, despite Batistuta's 16 league goals. The club returned to Serie A after one season in Serie B, with the contribution of 16 goals from Batistuta and the management of Claudio Ranieri, as Fiorentina captured the 1993-94 Serie B title. At Fiorentina, Batistuta found his best form. He was the top scorer of the 1994-95 Serie A season with 26 goals, and he broke Ezio Pascutti's 30-year-old record by scoring in all of the first 11 matches of the season. In the 1995-96 season, Batistuta, alongside Manuel Rui Costa and Francesco Baiano, helped the club to go on a 15-match unbeaten run, as they eventually ended the season with a fourth-place league finish. Fiorentina also won the Coppa Italia and Supercoppa Italiana over Milan; in the two-legged Coppa Italia final against Atalanta, Batistuta scored a goal in each fixture as Fiorentina won 3-0 on aggregate. The next season was less successful, as Fiorentina finished in a disappointing ninth place in the league, although the team managed to reach the semi-finals of the 1996-97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup, losing out to eventual champions Barcelona, despite scoring a goal in a 1-1 away draw in the first leg. After his failure to win the Italian championship with Fiorentina, Batistuta started considering a transfer to a bigger team. In an effort to keep Batistuta, Fiorentina hired Giovanni Trapattoni as coach and promised to do everything to win the Scudetto. After an excellent start to the season, Batistuta suffered an injury that kept him out of action for more than a month. Losing momentum, Fiorentina lost the lead and finished the season in third place, although the result enabled them to participate in the Champions League the following season.","completion":"This text is about Gabriel Omar Batistuta, a retired Argentine professional footballer who is also known by the nicknames Batigol and El Angel Gabriel."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the manufacturers process the recycled materials in the same way as they would new materials, they manufacture new goods incorporating the recycled content. These goods may include items such as paper, packaging, automotive parts, electronics, furniture, clothing, or construction materials, among many others. Not only does the use of recycled materials help reduce the overall demand for virgin, or raw, resources, but it often requires less energy to process and manufacture these goods compared to using entirely new materials. This, in turn, contributes to a decrease in greenhouse gas emissions and conserves energy, leading to a more sustainable economy and environment. Additionally, the production of new goods from recycled materials helps promote a closed-loop system, where materials are utilized to their maximum potential, generating less waste and driving consumer demand for more eco-friendly products. After the new products are manufactured and distributed, they become available for purchase by consumers, wholesalers, and retailers. The lifecycle then continues as consumers make environmentally conscious choices and opt for purchasing and using products made from recycled materials. Once these items have reached the end of their useful life, they can again be recycled, starting the whole process anew and becoming a part of the circular economy. In summary, the final step of the recycling process is the manufacturing of new products using recycled materials, followed by their distribution and purchase by consumers. This step is critical, as it closes the loop of recycling, promotes a circular economy, and ultimately leads to a more sustainable and eco-friendly world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Taking Back Sunday is an American rock band from Long Island, New York. The band was formed by guitarist Eddie Reyes in 1999. The band's members are Adam Lazzara (lead vocals), John Nolan (lead guitar, keyboards, vocals), Eddie Reyes (rhythm guitar), Shaun Cooper (bass guitar) and Mark O'Connell (drums). The band has released three studio albums with various past members Fred Mascherino (guitar, vocals), Matthew Rubano (bass guitar), and Matthew Fazzi (guitar, keyboards, vocals). On June 10, 2005, it was announced that the band had signed with major label Warner Bros. Records and would begin recording their third album later in 2005. That month, the group contributed \\"Error: Operator\\" to the video-game adaption of Fantastic Four, and it was later added to the film's soundtrack as well. On September 21, 2005, it was announced that Taking Back Sunday had begun recording their third album with Eric Valentine. The group chose Valentine because he had produced Queens of the Stone Age's Songs for the Deaf (2002) and Third Eye Blind's self-titled album (1997). On April 25, 2006, Taking Back Sunday released their third album, entitled Louder Now, on Warner Bros. Records. The members' comments on the album reflected the dramatic change the band had undergone in the two years since their last release. Matt Rubano noted that the move to a major label was not something the band took lightly, but it was a move that made sense given the band's tumultuous past. Lazzara stated that fans seemed to feel their live shows had more energy than their recordings, and that Louder Now brought more of that across. Taking Back Sunday received mainstream exposure by appearing on the late night talk shows The Tonight Show with Jay Leno, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, and Late Night with Conan O'Brien, as well as the teen drama Degrassi: The Next Generation in an episode entitled \\"What's It Feel Like To Be A Ghost?\\". In December 2006, the band released its first documentary, Louder Now: PartOne, featuring behind-the-scenes tour footage and four live concerts. Following months of touring to support Louder Now, Taking Back Sunday appeared in the American leg of Live Earth on July 7, 2007. During the summer of 2007, Taking Back Sunday was also a part of Linkin Park's Projekt Revolution tour, along with My Chemical Romance, HIM, and several other bands. On October 30, 2006, the band's former record label, Victory Records, released Notes from the Past, which featured four songs from Tell All Your Friends, six songs from Where You Want To Be, and two B-sides: The Ballad of Sal Villanueva and Your Own Disaster ('04 mix). The band then released Louder Now: Part Two on November 20, 2007, a DVD of unreleased live concert footage from their show at Long Beach Arena in Long Beach, California, which included special features such as the video for \\"Twenty-Twenty Surgery\\", made to be released in Europe. The DVD was packaged with a companion CD featuring eight live tracks, two B-sides that were previously unreleased in America, and a special \\"Twelve Days of Christmas\\" track. In 2007, the band contributed the song \\"What's It Feel Like to Be a Ghost?\\" to the soundtrack for the science fiction action film Transformers, although the song did not appear in the film.

The assumption that dishes will have less junk on them will not affect the occurrence of earthquakes or their intensity. The perturbation mentioned is not related to the process of plate tectonics and does not directly or indirectly impact any step of the process. To further understand plate tectonics and earthquakes, let's overview the process: 1. Plates on the Earth's crust move slowly past each other: The Earth's lithosphere is divided into several tectonic plates, which float on the semi-fluid asthenosphere. These plates move slowly due to the convection currents generated in the underlying mantle. 2. As the plates move, they exert a great force: The movement of the tectonic plates leads to the buildup of tension and stress at the plate boundaries, where plates interact through processes such as spreading, subduction, collision, or sliding past each other. 3. When the force is large enough, the crust breaks: As the stress at the plate boundaries increases, eventually the rocks will reach their breaking point and rupture, creating faults. 4. The stress is released as energy: When the rocks break, the stored energy is released in the form of seismic waves, which radiate out from the point of rupture, known as the earthquake's focus. 5. The energy moves through the Earth in the form of waves: Seismic waves propagate through the Earth's interior and along its surface, causing the ground to shake. 6. We feel the earthquake: The shaking and vibrations caused by seismic waves can be felt at the Earth's surface, and depending on their magnitude and proximity to populated areas, earthquakes can cause varying degrees of damage to infrastructure, the environment, and human life. In conclusion, the assumption that dishes will have less junk on them does not directly or indirectly impact any step of the process involved in plate tectonics and earthquakes. The perturbation is not applicable to the process, as earthquakes are caused by the movement and interaction of tectonic plates and are not influenced by the state of dishes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Sword of Osman was an important sword of state used during the enthronement ceremony of the sultans of the Ottoman Empire. The sword was named after Osman I, founder of the Ottoman Dynasty. The practice started when Osman I was girt with the sword of Islam by his mentor and father-in-law Sheikh Edebali. The girding of the sword of Osman was a vital ceremony which took place within two weeks of a sultan's accession to the throne. It was held at the tomb complex at Eyüp, on the Golden Horn waterway in the capital Constantinople. Even though the journey from Topkap Palace (where the sultan resided) to the Golden Horn was short, the sultan would board a boat amid much pomp to go there. The Eyüp tomb complex was built by Mehmed II in honour of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, a companion of Muhammad who had died during the first Muslim siege of Constantinople in the 7th century. The sword girding thus occurred on what was regarded as sacred grounds, and linked the newly enthroned sultan both to his 13th-century ancestors and to Muhammad himself. - The Ottoman Empire ('; Modern Turkish: ' or '), also known as the Turkish Empire, Ottoman Turkey, was an empire founded at the end of the thirteenth century in northwestern Anatolia in the vicinity of Bilecik and Söüt by the Oghuz Turkish tribal leader Osman. After 1354, the Ottomans crossed into Europe, and with the conquest of the Balkans the Ottoman Beylik was transformed into a transcontinental empire. The Ottomans ended the Byzantine Empire with the 1453 conquest of Constantinople by Mehmed the Conqueror. - Mehmed VI (\\"Memed-i sâdis\\", \\"Vahideddin\\", or ), who is also known as \\"ahbaba\\" (meaning \\"Emperor-father\\") among his relatives, (14 January 1861 16 May 1926) was the 36th and last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire, reigning from 1918 to 1922. The brother of Mehmed V, he succeeded to the throne as the eldest male member of the House of Osman after the 1916 suicide of Abdülaziz's son Yusuf Izzettin Efendi, the heir to the throne. He was girded with the Sword of Osman on 4 July 1918, as the thirty-sixth \\"padishah\\". His father was Sultan Abdülmecid I and mother was Gülüstü Hanm (1830 1865), an ethnic Abkhazian, daughter of Prince Tahir Bey Çaçba and his wife Afie Lakerba, originally named Fatma Çaçba. Mehmed was removed from the throne when the Ottoman sultanate was abolished in 1922. - Gülüstü Hanm; (1840 1865) was the Empress consort of Sultan Abdülmecid I. She was the mother of Mehmed VI, the last Sultan of the Ottoman Empire. - Abdülmecid I (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Abdül-Mecd-i evvel\\"; 23/25 April 182325 June 1861), also known as Abdulmejid and similar spellings, was the 31st Sultan of the Ottoman Empire and succeeded his father Mahmud II on 2 July 1839. His reign was notable for the rise of nationalist movements within the empire's territories. Abdülmecid wanted to encourage Ottomanism among the secessionist subject nations and stop the rise of nationalist movements within the empire, but failed to succeed despite trying to integrate non-Muslims and non-Turks more thoroughly into Ottoman society with new laws and reforms. He tried to forge alliances with the major powers of Western Europe, namely the United Kingdom and France, who fought alongside the Ottoman Empire in the Crimean War against Russia. In the following Congress of Paris on 30 March 1856, the Ottoman Empire was officially included among the European family of nations. Abdülmecid's biggest achievement was the announcement and application of the Tanzimat (Reorganization) reforms which were prepared by his father and effectively started the modernization of the Ottoman Empire in 1839. For this achievement, one of the Imperial anthems of the Ottoman Empire, the March of Abdülmecid, was named after him. - The Ottoman Empire used anthems since its foundation in the late 13th century, but did not use a specific imperial or national anthem until the 19th century. During the reign of Mahmud II, when the military and imperial band were re-organized along Western lines, Giuseppe Donizetti was invited to head the process. Donizetti Pasha, as he was known in the Ottoman Empire, composed the first Western-style imperial anthem, the \\"Mahmudiye Mar\\". - The March of Abdülmecid (Turkish: \\"Mecidiye Mar\\") was the national anthem of the Ottoman Empire. The title refers to Abdülmecid I (18391861). There were different anthems for each sultan. - Mehmed V Reshad ( Ottoman Turkish : Memed - i âmis , Turkish : Mehmed V Read or Reat Mehmet ) ( 2 November 1844 -- 3 July 1918 ) was the 35th Ottoman Sultan . He was the son of Sultan Abdülmecid I. He was succeeded by his half - brother Mehmed VI . - Padeshah, Padshah, Padishah or Badishah is a superlative royal title of Persian origin, composed of the Persian \\"pd\\" \\"master\\" and the widespread \\"shh\\" \\"king\\", which was adopted by several monarchs claiming the highest rank, roughly equivalent to the ancient Persian notion of \\"The Great\\" or \\"Great King\\", and later adopted by post-Achaemenid and Christian Emperors. Its Arabized pronunciation as Badshah was used by Mughal emperors. - Mahmud II (Ottoman Turkish: \\"Mahmud-u sn\\", \\"Mahmud-u Âdlî\\") (20 July 1785 1 July 1839) was the 30th Sultan of the Ottoman Empire from 1808 until his death in 1839. He was born in the Topkap Palace, Constantinople, the posthumous son of Sultan Abdul Hamid I. - Ottomanism (\\"Osmanllk\\" or \\"Osmanlclk\\") was a concept which developed prior to the First Constitutional Era of the Ottoman Empire. Its proponents believed that it could solve the social issues that the empire was facing. Ottomanism was strongly influenced by thinkers such as Montesquieu and Rousseau and the French Revolution. It promoted equality among the \\"millet\\"s. The idea originated amongst the Young Ottomans in areas such as the acceptance of all separate ethnicities in the Empire regardless of their religion, i.e. they were all 'Ottomans' with equal rights. Put simply, Ottomanism stated that all subjects were equal before the law. Ideally, all citizens would share a geographical area, a language, culture, and a sense of a 'non-Ottoman' party who were different than them. The essence of the \\"millet\\" system was not dismantled, but secular organizations and policies were applied. Primary education, conscription, head tax and military service were to be applied to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. - Paris (French: ) is the capital and most populous city of France. It has an area of and a population in 2013 of 2,229,621 within its administrative limits.

Context: In the 20th century after decades of intense warfare and political turmoil terms such as \\"Near East\\", \\"Far East\\" and \\"Middle East\\" were relegated to the experts, especially in the new field of political science. The new wave of diplomats often came from those programs. Archaeology on the international scene, although very much of intellectual interest to the major universities, fell into the shadow of international relations. Their domain became the Ancient Near East, which could no longer be relied upon to be the Near East. The Ottoman Empire was gone, along with all the other empires of the 19th century, replaced with independent republics. Someone had to reconcile the present with the past. This duty was inherited by various specialized agencies that were formed to handle specific aspects of international relations, now so complex as to be beyond the scope and abilities of a diplomatic corps in the former sense. The ancient Near East is frozen in time. The living Near East is primarily what the agencies say it is. In most cases this single term is inadequate to describe the geographical range of their operations. The result is multiple definitions. A:","completion":"The diplomatic corps had trouble with reconciling the present with the past, as well as handling the increasingly complex scope and abilities required for international relations. This complexity emerged due to the changes in political landscape, the dissolution of empires, and the emergence of new independent republics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: With almost two years left of my law degree, and with no intention of doing anything so idiotic as actually attending lectures or studying law, I had plenty of time to come up with my next bid for online fame. The Griff Rhys Jones TV project had stalled after a couple of meetings when everyone involved realised that the idea - to pipe broadband comedy programming into the nation's workplaces under the noses of bosses - was a bit of a non-starter. But I had become quite good friends with Rhys Jones's partner in the project, a comedy writer called Charlie Skelton, and he, Clare and I frequently met to brainstorm possible projects we might work on together. It was during one of these meetings that Clare proposed the idea of starting a comedy magazine - something like Private Eye, but for the Internet generation. My days as a school magazine publisher had taught me that printing magazines and distributing them was a royal pain in the arse and, anyway, if it was to be a magazine for the Internet generation then shouldn't it actually be on the Internet? The Zingin.com newsletter had attracted a ton of subscribers and had a distribution cost of basically nothing so why, I suggested, didn't we start a weekly comedy ezine, sent out by email? And, in a nod to Charlie's failed office comedy project, we could target it at bored office workers, sending the email to them on a Friday afternoon to cure the crushing boredom of those final few hours of the working week. And with that, The Friday Thing was born. To promote our fledgling publication we came up with a brilliant ruse: an online petition to have Friday afternoons declared a national holiday. British people worked harder than any other Europeans (we made up) and so it was only fair that our working week should end at noon on a Friday. We created an official website explaining our demands, registered a web address - letsgetitoff.com (snigger) - and sent a press release to the media.

Coming off their Monday Night road win over the Broncos, the Packers flew to Arrowhead Stadium for a Week 9 interconference duel with the Kansas City Chiefs (the only team that QB Brett Favre had never beaten). After a scoreless first quarter, Green Bay drew first blood with rookie kicker Mason Crosby getting a 48-yard and a 36-yard field goal. However, the Chiefs would take the lead into halftime as RB Larry Johnson completed a 1-yard TD run. In the third quarter, the Packers regained the lead as Favre completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Greg Jennings for the only score of the period. In the fourth quarter, Kansas City regained the lead with QB Damon Huard completing a 30-yard TD pass to Johnson. Green Bay replied with Crosby kicking a 32-yard field goal, yet the Chiefs answered with Huard completing a 17-yard TD pass to TE Tony Gonzalez (with RB Priest Holmes getting the 2-point conversion run). The Packers pulled back into the lead as Favre and Jennings hooked up again on a 60-yard TD pass. Afterwards, Crosby made a 45-yard field goal, and CB Charles Woodson returned an interception 46&#160;yards for a touchdown. With the win, the Packers improved to 7-1. Brett Favre also became the third quarterback to defeat all of the other 31 NFL teams at least once. Peyton Manning and Tom Brady had been the first two to do so, just hours apart, the week before.

After two falling amateurs leave the family dangling, Royce forces Peter to cut him loose to save Peter and his sister. Peter has since retired from climbing, becoming a full-time wildlife photographer, and Annie has gone on to become a renowned mountain climber. Their relationship is strained as Annie still blames Peter for obeying Royce instead of waiting for her to secure the rope. Three years later, during a wildlife photo shoot for National Geographic in the lower Himalayas in Pakistan, Peter's assistant falls and breaks his leg and has to be evacuated by the Pakistani Army stationed in a military station that monitors avalanches. Peter is dropped off at K2 Base Camp and searches for Annie who is planning a summit attempt on K2, the world's second highest and most dangerous mountain. The expedition is funded by wealthy industrialist Elliot Vaughn (Paxton) who is also taking part as he wants to attempt climbing the K2 for the second time after his first attempt ended in tragedy with him as sole survivor.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Vertical Limit,\\" the can that the teams carried with them contained nitroglycerin. Nitroglycerin is a powerful and sensitive explosive substance which was needed to initiate a rescue mission at a higher elevation on K2. The reason for carrying nitroglycerin in the movie is to blast out a crevasse (a deep crack or fissure in the ice on a glacier) in order to rescue Annie, Elliot Vaughn, and Tom McLaren who had fallen into it during their summit attempt on K2 mountain. The crevasse they were in could not be accessed by normal means, and hence the dangerous decision to transport and use nitroglycerin to create an opening was made. Carrying nitroglycerin at such high altitudes and extreme conditions adds an element of risk and challenge in the movie, as it is extremely sensitive to shocks and temperature changes. The task becomes even more daunting as the rescue team has to handle the cans carefully to avoid tragedy while traversing the treacherous environment of the mountain.

Body after body is discovered with one peculiar detail – all the victims' bodies are missing hair and pieces of clothing, leaving the townspeople mystified and terrified. Detective Jacques Moreau, a tough but seasoned investigator from Paris, is brought to Grasse to help solve these bizarre murders. He quickly learns about the town's unique obsession with fragrances, and realizes that the killer might be fixated on scent too. He begins digging into the lives of people working closely with the world of fragrances, and eventually stumbles upon the name of Grenouille, a mysterious and enigmatic figure in the perfume industry. Meanwhile, Dominique Druot, a sweet-tempered florist, unexpectedly finds bundles of the victims' hair and pieces of their clothing in her backyard. Frightened by this grisly discovery, she contacts Detective Moreau and provides him with the evidence. Little did she know, she just became the killer's next potential target. As the body count rises, Moreau begins to unravel Grenouille's twisted motive behind the murders: the quest to create the perfect fragrance, using ingredients extracted from the very essence of his victims. Grenouille believes that this perfume would grant him a power of manipulation and god-like control over people's emotions; he would become both feared and loved by all who inhale its alluring scent. Determined to stop Grenouille and save Dominique, Moreau sets up a trap at an upcoming perfume exhibition in Grasse. With the town's elite and high-profile members in attendance, Grenouille is expected to source his next set of victims. However, Grenouille, with his exceptional sense of smell, discovers Moreau's plans and becomes aware of Dominique's involvement. In a thrilling and nail-biting climax, Moreau and Grenouille finally come face to face in a battle of wits and power, with Dominique's life hanging in the balance. Grenouille, armed with the very perfume he's been concocting, tries to use it against the detective. With his keen intuition and sheer determination, Moreau manages to turn the tables on Grenouille by exposing him to his own creation. Overpowering Grenouille with the scent of his own handiwork, Moreau is able to rescue Dominique and bring the twisted perfume-maker to justice. As they walk away from the scene, Moreau and Dominique take a deep breath of the crisp, lavender-scented air, and for a moment, Grasse is returned to its former state of peace and serenity, leaving the dark events of the past behind."},{"prompt":"Give me the correct facts to answer this: what job does bill rancic have?","completion":"Bill Rancic is an entrepreneur, author, television personality, and speaker.

When the sky is dark with sand, buses and cars all move much more slowly. Sometimes, people can't even see for 20 metres. Sandstorms usually happen in spring. This year, sandstorms started in late March. They have happened in more than 10 provinces in northern China this year. More than 70 million people have had problems in those places because of the sandstorms. People in southern China don't have to worry about this kind of bad weather. Most of the sand comes from Gansu and Inner Mongolia . In northern China, lots of places have few trees and don't get much rain. People there have been cutting down too many trees. When there aren't many trees, the ground can't keep enough water. Over the years, the ground dries up and turns to sand. When spring comes and the ice melts , the ground becomes looser . Strong winds take the loose sand into the sky. Sandstorms are bad for people's health. If people breathe too much sand, they could cough or have asthma . Sandstorms also give farmers lots of problems. Sometimes their sheep get lost in the storms and never get back home. The winds also tear down farmers' houses. What can you do to stop sandstorms?

This season is characterized by the melting of ice, which leads to looser ground, allowing strong winds to pick up and carry the loose sand into the sky.

The text states that more than 10 provinces in northern China have experienced sandstorms this year, affecting over 70 million people. The primary source of sand in these storms is attributed to the Gansu and Inner Mongolia regions. In contrast, people in southern China don't have to worry about this type of weather event. Sandstorms have a negative impact on both people's health and the livelihood of farmers. Breathing in excessive amounts of sand can result in coughing and asthma, while farmers face issues related to lost livestock and damage to their property from the strong winds.

On February 7th, Bosnia-Herzegovina made an announcement regarding the initiation of a tender process aimed at establishing the necessary infrastructure for facilitating the transition from analog to digital television. This move signifies the country's commitment towards embracing modern technology and improving its communication systems. The transition from analog to digital television is a significant and vital step for any country, as it offers numerous advantages. Some of these benefits include higher picture and sound quality, more efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum, increased channel capacity, and the ability for viewers to access additional information and services through their television sets. To successfully implement this transition and achieve these benefits, Bosnia-Herzegovina must invest in the development of a robust digital terrestrial television (DTT) infrastructure. This will involve the procurement of required technical equipment, installation of transmission towers, and ensuring the availability of frequencies and signal coverage throughout the country. Additionally, the government will need to design and implement a comprehensive public information and awareness campaign to educate the population about the upcoming switch from analog to digital television and help them understand the benefits and requirements for receiving digital broadcasts. This may include offering subsidies or incentives for citizens to upgrade their television sets or purchase digital converters. Moreover, stakeholders involved in the broadcasting sector, such as broadcasters, regulators, and manufacturers, will need to collaborate closely to ensure a smooth and efficient migration process. This will entail addressing challenges such as spectrum allocation and licensing, adherence to international standards, and the development of local content and programming to cater to diverse linguistic and cultural needs.

In anaphase, sister chromatids separate into individual chromosomes and are pulled apart.

Step 4: Determine the consequence of the perturbation An uneven distribution of genetic material to the daughter cells can lead to genetic abnormalities or complications in the function and development of the daughter cells. Step 5: Conclusion The perturbation hypothesis, which proposes a decrease in sister chromatids during anaphase due to centrioles separating in prophase, could have a direct effect on the process of mitosis. This effect can result in an uneven distribution of genetic material to the daughter cells, leading to potential abnormalities or complications in their development and function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Starting on Sept. 8, that registration process will require a 14 fee, paid by credit or debit card. ESTA approval, which went into effect in early 2009, allows travelers to enter the United States without a full travel visa, which can cost over 100. The ESTA authorization lasts for two years (or until the individual’s passport expires), and is valid for multiple entries. This creates another potential roadblock for visitors from ESTA-participating countries, who will now need both Internet access and a MasterCard, Visa, American Express or Discover card (or a debit card within those networks). (The C.B.P. says it is looking into expanding to other forms of payment.) The bulk of the 14 fee will fund tourism promotion, with the remainder going toward operation of the ESTA program. Of course, visitors from those participating countries — mostly European and far East Asian — will still need a valid passport for entry. |||||","completion":"Starting from September 8, travelers flying to the United States from certain countries will have to pay a 14 fee, called the \\"tourist tax,\\" if they don't have a U.S. visa.

At this stage, the host's immune system detects the presence of the virus and starts fighting against it. This can lead to various symptoms such as fever, cough, and inflammation as the body tries to eliminate the virus from its system. The outcome might vary depending on multiple factors, including the individual's immune system strength, the aggressiveness of the virus, and any supportive treatment administered to the infected individual. In some cases, the infected individual can recover completely from the infection due to their immune system's successful elimination of the virus. However, in other cases, the virus may cause severe illness or even death if it overwhelms the host's immune system or damages vital organs and tissues. Additionally, after recovery or during infection, the host could develop immunity to the virus, reducing the risk of future infections.

I have never read a novel with so many unfinished subplots - incomplete and unfulfilled relationships (Ginger and Ruben, Stacy and Danny); the murderer left undiscovered to murder and commit incest again with his spouse having full knowledge; the ruination of the Frankel family also with no closure; the anti-Semite group headed by Kyle Breckenridge; no to mention the ambiguous role of Mr. Purdy. The only winner here is the author Ms. Sloan, who seems to have pulled the wool over the eyes of we fools who purchased her book.

These lawyers work with families going through the probate process to liquidate assets (houses, cars, stocks, bonds, etc.) to distribute to surviving heirs. Getting to know probate attorneys can open up a wealth of opportunity with virtually zero competition in acquiring the property. Most of the time families just want to liquidate assets from the estate as quickly as possible to receive their inheritance. You have a VERY motivated seller in this situation. You can usually use their desire for a quick sale to your advantage by buying the property at a greatly discounted price if you can close quickly. It also helps to have the attorney to nudge them along. As you can imagine, people tend to get a bit irrational and spiteful during the course of a typical divorce. At times some people tend to not care about what they receive just as long as the other party receives even less. There is often a home for sale as a result of a divorce. These attorneys will have clients who are filing for bankruptcy and may be interested in selling their home before or after they file. While unfortunate for the bankruptcy filers, the leads from this type of attorney could be very lucrative. You can also find notices of bankruptcy sales in the local newspaper as there is a requirement to post notice before any sale due to bankruptcy. In addition to handling real estate closings, this type of attorney deals with fixing problems people are having with their partnerships, co-ops, joint ventures, etc. They will also know about real estate deals that end up not closing for a variety of reasons, and you can be right there to make an offer to the sellers. Summary:","completion":"Working with probate attorneys can be a great strategy to acquire properties from estates that are being liquidated. Probate attorneys deal with families who are in the process of settling estates of their deceased loved ones. These families often want to liquidate assets like houses, cars, stocks, bonds, and so on as quickly as possible so they can divide the inheritance among the surviving heirs. This scenario usually leads to very motivated sellers who, driven by their urgency, are willing to sell at significantly reduced prices, especially if the buyer can close quickly. Furthermore, the attorney can expedite the process. These attorneys also work closely with individuals going through a divorce. During divorce proceedings, emotions can run high, causing individuals to act out of spite or anger. This often results in properties being sold, not necessarily for the best price, but to ensure the other party gets less. This kind of situation can present opportunities to prospective buyers looking for potentially discounted property. Probate attorneys are also good associates in the realm of bankruptcy cases. They work with clients who are considering bankruptcy and might be interested in offloading their properties before or after filing. These leads can lead to highly profitable scenarios. Moreover, one can find bankruptcy sale notices in local newspapers, as there is a legal obligation to announce these sales publicly. Finally, as these attorneys also handle real estate closings and deal with issues related to partnerships, co-ops, joint ventures, and the like, they can provide access to real estate deals that fall through due to various reasons. This gives a prospective buyer the chance to step in and make an offer. In conclusion, building relationships with probate attorneys can open up a host of opportunities. They are in a unique position to know about motivated sellers due to estate liquidation, divorces, and bankruptcy situations. This kind of contact is invaluable to anyone interested in acquiring property at potentially discounted rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

South Boston teenager Jason Tripitikas is a fan of martial arts films and awakens from a dream of a battle between the Monkey King and celestial soldiers in the clouds. He visits a pawn shop in Chinatown to buy wuxia DVDs and discovers a golden staff. On his way home, Tripitikas is harassed by some hooligans, whose leader Lupo attempts to use him to help them rob the shop-owner Hop, who is shot by Lupo. Hop tells Tripitikas to deliver the staff to its rightful owner and Tripitikas flees with the staff. He is cornered on the rooftop before being pulled off the roof by the staff. When Tripitikas regains consciousness, he finds himself in a village in ancient China that is under attack by armored soldiers. The soldiers see his staff and attempt to seize it. He is saved by the inebriated traveling scholar Lu Yan, a supposed \\"immortal,\\" who remains alert and agile even when drunk. Lu tells him the story of the rivalry between the Monkey King and the Jade Warlord.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: If a mixed number is a b/c then the equation used to convert it to an improper fraction is (ac+b)/c. In this equation: A is the whole number. B is the numerator (the top portion of the fraction). C is the denominator (the bottom portion of the fraction). BEDMAS or PEDMAS dictates that you must first address the numbers in parentheses. Since multiplication and division come first, you will first multiply ac. You will then add b, since that figure is also within parentheses. Finally, you will divide by c, or use c as the new denominator. P/BEDMAS stands for parentheses/brackets, exponents, multiply or divide, and add or subtract. Take the mixed number 1 ⅔ for example: a = 1, b = 2, and c = 3. Multiply ac, which in this example is 3 x 1 = 3. You now know the product of ac = 3, so now it's time to add b = 2: 3 + 2 = 5. This sum, 5, is the new numerator of your improper fraction. Remember that the denominator (c = 3) remains the same from the original fraction, and the new numerator is 5. The improper fraction converted from the original mixed number, therefore, is 5/3. To be certain, you can always double check your math by running the numbers again, or verifying the answer using an online calculator. The simplest form is the smallest and easiest way to represent a fraction. To reduce a fraction to its simplest form, determine if the numerator and denominator have common factors. If they do, select the highest one and divide the numerator and denominator by that number. For instance, in the fraction 9/42, the greatest common factor is 3. Divide both the numerator and denominator by the greatest common factor to get the fraction's simplest form: 9 ÷ 3 / 42 ÷ 3 = 3/14 Summary:","completion":"The article explains the process of converting a mixed number to an improper fraction using the (ac+b)/c equation and the P/BEDMAS order of operations, and provides tips on simplifying fractions to their simplest form by dividing the numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The wreckers are responsible for a series of engineered shipwrecks in which they extinguish coastal warning beacons to cause ships to run aground on the rocky Cornish coast. Then they kill the surviving sailors and steal the cargo from the wrecks. Beautiful, young Mary Yellan (Maureen O'Hara) is travelling to Jamaica Inn in a carriage, but the driver is afraid to stop there and drives a long way past the inn in spite of her repeated demands that he stop. Instead, he drops her off near the home of the local squire and justice of the peace, Sir Humphrey Pengallan (Charles Laughton). She meets him and requests the loan of a horse so she can go back to Jamaica Inn. Pengallan warns her not to go there. Nevertheless, Mary says she just came from Ireland, and as the orphaned niece of Joss's wife Patience (Marie Ney), she intends to live at Jamaica Inn. Unable to convince her to stay, Pengallan accompanies Mary to Jamaica Inn. When Joss meets Mary, he tries to kiss her and push himself on her. Patience is distraught to learn her sister, Mary's mother, has died. When Mary tells Joss that Pengallan has accompanied her to Jamaica Inn, Joss goes upstairs and reports to Pengallan. We learn that Pengallan is the secret criminal mastermind behind the wrecking gang, who finds out when well-laden ships are passing near the coast, determines when and where the wrecks are to be done, disposes of the stolen cargo, and uses the booty to support his lavish lifestyle, passing a small fraction of the takings back to Joss and the gang. In another part of the inn, the gang convenes to discuss why they get so little money for their efforts. They suspect Jem Traherne (Robert Newton), a gang member who has been with them for only two months, of embezzling goods.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the book with accounts of well-documented shark-human interactions at Ahwaz, Iran?, using the article: Another letter to The New York Times blamed the shark infestation on the maneuvers of German U-boats near America's East Coast. The anonymous writer claimed, \\"These sharks may have devoured human bodies in the waters of the German war zone and followed liners to this coast, or even followed the Deutschland herself, expecting the usual toll of drowning men, women, and children.\\" The writer concluded, \\"This would account for their boldness and their craving for human flesh.\\"Decades later, there is no consensus among researchers over Murphy and Lucas's investigation and findings. Richard G. Fernicola published two studies of the event, and notes that \\"there are many theories behind the New Jersey attacks,\\" and all are inconclusive. Researchers such as Thomas Helm, Harold W. McCormick, Thomas B. Allen, William Young, Jean Campbell Butler, and Michael Capuzzo generally agree with Murphy and Lucas. However, the National Geographic Society reported in 2002 that \\"some experts are suggesting that the great white may not in fact be responsible for many of the attacks pinned on the species.

Mr Schumer is the first Democratic Party senator to take such a stand. Correspondents say his move is a serious blow to the president as he urges Congress to back the deal. The nuclear deal calls for Iran to reduce its enrichment in exchange for the releasing of millions of dollars in frozen assets. White House spokesman Josh Earnest said on Friday that Mr Obama has made a persuasive case for the deal, garnering the support of twelve members of Congress. However, Mr Obama is disappointed Mr Schumer is against it, Mr Earnest said. It is considered a major part of Mr Obama's foreign policy legacy. He and his aides are working through the summer Congressional recess to convince lawmakers to back the deal. But Mr Schumer said that after \\"deep study, careful thought and considerable soul-searching\\" he had decided to oppose the agreement when the Senate votes on it in September after the summer recess. The New York senator is among the most powerful Jewish lawmakers in the US and is widely tipped to to become the Democratic party leader in the Senate in early 2017. \\"There are some who believe that I can force my colleagues to vote my way,\\" Mr Schumer said about his opposition to the deal. \\"While I will certainly share my view and try to persuade them that the vote to disapprove is the right one, in my experience with matters of conscience and great consequence like this, each member ultimately comes to their own conclusion,\\" he said.

The senator joins a handful of Jewish Democrat Congress members who are against the deal. President Obama on Wednesday described opponents of the deal as \\"selling a fantasy\\". He said the agreement is publicly supported by every country in the world except for Israel and that the forthcoming Congressional vote on lifting sanctions was either a vote for war or for peace.

The hypothesis suggests that a man is sitting. Since the premise states that the male character (a man) is sitting down to put on his shoes, it indeed implies that the man is sitting. The hypothesis accurately captures the action of the man's posture in the premise without focusing on the additional details present in the premise, such as the color of the man's shirt, the type of pants he is wearing, the color of his shoes, or the action he is undertaking while sitting (putting on his shoes). In essence, the hypothesis is a simplified version of the premise that highlights the primary element of the scene—that a man is sitting. Therefore, given the premise, we can conclude the hypothesis to be accurate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Single/multi-select question: Does the sentence \\"The Kpelle comprise more than 20% of the population and are the largest ethnic group in Liberia, residing mostly in Bong County and adjacent areas in central Liberia.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"Where do the Kpelle reside?\\" Pick from: [I] yes. [II] no.","completion":"[I] yes. The sentence \\"The Kpelle comprise more than 20% of the population and are the largest ethnic group in Liberia, residing mostly in Bong County and adjacent areas in central Liberia.\\" provides a valid answer to the question \\"Where do the Kpelle reside?\\" From the given sentence, we can extract valuable information about the geographical location of the Kpelle ethnic group. The sentence tells us that the Kpelle mostly reside in Bong County and adjacent areas in central Liberia. This information is useful because it narrows down the location of the Kpelle people to a specific region within Liberia. Bong County, situated in the central region of Liberia, is one of the 15 counties that make up the first-level administrative divisions of the country. The county has a population of around 329,000, and its capital is Gbarnga. As mentioned in the sentence, the Kpelle are concentrated primarily in Bong County and the adjacent areas, which could include neighboring counties such as Lofa, Nimba, and Margibi. Moreover, the sentence mentions that the Kpelle people make up more than 20% of the population in Liberia. This fact further validates the answer, as it helps in understanding their significance in terms of the country's demographics. Being the largest ethnic group in the country, they have a considerable presence in the region, and their residing location is a highly relevant piece of information. Considering the data provided in the sentence, it clearly answers the question about where the Kpelle reside. Thus, the correct answer is [I] yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With Iphigenia, Mikhali Cacoyannis is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen. His own screenplay, an adaptation of Euripides' tragedy, was far from easy, compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed. The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Euripides' version and placed in a logical, strictly chronological framework, better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic story-telling. Cacoyannis also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Euripides' tragedy: Odysseus, Calchas, and the army. This was done in order to make some of Euripides' points regarding war, the Church, and Government clearer. Finally, Cacoyannis' Iphigenia ending is somewhat ambiguous when compared to Euripides'. The film was shot on location at Aulis. The director of photography, Giorgos Arvanitis, shows us a rugged but beautiful Greece, where since the Homeric days time seems to have stood still. He takes advantage of the bodies, the arid land, the ruins, the intense light and the darkness. The harshness of the landscape is particularly fitting to the souls of the characters. The camera uses the whole gamut of available shots, from the very long, reinforcing the vastness and desolation of the landscape, as well as the human scale involved, to the extreme close-ups, dissecting and probing deep into the soul of the tormented characters. In particular, the film's opening, with a bold, accelerating tracking shot along a line of beached boats, followed by an aerial view of the many thousands of soldiers lying listlessly on the beach, is a very effective means of communicating Agamemnon's awesome political and military responsibility. No word but \\"sublime\\" can describe the stunning performances of Costa Kazakos (Agamemnon), Irene Papas (Clytemnestra), and Tatiana Papamoschou (Iphigenia). Kazakos and Papas embody the sublimity of the classical Greece tragedy. Kazakos' character is extremely down-to-earth, and his powerful look into the camera, more than his words, reveals the unbelievable torment tearing his soul. Irene Papas is the modern quintessence of classic Greek plays. In Iphigenia, she is terrible in her anguish, and even more so for what we know will be her vengeance. Tatiana Papamoskou, in her first role on the screen, is outstanding in her portray of the innocent Iphigenia, which contrasts with Kazakos' austere depiction of her father, Agamemnon. Cacoyannis is faithful to Euripides in his representation of the other characters: Odysseus is a sly, scheming politician, Achilles, a vain, narcissistic warrior, Menalaus is self centered, obsessed with his honor, eager to be avenged, and to have his wife and property restored. The costumes and sets are realistic: no Hollywood there. Agamemnon's quarters resembles a barn, he dresses, as do the others, in utilitarian, hand-woven, simple garb. Clytemnestra's royal caravan is made up of rough-hewn wooden carts. The music is by the prolific contemporary music composer Mikis Theodorakis. Theodorakis' score intensifies the dramatic and cinematographic unfolding, reflects on the psychological aspect of the tragedy, and accentuates its dimensions and actuality. This film and the story it narrates offer considerable insight into the lost world of ancient Greek thought that was the crucible for so much of our modern civilization. It teaches us much about ourselves as individuals and as social and political creatures. Euripides questions the value of war and patriotism when measured against the simple virtues of family and love, and reflects on woman's vulnerable position in a world of manly violence. In his adaptation of Euripides' tragedy, Cacoyannis revisits all of these themes in a modern, clear, and dramatic fashion. The relationships governing the political machinations are clearly demonstrated: war corrupts and destroys the human soul to such an extent that neither the individual nor the group can function normally any longer. With the possible exception of Menelaus, whose honor has been tarnished by his own wife's elopement with her lover, everyone else has his own private motivation for going to war with Troy, which has nothing to do with Helen: the thirst for power (Agamemnon), greed (the army, Odysseus), or glory (Achilles). And so in a real sense, Helen became the WMD of the Trojan War. The war, stripped of all Homeric glamor and religious sanctioning, was just an imperialist venture, spurred primarily by the desire for material gain, all else being a convenient pretext. Another conflict raised in the film is that between the Church and the State. Calchas, who represents the Church, feeling the challenge to his priestly authority and wishing to destroy Agamemnon for the insult to the Goddess he serves, tells him to sacrifice his daughter. In consenting to the sacrifice, the King comes closer to his moral undoing, but in refusing, loses his power over the masses (his army), who are brainwashed by religion. Of course, for Agamemnon, it's a game. The King must go along with the charade whether he honestly believes in the Gods or not, until he realizes, too late, that he has ensnared himself into committing a despicable filicide. Is it a sacrifice or a murder, and how can we tell the difference between the two? By focusing on the violent and primitive horror of a human sacrifice--and, worst of all, the sacrifice of one's own child--Euripides/Cacoyannis creates a drama that is at once deeply political and agonizingly personal. It touches on a most complex and delicate ethical problem facing any society: the dire conflict between the needs of the individual versus those of the society. In the case of Iphigenia, however, as in the Biblical tale of Abraham and Isaac, the father is asked to kill his own child, by his own hand. What sort of God would insist on such payment? Can it be just or moral, even if divinely inspired? Finally, does the daughter's sacrificial death differ from the deaths of all the sons and daughters who are being sent to war? These are many deep questions raised by a two-hour film.

Given the following context: After the painter's death in 1528, the portraits were held by his brother, and then his brother's widow before they passed into the collection of Willibald Imhoff, a grandson of Dürer's friend Willibald Pirckheimer. Inventories from the Imhoff collection from 1573–74, 1580 and 1588 list both panels. The next surviving Imhoff inventory, of 1628, again lists the mother's portrait, but it disappears after mention in the 1633–58 account books of Hans Hieronymus Imhoff, after which its whereabouts became unknown. Dürer expert Matthias Mende described the missing portrait of Barbara Holper as \\"among the most severe losses in the Dürer oeuvre\\". In 1977, art historian Lotte Brand Philip proposed that Unknown Woman in a Coif, held by the Germanisches Nationalmuseum in Nuremberg, was the original portrait of Barbara Holper. The Nuremberg panel was previously thought to have originated from a member of Wolgemut's workshop, a Franconian artist in his circle, or the anonymous Mainz painter Master W. B. Brand Philip's attribution was based on striking similarities in composition and its shared tone, theme and size with the father panel at the Uffizi. In both works the sitters are holding rosary beads, and Dürer attentively describes their hands. Both portraits show the sitter in the same pose, against a similarly coloured background. Both are lit from the upper left. The boards are identically cut in width and depth, although 3 cm was removed from the left edge of Barbara's panel. Brand Philip noted the similarities between the panel and Dürer's 1514 charcoal drawing Portrait of the Artist's Mother at the Age of 63. Fedja Anzelewsky agreed with the attribution, noting that both portraits bear, on their reverse, the catalogue number recorded in the Imhoff inventories, as well as \\"precisely the same design of masses of dark clouds\\".Anzelewsky speculated that the father's portrait, which was not listed in the 1628 Imhoff inventory, had been broken off and sold to Rudolph II of Austria.

Here is a goal: To prune your tomato plants, How would you accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of pruning tomato plants, I would follow these steps: Step 1: Gather necessary tools To prune tomato plants effectively, I would need a pair of clean, sharp pruning shears or scissors to ensure clean cuts without damaging the plant. Step 2: Identify the type of tomato plant There are two types of tomato plants: determinate and indeterminate. Determinate tomato plants grow to a certain size and produce all their fruit at once, while indeterminate plants continue to grow and produce fruit throughout the season. Pruning is more beneficial for indeterminate plants, as they can grow quite large and unruly. Determinate plants should be pruned minimally if at all, as excessive pruning can reduce their yield. Step 3: Locate the suckers Suckers are the small shoots that grow in the V-shaped area between the main stem and a leaf branch. These suckers will eventually grow into new branches with their own flowers and fruit, competing for nutrients and sunlight with the main stalk. Identifying these suckers is essential for proper pruning. Step 4: Prune the suckers Using the pruning shears or scissors, carefully cut the suckers close to the main stem without damaging the stem or leaf branch. Removing these suckers will encourage the plant to focus its energy on the main stem, promoting healthy growth and fruit production. Step 5: Remove the lower leaves As the plant grows taller, prune off the bottom leaves that are close to the ground. This helps prevent soil-borne diseases from splashing onto the leaves and promotes better air circulation around the base of the plant. Additionally, it makes it easier to water the plant at the root level without wetting the foliage. Step 6: Maintain and monitor Regularly check the tomato plant for new suckers and remove them as needed. Also, monitor the plant's overall health and growth. If it appears too dense or struggling for light, consider pruning additional leaves or branches to promote better air circulation and sunlight exposure. Step 7: Support the plant As the tomato plant grows larger, it may need support to avoid falling over under the weight of the fruit. Install a sturdy stake, cage, or trellis to provide the necessary support, and gently tie the plant to the support structure using soft ties. By following these steps, I would effectively prune tomato plants, promoting healthy growth and abundant fruit production."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Darth Vader turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished. The anguishing sequence in that film was when Luke is tortured and defeated by the Emperor/Darth Sidious. He is about to be destroyed when Darth Vader, Dark Lord of the Sith, eliminates his dark master. A nice sacrifice. The cinematography of this film is impressive. I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers. I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon Calomari, the ewoks, the sullesteian (Lando's co pilot) and many more... Most of my favorite scenes are in that film:1-When Vader destroys the Emperor and is fatally wounded. 2- When Luke sees the spirits of Obi-Wan and Yoda and then it shows up Anakin Skywalker (Sebastian Shaw)(the greatest scene in Star Wars) 3- When LEia slays Jabba strangling the Hutt crime lord. I personally like the script and the battle of Endor presenting a ground and space combat as well the best duel of Star Wars between Darth Vader V.s Luke Skywalker on the Death Star. Post-script: The scenes with Leia in the slave bikini are memorable. 9/10. Would you say this review is positive or negative?

After early successes in the Christian rock scene, Switchfoot first gained mainstream recognition with the inclusion of four of their songs in the 2002 movie A Walk to Remember. This recognition led to their major label debut, The Beautiful Letdown, which was released in 2003 and featured the hits \\"Meant to Live\\" and \\"Dare You to Move\\". In 2005 prior to the release of Nothing Is Sound Switchfoot announced that guitarist Drew Shirley (previously the guitarist for All Together Separate) had become the band's fifth member after touring with the band since 2003. Nothing Is Sound, was released on September 13, 2005, and with Shirley's inclusion saw Switchfoot's sound become even more densely layered and guitar-heavy, resulting in an album that was edgier and darker than any of their previous work. \\"Stars\\" was released as the first radio single to promote the album, and was a solid hit on mainstream and alternative rock radio stations.

A former midfielder, Veron's career started in Estudiantes, continued in Argentina's Boca Juniors, and included stints in several clubs in the Italian Serie A (where he won the Scudetto with Lazio and with Internazionale, and a UEFA Cup with Parma), and England's Manchester United and Chelsea. In 2006, Veron returned to Estudiantes, where he remained until his retirement in 2014, aside from a brief spell with Brandsen. He has announced his short return to first team will occur in Copa Libertadores 2017. Veron was called up for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France, where Argentina was eliminated by the Netherlands in the quarter-finals. A rumour (never confirmed) that Veron had failed an internal doping test, and allegations of laziness hampered his relationship with the media and fans. He was called up again for the 2002 World Cup in Korea/Japan, where Veron was regarded as a key player and captained the side in place of the injured Roberto Ayala. Some fans held him personally responsible for Argentina's dismal performance, which included a loss to England and elimination in the group phase. After then-national coach Jose Pekerman omitted him from the 2006 World Cup squad, his replacement, Alfio Basile recalled Veron to the national squad in February 2007, based on his performance in Estudiantes's 2006 championship team. Veron was a starter in the Argentine team that reached the final of Copa America 2007. Due to injuries and Estudiantes's busy schedule, Veron did not feature in the immediate plans of national coach Diego Maradona, but was recalled to the Argentine squad as a second-half substitute in the 4-0 win over Venezuela on 28 March 2009, Maradona's first competitive game in charge of the national team. He also played in the starting XI in a 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Colombia on 6 June 2009 and was selected by manager Diego Maradona in the final 23-man squad for the finals of the 2010 FIFA World Cup. Veron started Argentina's first group match against Nigeria, and provided the assist for Gabriel Heinze's goal. After missing the match against South Korea due to injury, Veron returned to the starting line-up against Greece and played the full 90 minutes as Argentina won 2-0. He came on as a substitute for Carlos Tevez in the 69th minute in Argentina's 3-1 victory over Mexico in the Round of 16, but did not feature during the quarterfinal loss to Germany. On 26 August 2010, Veron retired from international football.

Can you tell me the answer to who won hell's kitchen season 17 episode 16??","completion":"\\"Hell's Kitchen All Stars\\" or Season 17 of the American competitive reality TV show \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" which is hosted by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay, aired its 16th episode, the season finale, on February 2, 2018. In the final phase of the competition, the last two contestants standing were Michelle Tribble and Benjamin Knack. Michelle Tribble was announced as the winner of Hell's Kitchen Season 17, Episode 16. A Dallas native, Michelle returned to the competition after previously standing as a contestant in season 14 of Hell's Kitchen, where she came in third place. With her win in season 17, she proved her culinary prowess and showed significant growth from her previous stint on the show. In the final episode, both Michelle and Benjamin were tasked with running a full restaurant service, each being put in charge of their own kitchen in Hell's Kitchen, with both leading a team of eliminated contestants. They were assigned to create a five-course meal for the dining audience and scored based on the dishes they created and how smoothly service went. Michelle's win was hard-fought considering the high level of competition and stress. Her leadership skills, creativity, consistency, and strength in delivering exceptional dishes under pressure helped to win over Chef Ramsay. As the grand prize of \\"Hell's Kitchen All Stars\\", Michelle became the head chef at Gordon Ramsay's Hell's Kitchen flagship at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada with a 250,000 salary, which was a huge leap in her culinary career.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Information: - Hydnum is a genus of fungi in the Hydnaceae family. They are notable for their unusual spore-bearing structures of teeth rather than gills. The best known are the edible species \\"Hydnum repandum\\" and \\"H. rufescens\\". The word is derived from \\"(h)udnon\\"/, an Ancient Greek word for truffle. The white or buff \\"Hydnum repandum\\" has a spore scatterer of still another shape. The smooth cap grows as wide as 8 inches across. The stem is off-center and is less than 2 inches long. \\"Hydnum\\" has many brittle, white teeth from which the spores drop. The mushrooms of the \\"Hydnum\\" group grow both on ground and on wood. Some species have teeth which hang from ascending branches, while other species have teeth which project downwards from the undersurfaces of dead wood. Most \\"Hydnum\\" are safe to eat. - The Hydnaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. Originally the family encompassed all species of fungi that produced basidiocarps (fruit bodies) having a hymenium (spore-bearing surface) consisting of slender, downward-hanging tapering extensions referred to as \\"spines\\" or \\"teeth\\", whether they were related or not. This artificial but often useful grouping is now more generally called the hydnoid or tooth fungi. In the strict, modern sense, the Hydnaceae are limited to the genus \\"Hydnum\\" and related genera, with basidiocarps having a toothed or poroid hymenium. Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. \\"Hydnum repandum\\" (the hedgehog fungus) is an edible species, commercially collected in some countries and often marketed under the French name \\"pied de mouton\\". - The Gomphaceae are a diverse family of fungi belonging in what is classically known as the Phallales or cladistically as the gomphoid-phalloid clade. The family has 13 genera and 287 species. - The Cantharellaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains the chanterelles and related species, a group of fungi that superficially resemble agarics (gilled mushrooms) but have smooth, wrinkled, or gill-like hymenophores (spore-bearing undersurfaces). Species in the family are ectomycorrhizal, forming a mutually beneficial relationship with the roots of trees and other plants. Many of the Cantharellaceae, including the chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus cibarius\\"), the Pacific golden chanterelle (\\"Cantharellus formosus\\"), the horn of plenty (\\"Craterellus cornucopioides\\"), and the trumpet chanterelle (\\"Craterellus tubaeformis\\"), are not only edible, but are collected and marketed internationally on a commercial scale. - The Phallales are an order of fungi in the subclass Phallomycetidae. The order contains three families: the Claustulaceae, the Gomphaceae, and the Phallaceae, which, according to a 2008 estimate, collectively contain 26 genera and 88 species. - The Cantharellales are an order of fungi in the class Agaricomycetes. The order includes not only the chanterelles (Cantharellaceae), but also some of the tooth fungi (Hydnaceae), clavarioid fungi (Aphelariaceae and Clavulinaceae), and corticioid fungi (Botryobasidiaceae). Species within the order are variously ectomycorrhizal, saprotrophic, associated with orchids, or facultative plant pathogens. Those of economic importance include edible and commercially collected \\"Cantharellus\\", \\"Craterellus\\", and \\"Hydnum\\" species as well as crop pathogens in the genera \\"Ceratobasidium\\" and \\"Thanatephorus\\" (\\"Rhizoctonia\\"). - Cantharellus is a genus of popular edible mushrooms, commonly known as chanterelles. They are mycorrhizal fungi, meaning they form symbiotic associations with plants, making them very difficult to cultivate. Caution must be used when identifying chanterelles for consumption due to lookalikes, such as the Jack-O-Lantern species (\\"Omphalotus olearius\\" and others), which can make a person very ill. Despite this, chanterelles are one of the most recognized and harvested groups of edible mushrooms. - The Agaricomycetes are a class of fungi in the division Basidiomycota. The taxon is roughly identical to that defined for the Homobasidiomycetes (alternatively called holobasidiomycetes) by Hibbett & Thorn, with the inclusion of Auriculariales and Sebacinales. It includes not only mushroom-forming fungi, but also most species placed in the deprecated taxa Gasteromycetes and Homobasidiomycetes. Within the subdivision Agaricomycotina, which already excludes the smut and rust fungi, the Agaricomycetes can be further defined by the exclusion of the classes Tremellomycetes and Dacrymycetes, which are generally considered to be jelly fungi. However, a few former \\"jelly fungi\\", such as \\"Auricularia\\", are classified in the Agaricomycetes. According to a 2008 estimate, Agaricomycetes include 17 orders, 100 families, 1147 genera, and about 21000 species. Modern molecular phylogenetic analyses have been since used to help define several new orders in the Agaricomycetes: Amylocorticiales, Jaapiales, Stereopsidales, and Lepidostromatales. - The Aphelariaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a small group of tropical and subtropical clavarioid fungi, but is not well characterized and has not been the subject of published research. - The Clavulinaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family is not well defined, but currently comprises species of clavarioid (club and coral) fungi as well as some corticioid (crust- and patch-forming) fungi. These species are nutritionally diverse, some being ectomycorrhizal, others wood-rotting saprotrophs, others lichenized, and yet others lichenicolous (growing on or parasitizing lichens). - Phallaceae is a family of fungi, commonly known as stinkhorn mushrooms, within the order Phallales. Stinkhorns have a worldwide distribution, but are especially prevalent in tropical regions. They are known for their foul-smelling, sticky spore masses, or gleba, borne on the end of a stalk called the receptaculum. The characteristic fruiting-body structure, a single, unbranched receptaculum with an externally attached gleba on the upper part, distinguishes the Phallaceae from other families in the Phalalles. The spore mass typically smells of carrion or dung, and attracts flies and other insects to help disperse the spores. Although there is great diversity in body structure shape among the various genera, all species in the Phallaceae begin their development as oval or round structures known as \\"eggs\\". According to a 2008 estimate, the family contains 21 genera and 77 species. - Phallomycetidae is a subclass of the class Agaricomycetes of fungi. - The Botryobasidiaceae are a family of fungi in the order Cantharellales. The family contains a group of corticioid fungi that form thin, web-like basidiocarps. Some species form asexual anamorphs producing chlamydospores. All are believed to be wood-rotting or litter-rotting saprotrophs. None is known to be of any economic importance. - Craterellus is a genus of generally edible fungi similar to the closely related chanterelles, with some new species recently moved from the latter to the former. Both groups lack true gills on the underside of their caps, though they often have gill-like wrinkles and ridges. - The Gomphales are an order of basidiomycete fungi . Some or all families belonging to Gomphales have been sometimes included in the order Phallales ( and vice versa - they are also sometimes treated as synonyms ) , the now - obsolete Ramariaceae was also previously included in Cantharellales . Recent phylogenetic analyses include in Gomphales the families of the original description of the order by W. Jülich , with addition of Clavariadelphaceae . According to one 2008 estimate , the Gomphales contain 18 genera and 336 species . What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'gomphales'?

Help as much as you can. Answer the following question: Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: The London Underground (The Tube) The main source of public transport in London revolves around the Underground (or the Tube as it is known to Londoners). This network of 12 lines can get you to most places in the center of the city quickly. It's most necessary to get an Oyster Card or a Travelcard. Single tickets are priced starting at the intentionally absurd price of PS 4.80 (Zone 1-3), if you pay cash. Using an Oyster card, a single fare is PS 2.30 if you are traveling within the central Zone 1. On hot days it is also advisable to take a bottle of water with you as Underground trains are not air-conditioned. Last trains leave central London at around 00:30 weekdays, 23:30 Sundays. First trains leave the suburbs at around 5:00. The Bus System Outside the center of London, Tube stations are farther apart, so buses help fill the gaps. Also, the bus offers a cheaper alternative, even if it is a slower journey. Cash fares for London buses have been abolished -- you cannot pay cash. A bus fare costs PS 1.50 if using only buses, the fare is capped at PS 4.40 per day for Oyster or contactless users. River Services There are a number of different routes along the River Thames. The faster commuter services operate all day from Greenwich Pier to Embankment and from Putney and Chelsea harbour to Blackfriars during Peak Hours only. These routes will pass a number of places of interest including the Houses of Parliament and London Bridge. A return fare from Putney to Blackfriars will cost about 12 pounds. National Rail Once you leave Central London or if you are traveling South of the River Thames, the best public transport option will often be National Rail. There are numerous connections to the Rail System from the Tube. Travelcards can be used for travel on the National Rail (but not the Heathrow Express). Oyster cards can be used up to Zone 6 except certain services including Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect and HSI.

Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S). Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied more about portions of montane grasslands? Hint: Alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude. Portions of montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions worldwide include alpine tundra. Large regions of alpine tundra occur in the North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa.Alpine tundra occupies high-mountain summits, slopes, and ridges above timberline. Aspect plays a role as well; the treeline often occurs at higher elevations on warmer equator-facing slopes. Because the alpine zone is present only on mountains, much of the landscape is rugged and broken, with rocky, snowcapped peaks, cliffs, and talus slopes, but also contains areas of gently rolling to almost flat topography.Averaging over many locations and local microclimates, the treeline rises 75 metres (245 ft) when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N, and 130 metres (430 ft) per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 metres (11,500 and 13,100 ft). The answer to this question is:","completion":"To answer the question, we need to determine which latitudes are more related to montane grasslands and alpine tundra. From the hint provided, we know that alpine tundra occurs at high enough altitude at any latitude and is present in montane grasslands and shrublands ecoregions. We also know that alpine tundra is found in various parts of the world like North American Cordillera, the Alps and Pyrenees of Europe, the Himalaya and Karakoram of Asia, the Andes of South America, and the Eastern Rift mountains of Africa. From the information about treelines, we find that the treeline rises 75 meters when moving 1 degree south from 70 to 50°N and 130 meters per degree from 50 to 30°N. Between 30°N and 20°S, the treeline is roughly constant, between 3,500 and 4,000 meters. Comparing the regions that Pam and Alice studied, Pam studied more about high latitudes (70 to 50°N), while Alice studied about lower latitudes (30°N to 20°S).

Regardless of the specific cause, these efforts contribute to the overall health and vitality of a community. Finally, actively participating in social activities can positively impact mental health and overall well-being. Engaging with others—and working together toward common goals—can provide a sense of purpose and accomplishment, as well as impart a greater sense of connectedness among community members. This, in turn, can promote happiness and overall life satisfaction. In summary, being actively engaged in social activities involves participating in a range of community events, projects, and organizations that work toward the betterment of society. This involvement can result in personal growth, skill development, social connections, positive contributions to the community, and enhanced mental well-being."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: In a rare display of bipartisan unity during an election year, Republicans and Democrats alike have condemned presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump for his comments about the ethnicity of a judge overseeing a class action suit against Trump University. Members of both parties lambasted the real estate mogul for remarks that they assert were racist. Trump said he felt U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel, because of his \\"Mexican heritage,\\" would not rule fairly in the case that charged Trump with fraud. Curiel is an American who was born and raised in the midwestern U.S. state of Indiana. U.S. Senator Ben Sasse, a Republican from Nebraska who has criticized Trump on multiple occasions during the campaign, tweeted: \\"Saying someone can't do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of 'racism.''' Also leading the charge Monday were Trump’s two former rivals for the Republican nomination. Ohio Governor John Kasich tweeted that Trump's offensive \\"is flat out wrong.'' Trump, Kasich wrote, should \\"apologize to Judge Curiel & try to unite this country.'' Florida Senator Marco Rubio agreed. \\"It's wrong and I hope he stops.'' But no mea culpa was forthcoming from the candidate. Trump insisted earlier Monday that Curiel could not be impartial in the legal action against him because the jurist's parents were born in Mexico and Trump wants to build a wall along the Mexican border. Republican Senator Susan Collins called Trump's comments \\"absolutely unacceptable.\\" Democratic Congressman Filemon Vela said in an open letter published Monday that Trump's \\"ignorant anti-immigrant opinions,\\" border wall rhetoric and continued attacks on a sitting federal judge \\"are just plain despicable.\\" Vela, who represents a district along the U.S.-Mexico border, says his great-great-grandfather came to the U.S. in 1857 — well before Trump's ancestors. Vela wrote, \\"Mr. Trump you are a racist and you can take your border wall and shove it….\\" Kasich, Rubio and Collins joined other top...

A battle-hardened Huntley-Brinkley reporter later said that no military action he had witnessed had ever frightened or disturbed him as much as what he saw in Birmingham. Two out-of-town photographers in Birmingham that day were Charles Moore, who had previously worked with the Montgomery Advertiser and was now working for Life magazine, and Bill Hudson, with the Associated Press. Moore was a Marine combat photographer who was \\"jarred\\" and \\"sickened\\" by the use of children and what the Birmingham police and fire departments did to them. Moore was hit in the ankle by a brick meant for the police. He took several photos that were printed in Life. The first photo Moore shot that day showed three teenagers being hit by a water jet from a high-pressure firehose. It was titled \\"They Fight a Fire That Won't Go Out\\". A shorter version of the caption was later used as the title for Fred Shuttlesworth's biography. The Life photo became an \\"era-defining picture\\" and was compared to the photo of Marines raising the U.S. flag on Iwo Jima. Moore suspected that the film he shot \\"was likely to obliterate in the national psyche any notion of a 'good southerner'.\\" Hudson remarked later that his only priorities that day were \\"making pictures and staying alive\\" and \\"not getting bit by a dog.\\"Right in front of Hudson stepped Parker High School senior Walter Gadsden when a police officer grabbed the young man's sweater and a police dog charged him. Gadsden had been attending the demonstration as an observer. He was related to the editor of Birmingham's black newspaper, The Birmingham World, who strongly disapproved of King's leadership in the campaign. Gadsden was arrested for \\"parading without a permit\\", and after witnessing his arrest, Commissioner Connor remarked to the officer, \\"Why didn't you bring a meaner dog; this one is not the vicious one.\\" Hudson's photo of Gadsden and the dog ran across three columns in the prominent position above the fold on the front page of The New York Times on May 4, 1963.

Grunge is generally characterized by a sludgy electric guitar sound with a \\"thick\\" middle register and rolled-off treble tone and a high level of distortion and fuzz, typically created with small 1970s-style stompbox pedals, with some guitarists chaining several fuzz pedals together and plugging them into a tube amplifier and speaker cabinet. Grunge guitarists use very loud Marshall guitar amplifiers and some used powerful Mesa-Boogie amplifiers, including Kurt Cobain and Dave Grohl (the latter in early, grunge-oriented Foo Fighters songs ). Grunge has been called the rock genre with the most \\"lugubrious sound\\"; the use of heavy distortion and loud amps has been compared to a massive \\"buildup of sonic fog\\". or even dismissed as \\"noise\\" by one critic. As with metal and punk, a key part of grunge's sound is very distorted power chords played on the electric guitar.Whereas metal guitarists' overdriven sound generally comes from a combination of overdriven amplifiers and distortion pedals, grunge guitarists typically got all of their \\"dirty\\" sound from overdrive and fuzz pedals, with the amp just used to make the sound louder. Grunge guitarists tended to use the Fender Twin Reverb and the Fender Champion 100 combo amps (Cobain used both of these amps). The use of pedals by grunge guitarists was a move away from the expensive, studio-grade rackmount effects units used in other rock genres. The positive way that grunge bands viewed stompbox pedals can be seen in Mudhoney's use of the name of two overdrive pedals, the Univox Super-Fuzz and the Big Muff, in the title of their \\"debut EP Superfuzz Bigmuff\\".

My grandfather’s been falling.” After all, falls are a scary thing. Most people know that falls are dangerous for older adults. The Center for Disease Control (CDC) reports that one in five falls causes a serious injury such as a broken bone or head injury. Fear of falling can also seriously affect an aging adult’s quality of life and sadly, can keep a person from being active and thriving. So, many seniors and family caregivers are interested in fall prevention because the risks are so great. And the good news is that although it’s not possible to prevent all falls, it almost always IS possible to take actions that will reduce the chance of a bad fall. If you want to learn more, you’re in the right place. In this post, I’ll cover: * How understanding why aging adults fall can help you keep an older parent — or yourself — safer, * Why personalized fall prevention plans work better than relying on general fall prevention tips, * The four-step process I use to help older adults prevent falls, * A practical example showing you how to use these steps to avoid falls yourself. First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can — and should — try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall.

Here is an article: If ever an actor was the theatrical equivalent of a banner headline, that actor is Nathan Lane. Lane, who plays the bellowing editor Walter Burns, arrives a little more than halfway through the revival of The Front Page at the Broadhurst Theatre, splashed across the stage like a 72-point font. His jubilant, giant performance injects a cantankerous vitality into Jack O’Brien’s otherwise pleasant and respectful revival. The talky, gleefully squawky 1928 play by Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur is a comedy as black as shoe polish. It is also a passionate op-ed on the romance of the bygone newspaper industry. The action is set in a press room at the criminal courts building on the eve of the hanging of a cop killer, Earl Williams (John Magaro). The forthcoming execution doesn’t especially trouble the old hands who have gathered here to drink, jaw, play a hand of poker, and call in the occasional story. Their only complaint is the timing of the hanging. “Why can’t they jerk these guys at a reasonable hour so we can get some sleep?” one gripes. The plot coagulates when Williams escapes from custody, just as the longtime reporter Hildy Johnson (a dapper, oddly wan John Slattery) announces his retirement from the city pages in favor of marriage to Peggy (Halley Feiffer) and a cushy job in advertising. (As Slattery only recently finished his run on Mad Men, that line gets a particular laugh.) “Journalists,” Hildy complains, “peeking through keyholes. Running after fire engines like a lot of coach dogs. Waking people up in the middle of the night to ask them what they think of companionate marriage … a lot of lousy, daffy ‘buttinskis’, swelling around with holes in their pants, borrowing nickels from office boys! And for what?” The business, of course, won’t let him go so easily, especially when a scoop beckons. The set is handsome, the dialogue sharp-witted, the cast an assemblage of some of New York’s finest character actors (Jefferson Mays, David Pittu and Dylan Baker) and big names including John Goodman. The style is vivid and almost expressionist in the way that conversations are layered over around each other. Some of the discussion of race and gender is fairly unreconstructed, but O’Brien has excised the nastiest words. Yet the revival’s energy is something less than crackling and the enterprise might have seemed merely respectable were it not for the joyously disreputable Lane. Dressed in a homburg hat and a chalk-stripe suit, with a moustache that looks like a chipmunk has attached itself to his upper lip, he gives a performance that is both outsized and just the right size. A man seemingly devoid of ethics (he won’t let a little thing like kidnapping or arson stand in the way of a good story), his Burns is outrageous, disgraceful and yet impossible not to adore. He represents the best and worst of journalism, the selfish and single-minded pursuit of the truth (and advertising dollars). Print media may be imperiled, but one has the sense that were Lane’s Burns in charge, he’d shout it right back into shape.

Review: I used to watch Pufnstuf every weekend when I was about 10. It was on right after Bay City Rollers. I saw it come on to Family Channel one day, and taped it for my then three-year old daughter. I'd forgotten all the things I'd loved as a child, the magic flute, the zoom broom, Witcheepoo's makeup. This show is decidedly low tech. The mayor is surely a precedent to Mayor McCheese, and everyone is a stuffed creature with annoying googly eyes. But kids love this stuff. They would way, way rather watch a guy work a sock puppet than sit in front of high-tech computer animation. There is (mild) slapstick, but no adult themes such as sex or people dying, and kids accept Jimmy's schemes. Kids think it would be neat to carry a bag of smoke around and convince someone their house was on fire, and I loved how every time my daughter saw a jet stream in the sky she thought Witchypoo was flying overhead. The music is old, but you really get used to it, and my daughter really loved it. She used to sing \\"different is hard, different is lonely\\" in the car. My daughter watched this show at least once a day for about 5 months, and it's still one of her favourites. I see that a new Pufnstuf 2000 is in the works. I really hope they try to keep the old flavour and don't do anything like computer-animating characters etc. I think a whole new generation would love Pufnstuf. Now, what is this review like?

Many well-known companies have their headquarters in Nebraska, such as Berkshire Hathaway, Union Pacific Railroad, and Mutual of Omaha. Nebraska is rich in natural resources, such as water, fertile soil, and minerals like oil, natural gas, and limestone. The Platte River, which traverses the state from west to east, is particularly important for agriculture and wildlife habitat. Additionally, Nebraska boasts several natural landmarks, such as Chimney Rock, Scotts Bluff, and the Sandhills, which contain sand dunes and mixed-grass prairies. The state has a strong cultural heritage, with influences from Native American tribes, European settlers, and African American populations. Nebraska hosts a number of annual festivals and celebrations, such as the Nebraska State Fair, the Sandhill Crane migration, and Omaha's Juneteenth celebration.

Article: Do you know the open-air art gallery in London's Blackall Street? Probably -not. Not many Londoners know it either, but Henri does and he is willing to show it to you. Henri used to sleep in parks until he met a charity that helps homeless people get back on their feet by becoming tour guides. Rather than show traditional London sights, \\"Unseen Tours\\" t _ Henri has been teaching tourists about the history and architecture of Shoreditch, where he slept on public benches for three years. When he felt separated from the society, contact with the volunteer network \\"The Sock Mob\\" gave Henri hope. \\"Not everyone just looked down on me,\\" he said. The tours aren't the only actions trying to help those who have suffered a misfortune to stand tall again. An innovative college for homeless people in London, the first of its kind in the country, is attracting hundreds of students. The Recovery College, set up by St Mungo's charity, is providing courses designed to improve technical skills and life skills. According to Andy Williams, who helps to organize the college, the most popular courses have proved to be about raising self-confidence and developing self-pride. Steve, now in his 50s, told a reporter how much of a difference it makes to \\"have a bit of confidence\\". He had difficulty learning to read and had to leave school when he was 12. Because Steve's problem was not recognized at the time, he was \\"seen to be unable to read or write\\", and suffered with depression and alcohol addiction. He says the status of \\"student\\" is itself important for people who are used to being treated as outcasts Some charities aim not only to help the homeless become independent but also to make them popular. The Homeless World Cup started ten years ago. Today the tournament draws teams from 48 countries made up of players-men and women-who are, or have been, living in the streets.

The outlaws have stolen the father's grey horse with a double SS brand. Max sets out to avenge their deaths and uses this clue to trail the men. During his travels in the desert, Max uncovers an old and rusty gun. When he comes upon Jonas Cord, Sr, a traveling gunsmith, he tries to rob him. Cord, recognizing that Max's revolver is not loaded and is useless, convinces Max that his plan has failed. Max tells Cord of his vengeful journey.

Friends old and new gathered in the art and performance hall, located in the heart of the city's Beyoglu district, for a smoke-filled goodbye accompanied by live music and doses of nostalgia. Kooperatif closed its doors in Rumeli Han, a venerable 19th-century Ottoman shopping arcade that until recently housed an eclectic mix of tenants, including an Indian cultural center, a rock-climbing wall and the district headquarters of the Turkish Communist Party. Safak Velioglu, founder and owner of Kooperatif, called Rumeli Han a \\"small republic.\\" To get to OPTIONS: - Beyoglu, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - CNN, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Communist Party, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Indian, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Istanbul, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Kooperatif, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Ottoman, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Rumeli Han, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Safak Velioglu, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. - Turkish, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls.","completion":"To get to Kooperatif, visitors had to dip down a narrow staircase on a Beyoglu side street and stumble into an old brick basement painted white with remnants of past art installations plastered along the walls. However, as the night wore on and the final drinks were served, the boisterous crowd sensed that it was not only the end of an era for the iconic Kooperatif but for the entire Rumeli Han community. Gentrification had reached this small, creative, and vibrant republic, and property developers were already eyeing the valuable, diverse space, planning to transform it into luxury hotels and upscale boutiques. Those who made Rumeli Han their home were forced to pack their bags and say their goodbyes, leaving behind a space that once thrived with the eclectic culture of their community. But it was during these final moments that hope flickered through the air. United by their love for their unique community, the residents of Rumeli Han decided that they wouldn't lose everything without a fight. They rallied together and formed a coalition to resist the gentrification and preserve their beloved cultural hub. Months of protests and negotiations followed, with the passionate group of residents highlighting the historical and cultural significance of Rumeli Han. They launched petitions, raised money, and drummed up support from the Istanbul residents outside their community. Media outlets, including CNN, began to focus on their plight, casting a spotlight on the destruction of their cultural oasis. Their efforts finally paid off when Turkish officials took note of their persistence and the overwhelming public support. The authorities eventually agreed to halt the aggressive renovation plans and introduced new regulations safeguarding the heritage and identity of Rumeli Han. They recognized the importance of preserving the district's historical values and striking a balance between modernization and cultural conservation, transforming the redevelopment plans into a more sustainable, community-friendly project. With the success of their protest, the people of Rumeli Han breathed a collective sigh of relief. Kooperatif and the other unique establishments were allowed to remain, and the community was rejuvenated as artists and cultural enthusiasts flocked to the district, eager to contribute to a thriving creative scene. And so, in the face of the rapidly transforming landscape of Istanbul, Rumeli Han's \\"small republic\\" stood tall, evolving to the ever-changing world while fiercely protecting their cultural heritage. It continued to be a home for artists, musicians, and free spirits while serving as an inspiring reminder of the importance of community and a powerful symbol of resilience. The story ends with the people of Rumeli Han celebrating their victory, welcoming new friends and visitors into their cherished space, and immortalizing their unwavering spirit through music, art, and above all, the unwavering spirit of unity and love for their home in the ever-evolving city of Istanbul."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer.

Given the question: Few athletes would disagree that more muscle is an advantage in their sport. And protein is the perfect source of amino acid building blocks needed for new muscle growth and repair. Taken together, strength training and sufficient protein will stimulate new muscle protein synthesis. Note that the keyword here is sufficient, because this is where protein supplement marketers like to extend to “the more the better”. So how much protein do sportspeople need? Consensus position statements such as those produced by the American College of Sports Medicine give the range of 1.2 grams to 1.7 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight. But the top end of that range is for elite endurance athletes, power sportspeople and those in the early stages of a strength training phase. The “recreational athlete”, which describes the majority of active sportspeople, should aim for the bottom end of the range. So how do those protein requirement numbers stack up against a regular diet? Protein intake and body weights collected in the 2011-2012 Australian Health Survey, as an example, show the average Australian male already eats 1.2 grams and the average female 1.1 grams of protein per kilogram body weight. And this is for mostly sedentary people who are not following any special “high protein” training diet. Sportspeople do have higher energy needs. But by simply eating a greater volume of food with a focus on higher protein content, it’s very feasible for an athlete to get their protein requirements from food alone. This has been backed up by research; numerous dietary surveys show the normal diet of strength-based athletes provides around two grams of protein per kilogram body weight per day. And that’s before using any protein powders. But protein supplements can’t be dismissed altogether. There are circumstances where supplementation is an appropriate and convenient option for athletes, such as when travelling, or during an intense training schedule. After the article, what will sportspeople probably consume? - Only protein supplements so they can eat whatever they want - not enough information - More foods that are higher in protein - They'll consume less protein and more carbs for energy The answer is:","completion":"- More foods that are higher in protein"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Antifreeze could also be called “antiboil” because it also raises the boiling point of the water in a car radiator. Hot weather combined with a hot engine can easily raise the temperature of the water in the radiator above 100 °C, which is the boiling point of pure water. If the water boils, it could cause the engine to overheat and become seriously damaged. However, if antifreeze has been added to the water, the boiling point is much higher. For example a 50 percent antifreeze solution has a boiling point of 129 °C. Unless the water gets hotter than this, it won’t boil and ruin the engine. I am facing a new situation today: Rob is an auto mechanic. He was checking the radiators of his car and truck. He put antifreeze into the car radiator, but didn't put any antifreeze into the truck radiator. He was wondering how the vehicles would fare in coming hot weather. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which vehicle would do worse in hot weather and hot engine, car or truck? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the situation with Rob, the vehicle that would fare worse in hot weather and hot engine conditions would be the truck. This is because Rob did not add any antifreeze to the truck radiator. Without antifreeze, the boiling point of the water in the truck's radiator remains at 100 °C. As a result, the truck is more susceptible to engine overheating and potential damage due to boiling water in the radiator. On the other hand, Rob added antifreeze to the car radiator, which increases the boiling point of the water-antifreeze mixture to around 129 °C (assuming a 50% antifreeze solution). This significantly reduces the likelihood of the car's engine overheating and suffering damage in hot weather and hot engine conditions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

At 06:14 Egyptian time (04:14 GMT), the plane failed to make scheduled contact with air traffic control based in Larnaca, Cyprus. The plane disappeared from radar screens six minutes later while flying over central Sinai. Egyptian authorities said no SOS calls were received by air traffic controllers. Russia's Interfax news agency cited a source in Cairo as saying \\"uncharacteristic\\" sounds were picked up by the cockpit voice recorder before the plane disappeared from radar screens. \\"The recordings suggest that an emergency situation occurred on board unexpectedly and took the crew by surprise,\\" the source said. Data released by the flight tracking website Flightradar24 showed that just before the radar signal was lost, the aircraft reached an altitude of more than 33,000ft (10,060m), then started to descend with a vertical speed of about 6,000ft a minute. The plane's forward speed meanwhile dropped to around 170km/h (105mph), slower than the speed necessary to continue safe flight. Egyptian military aircraft subsequently located the wreckage of the plane in the Hasana area, 95km (59 miles) south of the Mediterranean coastal town of el-Arish. Russian officials said the wreckage was scattered across a 20 sq km (7.7-sq mile) area, meaning that the plane broke up in mid-air before falling to earth. Russia said on 17 November that a \\"terror act\\" was responsible for the crash and that \\"traces of foreign explosives\\" were found on debris of the Airbus. UK security service investigators say they suspect someone with access to the aircraft's baggage compartment inserted an explosive device inside or on top of the luggage just before the plane took off. A US official told AP on 4 November that US intelligence agencies also had preliminary evidence that suggested a bomb planted by the local affiliate of the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) brought down the plane. Militants from that affiliate, known as Sinai Province, said they brought down the plane shortly after it crashed, with a spokesman claiming this was \\"in response to Russian air strikes that killed hundreds of Muslims on Syrian land\\". But he did not provide evidence, asserting: \\"We are not obliged to disclose the mechanism of its demise.\\" Egyptian officials have said it is too early to draw conclusions on the cause. Both of the plane's \\"black boxes\\" have been recovered as part of the investigation. Sinai plane crash: Four theories Could Islamic State have bombed Flight 9268?

As the plane was registered in Ireland - the home of the company that leased the aircraft to Kogalymavia - a team of Irish investigators have also travelled to Egypt. German experts are also involved because the plane was assembled in Germany in 1997, and its flight recorders were made there. The plane was carrying 224 people in total, including 219 Russian citizens, four Ukrainians and one Belarus national. Of the 217 passengers, 17 were children. Most of the passengers were tourists. Many of the victims were members of the same families. A large number of them shared the same last name, and it appears that in some cases three generations of the same family perished in what is believed to be the worst air disaster involving a Russian plane. Sinai plane crash: The victims The twin-engine A321 has a range of up to 7,400km (4,000 nautical miles). It can accommodate up to 220 passengers. The plane which crashed was 18 years old, making it one of the oldest A321s in service. It had flown for 56,000 hours over nearly 21,000 flights, according to Airbus. It was produced in May 1997 and delivered to the Lebanese carrier Middle East Airlines. It changed hands eight times before being leased in 2012 to Kogalymavia, an airline based in western Siberia that also operates under the name Metrojet. The plane was registered in Ireland and leased to Kogalymavia by Willmington Trust SP Services (Dublin) Ltd. According to the Irish Aviation Authority (IAA), it passed an annual airworthiness certificate in March 2015. However, the plane had been damaged in 2001, when it was operated by Middle East Airlines, suffering a tail strike on a Cairo runway. Kogalymavia has said that the damage was fully repaired and would not have affected the plane. The plane's engines had also been checked on 26 October, Kogalymavia said, and it underwent a major maintenance inspection and overhaul in Turkey in March 2014. The A321 has a generally good safety record. According to a study by aircraft manufacturer Boeing of crashes between 1959 and 2014, there were 22 incidents in which a plane from the A321 family was damaged beyond repair - known in the industry as a \\"hull loss\\". This article was about:","completion":"The article discusses the crash of Airbus A321, operated by Russian airline Kogalymavia, on 31 October 2015. The plane took off from Sharm el-Sheikh airport and lost contact with air traffic control in Larnaca, Cyprus, before disappearing from radar screens over central Sinai. Egyptian military aircraft later located the wreckage in the Hasana area. The plane carried 224 people, and the wreckage was scattered across a 20 sq km area, indicating it broke up in mid-air. On 17 November, Russia announced that a \\"terror act\\" was responsible for the crash, with traces of foreign explosives found on the debris. UK security service investigators suspect an explosive device was placed in the baggage compartment of the plane. US intelligence agencies also have preliminary evidence suggesting a bomb planted by the local affiliate of Islamic State (IS) was the cause. IS claimed responsibility for the crash, but did not provide evidence. Egypt is leading the investigation, with the help of Russian and other international experts, including those from France and Germany. The plane's \\"black boxes\\" have been recovered as part of the investigation. The crashed Airbus A321 had a range of up to 7,400 km and could accommodate up to 220 passengers. The aircraft has a generally good safety record, and this incident marked one of the worst air disasters involving a Russian plane."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After more than a year of effort, attorneys with Northwest Justice Project earlier this week told 25 families in a mobile home park here that they can keep their homes and no longer need to fear eviction. The East Wenatchee City Council has entered into an Interlocal Agreement with the Wenatchee Housing Authority authorizing the Authority to purchase and maintain the Mobile Park Plaza mobile home park. Located just north of the Wenatchee Valley Mall, the park had been threatened with closure for more than a year. \\"We cannot say enough about how relieved we are that this is over,\\" said Manuel Luna, one of the residents of Mobile Park Plaza. \\"We were afraid that no solution would be found, and that our families would have no place to go. We are very grateful for the help of our attorneys. Without them, we would not have saved our homes. We are also thankful for the help of the Housing Authority, the City Council and Mayor Steve Lacy.\\" Formerly owned by local businessman Dan Jennings, Mobile Park Plaza had been home to 45 low-income families, many of them Latino farm workers. In October 2000 Jennings gave the park residents notice of his intent to close the park effective November 30, 2001. While some park residents decided to move, others, including 25 families, organized an informal association to relocate or save their homes. Unable to afford private legal counsel, the families asked for help from legal services attorneys at the Northwest Justice Project and Columbia Legal Services. In the succeeding months, these attorneys worked with representatives of the Greater Wenatchee Housing Authority, the state Office of Community Development, Chelan County, the City of East Wenatchee, state legislators, Jennings and others to secure funding and find a solution. \\"There seemed to be a never-ending set of obstacles,\\" said Patrick Pleas, an attorney with Northwest Justice Project. \\"Mr. Jennings had financial considerations, the City had growth and economic development considerations, and the State and Housing Authority had their own concerns.

Please answer the following question: What are the worst examples of false advertising you've seen? Did you fall prey to their claims? Rather that vouch for myself - my story is trite, and not particularly interesting - I'll relay the tale one of my nurses shared with me when I was laid up in the hospital for a few weeks. Call her R. R was from an Eastern European country. We chit-chatted a lot, while she was taking my blood pressure readings and stuff. Lots of fun stories! But she relayed to me one of her first U.S. memories: She wanted to lose weight. She was impressed by some things the U.S. had to offer - \\"you have actual nutritional information on everything!\\" - and thus figured everything she encountered was on the level. And she found a \\"miracle cure\\" company who was along those lines! \\"These are AWESOME miracle shoe inserts! Wear them, and the pounds will melt away!\\" She saved her pennies and dimes; she sprung for the inserts. She received them... and they were shoe inserts; that much was true. But then there was their documentation: \\"using these insoles, combined with a 1200 calorie-per-day diet....\\" Like a 1200-calorie diet won't likely involve weight-loss, no matter what else you did, shoe inserts aside. The inserts did nothing, obviously. It was a sham. At which point she knew she was snookered, but really had no recourse. She wasn't explicit about it, but I got the feeling that it was a leading factor towards her chosen profession. \\"I might not have been the most sage medical person ever, but I'm gonna rectify that, and if ever I hear someone falling for that sort of gambit again, I'll be there to nip those sentiments in the bud with my own anecdotes.\\" Which is awesome. I still feel for her. I wish I had contact information, so I could touch base, and express those thoughts personally. But that's the most personally resonant version of false advertising affecting someone that I've seen. Question: Why did the patient feel for R? Options: - R told funny stories. - R wanted to lose weight. - R was the victim of false advertising. - not enough information === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"The patient felt for R because R was the victim of false advertising. R was from an Eastern European country, and when she first came to the U.S., she believed that everything she encountered was credible.

R saved her money to buy the shoe inserts, hoping they would help her lose weight. However, when she received them, she realized she had been misled and that the insoles did nothing to aid in weight loss. This experience of being a victim of false advertising left a lasting impact on R and may have contributed to her decision to pursue a career in the medical field. As a nurse, she wanted to help others avoid similar scams, educate them about proper medical care, and share her personal experience to deter them from falling prey to false claims. The patient in the story could empathize with R's disappointment and frustration, and this empathy made them feel for R in her situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Endemic species can be threatened with extinction through the process of genetic pollution, i.e. uncontrolled hybridization, introgression and genetic swamping. Genetic pollution leads to homogenization or replacement of local genomes as a result of either a numerical and/or fitness advantage of an introduced species. Hybridization and introgression are side-effects of introduction and invasion. These phenomena can be especially detrimental to rare species that come into contact with more abundant ones. The abundant species can interbreed with the rare species, swamping its gene pool. This problem is not always apparent from morphological (outward appearance) observations alone. Some degree of gene flow is normal adaptation, and not all gene and genotype constellations can be preserved. However, hybridization with or without introgression may, nevertheless, threaten a rare species' existence. What behavior causes swamping of a gene pool?","completion":"Swamping of a gene pool occurs due to several behaviors and factors that increase the chances of hybridization, introgression, and genetic pollution among endemic species. These behaviors can be both human-induced and naturally occurring in different ecosystems. The following behaviors and factors contribute to the swamping of a gene pool: 1. Habitat destruction and fragmentation: Human activities like deforestation, urbanization, and industrialization often lead to the destruction and fragmentation of natural habitats. When a species' habitat shrinks or becomes fragmented, it reduces the opportunities for its individuals to breed within their own population and increases the chances of hybridization with other species that they might not have encountered in their original habitat. 2. Introduction of non-native species: The deliberate or accidental release of non-native species into a new ecosystem can lead to hybridization with the local endemic species, resulting in genetic swamping. For example, when non-native fish species are introduced into lakes or rivers for commercial or recreational fishing, they can interbreed with the endemic species and disrupt the local gene pool. 3. Human-assisted migration: Human activities like transportation and globalization have facilitated the movement of species beyond their natural range, increasing the chances of hybridization and genetic swamping. For example, climate change has caused some species to shift their ranges, leading to contact and interbreeding with other species that they would not normally encounter in their original range. 4. Natural hybridization events: Hybridization and introgression can occur naturally among closely related species, particularly when their ranges overlap or their habitats become more similar due to environmental changes. These events can lead to genetic swamping of endemic species, especially if the hybrid offspring have a fitness advantage compared to purebred individuals. 5. Inbreeding depression and reduced genetic diversity: Endemic species with small population sizes or isolated populations often suffer from inbreeding depression, which can result in reduced genetic diversity and overall fitness. In such cases, rare species may be more susceptible to swamping of their gene pool through hybridization with more abundant and genetically diverse species. Overall, swamping of a gene pool is caused by various behaviors and factors that increase the chances for hybridization, introgression, and genetic pollution. Understanding and mitigating these behaviors and factors, along with efforts to preserve and restore habitats, are crucial steps in conserving biodiversity and preventing the extinction of rare and endemic species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The price of basic food such as wheat and corn has stayed the same for quite a long time,about 30 years.But as the world's population is getting bigger,there's more pressure to feed more people,plus there's less land and water to go round. Another reason is climate change.Droughts and floods make it hard to grow crops like rice and grain.The price of oil has gone up and that makes it more expensive for farmers to run their tractors and to transport the food they make.And lots of fields are being used to grow crops to make other things that can't be eaten--which is bad news for hungry people.

Options: A. downtown area B. building C. drink and dance D. manhattan E. indoors","completion":"The nightclub owner wasn't a very good businessperson, but the club still did well thanks to its prime location in the downtown area (Option A). The success of the nightclub can be attributed to a number of factors that are associated with a downtown location. Firstly, downtown areas are known for their high foot traffic and concentration of commercial and entertainment establishments. This naturally leads to a larger pool of potential customers who are seeking a lively nightlife experience. Additionally, downtown areas often have a higher population density due to nearby residential and office buildings, providing a constant inflow of potential patrons. Another advantage of being located downtown is the availability of public transportation options. Many people visiting nightclubs prefer not to drive, either for convenience or because they plan on consuming alcohol. Having easy access to buses, trains, or taxis makes visiting the club more appealing and convenient for a broader range of customers. Aside from the location, there may also be several other factors contributing to the club's success despite the owner's lack of business acumen. These may include the club's ambiance, the quality of the music or entertainment, the presence of skilled and welcoming staff, and the creation of a supportive and enjoyable environment for patrons. These factors, combined with the prime downtown location, may compensate for any shortcomings in the owner's management abilities and ultimately lead to the club's success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before you cut, plan where you would like the layers of your hairstyle to line up. To get ideas of cut and color, you may wish to look at pictures online to see which sort of style you prefer. Websites like Tumblr are particularly good sources for images of the scene hairstyle. Consider your personal preferences but also consider what lengths will emphasize your best features. If you face is too round, for example, you may wish to have the upper layers end around your jawline, to make your face appear more narrow. Your jaw, chin, shoulders, and collarbone make good points of reference for your cut. Feel free to infuse your own creativity in how you approach the kind of cut you want. Implement different aspects of different haircuts to create your scene haircut. Understand the basics of scene haircuts and which elements create what kind of look. Scene hair means short, choppy layers but different techniques create different looks so it’s important to know terminology, especially if you’re trying to convey to a professional the kind of look you’re going for. Fringe: the trademark side-swept bangs common for scene haircuts. Razored: a razor edge is used to skim hair off of your ends by thinning out the strands. It makes the end result appear more messy and lived-in. Choppy: purposely uneven layers that contrasts the typical straight, bluntly cut layered hairstyle. ”Asian Mullet”: commonly used refer to scene hair. It is a cut divided into two parts where the top of the hair is choppy, short layers and the bottom of the haircut is left long. Be sure to include the length you’d like your layers and the bottom so that you aren’t literally left rocking a mullet. Teased: sections of your hair are backcombed to create big volume. It is another element of scene hair. Don’t be afraid to look at his/her portfolio and to describe in depth the kind of haircut that you want. It is important to be vocal and as descriptive as possible. Use your research, photo references, and previously mentioned terminology to ensure that you are getting your ideal scene hair cut by the stylist. If you have curly hair, decide whether or not you want to use a straightener everyday to maintain your scene look. If not, make sure that whatever length you decide on works for both curly and straightened hair – that way the length you want isn’t contingent upon daily heat application.","completion":"A scene hairstyle is a special type of haircut with layers of different lengths.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize the following: This type of mediation is done by a professional. The professional acts as a go-between for you and your ex when you can't work things out. In fact, the mediator can even work without having you both in the same room at the same time, so you won't have to bicker with your ex. The agreements you come to are not binding by the law, so you can change them later in court if you need to do so, though some judges may take the agreements you made into consideration. Mediation can happen before or after you go to court to try to prevent you from going to court a first or second time. Generally, you will hire one person you can both agree on as a mediator. Most of the time, that person will be a lawyer, though some people do work as professional mediators. In severe situations, you may need to call the police. For instance, if your spouse isn't letting you have your kids when they are supposed to, that is an appropriate time to call the police. The police can then come out and make a documentation of it, called a \\"visitation interference.\\" That way, if you do need to go to court, you have documentation to back you up. However, the police will not remove the child from the home. You'll need to go back to court. In addition, this step may only help you if you already have a court-ordered custody arrangement in place. If you haven't been to court or even if you have, you may need to go back to court if you can't work out your arrangements. In that case, you'll both need to hire lawyers to represent your side. Court can get messy, so make it a last resort if possible. If you feel like your ex spouse is an unfit parent, you may want to fight for full custody. In that case, you'll need to be able to provide examples of how and why the other parent is unfit. Your lawyer can help you come up with ways to prove your point. If you already have a court order for your custody arrangement, you generally must prove that something substantial has changed to get a different arrangement. This option is also important to consider if your ex spouse is delinquent on child support.","completion":"The text discusses a type of mediation process involving a professional mediator who helps resolve disputes between ex-partners who are unable to work things out on their own. The mediator serves as a neutral third party and can even facilitate negotiations without the two parties being in the same room. While the agreements reached through mediation are not legally binding and can be altered in court, judges may consider these agreements in their rulings. Mediation can take place before or after court proceedings, with the aim of preventing or reducing the need for further legal action. One mediator, usually a lawyer or a professional mediator, is appointed by mutual agreement between the ex-partners. In extreme cases where, for example, an ex-spouse denies access to children as per a predetermined agreement, the police can be called to document the incident as a \\"visitation interference.\\" However, the police will not remove the child, and a court intervention might still be necessary. Court involvement may become unavoidable if the ex-partners cannot reach a resolution. In such scenarios, both individuals will require legal representation, which can result in a complex and messy process. If one party believes the other is an unfit parent and seeks full custody, they will need to provide evidence to support this claim, with assistance from their lawyer. Modification of existing court-ordered custody arrangements would typically require substantial proof of a change in circumstances. Overall, the text highlights the role of professional mediation in resolving disputes between ex-partners, particularly in relation to child custody arrangements. Mediation aims to minimize the need for court intervention and legal conflict. However, court involvement may become inevitable if an agreement cannot be reached or if there is a severe violation of existing arrangements. In such situations, proper legal representation and strong evidence are essential for seeking changes and protecting one's interests."},{"prompt":"I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the man who returns the key to Cabella? ?

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Christian Fraser says President Sarkozy faces a testing few days A fifth day of protests in France against proposed pension reforms brought 825,000 people on to the streets, police said, although unions put the figure at 2.5m to 3m. The government wants to raise the retirement age from 60 to 62 and the full state pension age from 65 to 67. Most oil refineries have been hit by strike action, causing fuel shortages at some airports and filling stations. A further day of strikes is scheduled for Tuesday. The pension reforms have already been approved by the National Assembly, the lower house of the French parliament. The upper house, the Senate, has endorsed the key articles on raising the retirement age, and is due to vote on the full text on Wednesday. Public and private sector workers took part in strikes on Saturday across France, in cities including Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux, Lille and Toulouse. Unions had called for more than 200 marches nationwide. \\"We are not here to bring France to its knees and create a shortage, we are here to make ourselves heard,\\" Christian Coste, of the CGT trade union, told the Associated Press. A group of what the police described as anarchists operated on the fringes of the main demonstration, says the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris. As the protest drew to a close, they began ransacking café terraces, breaking windows and setting fire to bins. Some of them briefly occupied the Opera House at Bastille. The clashes did not last long, but they are a reminder to the government and unions of how quickly things can get out of hand, our correspondent says. Panic buying All 12 refineries in mainland France have been affected by strike action. Ten have shut down or are in the process of closing. A number of fuel depots have been blockaded. However, a pipeline supplying the two main airports in Paris, Charles de Gaulle and Orly, is now back in service. It was cut off by strike action, raising fears that Charles de Gaulle would run out of fuel by Tuesday. France also has a strategic fuel reserve which holds up to three months of supplies. However, some 10% of filling stations have run out of petrol and panic buying has broken out in some areas. Pension protest numbers Saturday 16 October: 825,000 (police) - 2.5-3m (unions) Tuesday 12 October: 1.2m - 3.5m Saturday 2 October: 899.000 - 3m Thursday 23 September: 997,000 - 3m Tuesday 7 September: 1.2m - 2.7m In Marseille, rubbish is piling up around the port amid a strike by bin collectors that has now lasted four days. More than 300 high schools have been affected by strikes and blockades - about one in 15 across the country - as students have joined the pension protests in the past week. Lorry drivers will decide on Monday whether to join the strikes. More than one million people took to the streets in the previous national protest on Tuesday, according to police. Trade unions organisers said 3.5m had taken part. The last weekend day of demonstrations was Saturday 2 October, when the numbers were about 900,000 according to police and 3m according to unions. Seventy percent of people polled this week think the sporadic strikes will build into a national protest movement like the one in 1995, and over half said they would support it. In 1995, three continual weeks of strikes by public and transport workers forced the government to abandon plans for economic reforms, including raising the retirement age. ||||| France's main airport has only a few days' worth of jet fuel left, it was announced today, as the strikes against government pension plans continued to disrupt infrastructure. The transport ministry warned of the fuel shortage at the Roissy-Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris as hundreds of thousands took part in another national protest against President Nicolas Sarkozy's bill to raise the retirement age. The country has already endured four days of strikes, affecting flights, rail services, hospitals and schools. Diesel supplies were running low in parts of France as unions announced that workers at all 12 fuel-producing refineries were now on strike, and many depots were being blockaded. Police yesterday forced three crucial fuel depots to reopen. A ministry spokesman said officials were working to restore aviation fuel supplies, and the transport minister, Dominique Bussereau, said there was no reason to fear a general shortage. The fuel supply into the Paris region and international airports was cut yesterday from a pipeline running south from Le Havre. Trapil, the company that operates the pipeline to the Paris airports, said Roissy-Charles de Gaulle could run out of fuel as early as next week. A transport ministry spokesman said reserves would last until late on Monday or Tuesday. But he said the pipeline was now working intermittently, adding: \\"We are exploring possible solutions to supply the airport [at Roissy]. We are confident.\\" Bussereau authorised oil companies to use some reserves after trucking companies complained of difficulties finding fuel. About 10% of petrol stations have run out of fuel and panic buying has broken out in some areas. A sign at a station in Feyzin, near Lyon, announced a fuel shortage at all pumps and frustrated motorists reported other problems. \\"When the government says there will be no shortage, it means there will be a shortage,\\" said Bernard Martin, a 60-year-old retiree who found no fuel at a Carrefour gas station in Ecully, near Lyon. \\"Since this morning, there is no more diesel fuel.\\" Strikers at oil refineries said their protest was about fighting recession-induced government spending cuts, such as Sarkozy's plan to raise the minimum retirement age from 60 to 62, and from 65 to 67 for a full state pension. \\"[These protests are] an attempt to say stop abusing the workers and citizens,\\" Christian Coste, head of the CGT Union at Total's La Mede refinery, said. \\"We are not here to bring France to its knees and create a shortage, we are here to make ourselves heard.\\" Workers have been striking for five days straight at the refinery in southern France. In cities around France excluding Paris, some 340,000 protesters were out in protest by midday, according to the interior ministry. Union figures have been consistently far higher than official counts. On the streets of Marseille, garbage was left uncollected for the fourth straight day and firefighters had to extinguish some rubbish piles set on fire. The pension reforms are seen by unions as an attack on their near-sacred social protections. The government says that is the only way to stop a €32bn (£28bn) annual pension shortfall ballooning to €50bn by 2020 and insists people must work longer because they are living longer. The reforms have already been approved by the national assembly, the lower house of the French parliament. The senate has endorsed the key articles on raising the retirement age, and is due to vote on the full text on Wednesday. \\"The French understand that those who are blocking this country are at the head of the government,\\" CFDT union leader Francois Chereque said. The CGT union called for the strikes at the SNCF train authority to be strengthened. About one-third of fast trains were hobbled by strikes yesterday, though the Eurostar train to London was running normally today. A sixth day of protest is set for Tuesday, a day before the senate vote. In another sign of growing protest, truck drivers – the heavyweights of French demonstrations because of their ability to block roads – have heeded a call to join the action. Maxime Dumont, head of the CFDT union's trucking section, said drivers could block fuel depots, refineries and food warehouses and clog roads by driving slowly along them. \\"In the transport sector we can do a bit more to help the workers. We are going to join the movement to make the government give way,\\" Dumont said. More than a million people took to the streets on Tuesday, according to police. Trade unions organisers said 3.5m had taken part. About 70% of people polled this week think the strikes will build into a national protest movement like the one in 1995, and more than half of those questioned said they would support it. France has a long tradition of overpowering unpopular government proposals through militancy on the street, although analysts believe many French people are reluctantly coming to terms with the fact that raising the retirement age in line with other European countries is inevitable – though 62 would still be one of the lowest retirement ages in Europe. Elsewhere, thousands of students and teachers across Italy demonstrated yesterday against planned cuts in education, while Portugal's minority government faced a battle in parliament over abrupt tax hikes and deep spending cuts. In Greece, riot police used teargas on hundreds of culture ministry workers yesterday to end a labour dispute that shut down the country's top attraction, the Acropolis, for three days. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"In France, people are protesting because the government wants to change the rules about when people can stop working and retire. Right now, people in France can retire at the age of 60, but the government wants to change it to 62. Some people don't like this idea and are going on strike, which means they stop working to show that they don't agree with the government's plan. This has caused some problems, like gas stations running out of fuel and public transportation not working well. The government says this change is needed because people are living longer and they need to make sure there is enough money for everyone's retirement. Many people in France are not happy about this and are coming together to protest and try to stop the government from making this change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Generate a question that has the following answer: A bowling alley and a skating rink. for the following movie plot: Left off after the events of the first movie The Blob, an oil pipeline layer named Chester (Godfrey Cambridge) returns to his suburban Los Angeles home from the North Pole, bringing with him a small sample of a mysterious frozen substance uncovered by a bulldozer on a job site. Prior to taking the blob to a lab to be analyzed, he places the storage container with the substance in his freezer, but he and his wife (Marlene Clark) accidentally let it thaw, releasing \\"the Blob\\". It starts by eating a fly, then a kitten, Chester's wife, and then Chester himself (while he is watching a television broadcast of the film The Blob). Lisa (Gwynne Gilford), a friend, walks in to see Chester being devoured by the Blob. She escapes, but cannot get anyone to believe her, not even her boyfriend Bobby (Robert Walker, Jr.). Meanwhile, the rapidly growing creature quietly preys upon the town. Some of its victims include a police officer and two hippies (Cindy Williams and Randy Stonehill) in a storm drain, a barber (Shelley Berman) and his client, transients (played by director Hagman, Burgess Meredith and Del Close), a Scoutmaster (Dick Van Patten), a farm full of chickens, and a bar full of people. At one point, Lisa and Bobby find themselves trapped in Bobby's truck with the creature attempting to find a way inside. In the panic, the truck's air conditioning is accidentally switched on and the Blob retreats because of its vulnerability to cold. The now-massive blob then invades a bowling alley and a skating rink (consuming dozens more people in the process). It is finally stopped when Bobby activates the rink's ice mechanism, freezing it. While the frozen blob is being filmed by a television crew, one of the crew's bright lights is positioned on the ground, melting a small portion of it, which oozes toward the sheriff and envelopes his feet as he is speaking on camera.

Answer choices: - sound - Movement of an air mass - burning coal - static electricity - In the winter - potential energy - by indirect light - geothermal energy Answer:","completion":"One way to heat a building is by utilizing geothermal energy. Geothermal energy is a sustainable and renewable source of energy that uses the Earth's natural heat to produce heating and cooling for buildings. This type of energy harnesses the heat generated from the Earth's core, which is continuously produced through the decay of radioactive isotopes present within the planet. To use geothermal energy for heating a building, a geothermal heat pump system is installed. This system includes a series of underground pipes, a heat pump, and a heat distribution system. The underground pipes, also known as ground loops, are filled with a heat-absorbing fluid. This fluid circulates through the pipes, absorbing heat from the ground. As it absorbs heat, the fluid's temperature rises and is then sent through the heat pump, where it is further heated. The heat pump, typically located in a separate mechanical room within the building, contains a heat exchanger and a compressor. When the heated fluid from the ground loops reaches the heat exchanger, it transfers the absorbed heat to the building's heat distribution system. The remaining cooler fluid is sent back into the ground loops to be reheated by the Earth, and the process continues in a sustainable and efficient manner. Geothermal energy has numerous advantages over other heating methods, such as burning coal, which produces greenhouse gas emissions contributing to climate change. Geothermal heating is environmentally friendly, with low greenhouse gas emissions and a minimal environmental footprint. It offers consistent and reliable heating, as the Earth's core remains a stable temperature year-round. Furthermore, geothermal heat pump systems are relatively low-maintenance and have a long lifespan, making them cost-effective over time. However, it is worth noting that several other energy sources can be used to heat a building as well. Among the given answer choices, burning coal is another option, though it is less sustainable and contributes to environmental pollution. Furthermore, the movement of an air mass, such as warm air currents generated through natural convection or forced air systems, can also provide heat to a building. Other popular options not listed include natural gas, propane, and electric heating systems. In conclusion, geothermal energy is a highly effective and sustainable way to heat a building. It efficiently captures and utilizes the Earth's natural heat, providing a reliable and environmentally friendly heating source. Other options mentioned like burning coal and movement of an air mass can also function as heating sources, but the benefits of using geothermal energy make it stand out as an exceptional choice for building heating."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The city could be argued to have some of the first preconceived layouts in the country. Upon founding, New Haven was laid out in a grid plan of nine square blocks; the central square was left open, in the tradition of many New England towns, as the city green (a commons area). The city also instituted the first public tree planting program in America. As in other cities, many of the elms that gave New Haven the nickname \\"Elm City\\" perished in the mid-20th century due to Dutch Elm disease, although many have since been replanted. The New Haven Green is currently home to three separate historic churches which speak to the original theocratic nature of the city. The Green remains the social center of the city today.

Alexander perhaps undercut his own rule by demonstrating signs of megalomania. While utilizing effective propaganda such as the cutting of the Gordian Knot, he also attempted to portray himself as a living god and son of Zeus following his visit to the oracle at Siwah in the Libyan Desert (in modern-day Egypt) in 331 BC. His attempt in 327 BC to have his men prostrate before him in Bactra in an act of proskynesis borrowed from the Persian kings was rejected as religious blasphemy by his Macedonian and Greek subjects after his court historian Callisthenes refused to perform this ritual. When Alexander had Parmenion murdered at Ecbatana (near modern Hamadan, Iran) in 330 BC, this was \\"symptomatic of the growing gulf between the king's interests and those of his country and people\\", according to Errington. His murder of Cleitus the Black in 328 BC is described as \\"vengeful and reckless\\" by Dawn L. Gilley and Ian Worthington. Continuing the polygamous habits of his father, Alexander encouraged his men to marry native women in Asia, leading by example when he wed Roxana, a Sogdian princess of Bactria. He then married Stateira II, eldest daughter of Darius III, and Parysatis II, youngest daughter of Artaxerxes III, at the Susa weddings in 324 BC.Meanwhile, in Greece, the Spartan king Agis III attempted to lead a rebellion of the Greeks against Macedonia. He was defeated in 331 BC at the Battle of Megalopolis by Antipater, who was serving as regent of Macedonia and deputy hegemon of the League of Corinth in Alexander's stead. Before Antipater embarked on his campaign in the Peloponnese, Memnon, the governor of Thrace, was dissuaded from rebellion by use of diplomacy. Antipater deferred the punishment of Sparta to the League of Corinth headed by Alexander, who ultimately pardoned the Spartans on the condition that they submit fifty nobles as hostages. Antipater's hegemony was somewhat unpopular in Greece due to his practice (perhaps by order of Alexander) of exiling malcontents and garrisoning cities with Macedonian...

Problem:Context_1 : In physical cosmology, the electroweak epoch was the period in the evolution of the early universe when the temperature of the universe was high enough to merge electromagnetism and the weak interaction into a single electroweak interaction (> 100 GeV). The electroweak epoch began when the strong force separated from the electroweak interaction. Some cosmologists place this event at the start of the inflationary epoch, approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang. Others place it at approximately 10 seconds after the Big Bang when the potential energy of the inflaton field that had driven the inflation of the universe during the inflationary epoch was released, filling the universe with a dense, hot quark–gluon plasma. Particle interactions in this phase were energetic enough to create large numbers of exotic particles, including W and Z bosons and Higgs bosons. As the universe expanded and cooled, interactions became less energetic and when the universe was about 10 seconds old, W and Z bosons ceased to be created. The remaining W and Z bosons decayed quickly, and the weak interaction became a short-range force in the following quark epoch. Context_2 : Nethaneel Joseph Mitchell-Blake (born 2 April 1994) is a British track and field sprinter who specialises in the 200 metres. He was the 2013 European Junior Champion and his personal best of 19.95 seconds ranks him as the second-fastest in Britain of all-time in the event. He is only the second Briton, after Adam Gemili to break both 10 seconds for 100 metres and 20 seconds for 200 metres. Context_3 : Khairul Hafiz bin Jantan (born 22 July 1998) is a Malaysian sprinter, competing in events ranging from 100 metres to 400 metres. He is the current Malaysian 100 metres outdoor record holder with a time of 10.18 seconds which is the new world youth record until 31 March 2017 His personal best of 20.90 seconds in the 200 metres is the Malaysian national junior record. Context_4 : Asha Roy (born 5 January 1990) is an Indian professional sprinter who won the silver medal for 200m in the Asian Track and Field at the 20th Asian Athletics Championships in Pune on 7 July 2013. Roy clocked 11.85 seconds in a 100-meter dash at the 51st National Open Athletics Championships, held at the Yuva Bharti Krirangan, Kolkata in 2011. Roy's record was just short of the national record of 11.38 seconds, which was set by Rachita Mistry in Thiruvananthapuram in 2000. Roy also ran the fastest 200-meter dash, clocking the tape at 24.36 seconds and anchored Bengal's 4x100m relay team, which won the silver with a timing of 47.49 seconds at the Championships. Context_5 : A nuclear isomer is a metastable state of an atomic nucleus caused by the excitation of one or more of its nucleons (protons or neutrons). \\"Metastable\\" refers to the property of these nuclei whose excited states have half-lives longer than 100 to 1000 times the half-lives of the excited nuclear states that decay with a \\"prompt\\" half life (ordinarily on the order of 10 seconds). As a result, the term \\"metastable\\" is usually restricted to isomers with half-lives of 10 seconds or longer. Some references recommend 5 × 10 seconds to distinguish the metastable half life from the normal \\"prompt\\" gamma emission half life. Occasionally the half-lives are far longer than this, lasting minutes, hours, or years. Ta is an example of a nuclear isomer that survives so long that it has never been observed to decay (at least 10 years). Context_6 : Christophe Lemaitre (] ; born 11 June 1990) is a French sprinter who specialises in the 100 and 200 metres.

Lemaitre has run a sub-10 second 100 m on seven occasions: three times in 2010 and four times in 2011. He won a bronze medal in the 4 x 100 m relay at the 2012 London Olympic Games and in the 200 metres at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games. Context_7 : Spin the bottle is a party game in which several players sit/stand/kneel in a circle. A bottle is placed on the floor in the center of the circle. A player spins the bottle, and must kiss the person to whom the bottle points when it stops spinning. It is popular among teenagers. There are a very large number of variants. One variant is that instead, two players must hug within 5 seconds, otherwise, they have to kiss in 10 seconds and if the 10 seconds are up and they haven't kissed, they have to French kiss. Variations allow for other tasks to be accomplished. It can also be used to decide the player for another game such as Truth or Dare? Certain variations also include penalties.

The number of organizations the team had conversations with is unspecified. 2. The selection criterion for narrowing the focus was based on the implementation of a comprehensive information security program. 3. The team narrowed their focus specifically to eight organizations. Now, let's examine the given hypothesis: \\"After talking to 10 organizations, we decided to focus on the first 5 we'd spoken to.\\" This hypothesis provides us with the following information: 1. The team talked to exactly 10 organizations. 2. The team decided to focus on the first 5 organizations they've had conversations with. 3. The selection criterion (if any) is not explicitly mentioned in the hypothesis. To determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we need to compare the information provided in both statements. 1. The number of organizations: In the premise, the number of organizations is not specified, while in the hypothesis, it clearly states 10 organizations were contacted. This indicates that there is insufficient information to determine if the premise entails the hypothesis in terms of the number of organizations involved. 2. The selection criterion: The premise narrows the focus of organizations based on the implementation of a comprehensive information security program. In contrast, the hypothesis doesn't provide any specific criteria for choosing to focus on the first 5 organizations. This difference in selection criteria suggests that the premise does not entail the hypothesis. 3. The number of organizations focused on: The premise states that the team narrowed their focus to eight organizations, while the hypothesis claims they focused on the first 5 organizations they've spoken to. Based on this information, we can conclude that the premise does not entail the hypothesis, as the number of organizations focused on is different. In conclusion, the premise does not entail the given hypothesis, as there are significant differences in the number of organizations, the selection criteria, and the final focus on selected organizations.

Step-by-step translation and justification: 1. \\"Here in the 9th district\\" - This phrase needs to be translated to \\"Dans le 9ème arrondissement\\". The word \\"here\\" translates to \\"ici\\", but \\"dans\\" is more appropriate to mean \\"in\\" when talking about being in a specific district in French. We keep the number \\"9\\" intact and add \\"ème\\" to transform it into \\"9ème\\" which is how the French indicate ordinal numbers. 2. \\"you'll discover\\" - This phrase needs to be translated to \\"vous découvrirez\\". The French verb for \\"to discover\\" is \\"découvrir\\", and its appropriate form for \\"you will\\" (future simple) is \\"vous découvrirez\\". 3. \\"an innovative concept\\" - This phrase needs to be translated to \\"un concept innovant\\". The French word for \\"an\\" is \\"un\\" when referring to masculine singular nouns. \\"Concept\\" remains the same as it is borrowed from French origin. And \\"innovative\\" translates to \\"innovant\\" in French. 4. \\"for a restaurant\\" - This phrase needs to be translated to \\"pour un restaurant\\".

However, many people don't smile because they think they have ugly teeth. For example, one of my classmates, Mike, doesn't have very nice teeth, so that is why he seldom opens his mouth. He even says that he has lost confidence because of his teeth. So it is very important for us to look after our teeth. In fact, a lot of people have this problem. Some people inherit teeth problems from their parents, while others' teeth are damaged because of bad habits, like heavy smoking, eating too much sugar or not brushing teeth often. If your teeth are in bad shape, you should see a dentist and ask for help. They can help improve your teeth and tell you how to take care of them. Smiling can help you to feel more confidence and make people think of you as a more friendly person. If you want to keep healthy, you should not only smile but also laugh.

Here is an article: CLEMSON, S.C. – Clemson cornerbacks Martin Jenkins and Darius Robinson are glad to finally make contributions on the field. The two had interception returns for touchdowns in the first half as the third-ranked Tigers (2-0) turned a tight game into a 52-13 blowout over FCS opponent South Carolina State on Saturday. Jenkins missed last season with a hernia injury while Robinson broke an ankle in midseason and missed the final six games. The two friends collaborated on a rap song they hoped would be a Clemson anthem, \\"We Too Deep.\\" They'd much rather make a difference stopping opponents and helping the Tigers win games winning games. \\"When people look at Clemson's defense, they look at the secondary as a weak line,\\" Jenkins said. \\"And it's been like that the past three years. We were talking and said, 'Man, we need to just start changing the culture.'\\" The Tigers took criticism in their opening week win over Georgia because the defense surrendered 545 yards and were gashed constantly by Georgia's feature back, Todd Gurley, who had touchdown runs of 75 and 12 yards. The pass defense wasn't much better, allowing Georgia quarterback Aaron Murray to throw for 323 yards. Clemson was stingier against South Carolina State. The Tigers held the Mid-Eastern Athletic Conference team to 11 first downs and 241 yards on offense. Holding down an FCS team will hardly convince fans that Clemson's defense has arrived, Jenkins understands. Still, he believes is a strong step toward being the stellar unit the Tigers hope to become down the road. Not everything went perfectly for the Tigers defense. South Carolina State connected on a pair of long touchdown throws to Tyler McDonald, the first for 63 yards from Richard Cue and the other for 51 yards from TeDarrius Wiley with four minutes left. \\"Yeah, I think our positioning was really pretty good\\" overall, said Clemson defensive coordinator Brent Venables. \\"Those two plays, we just got to clean up.\\" Clemson's defensive line, which turned around the Georgia game by sacking Murray four times, again was in the quarterback's face in this one. South Carolina State passer Richard Cue was sacked three times. Cue was hit by lineman DJ Reader as he threw, the ball floating into Jenkins' hands for his pick 6. Cue's pass was tipped up by linebacker Quandon Christian and Robinson easily grabbed it in the flat and took off an easy score that put Clemson up 24-0. Clemson's fast-paced offense got a chance to shine, even with the backups in charge. While Heisman Trophy candidate Tajh Boyd ran for the Tigers' first TD, second stringer Cole Stoudt threw for three touchdowns. Two of those went to reserve wideout Germone Hopper. Stoudt finished 19 of 20 passing, the single all-time best showing percentage-wise in Clemson history. Tailback C.J. Davidson, way down the depth chart, led the Tigers with 63 yards on the ground. Clemson's turned on the offensive firepower the previous two seasons. But Venables, the former Oklahoma defensive coordinator, was called on after the Tigers were torched for a 70 points in losing the Orange Bowl to West Virginia two years ago. He said when he took the job things wouldn't change overnight. Jenkins said he's challenged defensive players to work harder to fix what has been wrong on that side of the ball. Clemson coach Dabo Swinney was happy Jenkins and Robinson made critical plays in the Tigers' win against South Carolina State. \\"Both Darius and Martin have fought through some adversity, so it was good to see them get rewarded,\\" Swinney said. South Carolina State coach Buddy Pough said the interceptions and the scoring runs took some of the fight out of the Bulldogs. \\"What I am disappointed in is that we turned the ball over and gave them some scores,\\" he said. \\"If we don't give them scores, then it's a little different kind of ball game. But they're a top-five team and you better make sure you understand that.\\" And that ranking can rise even higher, Jenkins said, if the defense continues to improve. \\"We don't try and do everything in one day and we don't try and do everything in one game,\\" he said. \\"What you do mess up on, don't make that mistake again and when you keep building on that, you get better and better as the season goes on.

Summarize the following: If a teacher saw you looking at an answer key in the middle of an exam, you aren’t going to be able to convince anyone that you weren’t cheating. However, if your teacher simply has a hunch that you cheated, you may be able to successfully deny the allegations. The repercussions of cheating can be intense, such as losing financial aid, getting suspended, getting expelled, and more. Unless you were caught red-handed, you may be able to convince your teacher that you’re innocent. If you aren’t exactly sure what evidence your teacher has against you, plan on denying. If they didn’t catch you in the moment, they may only have a suspicion. If you believe you can get away with it, go for it. The most important thing to do is to act surprised that they’re questioning you in the first place. Imagine if you worked hard and completed an exam or a paper without cheating… wouldn’t you be shocked if you were accused of cheating? Channel that reaction. If your teacher accuses you of plagiarizing, simply tell them that you used the source in question for research. After reading the information and going directly to your paper to write it, you may have unintentionally phrased things similarly. If your score was uncharacteristically high on a test, just tell your teacher that you studied intently for it, as opposed to other times. Each accusation will be different, but unless you have a great excuse, keep it simple. Repeat that you studied hard, you did your best, and you’re upset that you’re being blamed. Keep it simple. If you are going to deny cheating, you don’t need to come up with a winding, elaborate lie. Continuously repeat that you did not cheat, you are not a cheater, and you are saddened by the accusation. Do not tell different people different stories, and do not confess to a friend or sibling, no matter how trustworthy you think you are. Maintain one solid story, and don’t budge. Summary:","completion":"If a teacher thinks you cheated on a test but didn't actually see you, you might be able to show them you didn't cheat. People might get in trouble like losing money for school, getting suspended or even kicked out if they cheat. If a teacher asks about cheating, act surprised and say you just studied really hard and didn't cheat.

I asked my sister, \\"Did you have any money in your jacket?\\" She said, \\"Yes, Anna, I did.\\" I said, \\"Look in your jacket quickly.\\" Cathy looked in her jacket, but her money was not there. \\"That girl stole it!\\" I said, and we both ran after her. We caught her quickly. My sister was very angry and she said, \\"Give me the money.\\" The girl gave the money to Cathy and ran away. We both ran after her, but we lost her. Then we went home. But before we could tell our parents, my mother said to Cathy, \\"You left your money at home. It's on the table in the sitting room.

This entails becoming acquainted with her, building a connection, and establishing some form of mutual interest. The process of getting to know someone can occur through various activities or situations, such as meeting via mutual friends, engaging in conversations, attending social events, or connecting in shared hobbies or interests. It may take multiple interactions to truly know someone, as people tend to reveal more about themselves as they grow increasingly comfortable with one another. In the context of dating, knowing Sasha typically means that Austin has expressed interest in her and has communicated his intentions to pursue a romantic relationship. This may involve sharing personal information, discussing common values and aspirations, or simply engaging in enjoyable activities together to assess the compatibility and chemistry between them. A solid foundation of trust, respect, and friendship should be established, as these are essential cornerstones for a healthy and successful relationship. Additionally, it is important for Austin to become aware of Sasha's likes and dislikes, her boundaries, and any circumstances that may influence their relationship. For instance, if she is allergic to certain types of food or has a specific dietary preference, Austin should be considerate and plan dates accordingly to accommodate her needs. Likewise, understanding her communication style, habits, and preferences can help them communicate more effectively and avoid potential misunderstandings or conflicts. Furthermore, it is crucial for both parties to be on the same page regarding the status and future of their relationship. For example, they should have a clear understanding of whether they are exclusively dating, open to seeing other people, or just exploring their connection temporarily. This transparency is vital for managing expectations and ensuring the well-being of both individuals involved. In summary, before Austin can wait for Sasha at the ice cream parlor for a date, he must first get to know her and establish a connection. Through the process of building trust, understanding, and a solid foundation, they can then proceed with their date and continue to develop their relationship."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Millions of matchsticks have been pieced together with painstaking precision by a craftsman who has devoted years of his life to creating models of iconic buildings. Pat Acton has dedicated thousands of hours to his hobby, with the Capitol building in Washington and New York's newest skyscraper, One World Trade Centre, among his handmade creations. The careers counsellor has also put together a model of the battleship USS Iowa, the Space Shuttle Challenger and the fictional Hogwarts school from Harry Potter. Craftsman: Pat Acton proudly shows of his matchstick models at his home museum in Gladbrook, Iowa. Iconic landmark: Mr Acton's model of the Capitol building in Washington took 478,000 matchsticks to make. Painstaking precision: Matchstick models of the Capitol building, left, and the Space Shuttle Challenger, right. Memorial: Mr Acton has dedicated his model of the Space Shuttle Challenger to the seven crew killed on board. The impressive models have taken pride of place in Mr Acton's home museum in Gladbrook, Iowa. The architecture-loving craftsman used 478,000 matchsticks and 10 gallons of carpenter glue to make the Capitol building model. His Hogwarts creation took 3,000 hours to building, with 602,000 matchsticks and 24 gallons of glue, as Mr Acton replicated every bridge, tower and window of the building seen in the films. He used photographs and drawings to work from, and made sure he included the Great Hall, Great Tower and Fortified Cathedral - settings for Harry Potter's famous run ins with Lord Voldemort. Dedication: The matchstick model of Hogwarts school in Harry Potter took up to 3,000 hours to create. Detailed: The replica of the fictional Hogwarts school from the Harry Potter films used 602,000 matchsticks. Hobby: Mr Acton, pictured hard at work in his home workshop, is a professional careers counsellor. Mr Acton, a father-of-three who lives with his wife April, said: 'I have always loved architecture ever since I was in elementary school. 'People react very differently to each model - some they are drawn to immediately, others they ignore.' He dedicated his space shuttle model, for which used 200,000 matchsticks, to the seven astronauts who died when it broke up 73 seconds after launch in 1986. Mr Acton's 1/70-scale version of the USS Iowa contains 137,000 matchsticks and took more than 800 hours to build. He said: 'My kids are proud of their dad the matchmaker. They are all a labour of love, taking years to plan and build.' Devoted: Mr Acton's 1/70-scale version of the USS Iowa took more than 800 hours to build. Write caption here.

Proud: The father-of-three proudly shows off his creations at his home museum in Gladbrook, Iowa. Mr Acton was born and raised in Iowa and graduated from the University of Northern Iowa in 1977. He first attempt at matchstick model making came in 1977, when he built a church, using a box of Ohio Blue Tip matches, a bottle of glue, a piece of sandpaper and a knife. Mr Acton then challenged himself to build a model for the frigate USS Constitution and he has never looked back.

(CNN) -- Cuba will pardon more than 2,900 prisoners, the government said Friday, though U.S. subcontractor Alan Gross is not among those who will be freed. The decision to release the prisoners follows \\"numerous requests\\" from their family members and religious institutions, and is a humanitarian gesture, said Cuban President Raul Castro. Among those who might be freed are prisoners over the age of 60, along with those who are sick, female or young with no previous criminal record. With some exceptions, prisoners convicted of spying, terrorism, murder and drug trafficking will not be released. Those who will be freed have already served a \\"important\\" part of their sentences and exhibited good behavior, according to an official statement published on the state-run website Cubadebate. The jailed American, Gross, will not be among those pardoned, the Cuban Interests Section in Washington said. Gross was jailed in December 2009, when he was working as a subcontractor on a U.S. Agency for International Development project aimed at spreading democracy. Castro has accused him of importing satellite equipment to connect dissidents to the Internet, and this year Cuba's highest court upheld the 15-year sentence imposed on Gross for committing crimes against the security of the state.

He takes a job as a projectionist in a Little Tokyo movie theater run by a Japanese-American family. He falls in love with his Japanese boss's daughter.

However, if you are looking for an explanation or interpretation of the term, I'd be more than happy to help. In literature, storytelling, or everyday language, the term \\"Jaws of Death\\" is often used metaphorically to represent a dangerous, life-threatening, or perilous situation. The phrase conjures images of a fierce, lethal predator (such as a shark) about to devour its prey, creating a sense of tension and impending doom. When used in a story or conversation, it can describe a situation where an individual is trapped and on the verge of being overwhelmed by an intense threat or must face an insurmountable challenge. It typically implies that the person must use their intelligence, resourcefulness, or determination to escape the \\"Jaws of Death\\" and survive. Here are a few examples of how the term can be used: 1. The daredevil narrowly escaped the jaws of death when he jumped off the bridge, just as it was collapsing. 2. The stranded hiker faced the jaws of death when a pack of hungry wolves surrounded him in the wilderness. 3. In the suspenseful movie climax, the hero becomes trapped in the jaws of death as the villain's lair starts to crumble around them.

The Texas church where a gunman opened fire during Sunday services, killing 26 and injuring 20, may not reopen. Pastor Frank Pomeroy of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs told leaders of the Southern Baptist Convention earlier this week that it would be too painful to continue using the church as a place of worship. Pomeroy, who lost his own 14-year-old daughter in the massacre, proposed turning the site into a memorial and building another church on a different site. The final decision on the fate of the building will be made by the denomination's top leaders, who traveled to the rural community in a show of support. But a national Southern Baptist spokesman said the pastor's wishes will be taken into consideration. Other sites of mass shootings have been torn down, including Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Connecticut, where a gunman killed 20 children and six adults in December 2012. A new school was built elsewhere. A one-room Amish schoolhouse near Lancaster, Pennsylvania, was torn down in 2006, 10 days after an assailant took children hostage and shot and killed five girls ages 6 to 13. The original site of the school is now a pasture. A nearly identical schoolhouse with a security fence was erected nearby. Also Thursday, the father of the Texas gunman broke his silence to say his family is in mourning. Michael Kelley spoke to ABC News on Wednesday from his home in New Braunfels, about 55 kilometers north of Sutherland Springs. He refused to comment further, saying he does not want the \\"media circus'' surrounding the attack by Devin Patrick Kelley to destroy \\"our lives, our grandchildren's lives.'' A motive for the carnage remains unclear, but the younger Kelley appears to have targeted the church because it was attended by his wife's family.

Our lives are always filled with emails and text messages. They make us feel wanted and important, but in a tiring and empty way. Being busy has a dangerous allure . If you are busy all the time, it's hard to sit quietly with your thoughts or to really feel what you're feeling. Whynot let everything become a choice -- how we spend time, who we reply to and how much or little we write? Many of us are busy becauseour self-worth goes up when people make demands on our time. Whydon't we free ourselves from needing, or even wanting? Why don't we make the best use of the time and space to be productive in a way that it best serves us? That may be consciously keeping ourselves not busy. In fact many great discoverieswere made by people who built white space into their day. Imagine asking \\"How are you?\\" to one of the most successful people you know like Warren Buffet. I've never heard anyone at that level answer \\"busy\\" though most people believe they are. What are they doing differently? First, they aim to project an image that things are under control. Second, they actually have things under control. They've had excellent staff, implemented thoughtful processes and they spend time only on critical tasks that require their attention. They make high-level strategic decisions with a large effect. It's time to end the glory of being busy and spend time setting up processes that make sense, rather than simply working more hours. To do this, you need to change yourway of thinking. It's cool to say you're busy, but it's better to be busy helping someone carry a stroller up the subway stairs or busy finishing a book. How to free us from the trendof being busy? Start with small steps. For one day, be mindful of every daily activity.

Charles Spotswoode's son Jimmy became involved with \\"the Canary\\", a conniving showgirl. The Canary, determined to force Jimmy to marry her so she can join the social elite, threatens to reveal that Jimmy was embezzling from his father. She turns down the elder Spotswoode's bribe to leave Jimmy alone. She telephones two men she has been blackmailing, Cleaver and Mannix, and demands one final generous gift from each of them by the next day. She makes the same request of \\"creepy\\" admirer Dr. Lindquist. Her ex-husband Tony Sheel eavesdrops and wants half, but she refuses to give him anything, even after he hits her. Cleaver, Mannix and Lindquist are all shown lurking about her apartment building late that night. Spotswoode visits her at her apartment around midnight, but cannot get her to change her mind. After he reaches the lobby of her building, he and another person hear screams from her place. They knock on the door, but she assures them that she is fine. The Canary is found strangled the next day. The coroner places the time of death around midnight. District Attorney Markham investigates, aided by Philo Vance (a close friend of Charles Spotswoode) and Police Sergeant Heath. After all the suspects are brought in for questioning, Vance asks Markham to keep them waiting for a few hours. Markham agrees. Vance subtly maneuvers Cleaver, Mannix, Lindquist and the two Spotswoodes into playing poker to pass the time so he can observe their personality traits. Only one shows the daring, imagination and discipline required for the crime; that man bluffs Vance, betting everything with just a pair of deuces. The suspects are then released. Sheel, who witnessed the murder while hiding in the closet, sends the killer several blackmail letters. He too is strangled. A pen found at the scene has Jimmy's name on it, so Heath arrests him for the murder. Jimmy then confesses to both murders, but Vance knows better.

Although both sentences convey that Roxus supported Poison and Bon Jovi during their tours in 1989, the two sentences carry different nuances. The primary difference lies in the description of the bands and the nature of their tours. In the first sentence \\"Roxus supported the respective Australian bands Poison and Bon Jovi in their international tours in 1989,\\" it states that both Poison and Bon Jovi are Australian bands. Additionally, it emphasizes that Roxus supported them during their international tours, which means that the tours covered multiple countries other than Australia. On the other hand, in the sentence \\"Roxus supported the international bands Poison and Bon Jovi on their respective Australian tours in 1989,\\" Poison and Bon Jovi are referred to as international bands, which means that they could be based in any country. Furthermore, it underscores that Roxus supported them during their Australian tours, indicating that these tours specifically took place in Australia. In summary, although both sentences suggest Roxus supported Poison and Bon Jovi in 1989, the context and nature of the support differ.

In George Orwell's \\"Animal Farm,\\" Mr. Frederick is a human character, a neighboring farmer who represents Adolf Hitler and the rise of Fascism. He plays a significant role in a specific incident that involves deception. Napoleon, the pig and primary villain in the story, represents Joseph Stalin. He takes control of Animal Farm after the rebellion against humans, ultimately becoming a dictatorial leader. As the farm's leader, Napoleon attempts to form alliances with the neighboring farmers, among them Mr. Frederick. The deception takes place when Napoleon decides to sell timber to Mr. Frederick. The two parties negotiate a deal, and Mr. Frederick pays Napoleon with banknotes. However, unbeknownst to Napoleon and the other animals, the banknotes are counterfeit. Napoleon is tricked into accepting worthless notes, and later on, it is revealed that they are fraudulent. The trickery doesn't end there. After Mr. Frederick obtains the timber, he goes further in his deception and betrayal. He and his men attack Animal Farm, leading to a fierce battle between the animals and the humans. Mr. Frederick's forces manage to destroy the windmill - a symbol of the animals' unity, labor, and progress. The windmill's destruction signals a significant loss for the animals and demonstrates Mr. Frederick's ruthless nature.

Possible A: roof, home, fabric, floor, computer game Why is \\"roof\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Roof\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense for this question because: Step 1: Analyzing the context The context of the question is about something being damaged after a windstorm and needing a replacement, which usually refers to a part of a structure or an object exposed to the elements. Step 2: Examining the given options In the list of possible answers, we have the options: roof, home, fabric, floor, and computer game. Step 3: Eliminating improbable options - Fabric, floor, and computer game don't typically require replacement specifically due to a windstorm, as they are not directly exposed to outdoor elements. Step 4: Comparing remaining options Between roof and home, the roof is a part of the home which is directly exposed to the wind and is more likely to be damaged in a windstorm. Step 5: Considering the clue Additionally, the question includes a clue about getting a heavier tile, which aligns with replacing a roof, as it is tiled in some cases.

Sometimes a baby shower can also happen after the baby is born. A baby shower can be held in someone's home or outside, like in a restaurant or a catering hall. Traditionally only women are invited to a baby shower. However, more and more baby showers are also including the father-to-be. Like a bridal shower, a mother-to-be will register a wish list of things she wants at one or several stores. This list usually includes things the mother wants for her baby like clothes, diapers and even furniture. This way friends and family members can go to the stores and buy something from the list. Registering helps make sure that there aren't repeat items, like 30 bottles when a new mom only needed 15. At a baby shower, people can give cards with wishes for the new baby and mom. Most of these cards also include money or gift cards to help the mom-to-be buy whatever else she needs for the baby. Sometimes there are games as well. In one game everyone guesses the date of the baby. Another game lets people taste baby food and guess the flavor. Question: According to the passage, we know that _ .

More particles inside the container means more collisions, and more collisions mean a higher pressure. If we keep deflating a balloon of oxygen particles what happens to the pressure increases or decreases? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the relations between particle density inside a container, collisions, and pressure. From the initial statement, we know that an increase in particle density results in more collisions and higher pressure. Step 2: Consider the action of deflating a balloon. Deflating a balloon involves removing air or letting the gas particles escape from the balloon, reducing the overall volume of the gas and related particles within the balloon. Step 3: Relate deflation to particle density, collisions, and pressure. When deflating a balloon, the number of particles inside the balloon decreases. This reduction in particles leads to fewer collisions of those particles. Step 4: Determine the effect of fewer collisions on pressure. As the number of collisions decreases based on the initial statement, pressure also decreases. Step 5: Formulate an answer to the question.

Berlin police said Tuesday the 41-year-old woman daubed Iodine-125 on specific cards, which allowed them to be identified by a gambler with a concealed detector. Police got on her trail after radioactive card fragments were found during a routine inspection of a garbage truck at a waste treatment plant a year ago. Investigators then followed the vehicle's route to determine the origin. They raided the woman's restaurant and other premises earlier this month and found 13 radioactive card pieces. Police said Tuesday that Iodine-125 is commonly used for medical purposes and only poses a health risk through direct contact with no protective clothing. How much the scheme netted is still under investigation. ||||| Image copyright Getty Images Police raiding a Berlin restaurant have discovered playing cards which had been laced with a radioactive substance. Detectives believe players could wear a hidden detector on their bodies allowing them to recognise certain cards, giving them an advantage. The scheme was discovered when a routine check at a waste treatment facility uncovered an increased level of radioactivity in a rubbish truck. Police managed to trace the vehicle to a restaurant in Berlin. On raiding it, they found 13 playing cards laced with iodine-125, a substance used in medicine that has a half-life of 60 days. That means it stays radioactive for longer than most other types of radioactive iodine. It's not clear what type of game the cards were being used for. The venue was not authorised for gambling. The German authorities ordered the area to be sealed and cleaned, and say that there is no wider risk of contamination. Other elaborate gambling cheats In 2013, workers at a casino in France marked some cards with invisible ink, which Italian gambler Stefano Ampollini could see through infra-red contact lenses. He and two others were jailed and fined. In 2004, a group of gamblers used a laser scanner to measure the speed of the ball on a roulette wheel and gauge which numbers were likely to come up. The trio won more than £1m (1.8m) at the Ritz Casino in London and police told them they could keep their winnings. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text or story.

In the solid state, particles are fixed in place, while particles are more free to move in the liquid and gas states. The particles in the solid and liquid states “stick together,” but in the gas state, they move freely about the container. In general, it requires energy to separate individual particles. If we want to make a solid adopt a liquid form, we can add energy in the form of heat, increasing the temperature of the substance. Conversely, if we want to convert a substance from a gas to a liquid or from a liquid to a solid, we remove energy from the system and decrease the temperature. Pressure also plays an important role in changes of state, which will be discussed later on. We will study these difference in greater detail in the chapter States of Matter. Now, I have a new situation: John is studying the different states of matter. Today, he has a matter in three states in front of him, state A, state B, and state C. State A is in solid state.

Snyder led the university from 1939 to 1949, when nearly 50,000 military officers and personnel were trained on the Evanston and Chicago campuses. After the war, surging enrollments under the G.I. Bill drove drastic expansion of both campuses. In 1948 prominent anthropologist Melville J. Herskovits founded the Program of African Studies at Northwestern, the first center of its kind at an American academic institution. J. Roscoe Miller's tenure as president from 1949 to 1970 was responsible for the expansion of the Evanston campus, with the construction of the lakefill on Lake Michigan, growth of the faculty and new academic programs, as well as polarizing Vietnam-era student protests. In 1978, the first and second Unabomber attacks occurred at Northwestern University. Relations between Evanston and Northwestern were strained throughout much of the post-war era because of episodes of disruptive student activism, disputes over municipal zoning, building codes, and law enforcement, as well as restrictions on the sale of alcohol near campus until 1972.

Context: WASHINGTON — U.S. President Barack Obama has shortened the sentences of 214 inmates of U.S. federal prisons, in what the White House called the largest batch of commutations on a single day in more than a century. The early release is part of Obama's effort to correct what he views as unreasonably long mandatory minimum sentences. The president's push to lessen the burden on nonviolent drug offenders reflects his long-stated view that the nation should remedy the consequences of decades of onerous sentencing rules, which have put tens of thousands of Americans behind bars for far too long. Among those affected by Wednesday's presidential order were 67 individuals serving life sentences - almost all for nonviolent drug crimes, although a few also were charged with firearms violations related to their drug activities. To date, Obama has granted 562 commutations, more than the previous nine presidents combined, and more clemency actions that by any other president in nearly a century. White House counsel Neil Eggleston said in the White House blog that Obama examines each clemency application on its specific merits to identify the appropriate relief, including whether the prisoner would be helped by additional drug treatment, educational programs or counseling. Presidents tend to use their powers to commute sentences or issue pardons more frequently near the end of their terms of office. Administration officials said the rapid pace will continue before Obama's leaves the White House in January 2017. \\"We are not done yet,\\" Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates said. \\"We expect that many more men and women will be given a second chance through the clemency initiative.\\" Obama has long called for phasing out strict sentences for drug offenses, arguing they lead to excessive punishment and incarceration rates unseen in other developed countries.

Write an article based on this summary: Astronauts on the International Space Station, trying to inflate a new space home, have hit a bit of a snag.","completion":"Title: Inflating a New Space Home: A Glimpse at the Challenges Faced by Astronauts on the International Space Station Introduction In the expanse of the cosmos, the International Space Station (ISS) stands as a collaborative achievement of space agencies from around the globe. An embodiment of modern engineering and technology prowess, the ISS serves as home to astronaut teams conducting ground breaking research and exploration. However, even within this advanced mechanical marvel, astronauts face unique challenges. Recently, they experienced a significant hiccup during an exciting new venture — inflating a new space home. The Expansion of Living Quarters in Space The new \\"space home\\" refers to an inflatable habitat proposed and developed by NASA and a space technology company called Bigelow Aerospace. Regarded as an innovative stepping stone for human space exploration, inflatable habitats are designed to offer more room for astronauts, taking up less space in a launch vehicle compared to traditional metal modules, and at a significantly lower weight. Part of the BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module) project, the inflatable habitat was launched to the ISS aboard the SpaceX CRS-8 cargo resupply mission in April 2016. It was designed to attach to the ISS and be expanded to create an additional living space for the astronauts. To inflate it, on-board astronauts would use the station's existing air system to pump air into the sealed module, filling it much like a balloon and raising the internal pressure until it reaches the same level as the rest of the ISS. The Problem The process of inflating a new space home is, in simple terms, akin to inflating a balloon. Still, it turned out to be more complicated than initially anticipated. As the astronauts on the ISS attempted to inflate the habitat, they encountered an unexpected issue. The habitat was supposed to inflate to its full size over the course of about 45 minutes by releasing air into the module. The ISS crew were monitoring the process closely, keeping track of the expansion and the internal pressure. However, as time passed, it became clear that the inflatable habitat was not expanding at the expected rate. The pressure readings, although increased, were not reaching target levels. The indicators pointed towards a snag in the process, obstructing the easy expansion of the module as pre-envisioned by experts on Earth. The astronauts' experience serves to clarify that any procedure, no matter how well-rehearsed on Earth, can encounter unforeseen difficulties in the unique environment of space. This difficulty posed an intriguing puzzle for the scientists back on Earth. They began a meticulous examination of the scenario, leveraging all available data to determine the cause and potential rectification for the inflation issue. The Importance of Problem-Solving in Space These snags, although inconvenient, are not necessarily drawbacks but rather, integral parts of space exploration. The ISS is not merely a habitation or a laboratory; it is, above all, a learning platform for future missions. Astronauts are trained to handle unforeseen circumstances and react quickly to maintain the safety and integrity of the ISS. Earth-based teams are adept at troubleshooting problems remotely, using the wealth of data provided by the station’s systems and the reports from the astronauts on board. Every hiccup in the space environment presents a valuable learning experience for scientists, engineers, and astronauts. It guides the development of more advanced technology, shapes the training of future astronauts, and informs the preparation for longer, more distant missions in our solar system and beyond. Conclusion In space exploration, challenges like the one faced by the astronauts in inflating their new space home are bound to arise. However, these obstacles ignite innovative solutions and compel us to rethink, redesign, and react. Undoubtedly, the snag of inflating a new habitat in outer space will serve as a catalyst for refining the technology, methods, and techniques of human habitation beyond our planet, continuously pushing the boundaries of our presence in the cosmos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Yes, based on the given premise, we can conclude that the hypothesis \\"Perfumes in ancient Egypt were sometimes made using petals and oils.\\" is true. The premise states that the elite of Ancient Egypt enjoyed a life filled with luxuries such as incense, unguents, and perfumes made from petals and oils. This information directly supports the hypothesis, which claims that perfumes were made using petals and oils. In ancient Egyptian society, the elite were among the most influential members. They had access to many amenities and comforts reflecting their wealth and status. One of these luxuries was the use of perfumes, which were created using various scents to improve their personal ambiance and enhance their social standing. To make these perfumes, ancient Egyptian artisans would use petals and oils, which were derived from carefully selected plants and herbs known for their aromatic qualities. The petals would likely come from flowers such as jasmine, lily, rose, or blue lotus - a flower that symbolized the sun and often appeared in ancient Egyptian art. These flower petals would be either steeped, pressed, or macerated to extract their fragrant oils. Other oils could be obtained from plants such as myrrh, frankincense, and cedarwood. The extraction process required skilled craftsmanship and knowledge of the plants to ensure the maximum fragrance and quality of the perfume. After obtaining the oils and floral extracts, they would be mixed with various other ingredients such as resins, animal fats, and waxes to create a solid or semi-solid unguent that could be applied to the skin or garments. Perfumes could be tailored to individual preferences, with artisans continually experimenting with novel blends, combinations, and techniques to create unique scents. The use of perfumes not only enhanced the elite's personal allure but also served as a symbol of their wealth and refinement. In conclusion, the hypothesis that \\"Perfumes in ancient Egypt were sometimes made using petals and oils\\" can be deemed true based on the provided premise. The Egyptian elite indulged in these scented commodities, further supporting this notion. The process of creating these perfumes involved skilled artisans and the use of petals and oils as key components in their production."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Despite the loss to the Cardinals, the Seahawks could still clinch the NFC West at home in a Thursday night game against the San Francisco 49ers with the Seahawks hoping to avenge the earlier loss to the 49ers. On a rainy, windy night, Seattle started off strong with RB Shaun Alexander getting a three-yard TD run for the only score of the first quarter. The 49ers offense was almost nonexistent in the first half, as seven of San Francisco's first eight drives ended in three-and-outs. However, the Seahawks still allowed a 39-yard field goal by Niners kicker Joe Nedney near the end of the half. After a scoreless third quarter, Seattle's defense started giving way. 49ers QB Alex Smith completed an 8-yard TD pass to TE Vernon Davis. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty on Davis combined with an excellent kickoff return by Nate Burleson gave Seattle prime field position at the San Francisco 33-yard line. However, the Seahawks failed to convert on a fourth down play on the first series from scrimmage, and turned the ball over on downs. Smith would take advantage by driving his team downfield and completing a 20-yard TD pass to RB Frank Gore. San Francisco delivered the final blow with Smith running for an 18-yard TD on a naked bootleg with no defenders near him. The Seahawks got a 22-yard touchdown from QB Matt Hasselbeck to TE Jerramy Stevens with under two minutes left, but it wouldn't be enough as Seattle would get swept by the 49ers. With the loss, the Seahawks fell to 8-6. Based on the above article, answer a question.

Choose your answer from: -no; -yes; The answer is:","completion":"-no; These two sentences do not have exactly the same meaning, although they are closely related. The first sentence states that if the n vectors are linearly independent, then equality in the Hadamard inequality is achieved if and only if the vectors are orthogonal. In other words, orthogonality is a condition for equality when the vectors are linearly independent. The second sentence, on the other hand, states that if the n vectors are linearly orthogonal, then equality is achieved in Hadamard's inequality if and only when the vectors are independent. This sentence implies that the vectors being orthogonal is a given condition, and linear independence is the condition for equality in the Hadamard inequality in this case. Both sentences describe the relationship between orthogonality and linear independence in the context of Hadamard's inequality, but they present it in different ways. The first sentence treats orthogonality as the condition for equality given linear independence, while the second sentence treats linear independence as the condition for equality given orthogonality."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. I read this background article the other day: Another major cause of extinction is global warming , which is also known as global climate change. During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce. I am facing a new situation today: Two neighboring islands Grey island and Sand island both contributed to global warming by their actions. Grey island contributed way more because they were more careless. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which island used more oil?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article and the new situation with Grey Island and Sand Island, it can be reasonably inferred that Grey Island used more oil. The fact that Grey Island contributed more to global warming by being more careless suggests that they may have consumed and burned a larger amount of fossil fuels like oil, as this is one of the primary causes of global warming. Burning fossil fuels, such as oil, releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, which in turn, leads to increase in Earth's average temperature. This elevated contribution to global warming implies a higher consumption and use of oil on Grey Island as compared to Sand Island."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Most nations do this in one way or another . 6. Every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead how it wishes . 7. Wars are horrifying times and atrocities are almost always committed by all sides .","completion":"The argument implied by these sentences revolves around how nations should be allowed to honor, remember, and celebrate their war dead, despite the presence of individuals who may be considered war criminals, and despite the brutal nature of certain wars, such as the Second World War. Beginning with a reference to the Analects and Mao Zedong's birthday, the argument brings attention to how different nations commemorate and honor war dead. The difference highlighted between Yasukuni Shrine in Japan, which enshrines convicted war criminals, and the Mausoleum of Mao Zedong, where big celebrations are still held, could imply a potential double standard when comparing these nations' approaches to honoring their war dead. The text then moves on to address the brutality of Japan's actions during its wars, specifically the Second World War, but asserts that this should not prevent Japanese leaders from paying their respects to their ancestors who fought and died for the country. By claiming that most nations partake in honoring their war dead in one way or another, the argument conveys a sense of commonality and shared responsibility in these acts of remembrance. The text concludes by suggesting that every nation should be allowed to honor its war dead as it chooses, noting that wars are horrifying events where atrocities are almost always committed by all sides involved. This statement acknowledges the complexity of war and the moral grey areas present during such times, suggesting that the commemoration of the dead should not be restricted based on the actions of some individuals. Overall, the argument emphasizes the importance of allowing nations to honor and remember their war dead in their preferred manner, despite the presence of controversial figures and the atrocities committed during the war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What is the answer for the question: What is the first name of the person who stroked Farrar's girlfriend's hair? from the following article ? With the addition of Stirratt, Coomer, and Johnston just prior to the recording of Anodyne, Farrar and Tweedy's relationship became more tumultuous, leading to verbal altercations after concerts. In one account, Tweedy recalled: Around this time, I would say something into a microphone onstage, and afterward [Farrar would] pull me aside and say, \\"Don't you ever fucking talk into that microphone again.\\" He would misconstrue me talking into the microphone as more evidence of my out-of-control, rampant ego, more evidence of me feeling like I didn't have to be so fucking afraid anymore. Tweedy felt the new members gave him a new opportunity to contribute to the band, but Farrar felt disdain for Tweedy's new carefree attitude. Years later, Farrar would claim that he had been tempted to quit the band after seeing Tweedy stroking the hair of Farrar's girlfriend, an act which he believed to have been a proposition. In January 1994, Farrar called manager Tony Margherita to inform him of his decision to leave the band. Farrar told Margherita that he was no longer having fun, and didn't want to work with Tweedy anymore. Soon after the breakup, Farrar explained his departure: \\"It just seemed like it reached a point where Jeff and I really weren't compatible. It had ceased to be a symbiotic songwriting relationship, probably after the first record.\\"Tweedy was enraged that he heard the news secondhand from Margherita, since Farrar decided not to tell him in person. The following day, the two singers engaged in a verbal confrontation. As a favor to Margherita—who had spent a substantial amount of money to keep the band running—Farrar agreed to a final tour with Uncle Tupelo in North America. Tweedy and Farrar again engaged in a shouting match two weeks into the tour, due to Farrar's refusal to sing harmony on any of Tweedy's songs.

Plot title: Marooned Movie plot: Three American astronauts â commander Jim Pruett (Richard Crenna), \\"Buzz\\" Lloyd (Gene Hackman), and Clayton \\"Stoney\\" Stone (James Franciscus) â are the first crew of an experimental space station on an extended duration mission. While returning to Earth, the main engine on the Apollo spacecraft Ironman One fails. Mission Control determines that Ironman does not have enough fuel remaining to use the reaction control system as a backup to initiate atmospheric reentry. Nor is there sufficient fuel to re-dock with the station and wait for rescue. The crew is effectively marooned in orbit. NASA debates whether a rescue flight can reach the crew before their oxygen runs out in approximately two days. There are no backup launch vehicles or rescue systems available at Kennedy Space Center and NASA director Charles Keith (Peck) opposes using an experimental Air Force X-RV lifting body that would be launched on a Titan IIIC booster; neither the spacecraft nor the booster is man-rated, and there is insufficient time to put a new manned NASA mission together. Even though a booster is already on the way to nearby Cape Canaveral Air Force Station for an already-scheduled Air Force launch, many hundreds of hours of preparation, assembly, and testing would be necessary. Ted Dougherty (David Janssen), the Chief Astronaut, opposes Keith and demands that something be done. The President agrees with Dougherty and tells Keith that failing to try a rescue mission will kill public support for the manned space program. The President tells Keith that money is no factor; \\"whatever you need, you've got it\\". While the astronauts' wives (Lee Grant, Mariette Hartley, and Nancy Kovack) agonize over the fates of their husbands, all normal checklist procedures are bypassed to prepare the X-RV for launch. A hurricane headed for the launch area threatens to cancel the mission, scrubbing the final attempt to launch in time to save all three Ironman astronauts.

To solve for 'k', we need to isolate it on one side of the equation. Let's first add 23472 to both sides of the equation: -489*k - 23472 + 23472 = 23472 This simplifies to: -489*k = 23472 Now, let's divide both sides by -489: (-489*k) / (-489) = 23472 / (-489) This further simplifies to: k = -48 So the solution to the math problem is k = -48."},{"prompt":"Read the article and select the best answer.

Article: President Donald Trump has long promised to pursue a “Buy American, Hire American” initiative. | Getty Trump to sign executive order reviewing ‘Buy American, Hire American’ practices President Donald Trump on Tuesday will sign an executive order aimed at bolstering his pledge to “buy American and hire American” by directing federal agencies to probe government procurement practices and re-examine all programs under which workers enter the United States from abroad — including H-1B visas, a key priority for tech companies. The “Buy American” aspect of the order will focus primarily on “the twin pillars of maximizing ‘Made in America’ content and minimizing waivers and exceptions to ‘Buy American’ laws,” a senior administration official told reporters late Monday afternoon. Story Continued Below Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross will coordinate an effort across all government agencies to root out weak monitoring, enforcement and compliance efforts relating to procurement practices, the official said. Ross will then advise Trump on how to close any existing loopholes in a report due 220 days from now — Thanksgiving Day — though the official noted recommendations could also come sooner. The executive order will also direct the Commerce Department and the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative to “comprehensively assess” the procurement provisions of trade agreements, which allow foreign companies to bid on U.S. government contracts, in an effort to “determine which deals may actually be working for America and which may not,” the official said. “It is simply unfair for government contracts to be awarded to low bidders that use dumped or injuriously subsidized, foreign-source content to push out domestic producers,” the official said. “This portion of the executive order is an innovative step to stop the foreign cheaters from using taxpayer funds to steal our jobs, to shutter our steel mills and offshore our factories.” The “Hire American” side of the order will re-examine all programs that govern the entry of foreign labor into the United States, with the goal of reforming current practices to grant visas to higher-skilled and higher-paid workers, a second senior administration official said. The order will also direct the departments of Labor, Justice, Homeland Security and State to examine their various programs and explore various ways to crack down on “fraud and abuse … in our immigration system in order to protect workers in the United States and their economic conditions.” While the order broadly calls for greater enforcement of all visa programs, the official said only one is specifically mentioned by name: the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to bring highly skilled foreign workers to the U.S. on a temporary basis. The official criticized the H-1B system for awarding visas randomly, without taking into account an applicant’s skill or salary level. “The result of that is that workers are often brought in at well below market rates,” the official said. The official emphasized that while each department will need a “full legal analysis” to determine what changes can be made to existing programs, the administration believes there are steps that can be taken both administratively and legislatively. Some potential changes to the H-1B program included weighting the lottery to give an advantage to applicants who hold higher education degrees, for example, or to increase the application fee. “If you change that current system that awards visas randomly, without regard or skill or wage, to a skill-based awarding, it makes it extremely difficult to use the visa to replace or undercut American workers, because you’re not bringing in workers at beneath the market wage,” the official said. “So it’s a very elegant way of solving systemic problems in the H-1B guest worker visa.” Sign up for Morning Trade A speed read on global trade news — weekday mornings, in your inbox.

Trump has long promised to pursue a “buy American, hire American” initiative, which aims to limit the purchase of goods manufactured abroad and the use of foreign workers. He included the goal in two of his highest-profile speeches since entering the Oval Office — his inaugural address in January and his address to a joint session of Congress in February — and tweeted last month that the initiative represents “the core of [his] agenda.” While the executive order will not immediately change any specific policies, it represents a concrete and symbolic step toward achieving that goal. “Some changes will come quickly, some will take more time,” the official said, adding that there is “great appetite” within the various agencies to move “expeditiously.” “I don’t want to tell you exactly how long it’s going to take,\\" the official added, \\"but the point is that it’s a clear statement from the president of the United States to begin shoring up these abuses and to do so immediately.” ||||| WASHINGTON—President Donald Trump is ramping up his tougher “America First” trade policy with plans to revive a decades-old, rarely used law to explore imposing new barriers on steel imports, the White House said on Wednesday night.

How would the sentiment of this tweet be described?","completion":"The sentiment exhibited in this tweet can be classified as a mix of surprise, frustration, and negativity. To break it down, the sentiment in \\"I wrote something but I deleted it by accident,\\" evokes a sense of frustration or self-annoyance. This is a relatively neutral sentiment, tending towards negative given the undesirable nature of accidentally deleting work. The expression \\"but yeah\\" shifts the tone of the sentiment to a more casual or conversational direction. The sentiment grows much clearer in the second part of the tweet: \\"how is the BNP still alive!!\\" Here, the sentiment is primarily one of surprise, with a negative undertone. The user appears incredulous about the continued existence or relevance of the British National Party (BNP). The double exclamation marks emphasize the strength of the sentiment - they express strong emotion, usually surprise, anger, or enthusiasm. In this case, it is used to amplify the speaker's disbelief or irritation. These interpretations make the assumption that the speaker has negative feelings towards the BNP based on the phrasing and punctuation used. The way they have phrased their question doesn't indicate a neutral or positive sentiment. Instead, it suggests that the speaker is unhappy or disillusioned by the BNP's continued existence. In summary, if one were to describe the sentiment of this tweet succinctly, it would be described as a strong expression of negative surprise mixed with frustration."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Allen Welsh Dulles (; April 7, 1893 - January 29, 1969) was an American diplomat and lawyer who became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence (DCI), and its longest-serving director to date. As head of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) during the early Cold War, he oversaw the 1954 Guatemalan coup d'etat, Operation Ajax (the overthrow of Iran's elected government), the Lockheed U-2 aircraft program and the Bay of Pigs Invasion. Following the assassination of John F. Kennedy, Dulles was one of the members of the Warren Commission. Between his stints of government service, Dulles was a corporate lawyer and partner at Sullivan & Cromwell. DCI Smith recruited Dulles to oversee the agency's covert operations as Deputy Director for Plans, a position he held from January 4, 1951. On August 23, 1951, Dulles was promoted to Deputy Director of Central Intelligence, second in the intelligence hierarchy. After the election of Dwight Eisenhower in 1952, Bedell Smith shifted to the Department of State and Dulles became the first civilian Director of Central Intelligence. The Agency's covert operations were an important part of the Eisenhower administration's new Cold War national security policy known as the \\"New Look\\". At Dulles' request, President Eisenhower demanded that Senator Joseph McCarthy discontinue issuing subpoenas against the CIA. In March 1950, McCarthy had initiated a series of investigations into potential communist subversion of the Agency. Although none of the investigations revealed any wrongdoing, the hearings were potentially damaging, not only to the CIA's reputation but also to the security of sensitive information. Documents made public in 2004 revealed that the CIA, under Dulles' orders, had broken into McCarthy's Senate office and fed disinformation to him in order to discredit him, in order to stop his investigation of communist infiltration of the CIA. In the early 1950s, the United States Air Force conducted a competition for a new photo reconnaissance aircraft. Lockheed Aircraft Corporation's Skunk Works submitted a design number called the CL-282, which married sailplane-like wings to the body of a supersonic interceptor. This aircraft was rejected by the Air Force, but several of the civilians on the review board took notice, and Edwin Land presented a proposal for the aircraft to Dulles. The aircraft became what is known as the U-2 'spy plane', and it was initially operated by CIA pilots. Its introduction into operational service in 1957 greatly enhanced the CIA's ability to monitor Soviet activity through overhead photo surveillance. The aircraft eventually entered service with the Air Force. The Soviet Union shot down and captured a U-2 in 1960 during Dulles' term as CIA chief. Dulles is considered one of the essential creators of the modern United States intelligence system and was an indispensable guide to clandestine operations during the Cold War. He established intelligence networks worldwide to check and counter Soviet and eastern European communist advances as well as international communist movements.

The first possible meaning is a discussion in which people express opposing views or opinions, frequently characterized by disagreements or disputes. In this context, the sentiment could be negative, as it may imply conflict or discord. Such disagreements usually bring about negative emotions like frustration, anger, or hostility. If your intent was to focus on this aspect of the term, you could conclude that the sentiment of the sentence is negative, making \\"negative\\" (1) the appropriate choice. On the other hand, arguments can also refer to logical reasoning and analytical thought processes, presenting one's opinions and reasons for holding certain beliefs. In this context, an argument could be well-structured, coherent, and insightful. Thus, if your intent was to focus on this meaning of the term, you could argue that the sentiment of the sentence is positive, leading to \\"positive\\" (2) as the preferred choice. However, due to the lack of context and clarification on the meaning of \\"arguments\\" in the given sentence, it is impossible to definitively label the sentiment as either positive or negative. This problem also highlights the importance of providing sufficient context and clarity when attempting to determine the sentiment of specific sentences and phrases.

Things get even more complicated when Anthony learns that Theresa, the woman he fell in love with, is not actually Snaps' daughter as she had claimed to be. Before Anthony can catch on, Snaps tricks him into agreeing to marry his actual daughter, Lisa, who is supposedly pregnant but without a husband. Both Lisa and Anthony are unhappy at the hasty arrangement, and the pair luck out when Lisa falls in love with someone else: Dr. Thornton Poole, Snaps' dialectician, whose frequent world travels appeal to her adventurous nature.

Hoping to get their first win of the season, the 49ers went home for a Week 5 Sunday night duel with the Philadelphia Eagles. The Niners delivered the game's opening strike in the first quarter as quarterback Alex Smith hooked up with wide receiver Michael Crabtree on a 7-yard touchdown pass, but the Eagles would answer with quarterback Kevin Kolb completing an 8-yard touchdown pass to tight end Brent Celek. Philadelphia took the lead in the second quarter as kicker David Akers made a 33-yard field goal, followed by running back LeSean McCoy's 29-yard touchdown run.

At one time this statement was true, but no longer. Since the 1960s, we have sent many spacecraft into space. Some are still traveling away from Earth. So it is possible to overcome gravity. Do you need a giant rocket to overcome gravity? No, you actually overcome gravity every day. Think about when you climb a set of stairs. When you do, you are overcoming gravity. What if you jump on a trampoline? You are overcoming gravity for a few seconds. Everyone can overcome gravity. You just need to apply a force larger than gravity. Think about that the next time you jump into the air. You are overcoming gravity for a brief second. Enjoy it while it lasts. Eventually, gravity will win the battle. Do you have any questions?","completion":"Yes, it's absolutely fascinating how we can overcome gravity in various ways, both big and small. However, overcoming gravity entirely and escaping the Earth's gravitational force is a whole different ballgame. While climbing stairs or jumping on a trampoline does provide a temporary respite from gravity's force, it's not enough to completely break free from gravity's pull. In order to escape the Earth's gravitational force, an object must reach a specific speed, known as the escape velocity. For Earth, this speed is roughly 11.2 kilometers per second (25,000 mph). At this speed, the kinetic energy of the object is enough to counteract the gravitational potential energy acting upon it. Spacecraft like rockets are specifically designed to attain such speeds, allowing them to venture into outer space and, in some cases, continue traveling indefinitely. It's important to note that escape velocity is not a constant value. It varies depending on the mass and radius of the celestial body, as well as the distance from the center of that body. For instance, if a spacecraft were to attempt to leave the Moon's surface, the escape velocity would be much lower due to the Moon's smaller mass and radius in comparison to the Earth. Now, let's address the concept of satellites and objects in Earth's orbit. Technically, these objects are also overcoming gravity, but they never truly escape it. Instead, they are in a delicate balance, moving around the Earth at a precise speed that keeps them from being pulled back into the Earth's atmosphere or drifting away into deep space. In conclusion, overcoming gravity has become a reality in the modern world through human innovation and exploits in space travel. Although we might not overcome gravity in the same way as a rocket does, by understanding the principles behind this force, we can appreciate the different ways we can temporarily defy gravity or escape it entirely.

Answer the following question: Information: - Tim Chandler (born February 3, 1960) is a bass guitar player, best known for his work with the rock bands Daniel Amos, The Swirling Eddies (credited as Berger Roy Al) and The Choir. - Bob Dylan (born Robert Allen Zimmerman, May 24, 1941) is an American songwriter, singer, artist, and writer. He has been influential in popular music and culture for more than five decades. Much of his most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when his songs chronicled social unrest. Early songs such as \\"Blowin' in the Wind\\" and \\"The Times They Are a-Changin'\\" became anthems for the American civil rights and anti-war movements. Leaving behind his initial base in the American folk music revival, his six-minute single \\"Like a Rolling Stone\\", recorded in 1965, enlarged the range of popular music. - Gene \\"Eugene\\" Andrusco (April 6, 1961 March 20, 2000) was a Canadian-born actor, record producer, engineer, composer and musician. Andrusco was best known as the leader of the alternative rock band Adam Again, a member of The Swirling Eddies (credited as \\"Prickly Disco\\") and as a founding member of the supergroup Lost Dogs. - Bruce Spencer is an American drummer, drumming instructor and clinician, singer and session musicion, songwriter, record producer, best known for his work with the rock and roll trio, The 77s. - Steve Hindalong (born November 29, 1959) is an American drummer, percussionist, songwriter and producer best known for his work with the alternative rock band The Choir.

These musicians recorded rock records using country themes, vocal styles, and additional instrumentation, most characteristically pedal steel guitars. Country rock began with Bob Dylan and The Byrds, reaching its greatest popularity in the 1970s with artists such as Emmylou Harris, the Eagles, Michael Nesmith, Poco and Pure Prairie League. Country rock also influenced artists in other genres, including The Band, Grateful Dead, Creedence Clearwater Revival, The Rolling Stones, and George Harrison's solo work.

The result was entitled MUTT , and included new acoustic versions of ten songs originally written and recorded for each band member 's regular rock bands . The following year , the band would release the almost entirely instrumental Island Dreams . The Lost Cabin and the Mystery Trees , was released July 2006 . In 2008 , the Lost Dogs traveled down historic Route 66 with cinematographer Jimmy Abegg . Abegg filmed the band 's experiences . The band then wrote and recorded 14 songs inspired by their journey , which was released as Old Angel in May 2010 . - A drummer is a musician who plays drums, which includes a drum kit (\\"drum set\\" or \\"trap set\\", including cymbals) and accessory-based hardware which includes an assortment of pedals and standing support mechanisms, marching percussion or any musical instrument that is struck within the context of a wide assortment of musical genres. The term percussionist applies to a musician who performs struck musical instruments of numerous diverse shapes, sizes and applications. Most contemporary western ensembles bands for rock, pop, jazz, R&B etc. include a drummer for purposes including timekeeping and embellishing the musical timbre. Most drummers of this particular designation work within the context of a larger contingent (a.k.a. rhythm section) that may also include, keyboard (a percussion instrument) or guitar, auxiliary percussion (often of non western origin) and bass (bass viol or electric). Said ensembles may also include melodic based mallet percussion including: vibraphone, marimba or xylophone. The rhythm section, being the core metronomic foundation with which other melodic instruments, including voices, may present the harmonic/melodic portion of the material. - Terry Scott Taylor (born May 24, 1950) is an American songwriter, record producer, writer and founding member of the bands Daniel Amos and The Swirling Eddies (credited as Camarillo Eddy). Taylor is also a member of the roots and alternative music group, Lost Dogs. He is currently based in San Jose, California, U.S. - Adam Again was an American rock band founded and led by vocalist Gene Eugene, with Riki Michele on vocals, Paul Valadez on bass, Jon Knox on drums, Greg Lawless on guitar. Dan Michaels often played saxophone. - Alternative rock (also called alternative music, alt-rock or simply alternative) is a genre of rock music that emerged from the independent music underground of the 1980s and became widely popular in the 1990s and 2000s. In this instance, the word \\"alternative\\" refers to the genre's distinction from mainstream rock music. The term's original meaning was broader, referring to a generation of musicians unified by their collective debt to either the musical style or simply the independent, D.I.Y. ethos of punk rock, which in the late 1970s laid the groundwork for alternative music. At times, \\"alternative\\" has been used as a catch-all description for music from underground rock artists that receives mainstream recognition, or for any music, whether rock or not, that is seen to be descended from punk rock (including some examples of punk itself, as well as new wave, and post-punk). - Riki Michele (born Michele Bunch, currently Michele Palmer) is a female Christian alternative music artist. She was a singer for Adam Again, and has also recorded four eclectic solo records. - Christian alternative rock is a form of alternative rock music that is lyrically grounded in a Christian worldview.

He is best known as the drummer of the rock band Daniel Amos. - Christian rock is a form of rock music that promotes Jesus and is typically performed by self-proclaimed Christian individuals and bands whose members focus the lyrics on matters of Christian faith. The extent to which their lyrics are explicitly Christian varies between bands. Many bands who perform Christian rock have ties to the contemporary Christian music labels, media outlets, and festivals, while other bands are independent. - A songwriter is an individual who writes the lyrics, melodies and chord progressions for songs, typically for a popular music genre such as rock or country music. A songwriter can also be called a composer, although the latter term tends to be used mainly for individuals from the classical music genre. The pressure from the music industry to produce popular hits means that songwriting is often an activity for which the tasks are distributed between a number of people. For example, a songwriter who excels at writing lyrics might be paired with a songwriter with a gift for creating original melodies. Pop songs may be written by group members from the band or by staff writers songwriters directly employed by music publishers. Some songwriters serve as their own music publishers, while others have outside publishers. - The 77s (alternatively spelled The Seventy Sevens or The 77's) are an American rock band consisting of Michael Roe on vocals/guitar, Mark Harmon on bass and Bruce Spencer on drums. - Jeffrey Lynne (born 30 December 1947) is an English songwriter, composer, arranger, singer, multi-instrumentalist and record producer who gained fame in the 1970s as the lead singer and sole constant member of Electric Light Orchestra.

Often referred to as \\"the quiet Beatle\\", Harrison embraced Hindu mythology and helped broaden the horizons of his fellow Beatles as well as their Western audience by incorporating Indian instrumentation in their music. Although most of the Beatles' songs were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney, most Beatles albums from 1965 onwards contained at least two Harrison compositions. His songs for the group included \\"Taxman\\", \\"Within You Without You\\", \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\", \\"Here Comes the Sun\\" and \\"Something\\", the last of which became the Beatles' second-most covered song. - A guitarist (or a guitar player) is a person who plays the guitar.

Answer a question about this article: Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. Many glaciers from temperate, alpine and seasonal polar climates store water as ice during the colder seasons and release it later in the form of meltwater as warmer summer temperatures cause the glacier to melt, creating a water source that is especially important for plants, animals and human uses when other sources may be scant. Within high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater. Under what circumstances would humans require water from a glacier?","completion":"To answer this question, I will first outline the main points from the article about glacial ice and its importance as a freshwater source. Then, I will identify situations in which humans would require water from a glacier. 1. Glacial ice is the largest reservoir of freshwater on Earth. 2. In various climates, glaciers store water as ice during colder seasons and release it as meltwater during warmer seasons. 3. This meltwater is important for plants, animals, and humans, especially when other water sources are scarce. 4. In high altitude and Antarctic environments, the seasonal temperature difference is often not sufficient to release meltwater. Now, I will list some circumstances in which humans would require water from a glacier: 1. In regions where the traditional water sources (rivers, lakes, groundwater) are scarce or have been depleted (e.g., during droughts), glacial meltwater could become a vital water source for human needs such as drinking, irrigation, and industrial usage. 2. In high-altitude or mountainous areas, where access to other water sources is limited, nearby glaciers can serve as a consistent source of freshwater for human consumption and agriculture. 3. In areas experiencing rapid population growth or increased demand for water resources, glacial meltwater may provide an additional source of water to help meet these increasing needs. 4. During periods of climate change, when weather patterns may affect the availability and distribution of water, glacial meltwater can serve as a more reliable water source contributing to water security. 5. Human settlements and activities in polar regions, such as research stations or exploration missions, may rely on glacial meltwater as their primary source of water, given the limited alternatives available in such extreme environments. In conclusion, humans would require water from a glacier under circumstances where traditional water sources are insufficient, scarce, or inaccessible, and during times of increased demand for water resources or changing climate conditions.

Tectonic plates are massive pieces of Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and the upper mantle. These plates, varying in size and thickness, float on the partially molten, more fluid asthenosphere below. The movement of these tectonic plates is driven by the heat generated from the Earth's interior, resulting from radioactive decay and the residual heat from Earth's formation. The Earth's lithosphere is divided into approximately seven large and several smaller plates that constantly move relative to each other. There are three primary types of tectonic plate boundaries: divergent, convergent, and transform. Each of these boundaries has different characteristics that contribute to the occurrence of earthquakes. 1. Divergent Boundaries: These boundaries occur when two tectonic plates move away from each other, due to the upwelling of material from the mantle. Divergent boundaries are primarily found in mid-ocean ridges, where new oceanic crust is formed. Although earthquakes along divergent boundaries are generally less severe than those along other types of plate boundaries, they can still cause a significant release of energy. For example, the East African Rift Valley is an active divergent boundary where earthquakes frequently occur. 2. Convergent Boundaries: At convergent boundaries, two plates collide with each other. This collision can result in the formation of mountain ranges, trenches, and volcanic arcs. Depending on the types of crust involved, convergent boundaries are further classified into three categories: a. Oceanic-continental convergence: When a dense oceanic plate collides with a less dense continental plate, the oceanic plate subducts beneath the continental plate, forming a deep trench. The process of subduction leads to the buildup of immense pressure and stress, eventually causing the release of energy in the form of earthquakes, often along the boundary or within the subducting plate. For example, the earthquakes along the western coast of South America are largely due to subduction of the Nazca Plate beneath the South American Plate. b. Oceanic-oceanic convergence: When two oceanic plates collide, the denser plate subducts beneath the other, creating a deep trench and volcanic island arcs. This type of convergence generates earthquakes, both along the boundary and within the subducting plate, similar to those seen in the oceanic-continental convergence. An example of oceanic-oceanic convergence is the region of Japan, where the Pacific Plate is subducting beneath the Philippine Sea Plate, making it an area of intense seismic activity. c. Continental-continental convergence: When two continental plates collide, they can't easily subduct due to their low density. Instead, they tend to buckle and uplift, creating mountain ranges. Earthquakes along these boundaries are typically caused by the release of stress from this compression and crustal deformation. The Himalayas are an example of a mountain range formed by continental-continental convergence, where the Indian Plate is colliding with the Eurasian Plate. 3. Transform Boundaries: At transform boundaries, two plates slide past each other horizontally, without any creation or destruction of the lithosphere. The movement of these plates is neither smooth or continuous, as their rough edges can get stuck against each other, causing the buildup of stress over time. Eventually, this stress is released in the form of an earthquake, when the plates suddenly slip past each other. The most famous example of a transform boundary is the San Andreas Fault in California, which separates the Pacific Plate and the North American Plate. In addition to these tectonic processes, there are other factors that influence the occurrence and intensity of earthquakes, such as the depth, structure, and strength of the Earth's crust in a specific region, as well as the presence of fault lines and geological variations. While the majority of major earthquakes are indeed caused by tectonic plate interactions, it is important to note that earthquakes can also be triggered by volcanic activity, human activities (such as underground mining or petroleum extraction), and even meteorite impacts, although these events are significantly less common."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

It was improvised by civilians who had never handled a hijacked aircraft that attempted to disappear, and by a military unprepared for the transformation of commercial aircraft into weapons of mass destruction. As it turned out, the NEADS air defenders had nine minutes' notice on the first hijacked plane, no advance notice on the second, no advance notice on the third, and no advance notice on the fourth. We do not believe that the true picture of that morning reflects discredit on the operational personnel at NEADS or FAA facilities. NEADS commanders and officers actively sought out information, and made the best judgments they could on the basis of what they knew. Individual FAA controllers, facility managers, and Command Center managers thought outside the box in recommending a nationwide alert, in ground-stopping local traffic, and, ultimately, in deciding to land all aircraft and executing that unprecedented order flawlessly. More than the actual events, inaccurate government accounts of those events made it appear that the military was notified in time to respond to two of the hijackings, raising questions about the adequacy of the response. Those accounts had the effect of deflecting questions about the military's capacity to obtain timely and accurate information from its own sources. In addition, they overstated the FAA's ability to provide the military with timely and useful information that morning. In public testimony before this Commission in May 2003, NORAD officials stated that at 9:16, NEADS received hijack notification of United 93 from the FAA. This statement was incorrect. There was no hijack to report at 9:16. United 93 was proceeding normally at that time. In this same public testimony, NORAD officials stated that at 9:24, NEADS received notification of the hijacking of American 77. This statement was also incorrect. The notice NEADS received at 9:24 was that American 11 had not hit the World Trade Center and was heading for Washington, D.C. In their testimony and in other public accounts, NORAD officials also stated that the Langley fighters were scrambled to respond to the notifications about American 77,178 United 93, or both. These statements were incorrect as well. The fighters were scrambled because of the report that American 11 was heading south, as is clear not just from taped conversations at NEADS but also from taped conversations at FAA centers; contemporaneous logs compiled at NEADS, Continental Region headquarters, and NORAD; and other records.

How do you do this: How to core an apple?","completion":"Coring an apple is a simple process that removes the center part of the apple that contains the seeds and leaves the flesh intact for further use in baking, cooking, or eating. The method you choose will depend on what equipment you have available and how you plan to use the cored apple. Here is a detailed step-by-step guide on how to core an apple: Method 1: Using an apple corer 1. Gather your equipment: You will need an apple corer, a cutting board, and a sharp knife. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Place the apple on the cutting board: Position the apple with its stem facing upward, and make sure it sits flat on the cutting board. 4. Insert the apple corer: Hold the handle of the apple corer vertically and align the corer’s circular blade with the center of the apple. Apply gentle pressure and a twisting motion to push the corer through the apple. 5. Remove the core: When the corer reaches the bottom of the apple, carefully pull the corer back out, removing the core. Dispose of the core and any seeds. 6. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Method 2: Using a knife 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a cutting board, a sharp knife, and a spoon or melon baller. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Place the apple on the cutting board: Position the apple with its stem facing upward, and make sure it sits flat on the cutting board. 4. Cut the apple into quarters: Hold the apple steady with one hand and, using the knife, make two vertical cuts that intersect at the core to create four equal sections. 5. Remove the core: Hold each apple section with the core facing upward and use the knife to make a diagonal cut that removes the seed compartment while preserving as much fruit as possible. Alternatively, you can use a spoon or melon baller to scoop out the cores and seeds from the quarters. 6. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple wedges for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Method 3: Using a cup or a small cookie cutter 1. Gather your equipment: You will need a cutting board, a sharp knife, and a cup or a round cookie cutter with a diameter slightly smaller than the apple. 2. Wash and dry the apple: Rinse the apple under running water and pat it dry with a clean towel or paper towel. 3. Slice off the top of the apple: Hold the apple steady with one hand and, using the knife, make a horizontal cut to remove the top of the apple, just below the stem. 4. Position the cup or cookie cutter: Turn the apple upside down so the cut surface is facing downward, and place the cup or cookie cutter over the center of the apple. 5. Push the cup or cookie cutter through the apple: Apply gentle pressure while slowly twisting the cup or cookie cutter to cut through the flesh of the apple until it reaches the cutting board, leaving the core intact. 6. Remove the apple cylinder: Carefully lift the apple and pull out the apple cylinder that now surrounds the core. 7. Separate the core from the apple cylinder: Hold the apple cylinder with one hand and use the knife to make a vertical cut, separating the core from the apple flesh. Discard the core. 8. Check and clean the apple: Inspect the cored apple cylinder for any remaining seeds or core fragments and remove them with the knife if necessary. Regardless of the method you choose, once the apple is cored, it is ready to be sliced, diced, or used whole in your favorite recipes such as pies, tarts, salads, or as a healthy snack.

Given the question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What is happening to a person found guilty of committing murder? Possible A: feeling sad, going to prison, jail time, go to jail, feeling of guilt Why is \\"going to prison\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? The answer is:","completion":"Going to prison is an answer aligned with human common sense because it reflects a widely understood and accepted consequence for committing a serious crime like murder. In societies governed by laws and regulations, murder is considered one of the most severe crimes that a person can commit, leading to the severest punishment in the form of imprisonment or, in some cases, even capital punishment. There are multiple reasons why the incarceration of a murderer aligns with human common sense: 1. Protection of society: The primary objective of imprisonment is to protect society from the threat posed by an individual who has demonstrated their capacity to cause extreme harm to others. By incarcerating a murderer, the community is safeguarded from any potential recidivism or further violent acts from the perpetrator. 2. Rule of law: Prisons function as a manifestation of the rule of law and the fundamental principle that, as members of a civilized society, individuals must be held accountable for their actions. Imprisoning a murderer reinforces the idea that no one is above the law, and even the most dangerous rule-breakers will be brought to justice. 3. Deterrence: Imprisonment of a murderer serves as a deterrent to not only the individual receiving the punishment but also to other potential lawbreakers. The fear of harsh consequences can discourage people from engaging in criminal behavior, thereby contributing to a more peaceful and safe society. 4. Opportunities for rehabilitation: While not all societies achieve this goal effectively, the incarceration of a murderer also creates an opportunity to rehabilitate the person, helping them understand the gravity and consequences of their crime and possibly prepare them for reintegration into society if they are eventually released. This attempt at rehabilitation aligns with human common sense, as it signifies that a person's capacity for change and growth is valued, despite their heinous past actions. 5. Expression of societal values: Imprisoning a murderer represents a society's condemnation of such acts and its dedication to upholding values like respect for human life, safety, and wellbeing. It serves as a statement that such behavior is not tolerated and that the guilty will be held accountable for their actions. In conclusion, \\"going to prison\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in the context of punishing someone found guilty of committing murder because it adheres to the values, principles, and expectations that many societies have established regarding crime and punishment. The imprisonment of a murderer serves vital functions such as protection, deterrence, rehabilitation, and the expression of societal values, which are all important elements in maintaining a lawful and secure society."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Donald Trump's bad week Trump is facing the toughest test of his campaign after a week in which he veered into a series of unexpected controversies and -- for a change -- seemed to struggle in his response. His parade of missteps on issues ranging from national security to abortion have left the Republican front-runner wading through his roughest patch yet on the campaign trail. Trump will learn whether he dealt his campaign serious damage on Tuesday when GOP voters in Wisconsin go to the polls. Some surveys show Texas Sen. Ted Cruz leading in the primary there and a loss for Trump would make it that much harder to secure the 1,237 delegates he'll need to secure the nomination before the GOP convention. \\"I don't know that it's been the worst week of my campaign,\\" he told CBS News in comments that will air Sunday on \\"Face the Nation. \\"I think I've had many bad weeks and I've had many good weeks. I don't see this as the worst week in my campaign.\\" His opponents in the party believe he has already been damaged beyond repair among the broader electorate that will decide the general election. Tim Miller, senior advisor to the Our Principles PAC, which is dedicated to opposing Trump, believes that the idea that nothing hurts Trump is a \\"moronic piece of conventional wisdom.\\" \\"He has completely turned off huge swaths of the electorate. His numbers have continued to get worse. He would get absolutely massacred on a historic scale (in a general election). All of the data demonstrates it.\\" The week of staggering developments seems to encapsulate the wild, unorthodox nature of much of the Trump campaign, and the election cycle he has dominated. It began on Tuesday when his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski, was charged with simple battery in connection with an incident involving a female reporter. Trump's denial that his aide did anything wrong and his decision to attack Lewandowski's accuser during a CNN town hall raised new questions about his attitude towards women. During the same town hall, Trump abandoned his earlier pledge to support the eventual GOP nominee if it wasn't him. His Republican competitors, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, also backed off -- reflecting the deep divisions in the party heading into the election. And he shocked many foreign policy observers with comments suggesting he wants to curb nuclear proliferation while also raising the potential that Japan and South Korea develop such instruments to defend themselves. Trump set off an even more intense firestorm Wednesday -- and bipartisan anger -- when he suggested women who had an abortion should be punished if the procedure were outlawed. He then changed his line several times on an issue that is viewed as a deeply personal litmus test by many conservatives. On Friday, he again reversed course, telling CBS's \\"Face the Nation\\" that federal laws Trump also struggled through a highly critical radio interview with radio host Charlie Sykes -- without realizing the well-known Wisconsin conservative was a declared member of the #NeverTrump movement. Meanwhile, a flurry of news stories emerged about how Trump could harm Republicans in November, with a sudden focus on the fact that if he does not improve his standing, even the wide Republican House majority could be at risk. And Trump caused a new uproar after apparently not being familiar with delegate apportioning rules in Louisiana that could hand Cruz more delegates from the state, even though he walked away with a victory in the primary there. The sequence of events not only tests Trump's Teflon aura but also calls into question his unique method of campaigning, which relies on off-the-cuff calls from the gut, assaults on political correctness and an unusually small-scale political operation around the billionaire. Trump's defenders believe his message is so in tune with an angry electorate -- and his appeal is so broad -- that his liabilities could evaporate come November, especially against a Democratic candidate with her own high negatives, Hillary Clinton. \\"When you get down to a fall election, and the choice is between candidate A and candidate B, then the election always looks different,\\" Trump supporter and CNN contributor Jeffrey Lord said on \\"New Day.\\" \\"This kind of thing always happens.\\" Still, The Washington Post reported this week that Trump would be the most unpopular general election candidate since the paper started polling 32 years ago. Peter Feaver, a former senior National Security Council adviser in the George W. Bush administration, said that Trump's strength among core supporters has distracted attention away from his liabilities among a wider electorate. \\"Trump is the first time in history that we have a candidate who has held onto his supporters so long despite making so many mistakes,\\" said Feaver, now a professor of political science at Duke University. \\"He is also the first candidate in history to have been a front-runner for so long without generating any momentum among people who have not already supported him,\\" Feaver said, pointing to the imperative for all potential nominees of widening their political support base and unifying their party behind him. \\"That suggests to me that Trump has been hurting himself -- but in ways that are obscured by the unusual fact that they can still hold onto his base.\\" Trump's tough week came during a lull between primary contests, which meant the narrative of the campaign has, for the first time in a while, not been dominated by his apparent march to the nomination. In that space, the focus of the media has turned to policy and what Trump would do as president. At the same time, he's facing more intense cross-examination from journalists. In the CNN town hall, moderator Anderson Cooper dismissed his claim that Ted Cruz started a spat over their wives as the argument of a five-year-old. Sykes, meanwhile, told Trump in their interview that his row with Cruz was something he would expect from \\"a 12-year-old bully on the playground, not from somebody who wants the office held by Abraham Lincoln.\\" And Trump's botched answer on abortion came under intense questioning from MSNBC anchor Chris Matthews. The showdowns were a taste for Trump of the intense and increased scrutiny and pressure that the billionaire would face during a general election. And as the political season slips closer toward November, Trump's prospects are coming into focus, as polls show he curtrails both potential Democratic rivals, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Evidence of recent polls suggests that Trump could be digging himself into a hole that might be tough to escape during a general election campaign. In the latest CNN/ORC poll in mid-March, 73% of female voters said they had a negative view of Trump and just 26% view him positively -- figures that show a significant erosion from data earlier in the campaign. Those numbers also came before Trump's furious row with Cruz sparked when an unaffiliated super PAC tweeted out a picture of the billionaire's scantily clothed wife and former model Melania. Trump responded by retweeting an unflattering picture of Cruz's other half, Heidi. Crucially, Trump's standing among Republican women also seems to be eroding. In the latest NBC/Wall Street Journal poll, nearly half of Republican women (47%) said they could not imagine themselves voting for Trump. That could be a danger sign for Trump in key swing state races in the fall in places like Pennsylvania, Colorado and Virginia, where Republican women in suburban locations could be especially crucial to his chances of being competitive. As Trump reflects on the events of the last week, it's possible he may conclude that his intimate, loyal campaign operation has left him exposed. For instance, had he been better briefed, or more steeped in the issues, he likely could have avoided the firestorm on abortion. And it's possible that Trump's contradictions on foreign policy — for instance, saying he is worried about nuclear proliferation but suggesting Japan and South Korea should get nuclear weapons — could have been avoided from organized tutorials with a more robust national security team than the cadre of little-known advisers he has named. So Trump's tough week could beget an evolution of his candidacy and his political campaign tactics and team. Failing that, he will need to maintain his unusual political immunity and break the rules that prevail in general elections just as he has rewritten the structure of the GOP nominating race.

Question: John has been hearing about climate change for last couple of years. He wants to understand the science behind climate change. For that, he picked up two eras in earth's history, era A and era B. Era A was hundred thousand years ago, and era B is in the present day. He now wants to compare these to eras to understand the change in climate better. Would era A have more or less carbon dioxide in the air than era B? Answer:","completion":"To answer John's question, we need to compare the carbon dioxide (CO2) levels during era A (100,000 years ago) and era B (present day). Let's investigate the CO2 levels step by step. Step 1: Collect data on carbon dioxide levels in era A and era B For era A, we can analyze the ice core samples obtained from places like Antarctica. The air bubbles trapped in the ice at the time of its formation can provide information about the CO2 levels during that time period. Similarly, for era B, we can refer to recent observations of atmospheric CO2 levels from scientific organizations such as NASA or NOAA. Step 2: Analyze and compare the data Once we have the CO2 levels for both eras, we can quantitatively compare them to understand whether era A had more or less CO2 in the air than era B. According to the available data: - Era A: 100,000 years ago, the CO2 levels were approximately 185-200 ppm (parts per million). - Era B: Present-day CO2 levels are over 410 ppm, according to recent measurements. Step 3: Draw a conclusion Based on the comparison of CO2 levels in both eras, we can conclude that era A had significantly less carbon dioxide in the air than era B. This result suggests that human activities have contributed to the increase in CO2 levels, which has led to the current issue of climate change."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q:I have a new situation: The ecologist moved from Aspen, where there was no air pollution, to Seattle which experienced a lot of air pollution. He started studying the weather there as well. But I can use this background: One result of air pollution is acid rain. Acid rain is precipitation with a low (acidic) pH. This rain can be very destructive to wildlife. When acid rain falls in forests, freshwater habitats, or soils, it can kill insects and aquatic life. It causes this damage because of its very low pH. Sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides in the air both cause acid rain to form ( Figure below ). Sulfur oxides are chemicals that are released from coal-fired power plants. Nitrogen oxides are released from motor vehicle exhaust. What is an answer for this question: Which city didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the city that didn't have rain that can kill aquatic life is Aspen. Aspen is mentioned as having no air pollution, which is a key factor in the formation of acid rain. Acid rain, as explained, is caused by sulfur oxides and nitrogen oxides released into the air from coal-fired power plants and motor vehicle exhaust, respectively. These air pollutants contribute to the low pH levels in precipitation, resulting in a harmful impact on wildlife, including the potential to kill insects and aquatic life. In contrast, Seattle has been described as a city that experiences a lot of air pollution, making it more likely for acid rain to occur there. Acid rain can lead to detrimental environmental effects, including damage to forests, freshwater habitats, and soils. The ecologist's move from Aspen to Seattle introduces the new challenge of studying the weather and potential environmental issues stemming from increased air pollution. In summary, Aspen is the city that did not experience rain that can kill aquatic life due to its lack of air pollution. Seattle, on the other hand, has air pollution that contributes to the formation of acid rain, which can threaten the health and survival of aquatic life and other wildlife."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The first self-sustaining lunar colony, Artemis, thrives on the Moon's surface with a growing population of 5,000 residents. Accompanying the burgeoning colony is a revolutionary moon-based power plant designed to harness solar energy and deliver it directly to Earth via wireless transmission. This groundbreaking technology substantially alleviates Earth's energy crisis, bringing newfound hope to a world grappling with overpopulation and dwindling resources. On Earth, the Unified International Space Agency (UISA) eagerly prepares for a historic manned mission to Mars. The mission, led by decorated astronaut Commander Allison Ford, has captured the world's imagination. Prior to the launch, UISA announces a final, routine test - the ignition of a powerful experimental antimatter propulsion system near the Moon's trajectory. The new propulsion system promises to shorten travel time to Mars and other distant locations by months or even years. Unbeknownst to UISA, a rogue asteroid enters the solar system and alters the Moon's orbit. As the UISA scientists initiate the final tests for the antimatter propulsion system near the Moon, the unexpected shift in the lunar trajectory results in a catastrophic explosion. Massive chunks of the Moon are blasted into space, while vast amounts of debris crash down on Earth, triggering widespread tsunamis, earthquakes, and meteor showers. As Earth descends into chaos, Commander Ford and her crew face the somber realization that their families and friends are in grave peril. UISA dispatches an unmanned craft to Artemis with relief supplies and cutting-edge technology, including a small team of highly advanced AI-controlled drones designed to fend off the looming asteroid threat. Meanwhile, stranded Martian colonists scramble to devise a rescue plan with their Earthly counterparts. In a race against time, Commander Ford and her team must strategize how to deal with the impending asteroid menace, restore Artemis's space-faring capabilities, and return to Earth to help save their loved ones. Onboarding a brilliant and relentless scientist, Dr. Vincent Shaw, the UISA Mars mission crew devises a risky plan to rebuild and repair a lunar transport in the wreckage of Artemis. Working closely with UISA's AI drones, Dr. Shaw engineers a powerful weapon capable of vaporizing the encroaching asteroids. As the lunar colonists join forces with the stranded Mars mission crew, Commander Ford faces agonizing decisions about who will return to Earth on their makeshift craft and who is left behind. Ultimately, personal sacrifices must be made for the greater good. In the riveting climax, the UISA Mars mission crew successfully implements Dr. Shaw's weapon, neutralizing the asteroid threat as their make-shift lunar transport takes off to traverse the Earth's ravaged atmosphere. The crew's re-entry and dramatic rescue mission on Earth become the foundation for global unity, fostering interdisciplinary collaboration to develop new technologies aimed at preventing future celestial catastrophes. 'Lunar Cataclysm' explores themes of heroism in the face of disaster, humanity's aptitude for innovation, and the complexities of personal sacrifice. This thrilling, suspenseful, and emotional journey asks how far we'll go to forge a brighter future amidst the specter of global catastrophe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The juice squeezed out of the lemon could not fill the cup because the","completion":"lemon was not ripe enough. Consequently, to obtain the desired amount of lemon juice, I had to follow several steps. Step 1: Selecting more lemons Given that the initial lemon was not ripe enough to produce sufficient juice, I decided to select a few more lemons. I chose three additional ripe lemons that appeared larger and juicier to make sure I would get enough juice to fill the cup. Step 2: Rolling and soften the lemons Before cutting them, I rolled the lemons on a flat surface applying gentle pressure with my hand. This process helps break down some of the internal fibers and results in the release of more juice from the fruit. Step 3: Cutting and juice extraction After rolling the lemons, I cut them in half crosswise. Using a citrus juicer, I squeezed each lemon half to extract the juice. The juicer made it easier to extract the maximum amount of juice possible and minimized the risk of seeds falling into the cup. Step 4: Measuring the juice As I extracted the juice from each lemon half, I kept an eye on the cup's fill level. Once the juice reached the desired amount, I stopped extracting to avoid any excess. Step 5: Straining the juice (Optional) In case there were any small seeds, pulp, or unwanted residue in the lemon juice, I strained it using a fine mesh strainer to ensure the juice was smooth and seed-free. By following these steps, I was able to fill the cup with the desired amount of lemon juice, compensating for the initial lemon's inadequate juice yield.

Question: Megan, a sophomore in college, is visiting her grandparents who live out of town. There is a party going on at her grandparents' house because her grandma, Emily, has just retired. There is cake and ice cream and people are talking about their jobs, and Emily is talking about all the good and bad memories she has from her work. Who will have slower reflexes? Hint: Old age begins in the mid-60s and lasts until the end of life. Many people over 65 have retired from work, freeing up their time for hobbies, grandchildren, and other interests. Stamina, strength, reflex time, and the senses all decline during old age, and the number of brain cells decreases as well. The immune system becomes less efficient, increasing the risk of serious illnesses such as cancer and pneumonia. Diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease that cause loss of mental function also become more common. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Emily, Megan's grandmother, will likely have slower reflexes. This is because she is within the old age range, which is associated with a decline in reflex time, as well as a decline in stamina, strength, and the senses. The decrease in the number of brain cells and a less efficient immune system also contribute to this decline in reflexes and other physical abilities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Air France has been forced to cancel hundreds of flights. Main pilots' union says expansion would erode pay and conditions. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Air France Cancels Hundreds of Flights Due to Pilots' Strike Over Transavia Expansion Subtitle: The main pilots' union argues that the expansion would lead to diminished pay and conditions for its members. Date: September 16th, 2021 Introduction Air France has been compelled to cancel hundreds of flights following a strike by pilots on September 15th. The pilots' protest is a response to the airline's proposed expansion of its low-cost subsidiary Transavia. The main pilots' union, Syndicat National des Pilotes de Ligne (SNPL), claims that this expansion will lead to an erosion of pilots' salaries and general working conditions. The repercussions of this move by Air France's pilots have had significant consequences for both the airline and its passengers. Background of the Situation Transavia, which primarily operates short and medium-haul flights, has been a low-cost branch of Air France-KLM since 2007. As part of the group's long-term strategy to improve revenues and expand market share in the competitive airline industry, Air France has announced plans to develop Transavia's operations further. The proposed plan includes adding new routes and increasing the number of aircraft operated by the subsidiary. However, the pilots' union sees this expansion as a threat to their pay and job security. With the aim to maintain competitiveness, the airline's growth strategy for its low-cost unit comes hand in hand with numerous cost-saving measures. Pilots are concerned that this will lead to a weakening of employment terms and conditions, particularly those pertaining to remuneration and working hours. Strike Action and Flight Disruptions In response to the proposed expansion, pilots have chosen to strike on September 15th. The labor dispute has led to hundreds of flights being cancelled, inevitably causing disruptions for passengers and affecting Air France's bottom line. With negotiations at a standstill, the airline has been forced to find alternative options for its affected passengers, including rebooking their flights or offering refunds. The strike has also had a negative impact on cargo transportation, exacerbating an already strained supply chain caused by the global COVID-19 pandemic. Passenger and Industry Reactions The strike has, understandably, led to a wave of complaint and frustration from affected passengers who now face significant delays and complications in their travel plans. The airline industry, too, has been critical of the situation. For an industry still reeling from the effects of the pandemic, such events could cause potential passengers to choose alternative modes of transportation or opt for other airlines that are perceived to have fewer disruptions. Possible Outcomes and Solutions To resolve this situation, Air France and the pilots' union need to find a compromise that satisfies both parties. It is crucial for the airline to continue its growth and maintain competitiveness in the market while addressing pilots' concerns and ensuring their job security. Potential solutions may include reassessing the employment conditions for pilots working for Transavia, providing clearer career progression paths, or introducing policies which ensure that current Air France pilots are not negatively affected by the expansion. Conclusion The ongoing strike by Air France pilots over proposed Transavia expansion has led to the cancellation of hundreds of flights and significant disruptions for passengers. While the airline seeks to grow and maintain its profitability by expanding its low-cost subsidiary, it is essential that it addresses the concerns of the pilots' union to ensure fair treatment and to avoid further labor disputes and disruptions. A successful resolution would result in a mutually beneficial outcome for the airline, its pilots, and passengers who depend on its services."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He was in the Low Countries at a time when Italian Classicism was the height of fashion, and similarities have been observed between Bruce's work, particularly Holyroodhouse, and such buildings as the Amsterdam City Hall (1648–65), the work of Jacob van Campen, and Maastricht's City Hall (1659–64), by Pieter Post. Alexander Bruce had married a Dutch woman with family ties to the House of Orange, and it seems likely that he provided links to the Dutch artisans who worked on some of Bruce's projects.Bruce was certainly familiar with northern France, and in 1663 he made a further \\"foreign journey\\" at the behest of Lauderdale, although his itinerary is unknown. Whether by visit or through studying engravings, he knew several notable French houses including Vaux-le-Vicomte, Blérancourt, and the Chateau de Balleroy, the last the work of French architect François Mansart. These modern French designs, incorporating features then unknown in Scotland, such as the double-pile of major rooms in two enfilades, ranged back-to-back, were also influential on Bruce's designs.English influence is also visible in his work. His country houses took the compact Anglo-Dutch type as their model, as introduced into England by Hugh May and Sir Roger Pratt, but with Continental detailing, such as the rustication on the facade at Mertoun. Roger Pratt's Coleshill House of 1660 is often cited as a model for Bruce's Kinross House.

Translate this to English?","completion":"The given Finnish phrase \\"Näin määrätään työjärjestyksessä\\" can be translated to English as \\"This is determined by the work order\\" or \\"This is specified in the work order.\\" The translation suggests that a particular task, operation, or procedure is determined or described within a specific work order. Work orders are documents issued to indicate tasks, jobs, or projects that need to be carried out, often as part of a larger plan or operation. They typically contain essential details, such as the description of the work to be done, the necessary materials or equipment, the workers responsible for the task, the deadline, and any relevant safety or quality instructions. Work orders are commonly used in a variety of industries, including construction, manufacturing, maintenance, and services. The phrase emphasizes the importance of adherence to the specified work order. Abiding by the work order's conditions ensures that the work proceeds according to the planned timeline and can minimize confusion or misunderstandings. Additionally, following the work order can also help in maintaining quality standards and compliance with any industry-specific or legal requirements. In some cases, the phrase may imply that a particular decision, such as the sequence of operations or the allocation of resources, has been made based on the work order's instructions. This could be a response to a question about why a particular procedure or method has been chosen or why certain tasks have been prioritized over others.

Under the provisions of the Charities Act 2006, it is now an excepted charity, and fully registered with the Charities Commission, and is now one of the 100 largest charities in the UK. As a charity, it benefits from substantial tax breaks. It was calculated by the late David Jewell, former Master of Haileybury, that in 1992 such tax breaks saved the School about £1,945 per pupil per year, although he had no direct connection with the School. This subsidy has declined since the 2001 abolition by the Labour Government of state-funded scholarships (formerly known as \\"assisted places\\") to independent schools. However, no child attended Eton on this scheme, meaning that the actual level of state assistance to the School has always been lower. Eton's retiring Head Master, Tony Little, has claimed that the benefits that Eton provides to the local community free of charge (use of its facilities, etc.) have a higher value than the tax breaks it receives as a result of its charitable status. The fee for the academic year 2010–2011 was £29,862 (approximately US48,600 or €35,100 as of March 2011), although the sum is considerably lower for those pupils on bursaries and scholarships.

Palpate (touch) the upper arm and feel for any bumps, lumps or evidence of broken skin. Carefully remove or alter clothing so you can see the entire arm and look for signs of bruising, inflammation or deformity. After identifying a proximal humerus fracture, it is crucial to provide proper first aid to aid in pain management and prevent further complications until professional medical help can be sought. Follow these steps to splint a humerus fracture: 1. First and foremost, call for emergency medical help or have someone else do it. While waiting for the professionals to arrive, you can proceed with splinting the fractured arm. 2. Keep the injured person as still as possible, and provide reassurance that help is on the way. Try to minimize movements, especially in the affected area, to prevent further injury. 3. Assess the arm for any noticeable deformities, skin breaks, or other visible signs of the fracture. Be cautious when handling the arm to avoid exacerbating the injury or causing unnecessary pain. 4. If any open wounds are present, cover them with a sterile dressing to protect from contamination and infection. Be mindful of applying excessive pressure to these areas. 5. Find a rigid and sturdy material to use as a splint; this can be anything from a piece of wood, a rolled-up magazine, or even a firm pillow. The splint should be long enough to stabilize the joint above and below the fracture site. 6. Gently, but firmly, immobilize the affected arm by placing the splint along the length of the humerus, which is the long bone in the upper arm. Be sure to support the entire arm, from the shoulder to the elbow. 7. Hold the splint in place using bandages, strips of cloth, or even torn pieces of clothing. Wrap the material around the arm and splint, ensuring that it is secure but not too tight, as this may cause more harm than good. 8. Once the arm is immobilized, support the affected arm with a sling. You can use a triangular bandage or even a long and wide strip of cloth. The sling should go under the arm and around the neck, providing support and minimizing movement. 9. Monitor the person for signs of shock, such as a rapid pulse, shallow breathing, cold or sweaty skin, and paleness. If these symptoms become apparent, lay the person down, elevate their legs, and cover them with a blanket to help regulate their body temperature. 10. Continue to provide reassurance and support until professional help arrives, at which point, they will take over the treatment and management of the humerus fracture. Remember to provide any pertinent information regarding the injury, such as how it occurred and any interventions performed, to the healthcare provider. By following these steps, you can safely and effectively splint a humerus fracture and ensure the injured person receives proper care while waiting for emergency medical help. Keep in mind that this is only a temporary measure and should not replace professional evaluation and treatment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Question: What does the Napoleonic Concardat of 1801 give? Context: Most of the Alsatian population is Roman Catholic, but, largely because of the region's German heritage, a significant Protestant community also exists: today, the EPCAAL (a Lutheran church) is France's second largest Protestant church, also forming an administrative union (UEPAL) with the much smaller Calvinist EPRAL. Unlike the rest of France, the Local law in Alsace-Moselle still provides for to the Napoleonic Concordat of 1801 and the organic articles, which provides public subsidies to the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Calvinist churches, as well as to Jewish synagogues; religion classes in one of these faiths is compulsory in public schools. This divergence in policy from the French majority is due to the region having been part of Imperial Germany when the 1905 law separating the French church and state was instituted (for a more comprehensive history, see: Alsace-Lorraine). Controversy erupts periodically on the appropriateness of this legal disposition, as well as on the exclusion of other religions from this arrangement.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. Question: \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" Answer: \\"The Deepwater Horizon oil spill\\" Is this answer to the question correct?","completion":"Yes, the answer to the question \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" is correct. The Deepwater Horizon oil spill, also known as the BP oil spill, is considered the worst oil spill in U.S. history. The disaster occurred on April 20, 2010, when the Deepwater Horizon oil rig, owned by Transocean Ltd. and leased by BP, exploded in the Gulf of Mexico, killing 11 workers and injuring 17 others. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf, causing extensive environmental, economic, and social damages. In the aftermath of the spill, investigations were carried out by multiple parties, including the U.S. government, independent organizations, and the companies involved. In January 2011, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that assigned blame for the accident among Transocean, BP, and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing. The report concluded that the disaster was likely due to a combination of factors, including poor risk management, systemic organizational failures, and inadequate regulatory oversight. The Deepwater Horizon disaster had far-reaching consequences, with damaged ecosystems, massive costs related to clean-up efforts, and economic losses, especially for the fishing and tourism industries in the Gulf region. Furthermore, the spill led to a reevaluation of offshore drilling practices and regulations in the U.S., with new safety and environmental protection measures being imposed on the industry. In conclusion, the answer to the question \\"What was the worst oil spill in U.S. history?\\" is, indeed, the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. This tragic event continues to serve as a painful reminder of the potential risks and devastating consequences associated with offshore oil and gas operations, and highlights the importance of rigorous safety and environmental oversight in the industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the name of the person who drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece from Meyerbeer? Discounting his collaboration with Dukas in the completion of Guiraud's unfinished Frédégonde, Saint-Saëns wrote twelve operas, two of which are opéras comiques. During the composer's lifetime his Henry VIII became a repertory piece; since his death only Samson et Dalila has been regularly staged, although according to Schonberg, Ascanio (1890) is considered by experts to be a much finer work. The critic Ronald Crichton writes that for all his experience and musical skill, Saint-Saëns \\"lacked the 'nose' of the theatre animal granted, for example, to Massenet who in other forms of music was his inferior\\". In a 2005 study, the musical scholar Steven Huebner contrasts the two composers: \\"Saint-Saëns obviously had no time for Massenet's histrionics\\". Saint-Saëns's biographer James Harding comments that it is regrettable that the composer did not attempt more works of a light-hearted nature, on the lines of La princesse jaune, which Harding describes as like Sullivan \\"with a light French touch\\".Although most of Saint-Saëns's operas have remained neglected, Crichton rates them as important in the history of French opera, as \\"a bridge between Meyerbeer and the serious French operas of the early 1890s\\". In his view, the operatic scores of Saint-Saëns have, in general, the strengths and weaknesses of the rest of his music – \\"lucid Mozartian transparency, greater care for form than for content ... There is a certain emotional dryness; invention is sometimes thin, but the workmanship is impeccable.\\" Stylistically, Saint-Saëns drew on a range of models. From Meyerbeer he drew the effective use of the chorus in the action of a piece; for Henry VIII he included Tudor music he had researched in London; in La princesse jaune he used an oriental pentatonic scale; from Wagner he derived the use of leitmotifs, which, like Massenet, he used sparingly. Huebner observes that Saint-Saëns was more conventional than Massenet so far as through composition is concerned, more often favouring discrete arias and ensembles, with less...

Possible answers: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","completion":"(3). No. While it is true that having someone home all the time can make it more effective to complete tasks and chores within the household, it does not necessarily imply that \\"everything can be done.\\" There could be various factors and reasons that might prevent all tasks from being accomplished, even with someone constantly present at home. Firstly, the person's ability and expertise play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the tasks at hand. Each individual possesses a different set of skills, and some tasks might require specialized knowledge or skills for appropriate completion. Even if someone is home all the time, they may lack the competence to manage certain tasks. For example, repairing a complex electrical appliance or dealing with plumbing issues may require the assistance of a professional technician, regardless of the individual being at home all day. Secondly, the capacity to manage tasks might be a constraint. Sometimes, there may be multiple tasks that need immediate attention, making it impossible for a single individual to manage all of them simultaneously. Additionally, if someone is looking after the children or attending to family members with special needs, their primary focus will be on providing care and support, leaving them with limited time and energy to devote to other tasks. Thirdly, external factors can also impede the ability to complete tasks at home. For instance, financial constraints could lead to delays in making necessary home improvements or addressing essential repairs. Moreover, such limitations might also impact the procurement of necessary resources, such as groceries and supplies, hindering a person's ability to accomplish everything. Lastly, fatigue and mental health can influence productivity and efficacy. Constantly staying at home and managing an array of tasks may cause stress and burnout, leading to a decline in a person's ability to attend to and complete all the tasks on their plate. In conclusion, while having someone at home all the time can contribute to accomplishing more within the household, it does not guarantee that everything can be done. Factors such as abilities, capacity, external influences, and mental well-being can all impact the completion of tasks, regardless of the individual's constant presence in the house."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Intraplate earthquakes occur within the interior of tectonic plates, away from their boundaries and are caused by the movement of the lithosphere on a round planet. The solid lithosphere, which comprises the Earth's crust and the solid upper part of the mantle, moves due to the heat and convection patterns of the partially molten, yet still solid, upper mantle beneath it. As the lithosphere moves and undergoes deformation, stresses build up, and when they reach a certain threshold, they release as earthquakes. Although intraplate earthquakes are less frequent and generally less intense compared to those occurring at tectonic plate boundaries, they can still be significant and cause damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bill looked up the Gaia hypothesis, while Frank read about the Flat Earth theory. Which friend read less about the composition of our atmosphere? A:","completion":"Without specific information about the exact content that Bill and Frank read, it is impossible to determine with certainty who read less about the composition of our atmosphere. However, we can analyze the topics that each friend chose to read about and make an educated guess. The Gaia hypothesis, proposed by James Lovelock and Lynn Margulis, argues that Earth is a self-regulating, complex system that maintains the conditions necessary for life. From a broad perspective, this hypothesis suggests that the living and non-living components of Earth, such as the atmosphere, oceans, and biosphere, interact and work together to maintain a harmonious balance that sustains life on the planet. Studying the Gaia hypothesis would likely involve examining the composition of our atmosphere due to its crucial role in regulating Earth's climate system and supporting life. On the other hand, Flat Earth theory is a belief that Earth is flat rather than spherical in shape. Individuals who hold to this theory question or deny the widely accepted evidence that supports Earth's sphericity, such as satellite images and astronauts' observations from space. While Flat Earth theorists may discuss certain aspects of Earth's atmosphere, such as why it appears curved in photos taken from high altitude, their focus is primarily on the overall shape of the Earth and not on the composition of the atmosphere. Based on the general content of each topic, we can infer that Bill, who looked up the Gaia hypothesis, likely read more about the composition of our atmosphere, as it has a more direct relevance to the topic. Frank, who read about the Flat Earth theory, would likely have encountered less information about the atmospheric composition since the theory mostly focuses on the Earth's shape. Therefore, we can conclude that it is most probable that Frank read less about the composition of our atmosphere during their sleepover. However, it is important to note that this conclusion is based upon the typical scope and content of each topic and could be different if they delved into varying aspects of their chosen topics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The most embarrassing was when my Mom apologized to the people we were staying with because her \\"pants were dirty\\". They looked at her in amazement, not knowing how to react. You see, Mom had fallen over and gotten mud on her jeans. But in Britain, \\"pants\\" means underpants or knickers, not trousers as it does back home. Katie -- From America I went to stay with a friend on the west coast last summer. Her flat was on the first floor of a high-rise building so I got the lift up. Then I wandered round for ages looking for her flat but couldn't find it. Fed up and tired, I finally had to go out to find a phone box. She explained that her flat was on the first floor, which for me meant the ground floor. David -- From Britain When I asked for the \\"restroom\\" in a big department store, people kept directing me to a room with seats where I could sit and \\"rest\\".

Question: Process: - An animal eats a lot of food to fatten up - The animal finds or builds a suitable place to hibernate where they can stay warm and protected - The animal moves into their den - Their heart rate and breathing slow down to conserve energy - They emerge from the den when the weather is warming up again. Question: suppose the animal does not fatten up happens, how will it affect HURTING the animal to hibernate properly. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"If an animal does not fatten up before entering hibernation, it will have a negative impact on the animal's ability to hibernate properly. Fattening up allows the animal to store energy reserves in their body in the form of fat. These energy reserves are critical to the animal's survival during hibernation, as they are not consuming any food during this dormant period. Without sufficient fat reserves, the animal will have less energy available to sustain itself throughout the entire hibernation period, resulting in a higher risk of starvation and other health issues. Consequently, it may be unable to maintain essential bodily functions like temperature regulation, a stable heart rate, and proper cell maintenance at a reduced rate. This scenario corresponds to a \\"more effect\\" situation as it poses a greater threat to the animal's well-being and survival. As for the second effect mentioned—the animal finding or building a suitable place to hibernate—it may also be negatively influenced by the animal's lack of fat reserves. An animal that has not fattened up properly may have less energy to allocate to searching for or constructing an appropriate den. Consequently, they may choose a less-than-ideal location, leaving them more vulnerable to predators, extreme temperatures, and other environmental threats. Overall, this further increases the risk of harm to the animal during hibernation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

It was probably our first form of self-expression when we were babies: long before we start writing, we're painting and scribbling , both in order to make sense of the world and because we enjoy it. In the history of human culture, too, painting and image making came before writing or even simple mathematics: 30,000 years ago compared to 5,000. Yet after we leave school most of us never pick up a pencil again--willingly. If asked to draw something, most adults and many older children will shake their heads and say, \\" Not me! I can't draw. I'm hopeless at it.\\" When you think about it, this is very strange. Drawing involves coordinating the hand and the eye with the pencil. It's a basic skill, no more difficult to learn than other amazing things that humans do, such as hitting a tennis ball over the net or writing our own name. there's no special talent involved. Anybody who can learn to write can learn to draw. So, there you are - no excuse not to get out your pencil, pencil sharpener and rubber and take part in the Big Draw, a nationwide series of free art events taking place all over Britain next October. Everyone's welcome: all you need is a willingness to express yourself through drawing. The Big Draw, now in its fifth year, has already achieved two world records: one for the longest drawing in the world (1km) and the other for the greatest number of people drawing at the same time (7,000). This year, there will be an attempt to create a new Guinness World Record for the longest visitors'book: people will be invited to leave their name and a drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper. The theme this year is InsideOutside--People, Structure( ) and Spaces, and other events planned include drawing on a three-kilometer piece of paper. The Big Draw is not about turning the nation into artists, it is about helping people to acquire this universal language of communication.

Ernest Edward \\"Ernie\\" Kovacs (January 23, 1919 - January 13, 1962) was an American comedian, actor, and writer. Kovacs's visually experimental and often spontaneous comedic style influenced numerous television comedy programs for years after his death. Many individuals and shows, such as Johnny Carson, David Letterman, Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In, Saturday Night Live, Monty Python's Flying Circus, Jim Henson, Max Headroom, Chevy Chase, Conan O'Brien, Jimmy Kimmel, Captain Kangaroo, Sesame Street, The Electric Company, Dave Garroway, Uncle Floyd, and many others have credited Kovacs as an influence. Chevy Chase thanked Kovacs during his acceptance speech for his Emmy award for Saturday Night Live. Kovacs's father Andrew emigrated from Hungary at age 13. He worked as a policeman, restaurateur, and bootlegger; the last so successfully that he moved his wife Mary, and sons Tom and Ernie, into a 20-room mansion in the better part of Trenton. Though a poor student, Kovacs was influenced by his Trenton Central High School drama teacher, Harold Van Kirk, and received an acting scholarship to the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in 1937 with Van Kirk's help. The end of Prohibition and the Depression resulted in difficult financial times for the family. When Kovacs began drama school, all he could afford was a fifth floor walk-up apartment on West 74th Street in New York City. During this time, he watched many \\"Grade B\\" movies; admission was only ten cents. Many of these movies influenced his comedy routines later. A 1938 local newspaper photograph shows Kovacs as a member of the Prospect Players, not yet wearing his trademark mustache. Like any aspiring actor, Kovacs used his class vacation time to pursue roles in summer stock companies. While working in Vermont during 1939, he became so seriously ill with pneumonia and pleurisy that his doctors didn't expect him to survive. During the next year and a half, his comedic talents developed as he entertained both doctors and patients with his antics during stays at several hospitals. While hospitalized, Kovacs developed a lifelong love of classical music by the gift of a radio, which he kept tuned to WQXR. By the time he was released, his parents had separated, and Kovacs went back to Trenton, living with his mother in a two-room apartment over a store. He began work as a cigar salesman, which resulted in a lifelong cigar-smoking habit. Kovacs's first paid entertainment work was during 1941, as an announcer for Trenton's radio station WTTM. He spent the next nine years with WTTM, becoming the station's director of Special Events; in this job he did things like trying to see what it was like to be run over by a train (leaving the tracks at the last minute) and broadcasting from the cockpit of a plane for which he took flying lessons. Kovacs was also involved with local theater; a local newspaper published a photograph of him and the news that he was doing some directing for the Trenton Players Guild in early 1941. The Trentonian, a local weekly newspaper, offered Kovacs a column in June 1945; he named it \\"Kovacs Unlimited\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Are there any other interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"There are definitely interesting aspects in this article, such as: 1.

Growing up in Hibbing, Minnesota, Dylan and his family were part of the area's small but close-knit Jewish community, and in May 1954 Dylan had his Bar Mitzvah. Around the time of his 30th birthday, in 1971, Dylan visited Israel, and also met Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the New York-based Jewish Defense League. Time magazine quoted him saying about Kahane, \\"He's a really sincere guy. He's really put it all together.\\" Subsequently, Dylan downplayed the extent of his contact with Kahane. During the late 1970s, Dylan converted to Christianity. In November 1978, guided by his friend Mary Alice Artes, Dylan made contact with the Vineyard School of Discipleship. Vineyard Pastor Kenn Gulliksen has recalled: \\"Larry Myers and Paul Emond went over to Bob's house and ministered to him. He responded by saying, 'Yes he did in fact want Christ in his life.' And he prayed that day and received the Lord.\\" From January to March 1979, Dylan attended the Vineyard Bible study classes in Reseda, California.By 1984, Dylan was distancing himself from the \\"born again\\" label. He told Kurt Loder of Rolling Stone magazine: \\"I've never said I'm born again. That's just a media term. I don't think I've been an agnostic. I've always thought there's a superior power, that this is not the real world and that there's a world to come.\\" In response to Loder's asking whether he belonged to any church or synagogue, Dylan laughingly replied, \\"Not really. Uh, the Church of the Poison Mind.\\"When it was asked of Dylan in a 1986 press conference in Australia \\"How much do you feel you are a vessel, a medium for a higher power, for God, that it [the music] flows through you... for Him?\\" Dylan replied, \\"Well I feel that way about most of the stuff that I do.\\"In 1997, he told David Gates of Newsweek: Here's the thing with me and the religious thing.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize this article: About 11,000 people who have had early bowel, breast, prostate, stomach and oesophageal cancer will be involved. Uncertainty about the drug's possible anti-cancer qualities has led to fierce medical debate in recent years. If it is proven to work, scientists say it would be \\"game-changing\\", by providing a cheap and effective way to help more patients survive. During the study, funded by the charity Cancer Research UK and the NIHR - the research arm of the NHS - patients will take a tablet every day for five years. Researchers will compare groups of patients taking different doses of aspirin with people taking dummy (placebo) pills and check for any recurrences of cancer. Dr Fiona Reddington from Cancer Research UK said: \\"The trial is especially exciting as cancers that recur are often harder to treat so finding a cheap and effective way to prevent this is potentially game-changing for patients.\\" The trial will run across 100 UK centres, involving patients who are having or have had treatment for early cancer, and will last up to 12 years. But scientists warn that aspirin is not suitable for everyone and should not be used without medical advice. Taking the drug every day comes with a serious health warning as it can cause side effects such as ulcers and bleeding from the stomach, or even the brain. Prof Ruth Langley, lead investigator on the trial, said: \\"There's been some interesting research suggesting that aspirin could delay or stop early stage cancers coming back but there's been no randomised trial to give clear proof. \\"The trial aims to answer this question once and for all. \\"If we find that aspirin does stop these cancers returning, it could change future treatment - providing a cheap and simple way to help stop cancer coming back and helping more people survive.\\" Alex King, 51, who was diagnosed with breast cancer in December 2009 and has been given the all-clear, said: \\"Having cancer was one of the toughest experiences of my life. \\"Any opportunity to reduce the chance of cancer coming back is incredibly important so patients can rest more easily.\\" Many people are already prescribed daily, low-dose aspirin as a heart drug. Summary:","completion":"A big study is being done with around 11,000 people who had different kinds of cancer. They will take a special tablet every day for five years. The tablet has aspirin in it, and scientists want to see if the aspirin helps to stop the cancer from coming back. If it works, it could be a cheap and simple way to help cancer patients. But, taking aspirin every day can have some bad effects, like stomach problems.

One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats.

Schonberg believes that Chopin displayed a \\"tinge of jealousy and spite\\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano, and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success. Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 Études, and his performance of them prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \\"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\\" However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \\"my friend Liszt\\". Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress Marie d'Agoult's obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with George Sand.

We all present these glossy lives to the world; coffee cups presented to dewy sunrises, champagne in airport lounges, luxurious restaurants that cost more than they should and share the blue skies days of exploration.

Those days where the wind is so strong you can’t instastory for talking (I’m looking at you Cornwall), when travel mistakes happen (like in Vienna where I accidentally booked our trip a day short) or when everyone asks you what your next trip will be and you sheepishly have to answer ‘er, not sure’.

I hate photographs of myself. Ironic, no? Especially when one of the first rules of blogging is all about the cult of personality. I just don’t like them. I wish I did, but there are few times that I fancy a photo and even less when I like the result. 2. We nip into a MacDonalds at least once every trip.

This is in no way a #humblebrag about the trip, but a comment on how impractical I can be – and how careful I also am.

It is bordered by Ethiopia to the west, Djibouti to the northwest, the Gulf of Aden to the north, the Indian Ocean to the east, and Kenya to the southwest. Somalia has the longest coastline on Africa's mainland, and its terrain consists mainly of plateaus, plains and highlands. Climatically, hot conditions prevail year-round, with periodic monsoon winds and irregular rainfall. - Aden (, ; \\"\\" ) is a port city in Yemen, located by the eastern approach to the Red Sea (the Gulf of Aden), some east of Bab-el-Mandeb. Its population is approximately 800,000 people. Aden's ancient, natural harbour lies in the crater of a dormant volcano which now forms a peninsula, joined to the mainland by a low isthmus. This harbour, Front Bay, was first used by the ancient Kingdom of Awsan between the 5th and 7th centuries BC. The modern harbour is on the other side of the peninsula.

A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - The even-toed ungulates (order Artiodactyla) are ungulates (hoofed animals) whose weight is borne equally by the third and fourth toes. By contrast, odd-toed ungulates, such as horses, bear their weight primarily on their third toe.

After several high-profile men have resigned due to claims of sexual misconduct, some Democratic lawmakers are suggesting that President Trump should follow suit. In the wake of Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein, “Today” show host Matt Lauer and Democratic Sen. Al Franken losing their jobs over misconduct allegations, a couple of high-profile Democratic senators suggested that the president should do the same. “President Trump has committed assault, according to these women, and those are very credible allegations of misconduct and criminal activity, and he should be fully investigated and he should resign,” Gillibrand told CNN’s Christiane Amanpour. The remarks came as three of Trump’s accusers spoke out again about his behavior. “In an objective setting, without question, a person with this record would have entered the graveyard of political aspirations never to return. Yet, here we are with that man as President,” Rachel Crooks, one of Trump’s accusers, explained at a press conference Wednesday. Here’s what the lawmakers have said. Kirsten Gillibrand Gillibrand told CNN’s Chrisiane Amanpour Monday that Trump should resign, and have congress investigate the allegations of he does not. “These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I’ve heard these women’s testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking,” she told Amanpour. Ron Wyden Wyden, a Democratic Senator from Oregon, echoed Gillibrand’s sentiments on Twitter. “These women are right. If [President Trump] won’t resign, Congress must investigate allegations by many, many women that he sexually assaulted and harassed them. No one is above the law,” he tweeted. Cory Booker Booker told Vice News Saturday that if Franken can be coerced into resignation, it’s only fair that Trump follow suit because the allegations are more damning. “I just watched Sen. Al Franken do the honorable thing and resign from his office. My question is, why isn’t Donald Trump doing the same thing — who has more serious allegations against him, with more women who have come forward. The fact pattern on him is far more damning than the fact pattern on Al Franken,” the New Jersey Senator told Vice. Jeff Merkley Speaking on MSNBC on Dec. 7 — the day Al Franken resigned — Merkley mentioned the possibility of Trump’s resignation when disavowing Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore, who has been accused by multiple women is sexual misconduct when they were teenagers and he was in his thirties. “He should drop out of that race right now.” Merkley said of Moore. “And by the way, for that, matter, the President should resign because he certainly has a track record with more than 17 women of horrific conduct.” ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

(Associated Press) NEW YORK (AP) — Donald Trump sailed past a raft of allegations of sexual misconduct in last year's presidential election. Now the national #MeToo spotlight is turning back to Trump and his past conduct. Several of his accusers are urging Congress to investigate his behavior, and a number of Democratic lawmakers are demanding his resignation. With each day seeming to bring new headlines that force men from positions of power, the movement to expose sexual harassment has forced an unwelcome conversation on the White House. In a heated exchange with reporters in the White House briefing room on Monday, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders steadfastly dismissed accusations against the Republican president and suggested the issue had already been litigated in Trump's favor on Election Day. But to Trump's accusers, the rising #MeToo movement is an occasion to ensure he is at last held accountable. \\"It was heartbreaking last year. We're private citizens and for us to put ourselves out there to try and show America who this man is and how he views women, and for them to say, 'Eh, we don't care,' it hurt,\\" Samantha Holvey said Monday. The former beauty queen claimed that Trump ogled her and other Miss USA pageant contestants in their dressing room in 2006. \\"Let's try round two,\\" she said. \\"The environment's different. Let's try again.\\" Holvey was one of four women to make her case against Trump on Monday, both in an NBC interview and then in a news conference. Rachel Crooks, a former Trump Tower receptionist who said the celebrity businessman kissed her on the mouth in 2006 without consent, called for Congress to \\"put aside party affiliations and investigate Trump's history of sexual misconduct.\\" \\"If they were willing to investigate Sen. Franken, it's only fair that they do the same for Trump,\\" Crooks said. Franken, the Democratic senator from Minnesota, announced last week that he would resign amid an ethics probe into accusations that he sexually harassed several women. Reps. John Conyers, D-Mich., and Trent Franks, R-Ariz., also resigned after misconduct accusations. But a Capitol Hill investigation into Trump's conduct appears unlikely. The Senate and House Ethics Committees investigate members of Congress, not presidents, and Republican-led committees are not apt to investigate Trump on sexual misconduct unless there is some sort of connection to the ongoing Russia probe. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said Congress shouldn't investigate the allegations against Trump. \\"I don't think there's any forum for us to do that,\\" he said. \\"Just think about how that could be abused.\\" Nonetheless, several Democratic senators have seized the moment and called for Trump to step down. \\"President Trump should resign,\\" New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told CNN on Monday. \\"These allegations are credible; they are numerous. I've heard these women's testimony, and many of them are heartbreaking.\\" New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker and Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley have also called on Trump to resign. White House aides have warily watched the movement sweep Capitol Hill, opting to repeat rote denials about allegations against the president. The president's advisers were stunned Sunday when one of the highest-ranking women in the Trump administration broke with the White House line and said the accusers' voices \\"should be heard.\\" \\"They should be heard, and they should be dealt with,\\" Nikki Haley, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a CBS interview. \\"And I think we heard from them before the election. And I think any woman who has felt violated or felt mistreated in any way, they have every right to speak up.\\" Haley's comments infuriated the president, according to two people who are familiar with his views but who spoke on condition of anonymity because they aren't authorized to speak publicly about private conversations. Trump has grown increasingly angry in recent days that the accusations against him have resurfaced, telling associates that the charges are false and drawing parallels to the accusations facing Republican Alabama Senate candidate Roy Moore. Sixteen women have come forward with a range of accusations against Trump, many after the release of the \\"Access Hollywood\\" tape last October in which Trump was caught on an open microphone bragging about groping women. One woman, Summer Zevos, a contestant on Trump's reality show, \\"The Apprentice,\\" sued, contending that Trump's denials of her accusations amount to false and defamatory statements. Jessica Leeds, who appeared at Monday's news conference, recalled sitting on an airplane next to Trump in the 1970s when he began to fondle her. \\"All of a sudden, he's all over me. Kissing and groping, groping and kissing,\\" she said. \\"Nothing was said. It was just this silent groping going on.\\" Trump denied the allegations during the campaign, and Sanders did the same Monday. \\"Look, as the president said himself, he thinks it's a good thing that women are coming forward, but he also feels strongly that a mere allegation shouldn't determine the course,\\" Sanders said. \\"And again, the American people knew this and voted for the president. And we feel like we're ready to move forward in that process.\\" Sanders declined to say whether she believed the accusers or if she herself had been the victim of harassment. She grew impatient with the repeated questions and pledged to provide a list of eyewitnesses whose accounts exonerated the president. The White House did not provide the list by late Monday. ___ Associated Press writers Zeke Miller and Richard Lardner contributed to this report from Washington. ___ Follow Lemire on Twitter at http://twitter.com/@JonLemire ___ This story has been corrected to show that Holvey was a contestant in the Miss USA pageant, not the Miss America pageant. ||||| Donald J.

Given the question: Given the below context: The Avenue Range Station massacre was the murder of a group of Aboriginal Australians by white settlers during the Australian frontier wars. It occurred in about September 1848 at Avenue Range, a sheep station in the southeast of the Colony of South Australia. Information is scarce about the basic facts of the massacre, including the exact date and number of victims. A contemporary account of the massacre listed nine victims – three women, two teenage girls, three infants, and an \\"old man blind and infirm\\". Another account published by Christina Smith in 1880 gave the number of victims as eleven, and specified that they belonged to the Tanganekald people. Pastoralist James Brown and his overseer, a man named Eastwood, were suspected of committing the murders in retaliation for attacks on Brown's sheep. In January 1849, reports of the massacre reached Matthew Moorhouse, the Protector of Aborigines. He visited the district to investigate the claims, and based on his enquiries Brown was charged with the murders in March 1849. Proceedings against Brown began in June 1849 and continued in the Supreme Court of South Australia for several months, but were eventually abandoned. Some key witnesses, including Eastwood, either fled the colony or refused to cooperate with the investigation. There were also significant restrictions on the use of evidence given by Aboriginal witnesses, especially where a verdict could involve capital punishment. These legal hurdles and settler solidarity ensured the case did not go to trial, although the magistrate who committed him for trial told a friend that there was \\"little question of the butchery or the butcher\\". Although the details of the case were known for decades after the murders, distortions of the massacre eventually appeared in print and were embellished by local white and Aboriginal historians. Two key aspects of these later accounts were that Brown poisoned rather than shot the victims, and that he had undertaken an epic horse ride to Adelaide to establish an alibi....

Title: Not the best sundial book available Review: I found Rohr not to be as useful as the two other texts by Waugh or Mayall and Mayall. The other books are more clear and practical in the constructions of many different types of dials.The only strength of the Rohr test is the explanation of (i) drawing hour lines on any surface so long as you have a rod shaped gnomen and (ii) the construction of babylonian and Italian hours. Even so the explanation of the babylonian and Italian hours could be better.So the Rohr book would best be used as an adjunct to the other texts but if you are just starting out, buy the book by Waugh first then Mayall and Mayall and then perhaps Rohr if your library hasn't got it.

A little underwhelmed, a little over stimulated, but I wouldn't fight my friends or refuse to show up if they planned a happy hour here. The identity crisis between sports bar and sushi bar was a little distracting to me - we sat outside where TVs were playing some sporting event, but inside seemed more like Feng Shui-ed. The restrooms were highly entertaining with remote controlled toilets and sensor activated zen inspiring pebble sinks; if I wasn't so hungry I probably would have spent more time in there playing with the gadgets. We unfortunately had just missed happy hour, but I could see how the slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming. The menu had some pretty decent veg options. However, the tofu lettuce wraps had a sour funk that smelled like feet. They didn't taste much better either so I'd steer clear of those if I were ever to stumble on the occasion where I had no choice but to dine here. I'll admit the veggie roll was actually tasty, not enough to make me a loyal patron though. I've had better food. I've had better atmosphere. I've spent less money on mediocre sushi.

The mention of an \\"identity crisis\\" between sports bar and sushi bar being \\"distracting\\" suggests that the atmosphere wasn't entirely enjoyable. 3. While the restrooms' gadgets were entertaining, this point is not relevant to the overall dining experience and doesn't have a significant impact on the overall review. 4. The comment about missing happy hour and how \\"slashed prices may be somewhat redeeming\\" implies that the reviewer found the regular prices less appealing. 5. The critic states that tofu lettuce wraps had a \\"sour funk\\" and \\"didn't taste much better,\\" which indicates dissatisfaction with a specific dish. 6. The reviewer concedes that the veggie roll was \\"tasty\\" but still not enough to become a loyal patron, reinforcing an overall negative impression. 7. The lines \\"I've had better food.

Q: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

Additionally, the Laas Geel caves exhibit some of the earliest known art in Africa. Furthermore, evidence of pottery, stone tools, and occasional lithic remains has also been found, helping us to understand the lives of these prehistoric peoples. In contrast, the Hargesian culture, which was also present during the same period, is named after the Hargeisa region. This culture is characterized mainly by stone tools such as stone picks, pottery, and microlithic implements. These tools suggest that the Hargesian people followed a subsistence strategy focused on hunting, gathering, and fishing practices. In conclusion, although the initially provided statement gives some interesting information about ancient inscriptions, it does not directly answer the posed question. The correct answer should state that the Laas Geel culture existed alongside the Hargesian culture in Somalia during the Stone Age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Reading is the key to school success and, like any skill, it takes practice. A child learns to walk by practicing until he no longer has to think about how to put one foot in front of the other. An excellent sportsman practices until he can play quickly, correctly and without thinking. Educators call it \\"automaticity \\". www.ks5u.com A child learns to read by sounding out the letters and finding the meaning of the words. With practice, he stumbles less and less, reading by the phrase . With automaticity, he doesn't have to think about the meaning of words, so he can give all his attention to the meaning of the text. It can begin as early as first grade. In a recent study of children in Illinois schools, Alan Rossman of Northwestern University found that automatic readers in the first grade not only read almost three times as fast as the others, but also got better results in exams. According to Rossman, the key to automaticity is the amount of time a child spends reading , not his IQ. Any child who spends at least 3.5 to 4 hours a week reading books, magazines or newspapers will probably reach automaticity. It can happen if a child turns off TV just one night for reading at home. You can test yourself by reading something new which is suitable for your level. If you read aloud with expression, with a sense of the meaning of the sentences, you probably are an automatic reader. If you read brokenly, one word at a time, without expression or meaning, you need more practice.
