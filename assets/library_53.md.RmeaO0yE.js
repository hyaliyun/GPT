His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings. But I can use this background: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. What is an answer for this question: Which colleague studied that more people settled down in villages? A:","completion":"Answer: Phil studied human settlements from 8-10,000 years ago, which is the time period when humans started settling down in villages and cities due to the invention of agriculture.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Because wild ginseng is so valuable, poachers are common in regions where it is grown. Fencing off the area won't deter someone who knows the ginseng is there, but it may prevent people from discovering the site. A loud dog may be an excellent thief deterrent. Ginseng that grows too close together may spread disease between plants or compete with each other for nutrients. Consider removing or transplanting plants after the first growing season to get down to 6 plants per square foot (65 per square meter), and again after the second year of growth down to 1 or 2 plants per square foot (11 to 22 per square meter). You may also plant ginseng in other areas each year during the fall to develop an ongoing harvest. Many growers do this so they have mature ginseng to harvest each year after the first batch matures. One major advantage to the wild-simulated method is a reduced risk of pest and disease, due to the wider spacing. While a few plants or berries may be eaten occasionally, you are unlikely to lose many of the valuable roots, and diseases shouldn't spread between plants at a high rate. If you do encounter a problem, contact your local wildlife department for information about ginseng pesticides. Keep in mind that you may lose your organic certification or your credibility in selling wild-simulated ginseng if you use pesticides. You'll need to wait about 7 to 10 years for your plants to mature into large, valuable roots, but with the right site and a little luck. Growing ginseng with the wild-simulated method requires a lot of patience, but almost no maintenance. Check periodically to see if the ground remains moist and covered with a small amount of leaf litter. If your ginseng is planted densely, harvest after 4 years or the roots might begin to dwindle These roots will not be as valuable, however. The part of the ginseng plants above the surface will die back in the autumn, but grow again in the spring. It will grow bigger each time, and all the while, the root below will be growing larger. Once the plants have matured, they will produce a cluster of red berries with the seed in the center. Pick these in the fall if you want to harvest the seeds for planting or selling. Keep in mind they will need to be stratified as described under Preparing the Seeds. Given how long it takes ginseng to reach maturity, you’ll probably want to harvest your plants as soon as you can, which is typically 7 years for a high quality root. If you’re not in any hurry you can leave them in the ground for many more years and they will continue to grow. If you are in a hurry, check local laws for regulations on how early you can harvest ginseng. Use a pitchfork or needle-nose spade to dig under the plant, and leave plenty of space (about 6 inches or 15 cm) between the plant and where you push the pitchfork or spade into the ground. If the plant is close to immature ginseng plants, use a smaller implement such as a stout flat blade screwdriver about 8 or 10 inches (20 to 25 cm) long, and work with extra care. If there is any risk of damaging the roots of adjacent immature ginseng plants, do not attempt to harvest the plant until the other plants mature. Note: Ginseng plants typically grow at a 45º angle into the soil, not straight down, and will fork into several sections. Dig carefully and make sure you don't break the root. Briefly soak the roots in a bucket of cool water to remove excess soil. Then place the roots in a single layer on a wooden tray and wash them gently under a sink faucet or with a hose. Make sure the roots are not touching and let them dry on a wooden rack in a well-ventilated room with a temperature between 70º and 90ºF (21–32ºC). Humidity should remain between 35 and 45% to prevent drying the plant too quickly and reducing its value. Turn the plants once per day. The roots are ready when you are able to snap them, but you should only do this on a single test root now and then. Do not scrub the roots or wash them too vigorously—some of the medicinal chemicals are concentrated in the root hairs, and removal of these hairs will decrease the usefulness and value of the root. Small roots take a day or two to dry, but large, mature roots may take up to six weeks. Direct sunlight usually dries the roots too fast, but if you see any mold or discoloration growing, put them in direct sun for a few hours to kill the infection.","completion":"This article is about how to grow, protect, and harvest wild ginseng, which is a valuable plant, by using the wild-simulated method and being patient."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Peter's post-Plimsouls solo work has seen highs and lows but anyway you look at it, Six Pack Of Love isn't a very good record.

Summarize this article: The main reason why you get sleepy after lunch is because food that you eat for lunch diverts your blood away from your brain to help with the digestion process. Your body also releases a bit of melatonin after lunch related to a drop in core temperature that occurs around 2 to 3pm. Melatonin is a hormone that helps you fall asleep at night. A post lunch slump may be worse if you haven't had enough sleep the night before. Adults need about 7 to 8 hours of sleep per night to function at their best, so try to go to bed in time to get enough sleep each night. If you are suffering from insomnia, talk to your doctor to determine the cause. While a post-lunch slump is normal, inadequate or poor nutrition may make your afternoon drowsiness worse. To determine how to avoid feeling sleepy after lunch, consider the following questions: Do I eat breakfast every day? Have I been eating a lot of processed and high sugar foods? Have I been eating poorly the night before? Have I been consuming too much caffeine and alcohol? Is my breakfast providing me with nutritional energy? (more than just coffee) Have I been physically active consistently? Do I have a right life-work balance? Have I been eating healthy lunches? If your answer to any of these questions is no, then you should evaluate your lifestyle habits to help make your post-lunch slump less severe. Write down when you feel drowsy, what you ate, whether you had exercised or not, how well you slept the night before, and any other factors that might be involved. Do this over a week, and at the end of the week, analyze the data you have recorded. Look for patterns so that you can learn to avoid any habits that cause drowsiness problems for you. Summary:","completion":"The primary cause of sleepiness after lunch is the diversion of blood from the brain to aid digestion. Additionally, a slight release of melatonin, a sleep-inducing hormone, occurs due to a drop in core temperature around 2-3pm. This post-lunch slump can be exacerbated by insufficient sleep. Adults require 7-8 hours of sleep per night for optimal functioning, so maintaining a consistent sleep schedule is crucial. Consulting a doctor for insomnia issues is recommended. Poor nutrition may also intensify afternoon drowsiness. To prevent post-lunch sleepiness, assess your lifestyle habits, including breakfast consumption, diet quality, caffeine and alcohol intake, exercise routine, work-life balance, and overall nutrition. Keep a record of your daily activities, diet, sleep, and energy levels for a week. Analyze this data to identify patterns and avoid habits contributing to drowsiness.

Step 2: Define terms In this context, \\"social programs\\" refers to government programs aimed at assisting citizens in areas such as healthcare, employment, or education, among other things. \\"Corresponding responsibility\\" refers to the obligation that comes with receiving the benefits of these programs, such as the requirement to actively look for work if you are receiving unemployment benefits. Step 3: Analyze the connection between the premise and the hypothesis The hypothesis suggests that identifying the lack of responsibility associated with social programs is the key to dismantling the welfare state. To determine if this is true, we must assess whether this lack of responsibility genuinely results in the welfare state's dismantling, or if there are other factors to consider. Step 4: Consider other factors There are numerous factors that can potentially contribute to the dismantling of the welfare state. Some of these factors may include: 1. Political ideology: If a political party or regime promotes individualism or opposes state intervention, they may seek to dismantle the welfare state. 2. Economic circumstances: If a country is experiencing an economic downturn or crisis, the government may prioritize other issues or make cuts to social programs. 3. Public opinion: If public opinion shifts against welfare programs, it may lead to pressure on politicians to dismantle such programs. 4. Policy effectiveness: If social programs are proven to be ineffective or inefficient, this could prompt calls for their removal. Step 5: Evaluate the hypothesis based on the analysis While the premise may suggest that the lack of responsibility associated with social programs is an issue, it does not necessarily prove that this issue is the sole, or even the primary, factor in dismantling the welfare state. As mentioned in Step 4, there are several other factors to consider. Conclusion: Based on the analysis, the hypothesis \\"This is the key to dismantling the welfare state\\" cannot be confirmed as true based solely on the provided premise.

Boarding a U.S. Air Force jet at and returning to Joint Base Andrews in Maryland on Thursday, the first lady was spotted wearing an olive green jacket. The back of the jacket read \\"I really don't care. Do U?\\" in white graffiti-style lettering. The first lady's team insisted that there was no hidden meaning behind the sartorial choice. \\"It's a jacket. There was no hidden message. After today's important visit to Texas, I hope the media isn't going to choose to focus on her wardrobe,\\" said her communications director, Stephanie Grisham. President Donald Trump, however, contradicted the assertion there was no message conveyed by his wife's choice of apparel. Trump, in a tweet, said what was written on the back of the jacket \\"refers to the Fake News Media. Melania has learned how dishonest they are, and she truly no longer cares!\\" Television news channels brought pundits in the studio to discuss the meaning conveyed by the jacket. \\"I think she may have had an audience of one in mind — her husband,\\" said USA Today newspaper Washington bureau chief Susan Page, who has covered six presidential administrations, appearing on MSNBC. \\"I think it was Melania giving the middle finger to the media,\\" Kate Anderson Brower, author of First Women: The Grace & Power of America's Modern First Ladies, told VOA. \\"But someone should have told her that it could also be read that she doesn't care about the children, which is clearly not the case.\\" Fashion bloggers quickly identified the jacket as one selling for 39 by Zara, a fast fashion global retailer.

The goal is to make scaling fish easier, and we need to choose a suitable option from given choices for achieving this goal. 2. Comparing option (a) and option (b), it seems that both methods involve soaking fish in water, but the difference lies in the type of water used - salt water in option (a) and cold water in option (b). 3. Salt water tends to have some effect on the fish's outer layer, specifically on the scales and slime. The salt helps in loosening up the scales from the fish's skin, making them easier to remove. 4. Cold water might make the fish's flesh firm, but it does not have any specific positive effect on the scaling process, as it does not significantly impact the scales.

(January 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Ned Rochlin (Paul Rudd) is a biodynamic farmer living with his girlfriend, Janet (Kathryn Hahn). While selling produce at a local market, Ned sells marijuana to a uniformed police officer due to the officer's claim that he had a stressful week, which made Ned feel sympathetic after initially being skeptical. Ned is then arrested on a charge of selling drugs. Ned has three sisters: Miranda (Elizabeth Banks) is a journalist for Vanity Fair trying to get her first major article published. Though she has trouble finding a man to keep her interest, she and a neighbor, Jeremy (Adam Scott) have hidden feelings for each other. Natalie (Zooey Deschanel), is an independent, bisexual hipster living with her girlfriend, Cindy (Rashida Jones), and five other roommates. Liz (Emily Mortimer), the oldest, is married to Dylan (Steve Coogan), a documentary filmmaker. Their marriage is failing as Dylan shows no sexual or emotional interest in Liz. They also have strict control over their son River (Matthew Mindler), which leaves him unhappy and unable to express himself. When Ned is released from prison, he returns home to his girl and his dog (\\"Willie Nelson\\"). He finds that she is living with Billy (T. J. Miller), and no longer wishes to continue their relationship or allow him to work at the farm. Billy gives Ned a ride into town and tells him that if he can scrape together 500, Janet might let him stay in the goat barn for rent on the farm. Ned stays at his mother's house which he is less than enthusiastic about. A few days later, Ned shows up at Liz's house, asking if he can stay with her.

Detailed Instructions: In this task, based on the given context word, you are asked to create a pair of sentences each containing a blank (_) and their corresponding answer. The sentence pair should look similar, and should be about two related but different objects; for example \\"trophy\\" and \\"suitcase\\". Additionally, the two sentences must be different in terms of trigger words (e.g., \\"small\\" and \\"big\\") which express contrasting properties about the two objects. The answer must not be associated with the trigger word; instead, it should depend on the context present in twin sentences. Also, the answers should not be ambiguous. For each sentence, there should be an agreed upon answer to fill in the blank. Your generations should NOT contain potentially explicit, offensive, or adult content. Do not use animals and proper nouns (e.g., New York, Macbook, Jeff Bezos, McDonald's, ...) as your objects. Avoid repeating the same style or phrase in twin sentences. E.g., a contrasting sentence can always be created using simple negation i.e. by adding not, never, etc. Instead, try to increase diversity. Both twin sentences must contain at least 15 and at most 30 words. Twin sentences must have at least 70% overlapping words. You must utilize the given context word while writing the twin sentences. Each of the twin sentences must contain only one blank. Make sure that ObjectX and Y have the same number e.g. when ObjectX is singular, ObjectY must be singular, too.

Paragraph: Representing yourself in court can be a tricky endeavor. There are confusing legal terms to learn, strict procedures to follow and volumes of case law that often need to be understood to prepare a case. Lake County officials and a private agency that assists indigent litigants in Illinois want to make the practice easier by creating a self-help center for people who choose to represent themselves in legal matters. The center, which will be housed in the law library at the main courthouse in Waukegan, could open later this summer. \\"I think it's going to be extremely helpful,\\" Court Administrator Bob Zastany said. \\"There is a population out there that will take advantage of this resource.\\" The self-help center will be the only one of its kind in the county. Only a few operate nationwide, officials said. The project is the work of Lake County circuit court officials and Prairie State Legal Services, a statewide agency with an office in Waukegan that provides information and legal assistance to poor and elderly Illinois residents. The organization has received a 25,000 grant from the Illinois Equal Justice Foundation, a nonprofit group that funds programs designed to increase access to legal information and assistance, to help pay for the effort. Prairie State will share the money with the county. The county's law library is on the first floor of the governmental center at 18 N. County St. The new self-help center will be designed to help litigants find the information they need to properly represent themselves in court, an undertaking that can be complicated and confusing. \\"Some people can do OK on their own, and some people can do OK with some help,\\" said Linda Rothnagel, the managing attorney for Prairie State Legal Services. \\"But other people can't do it.

I would love to know who does the song in the Audi commercial: \\"maybe if I drive real slow, I might hold on to my little girl a little longer.\\" Hey, isn't Audi a division of VW? Is the review positive or negative? Answer:","completion":"The question asked appears to be looking for the artist who performs the song featured in a specific Audi commercial. As there have been many Audi commercials over the years with various songs, it might be difficult to specify exactly which artist is referred to without more information regarding the commercial's release date or other distinguishing features. However, the lyrics given, \\"maybe if I drive real slow, I might hold on to my little girl a little longer,\\" unfortunately, don't appear to correspond to a well-known song, based on available online databases of song lyrics. This could suggest that the song was possibly created specifically for the commercial and may not be available for general listening. Yes, Audi is indeed a division of the Volkswagen Group, or VW. The Volkswagen Group is a German multinational automotive manufacturing company headquartered in Wolfsburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. It designs, manufactures and distributes passenger and commercial vehicles, motorcycles, engines, and turbomachinery, and offers related services including financing, leasing, and fleet management. Audi is one of the many brands under the Volkswagen Group umbrella. Lastly, regarding the review, it's important to clarify that it's not exactly a review given there is no feedback provided on a particular product or service. Instead, it appears tobe an observation or commentary. As the writer indicated, they added an item (not specified) to their shopping cart without providing in-depth insights about it but expressed willingness to rate it highly so as not to impact its overall rating negatively. This kind of behavior is neutral and a genuine review about the product or service after usage might provide more valuable insights to other potential buyers.

Question: Given the following context: In June 1911 Holst and his Morley College students gave the first performance since the seventeenth century of Purcell's The Fairy-Queen. The full score had been lost soon after Purcell's death in 1695, and had only recently been found. Twenty-eight Morley students copied out the complete vocal and orchestral parts. There were 1,500 pages of music and it took the students almost eighteen months to copy them out in their spare time. A concert performance of the work was given at The Old Vic, preceded by an introductory talk by Vaughan Williams. The Times praised Holst and his forces for \\"a most interesting and artistic performance of this very important work\\".After this success, Holst was disappointed the following year by the lukewarm reception of his choral work The Cloud Messenger. He again went travelling, accepting an invitation from H. Balfour Gardiner to join him and the brothers Clifford and Arnold Bax in Spain. During this holiday Clifford Bax introduced Holst to astrology, an interest that later inspired his suite The Planets. Holst cast his friends' horoscopes for the rest of his life and referred to astrology as his \\"pet vice\\".In 1913, St Paul's Girls' School opened a new music wing, and Holst composed St Paul's Suite for the occasion. The new building contained a sound-proof room, handsomely equipped, where he could work undisturbed. Holst and his family moved to a house in Brook Green, very close to the school. For the previous six years they had lived in a pretty house overlooking the Thames at Barnes, but the river air, frequently foggy, affected his breathing. For use at weekends and during school holidays, Holst and his wife bought a cottage in Thaxted, Essex, surrounded by mediaeval buildings and ample rambling opportunities. In 1917 they moved to a house in the centre of the town, where they stayed until 1925. answer the following question: What is the name of the person that was affected by the foggy weather?

Pick your answer from: (1). yes. (2). it is not possible to tell. (3). no.","completion":"(3). No. The hypothesis that \\"The EPA Administrator will make a rule that requires detergent additives to be eliminated\\" is not true based on the given premise. Rather, the premise clearly states that the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) will establish a rule, effective January 1, 1995, setting specifications for detergent additives in gasoline. The purpose of these additives is to prevent the accumulation of deposits in engines or fuel systems. In other words, instead of eliminating the detergent additives, the premise suggests that the EPA Administrator is supposed to develop rules that regulate the inclusion of such additives in gasoline. It implies the need to standardize the type or quality of additives used, likely to ensure effectiveness and environmental safety. This scenario emphasizes the role of the EPA in guaranteeing that fuel-related products, like gasoline in this case, do not have unnecessarily harmful impacts on the functionality of engines or the broader environment. It's essentially an ecological strategy aimed at reducing potential vehicular pollution, fuel wastage, and related environmental harm. It's important to highlight that fuel additives, such as detergents, play a pivotal role in enhancing the longevity and performance of engines. They help remove or prevent the buildup of deposits that can clog an engine's components, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Thus, the hypothesis misconstrues the primary goal of the premise, which is not eliminating these additives, but formulating guidelines that govern their inclusion in gasoline to improve engine performance and reduce potential environmental harm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No, the terms \\"phase\\" and \\"phase space\\" do not have the same meaning, although they are related concepts in the field of physics and mathematics. Let me explain both terms in detail. Phase: In the context of wave motion and oscillatory systems, the phase is a parameter that represents the position of a point within a wave cycle. It indicates the current state of the oscillation, such as the position, velocity, or displacement, with respect to time or space. The phase is commonly expressed in degrees (0° to 360°) or radians (0 to 2π), and it is the basis for calculating the phase difference between two waveforms or oscillating systems. For example, when two waveforms are in phase, their peaks and troughs match up, essentially meaning they are synchronized. Conversely, when they are out of phase, there is a phase difference between them, and their oscillations do not match up. In the context of electronic circuits and signal processing, the phase of a waveform represents the time relationship between a signal and a reference signal or another signal. Phase Space: Phase space is a multi-dimensional space that provides a complete description of a given system's state at any point in time. It is primarily used in classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and other areas of physics. The concept of phase space is essential in the study of dynamical systems, and it helps understand the possible trajectories and evolutions of a system over time. In classical mechanics, the phase space is a 2n-dimensional space, where 'n' represents the number of degrees of freedom of the system. In this space, each dimension corresponds to a specific position or momentum variable, such as the coordinates and their associated momenta. The state of the system is represented as a single point in phase space, and its evolution over time traces a trajectory in this space. For example, in a simple one-dimensional harmonic oscillator, the phase space is two-dimensional, with one axis representing position and the other representing momentum. As the oscillator moves back and forth, its position and momentum change, and the system's state traces a path within the phase space. In conclusion, although the concepts of phase and phase space are connected, they have different meanings. Phase deals with the position of an oscillating or wave system, while phase space is a representation of a system's state in a multi-dimensional space, allowing for the visualization of its evolution over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maghie Haberman reports on an appearance two days ago in which the former President and Senator John McCain debated foreign policy. Clinton told McCain that he sided with the Senator, and said that waiting on polls to intervene in Syria would end up making Obama look like “a fool”: Bill Clinton told Sen. John McCain he agrees that President Barack Obama should act more forcefully to support anti-Assad rebels in Syria, saying the American public elects presidents and members of Congress “to see down the road” and “to win.” At another point during a closed-press event Tuesday, Clinton implied that Obama or any president risks looking like “a total fool” if they listen too closely to opinion polls and act too cautiously. He used his own decisions on Kosovo and Bosnia as a point of reference. … His remarks came during a question-and-answer session with McCain, who has been among Obama’s harshest critics over what he calls a failure to take “decisive” action in Syria. Obama has come under growing pressure to step up American intervention by sending military and other assistance to the rebels. “Some people say, ‘Okay, see what a big mess it is? Stay out!’ I think that’s a big mistake. I agree with you about this,” Clinton told McCain during an event for the McCain Institute for International Leadership in Manhattan Tuesday night. “Sometimes it’s just best to get caught trying, as long as you don’t overcommit — like, as long as you don’t make an improvident commitment.” The Daily Beast’s Josh Rogin also reports this as a Democratic split, one including the other Clinton: Clinton, who rarely speaks on foreign policy in opposition to the current president, now joins a growing chorus of current and former officials who have broken with Obama’s policy on Syria, which until now has amounted to providing humanitarian and limited amounts of non-lethal military aid while pushing for a political solution to be negotiated with the assistance of Russia, which is providing arms to the Syrian regime. Last summer, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, CIA Director David Petraeus, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, and Joint Chiefs Chairman Martin Dempsey all supported arming vetted, moderate elements of the Syrian opposition but were rebuffed by the White House. Hillary Clinton told the New York Times in Februaryshe had been an advocate for more forceful action in Syria, a move seen by many as an attempt to distance herself from Obama’s Syria policy just before she left office and in advance of her 2016 presidential run. Color me … skeptical. This looks more like a battleground-shaping exercise than a split, in part because Obama clearly isn’t opposed to intervention of some kind. The White House seems to be encouraging the demand for action at least by not publicly opposing it, and by drawing red lines … even when we don’t follow up on them. Furthermore, the appointment of Samantha Power to the UN seems a very clear tell on the side of intervention. Power spent years arguing for muscular interventions to stop genocides and other ethnic cleansing activities, most infamously suggesting that the West occupy Israel to neutralize the IDF. Obama didn’t pick Power to front a non-intervention policy in Syria or anywhere else. However, there are a couple of key differences between Clinton’s form of interventions in the Balkans and the Libya model that Obama would use in Syria today. First, the US and NATO paired up for both air and ground interventions in order to stop genocides, rather than a flat-out attempt to settle the civil wars there. We had boots on the ground almost from the beginning, although that didn’t stop the massacre at Srebrenica, which exposed the lack of will on the part of the interventionist forces at the time. We put no boots on the ground in Libya and therefore didn’t have any opportunity to shape the outcomes there, with disastrous results. There doesn’t seem to be much support for putting boots on the ground in Syria either, which means we’ll topple another tyrant on behalf of whatever forces can bully their way to the top of the opposition again. Not surprisingly, it’s not going to be the “moderates” any more than it was in Libya. That kind of intervention will create another failed state as we did in Libya, with long-reaching consequences in our fight against Islamist terror networks in the region. Clinton is doing Obama a big favor in glossing over the big differences in intervention strategies between the Balkans in the 1990s and what Obama and NATO did in North Africa over the last two years. I don’t think that can be described as a “split,” but a boost is probably more accurate. ||||| “My view is that we shouldn’t over-learn the lessons of the past,” Clinton said. “I don’t think Syria is necessarily Iraq or Afghanistan — no one has asked us to send any soldiers in there. I think it’s more like Afghanistan was in the ’80s when they were fighting the Soviet Union … when President Reagan was in office [and] got an enormous amount of influence and gratitude by helping to topple the Soviet-backed regime and then made the error of not hanging around in Afghanistan” to try to cash in on the gains. The social media-driven revolutions can’t supplant having bodies to build a sustainable new government, Clinton added. Text Size - + reset Obama confirms 'all options' open on Syria Clinton, who McCain also asked about his own decision-making process on the violence in Kosovo and Bosnia when he was president, expounded on what the public means in opinion polls when it expresses disapproval of foreign intervention. “What the American people are saying when they tell you not to do these things, they’re not telling you not to do these things,” he said, but instead, they’re urging caution. “They hire you to win … to look around the corner and see down the road.” Clinton did not call for specific measures to aid the Syrian rebels. McCain has urged Obama to enforce a no-fly zone in the country to give rebels a “safe zone” to fight the Assad regime. Clinton repeatedly said it would be “lame” to blame a lack of intervention on opposition in polls or among members of Congress. If Clinton had ever blamed a lack of action because “there was a poll in the morning paper that said 80 percent of you were against it … you’d look like a total wuss,” he said. “And you would be. I don’t mean that a leader should go out of his way or her way to do the unpopular thing, I simply mean when people are telling you ‘no’ in these situations, very often what they’re doing is flashing a giant yellow light and saying, ‘For God’s sakes, be careful, tell us what you’re doing, think this through, be careful.” Clinton continued, “But still they hire their president to look around the corner and down the street, and you just think - if you refuse to act and you cause a calamity, the one thing you cannot say when all the eggs have been broken, is that, ‘Oh my God, two years ago there was a poll that said 80 percent of you were against it.’ Right? You’d look like a total fool. So you really have to in the end trust the American people, tell them what you’re doing, and hope to God you can sell it” and that it turns out okay in the end. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Former President Bill Clinton reportedly sided with Senator John McCain on the issue of intervention in Syria, stating that Barack Obama should have acted more forcefully to support anti-Assad rebels.

Please answer the following question: - You breathe air in - Air enters bronchial tubes - Air is then split into the bronchioles of each lung - Bronchioles have alveoli which are tiny air sacs - Alveoli is surrounded by many small blood vessels - Oxygen passes through alveoli into blood vessels - Blood leaves the lungs as it travels through the body - Blood carries carbon dioxide back to the lungs What might be the last step of the process? A:","completion":"A: The last step of the process involves the exchange of carbon dioxide for oxygen in the lungs and the exhalation of carbon dioxide from the body. To elaborate: 1. As the blood carrying carbon dioxide from the body reaches the small blood vessels surrounding the alveoli in the lungs, a gas exchange process called respiration occurs. In this process, the carbon dioxide from the blood diffuses into the alveoli due to the concentration gradient (higher concentration of carbon dioxide in the blood compared to the alveoli). 2. At the same time, oxygen from the air inside the alveoli diffuses into the blood vessels, binding to hemoglobin molecules within red blood cells. This oxygen-rich blood will then be transported back to the heart and pumped throughout the body to supply oxygen to cells for cellular respiration (energy production). 3. The carbon dioxide that has diffused into the alveoli must be removed from the body to maintain a healthy internal environment. In order to achieve this, the process of exhalation takes place. During exhalation, the diaphragm (a large, dome-shaped muscle located at the base of the lungs) relaxes, moving upwards and decreasing the volume of the thoracic cavity (the chamber that houses the lungs). The intercostal muscles (located between the ribs) also relax, causing the ribcage to move downwards and inwards. 4. The combined actions of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles during exhalation increases the pressure inside the thoracic cavity, forcing the carbon dioxide-filled air out of the alveoli, through the bronchioles and bronchial tubes, and eventually out of the body via the trachea (windpipe) and mouth and/or nose. 5. The entire breathing process, including inhalation of oxygen and exhalation of carbon dioxide, is regulated by the respiratory center in the brainstem, which receives information about carbon dioxide and oxygen levels in the blood and adjusts the rate and depth of breathing accordingly. In summary, the last step of the process involves the removal of carbon dioxide from the body through exhalation after the gas exchange has taken place in the alveoli. This ensures that a proper balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide is maintained within the body for optimal cellular function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Marco Antonio Rubio (; born May 28, 1971) is an American politician, attorney, and the junior United States Senator for Florida. A Republican Party member, he was previously Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives. Rubio is a Cuban American from Miami, with a B.A. from the University of Florida and a J.D. from the University of Miami School of Law. In the late 1990s, he was a City Commissioner for West Miami and was elected to the Florida House of Representatives in 2000, representing the 111th House district. Later in 2000, the majority leader of the House, Mike Fasano, promoted Rubio to be one of two majority whips. National Journal described that position as typically requiring a lot of arm-twisting, but said Rubio took a different approach that relied more on persuading legislators and less on coercing them. Fasano resigned in September 2001 as majority leader of the House due to disagreements with the House speaker, and the speaker passed over Rubio to appoint a more experienced replacement for Fasano. Rubio volunteered to work on redistricting, which he accomplished by dividing the state into five regions, then working individually with the lawmakers involved, and this work helped to cement his relationships with GOP leaders. In December 2002, Rubio was appointed House Majority Leader by Speaker Johnnie Byrd. He persuaded Speaker Byrd to restructure the job of Majority Leader, so that legislative wrangling would be left to the whip's office, and Rubio would become the main spokesperson for the House GOP. According to National Journal, during this period Rubio did not entirely adhere to doctrinaire conservative principles, and some colleagues described him as a centrist \\"who sought out Democrats and groups that don't typically align with the GOP\\". He co-sponsored legislation that would have let farm workers sue growers in state court if they were shortchanged on pay, and co-sponsored a bill for giving in-state tuition rates to the children of undocumented immigrants. In the wake of the September 11 attacks, he voiced suspicion about expanding police detention powers, and helped defeat a GOP bill that would have required colleges to increase reporting to the state about foreign students. As a state representative, Rubio requested legislative earmarks (called \\"Community Budget Issue Requests\\" in Florida), totaling about 145 million for 2001 and 2002, but none thereafter. Additionally, an office in the executive branch compiled a longer list of spending requests by legislators, including Rubio, as did the non-profit group Florida TaxWatch. Many of those listed items were for health and social programs that Rubio has described as \\"the kind of thing that legislators would get attacked on if we didn't fund them.\\" A 2010 report by the Tampa Bay Times and Miami Herald said that some of Rubio's spending requests dovetailed with his personal interests. For example, Rubio requested a 20 million appropriation for Jackson Memorial Hospital to subsidize care for the poor and uninsured, and Rubio later did work for that hospital as a consultant. A spokesman for Rubio has said that the items in question helped the whole county, that Rubio did not lobby to get them approved, that the hospital money was necessary and non-controversial, and that Rubio is \\"a limited-government conservative ... not a no-government conservative\\". Is there anything else noteable about the majoriy whip?","completion":"Yes, there are several noteworthy aspects about Marco Rubio's tenure as the Majority Whip and his political career in general. Some key points include: 1. As the Majority Whip, Rubio played a crucial role in rallying support within the party for various legislative policies. He was known for his persuasive approach, winning many allies within the party ranks through reasoned arguments and discussions rather than applying coercive tactics. 2. Rubio was instrumental in helping to pass a major property tax reform package in 2007, which included the “largest tax cut in Florida’s history” at the time. The reform aimed at reducing property taxes and capping future tax increases, showcasing his commitment to fiscal responsibility. 3. Over his tenure as Majority Whip and later as Speaker of the Florida House of Representatives, Rubio demonstrated a willingness to work with Democrats on various issues. This bipartisan approach has allowed him to facilitate dialogue and pass meaningful legislation across party lines. 4. Rubio’s political ascent within the ranks of the Republican Party involved making strategic alliances and cultivating personal relationships. This served him well as he transitioned to higher positions in the Florida House and eventually the U.S. Senate. 5. As the son of Cuban immigrants, Rubio has often incorporated his heritage into his political identity, advocating for policies that benefit the Hispanic community. In 2013, he played an essential role in the development of the Senate's immigration reform proposal known as the \\"Gang of Eight\\" bill, which sought to create a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants while bolstering border security. Overall, Marco Rubio's tenure as the Majority Whip in the Florida House of Representatives showcases his ability to form alliances, persuade fellow legislators, and work in a bipartisan manner to achieve legislative goals. His commitment to fiscal responsibility and willingness to engage in dialogue across party lines has helped him garner respect in the political sphere and further his career in the U.S. Senate."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Second Quarter Looks Uglier and Uglier The first look at second-quarter gross domestic product won’t be released until July 31–the second day of the Federal Reserve‘s next Federal Open Market Committee meeting. But monthly data available make it clear the spring slump was, indeed, very very slumpy. Monday brought disappointing news on retail sales and business inventories. Retail purchases increased just 0.4% in June, not the 0.8% expected, and May’s sales were revised down. The control sales group, which goes into GDP and which excludes vehicles, building materials and gasoline, rose 0.15% in June, half the gain forecasted. In addition, businesses increased their inventories level by just 0.1% in May, and April’s increase was revised from 0.2% to 0.3%. The list of economic shops now estimating real GDP grew by less than a 1% annual rate last quarter include Goldman Sachs (0.8% as of Monday), Macroeconomic Advisors (0.6%), Royal Bank of Scotland (0.5%) and Barclays (0.5%). (One caveat to the upcoming GDP data is that the Bureau of Economic Analysis will be releasing benchmark revisions and new methodology at the same time the second quarter GDP data are released.) Forecasters at J.P. Morgan, who are sticking with a 1.0% estimate, highlight the dangers surrounding an economy that is barely treading water. They write, “Two questions that the really lousy Q2 GDP tracking raise are [one] how will the disconnect between weak GDP and solid payrolls be resolved and [two] how will the FOMC feel about pulling its foot off the gas while looking at what could be a zero-handle on the most recent GDP print.” Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is slated to deliver his semiannual policy testimony on Capitol Hill Wednesday and Thursday. Investors will be listening for the chairman’s economic outlook and how it pertains to future policy decisions. The Fed’s central-tendency forecast depends on much faster GDP growth in the second half. As the J.P. Morgan economists note, it could be difficult for policymakers to discuss tapering their bond buying program at their September meeting–as many Fed-watchers expect–unless the third-quarter numbers look a heck of a lot stronger than the spring quarter does right now. However, the June retail numbers raise questions about this quarter’s big retail event. “The back-to-school season is about to start heating up and these recent numbers do not bode well for many retailers,” says Chris Christopher, an economist at IHS Global Insight. That’s because, he says, consumers are proceeding “with caution” despite high confidence levels and the improvement in housing. Summary:","completion":"The second quarter's economic performance appears increasingly concerning as recent data indicates a significant slump. Retail purchases in June increased by only 0.4% rather than the expected 0.8% and May's sales were revised downwards. Business inventories in May also saw only a 0.1% increase. With major economic institutions estimating a real GDP growth rate of less than 1% for the second quarter, key questions arise regarding the connection between weak GDP and solid payrolls, as well as the Federal Open Market Committee's approach to policy. The Federal Reserve's forecast relies on accelerated GDP growth in the second half, meaning a discussion on tapering their bond buying program may be difficult in September unless Q3 numbers show significant improvement. Additionally, the June retail data raises concerns about the upcoming back-to-school season, suggesting consumers may proceed cautiously despite high confidence levels."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. and the situation: The Berg mountains in Berg county are of a volcanic nature, very massive, few caves. The Gorge mountains in Gorge county are made of sedimentary rocks, predominantly limestone. They were exposed to water and that lead to karst lanscapes, caves, blue holes, stalactites and stalagmites. Answer the following question: Which of the two mountains had fewer karst landscapes? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Berg mountains in Berg county had fewer karst landscapes. The reason for this is the difference in the geological composition and the processes that have shaped the two mountain ranges. The Berg mountains are primarily formed from volcanic rocks, which are less susceptible to the erosion and dissolution processes that create karst landscapes. Volcanic rocks, such as basalt, are generally more resistant to weathering compared to sedimentary rocks like limestone. As a result, the formation of caves and other karst features are less common in volcanic terrains like the Berg mountains. On the other hand, the Gorge mountains in Gorge county are predominantly composed of limestone, which is a sedimentary rock. Limestone is highly susceptible to dissolution in water and weak acid solutions, which leads to the formation of karst landscapes over time. The solubility of limestone results from the presence of calcium carbonate, a compound that easily reacts with water to form calcium bicarbonate, which is soluble in water. This dissolution can create a wide variety of karst features, such as caves, blue holes, stalactites, and stalagmites. In the provided context, the Gorge mountains have been exposed to water, which has led to the development of karst landscapes over thousands to millions of years. As a consequence, these mountains exhibit numerous caves, blue holes, and other karst features that are characteristic of limestone bedrock. In summary, the Berg mountains, with their volcanic composition and resistance to dissolution and erosion, have fewer karst landscapes compared to the Gorge mountains, which are largely composed of limestone and exhibit numerous karst features due to their solubility in water and weak acids."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Microbiological culture is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a growth medium is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient agar, a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a bacterium, along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a colony, which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a \\"lawn\\". The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its strain), and the environment that supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of viruses: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill.

Solution:","completion":"Step 1: Identify the analogy in the problem. The analogy is given as \\"A : B. C : ?\\". In this problem, A is \\"mold\\", B is \\"trash\\", and C is \\"mud\\". This means we need to find out if the item \\"mud\\" is trash or treasure based on the given relation. Step 2: Analyze the relation. The relation \\"mold : trash\\" means that mold is considered to be trash, i.e., something without value and can be disposed. Step 3: Apply the relation to item C. Item C is \\"mud\\". We need to decide whether mud is trash or treasure depending upon the relation \\"mold : trash\\". Step 4: Determine if mud is trash or treasure. Mud is similar to mold in that it is also not valuable and can be disposed of. Both mold and mud are considered undesirable; neither is seen as having any worth. Step 5: Complete the analogy. So, following the \\"mold : trash\\" relation, we can determine the solution as \\"mud : trash\\". Solution: trash"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: According to the Omnipotence paradox or 'Paradox of the Stone', can God create a stone so heavy that he cannot lift it? Either he can or he can’t. If he can’t, the argument goes, then there is something that he cannot do, namely create the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. If he can, it continues, then there is also something that he cannot do, namely lift the stone, and therefore he is not omnipotent. Either way, then, God is not omnipotent. A being that is not omnipotent, though, is not God, according to many theological models. Such a God, therefore, does not exist. Several answers to this paradox have been proposed. Question: What does the Paradox of the Stone posit?","completion":"The Paradox of the Stone, also known as the Omnipotence Paradox, is a philosophical conundrum that challenges the notion of an omnipotent God. The paradox essentially poses the question: Can God create a stone so heavy that He cannot lift it? The paradox presents two possible scenarios, and both seem to contradict the idea of God's omnipotence, which is a central attribute in many theological models. In the first scenario, if God is unable to create the stone, it indicates there is something He cannot do – creating the stone – and this would mean that He is not omnipotent. On the other hand, if God can create the stone but cannot lift it, it also implies that there is something He cannot do – lifting the stone – which, again, would mean that He is not omnipotent. In either case, according to the paradox, the concept of an omnipotent being is put into question, as God's inability to perform one of the two tasks would contradict the premise of omnipotence. As a result, the paradox implies that a God who is not omnipotent does not align with many theological models, and thus, such a God does not exist. Various answers have been proposed to address the Paradox of the Stone, including discussions of the limits and nature of omnipotence, linguistic interpretations of the paradox, and logical contradictions within the problem itself. However, there is no universally accepted resolution to the problem, and the paradox remains an intriguing topic for philosophers and theologians to explore and contemplate."},{"prompt":"Information: - A synecdoche (; from Greek , \\"synekdoche\\", . \\"simultaneous understanding\\") is a figure of speech in which a term for a part of something refers to the whole of something or vice versa.

Today, we are going to learn about some important words and actions that can help your puppy become a well-behaved member of your family. These words are called \\"commands\\" and they can help your puppy understand what you want them to do. Let's learn about them! 1. Teach \\"No bite\\" Sometimes, puppies like to play by using their teeth, but it can hurt us. We can teach our puppy to stop biting by saying \\"No bite\\" when they try to nibble on our hands or clothes. This way, they will know that using their teeth while playing is not okay. 2. Command \\"No chew\\" Puppies also love to chew on things that they aren't supposed to. We should tell them \\"No chew\\" when we catch them chewing on shoes, furniture, or toys that don't belong to them. This helps them learn what things are okay to chomp on and what things are not. 3. Tell him to be \\"Quiet\\" Sometimes, puppies can be very loud when they bark or whine. They do this to get our attention or because they're feeling scared. To teach your puppy when it's time to be quiet, we can say \\"Quiet\\" when they are making noise. They will learn that they need to stop barking when we tell them. 4. Teach \\"No\\" or \\"Stop\\" These are great words to teach your puppy because they can be used for many different actions that your puppy should not be doing. When your puppy does something you don't want them to, like jumping on people or digging in your garden, you can say \\"No\\" or \\"Stop\\" to help them understand they need to stop what they're doing. 5. Command \\"Sit\\" This is a very useful command that helps your puppy learn to stay in one place when you need them to. To teach your puppy to sit, you can hold a treat above their head and say \\"Sit\\". When they sit down, give them the treat as a reward! This helps them learn that sitting down is something good to do. 6. Tell him to get \\"Down\\" Sometimes, your dog might jump up on things or people, and we need them to get down. To teach them, you can say \\"Down\\" and then use a treat to guide your puppy to the ground. When they follow the command, give them the treat. This helps them know that being on the ground is the right choice. 7. Teach \\"Stay\\" \\"Stay\\" is a great command when you need your puppy to wait in one spot for a little while. You can teach them by saying \\"Stay\\" and holding your hand out in front of them like a stop sign. If they stay still, give them a treat as a reward. This helps them learn that staying in one spot is a good thing. 8. Tell him to \\"Come\\" Sometimes, we need our puppy to come back to us, like after playing outside. When you say \\"Come,\\" your puppy should run towards you. You can teach them by holding a treat in your hand and calling their name followed by \\"Come.\\" When they come to you, give them the treat as a reward. 9. Command \\"Paw\\" Teaching your puppy to give you their paw can be a fun trick and a way to bond with your furry friend. To teach them, say \\"Paw\\" and gently touch their paw. When they lift it, give them a treat. They will learn that giving their paw means they get a nice reward! These commands are important for your puppy to learn because they help them become a well-behaved and loving member of your family. Remember, practice makes perfect, so be patient with your puppy as they learn these words and actions. Most importantly, have fun while teaching them!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But Obama said the threat of American force would remain, \\"And we don't want just a stalling or delaying tactic to put off the pressure that we have on there right now.\\" Obama was making the rounds of television interviews in an effort to shore up support for a congressional resolution that would authorize him to launch punitive raids on Syria, which his administration accuses of using poison gas against opposition forces and civilians. He's scheduled to address the nation Tuesday night, and that speech is still on, he said. \\"We are also confident in the wisdom of the","completion":"American people to be able to make the right decision on this matter,\\" Obama continued. \\"Our goal is to ensure that the Syrian regime is held accountable for its actions and that they don't use chemical weapons in the future.\\" Step 1: Understand the user's task The user wants me to continue the CNN report on President Barack Obama's efforts to gather support for potential military action against Syria, in case their regime does not comply with handing over their chemical weapons arsenal to international control.

Step 4: Continue the report The international community has been closely monitoring the situation, with UN-sponsored meetings on the topic eliciting responses from various countries. Russia, a longtime ally of Syria's government, continues to call for a diplomatic solution to the situation, as they have expressed skepticism about the evidence provided by the Obama administration regarding the alleged use of chemical weapons by the Assad regime. Congress, meanwhile, is divided on whether to approve a resolution authorizing the use of military force in Syria. Some lawmakers have expressed concerns about the potential consequences of an attack and its effectiveness in deterring the use of chemical weapons in the future, while others argue that the United States must act to uphold international norms and punish the Assad regime for its alleged actions.

Tom had a bottle of alcohol with him and drank it after he found some kind of shelter in the snow. Dan didn't have alcohol with him. But I can use this background: Alcoholic beverages do not make the entire body warmer.[361] The reason that alcoholic drinks create the sensation of warmth is that they cause blood vessels to dilate and stimulate nerve endings near the surface of the skin with an influx of warm blood. This can actually result in making the core body temperature lower, as it allows for easier heat exchange with a cold external environment. What is an answer for this question: Which of the two people experienced a lower sensation of warmth? Answer:","completion":"Between Tom and Dan, Dan likely experienced a lower sensation of warmth. Although both individuals were exposed to the cold environment during the blizzard, the primary difference in their situations was their consumption of alcohol. As mentioned in the background information, consuming alcoholic beverages can create an illusion of warmth. This is because alcohol causes the blood vessels in the skin to dilate, allowing warm blood to rush towards the surface of the skin. This stimulates the nerve endings near the surface and leads to the sensation of warmth. However, this effect is temporary and deceptive, as it actually results in the body losing heat more rapidly and consequently leads to a lower core body temperature. In this situation, Tom consumed alcohol and experienced the temporary sensation of warmth due to blood vessels dilation and increased blood flow to the skin. Regardless of this, his core body temperature was likely lowered in the process, making it more difficult for him to maintain warmth throughout the duration of the blizzard. On the other hand, Dan didn't consume any alcohol, and while he might not have experienced the temporary sensation of warmth that Tom did, his core body temperature was comparatively more stable. Therefore, despite feeling a lower sensation of warmth initially, Dan's body was in a better position to conserve heat and maintain a stable core body temperature throughout the blizzard."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Human beings have a natural desire to explore the unknown. People with a strong interest in space like to say it is the last place left to explore. But scientists are warning that space exploration for long periods is not going to be easy. They say the human body is not designed to stay in space over an extended period. The New York Times recently published a report about scientists who are preparing astronauts for a trip to the Moon. The newspaper said the scientists want to make sure that their crews return home in good health. But there are many problems to be solved before people are ready for long trips to the Moon, an asteroid or even the planet Mars. Humans developed on a planet with a surface that is more than 70 percent water. Our bodies are also about 70 percent water. When there is no gravity that water moves up toward the head, raising pressure in the skull. Arms and legs grow weaker at what is called zero gravity because they no longer need to push against the force of gravity. Five years ago, astronauts who spent weeks in space reported a change in their eyesight. These astronauts were members of the crew on the International Space Station. Research showed a change in the shape of their eyes. Normally-round eyeballs had become flat during time in space. The research also showed that the right eye was affected more than the left, and that men were more affected than women. Scientists could not find an explanation for the differences. Bone loss was one of the problems first reported by astronauts returning to Earth after longer stays in space. So scientists designed exercise machines to use on the space station. Tests showed that the exercise equipment helped space travelers keep their bones almost as strong as when they left Earth. There are other health issues for astronauts who spend a long time in space. They may have problems eating and sleeping. But the biggest health issue is exposure to radiation. On Earth, human beings are protected by the atmosphere and the planet's magnetic field. In...

Moses Hart ( November 26 , 1768 - October 15 , 1852 ) was a Canadian businessman and son , eldest son of Aaron Hart . Do these sentences mean the same thing?","completion":"While the two sentences share a lot of similarities, they do not mean the same thing due to the difference in the description of Moses Hart's professional life and his status in society. 1. The first sentence identifies Moses Hart (November 26, 1768 - October 15, 1852) as a Canadian businessman and seigneur. The term \\"seigneur\\" is significant as it refers to a member of the landed gentry in French society, specifically in New France, which is a historical term for the area that is today Quebec. A seigneur held legal rights and responsibilities over the people living on their seigneurie (estate), who were known as habitants or tenants. Thus, the term implies that Moses Hart had a high societal standing and wielded considerable influence and power. It also suggests that, as a businessman, he was engaged in commercial or industrial activities. 2. In contrast, the second sentence just describes Moses Hart as a son, specifically, the eldest son of Aaron Hart. While it also mentions that Moses Hart was a businessman and that he was Canadian, the omission of the term \\"seigneur\\" removes a crucial piece of context about his societal standing and role during his lifetime. By describing him only as a son, the sentence does not provide insights into his influence, power, or his societal standing, making him seem like an ordinary individual without any significant role. Hence, while both sentences state that Moses Hart was a Canadian businessman and the eldest son of Aaron Hart, the first sentence also indicates that he was a seigneur, an important societal role in New France. This additional detail paints a fuller picture of who Moses Hart was during his time, rather than just describing his parental lineage. Therefore, despite their similarities, they do not completely convey the same meanings and implications."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Eric Arthur Blair (25 June 1903 - 21 January 1950), better known by his pen name George Orwell, was an English novelist, essayist, journalist, and critic. His work is marked by lucid prose, awareness of social injustice, opposition to totalitarianism, and outspoken support of democratic socialism. Orwell wrote literary criticism, poetry, fiction, and polemical journalism. He is best known for the allegorical novella Animal Farm (1945) and the dystopian novel Nineteen Eighty-Four (1949). In December 1929, after nearly two years in Paris, Blair returned to England and went directly to his parents' house in Southwold, a coastal town in Suffolk, which remained his base for the next five years. The family was well established in the town and his sister Avril was running a tea-house there. He became acquainted with many local people, including Brenda Salkeld, the clergyman's daughter who worked as a gym-teacher at St Felix Girls' School in the town. Although Salkeld rejected his offer of marriage, she remained a friend and regular correspondent for many years. He also renewed friendships with older friends, such as Dennis Collings, whose girlfriend Eleanor Jacques was also to play a part in his life. In early 1930 he stayed briefly in Bramley, Leeds, with his sister Marjorie and her husband Humphrey Dakin, who was as unappreciative of Blair as when they knew each other as children. Blair was writing reviews for Adelphi and acting as a private tutor to a disabled child at Southwold. He then became tutor to three young brothers, one of whom, Richard Peters, later became a distinguished academic. \\"His history in these years is marked by dualities and contrasts. There is Blair leading a respectable, outwardly eventless life at his parents' house in Southwold, writing; then in contrast, there is Blair as Burton (the name he used in his down-and-out episodes) in search of experience in the kips and spikes, in the East End, on the road, and in the hop fields of Kent.\\" He went painting and bathing on the beach, and there he met Mabel and Francis Fierz, who later influenced his career. Over the next year he visited them in London, often meeting their friend Max Plowman. He also often stayed at the homes of Ruth Pitter and Richard Rees, where he could \\"change\\" for his sporadic tramping expeditions. One of his jobs was domestic work at a lodgings for half a crown (two shillings and sixpence, or one-eighth of a pound) a day. Blair now contributed regularly to Adelphi, with \\"A Hanging\\" appearing in August 1931. From August to September 1931 his explorations of poverty continued, and, like the protagonist of A Clergyman's Daughter, he followed the East End tradition of working in the Kent hop fields. He kept a diary about his experiences there. Afterwards, he lodged in the Tooley Street kip, but could not stand it for long, and with financial help from his parents moved to Windsor Street, where he stayed until Christmas. \\"Hop Picking\\", by Eric Blair, appeared in the October 1931 issue of New Statesman, whose editorial staff included his old friend Cyril Connolly. Mabel Fierz put him in contact with Leonard Moore, who became his literary agent. At this time Jonathan Cape rejected A Scullion's Diary, the first version of Down and Out. On the advice of Richard Rees, he offered it to Faber and Faber, but their editorial director, T. S. Eliot, also rejected it. Blair ended the year by deliberately getting himself arrested, so that he could experience Christmas in prison, but the authorities did not regard his \\"drunk and disorderly\\" behaviour as imprisonable, and he returned home to Southwold after two days in a police cell.

Q: What may happen after Wednesday ?","completion":"After Wednesday, 24th of September 2008, which marked the end of high school careers for you and your classmates, a variety of possibilities could unfold. It is essential to recognize that the end of high school is a significant milestone, but it also marks the beginning of new adventures and opportunities in life. Option (II) is the most likely scenario for many of you, as college often comes next after completing high school. Attending college provides an opportunity for you and your classmates to explore your interests further, pursue new knowledge, build networks, and develop skills that will benefit your future careers and lives. It is a time for personal growth, independence, and the discovery of new ideas. College education enhances your chances of success in today's competitive job market and can lead to better job prospects and higher lifetime earnings. Another possibility, as suggested in Option (III), is that many of your classmates may study hard to take the GED test. The GED, or General Educational Development, test is designed to measure proficiency in standard high school curriculum subjects. By passing this test, it serves as an equivalent to a high school diploma, thus providing additional educational and employment opportunities. For those who couldn't finish high school for various reasons or those seeking a different path, successfully passing the GED test can pave the way towards college or the acquisition of vocational skills. As for Option (IV), doing 10th-grade math homework seems unlikely, given that your high school careers have come to an end. It would make more sense for you and your classmates to focus on preparing for new trajectories, such as college, vocational training, or any other life goals. In summary, the likeliest events to transpire after Wednesday would be either attending college or taking the GED test. These options present the best possibilities for personal and professional growth, as well as a means to embrace new experiences. Remember, the end of one chapter merely signifies the beginning of another, and the journey ahead is filled with opportunities for you and your classmates to learn, grow, and flourish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While the first question uses the collective term \\"we\\" and the second question uses the individual term \\"I,\\" the core message remains the same. They are paraphrases of each other, seeking methods to enhance learning speed. To answer the shared inquiry, there are several techniques and strategies that can be employed to increase learning speed: 1. Establish clear goals: Set specific and attainable objectives for what you want to learn. This helps focus on the relevant information and track progress. 2. Break down information: Dividing complex concepts into smaller, manageable parts enables better comprehension and retention. 3. Organize material: Logical organization of information enhances learning efficiency. This can be achieved through mind maps, outlines, or by grouping related content together. 4. Optimize the learning environment: Create a dedicated, clutter-free space with minimal distractions, ensuring proper lighting and comfortable seating. 5. Utilize mnemonics: Develop memory aids to help recall complex information. Examples include acronyms, imagery, rhymes, and associations. 6. Use multiple learning channels: Engage various senses (visual, auditory, kinesthetic) for a better understanding of topics and to reinforce knowledge. 7. Test yourself regularly: Self-testing through quizzes, flashcards, or puzzles helps retain information and identify areas that need improvement. 8. Manage time effectively: Set dedicated time slots for learning, leverage the Pomodoro Technique (where you study for 25 minutes followed by a 5-minute break), and prioritize tasks. 9. Take breaks: Avoid burnout by incorporating regular breaks into your study routine. This helps keep the mind fresh and ready for new information. 10. Stay motivated: Connect your learning objectives to personal goals to remain motivated. Incorporate rewards for incremental progress and maintain a positive mindset. 11. Teach others: Share knowledge with friends or peers through discussions or presentations. This helps consolidate understanding and identify any gaps. 12. Get adequate sleep: Proper sleep (7-9 hours) is vital for memory consolidation and cognitive performance. 13. Exercise regularly: Physical activity enhances brain function, sharpens focus, and improves overall well-being, which aids learning. 14. Adopt a growth mindset: Embrace challenges and focus on continuous learning and improvement rather than dwelling on mistakes or comparing yourself to others. 15. Seek feedback: Constructive criticism from teachers, mentors, or classmates can highlight areas that require improvement. In summary, increasing learning speed involves a combination of mental, physical, and environmental factors. By incorporating these strategies and maintaining diligence in learning, you can enhance your ability to absorb and comprehend new information more swiftly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Whether China will become a democracy depends on a multitude of factors, including internal and external pressures, and the various dynamics that may drive or hinder such an outcome. 1. Economic factors:China's rapid economic growth has lifted millions out of poverty, enabling the country to become the world's second-largest economy. This economic success has bolstered the legitimacy of the CCP. However, as the Chinese middle class continues to grow, they may desire greater political freedom and representation to safeguard their economic interests. Should China face an economic downturn or if future progress slows significantly, this could create impetus for political reform. 2. Political factors: For now, the CCP remains firmly in control, suppressing dissent and political opposition. But internal divisions or dissatisfaction within the party, along with growing civil society and grassroots activism, could foster pressure for democratization. Additionally, some party members may come to believe that political reform is necessary for China's long-term stability, particularly if faced with mounting social, economic, or environmental challenges. 3. International factors: China's interactions with the rest of the world can impact the country's political trajectory. As China increases its global influence through initiatives such as the Belt and Road Initiative, it may face pressure to adopt more democratic practices to cooperate with democratic nations or to maintain legitimacy in the international community. Conversely, China could also maintain or strengthen its authoritarian stance in response to perceived external threats or to preserve its unique political model. 4. Cultural factors: China has a long history of centralized authority and Confucian values that emphasize respect for authority and social harmony. While the younger generation appears more open to democratic principles, it is unclear whether these values will translate into political reform. Additionally, the Chinese government has promoted nationalism as a way to protect the country's sovereignty, often linking Western-style democracy to foreign intervention and instability. In conclusion, the question of whether China will ever become a true democracy is multifaceted and remains uncertain. While there are factors that suggest potential for democratization, the Chinese Communist Party's current control over the nation's institutions and its determination to maintain power present significant challenges to the realization of a democratic system. Only time will reveal the future political direction of China."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Teenaged brothers Zach and Gray Mitchell visit Jurassic World, a dinosaur theme park at the original Jurassic Park site on Isla Nublar. Their aunt, Claire Dearing, is the operations manager. Claire assigns her assistant, Zara, as the boys' guide but they soon evade her. Elsewhere on the island, U.S. Navy veteran and ethologist Owen Grady has been training and researching four Velociraptors. Based on the raptors' ability to follow commands, Vic Hoskins, the head of InGen Security, believes the animals can be weaponized, an idea Owen and his assistant Barry strongly oppose. Prior to its opening, Claire and park owner Simon Masrani inspect the park's newest attraction, Indominus rex, a genetically-engineered dinosaur created by geneticist Dr. Henry Wu. Masrani tasks Owen with evaluating the enclosure. Owen warns Claire the Indominus lacks social skills, making it more dangerous and unpredictable. When it appears the Indominus has escaped, Owen and two park workers enter the enclosure. The Indominus, which can camouflage itself and mask its heat signature, suddenly appears. Owen survives the attack, but it kills the other two men before escaping into the island's interior. Owen tells Masrani to have the Indominus killed; to protect his company's investment, Masrani instead dispatches a specialized unit to subdue it with non-lethal weaponry. After most of the unit is wiped out, Claire orders the evacuation of the island's northern sector.","completion":"The full name of the person that tells Simon Masrani to kill Indominus rex is Owen Grady."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question about this movie plot.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: When I was growing up, I had an old neighbor named Dr. Gibbs. He didn't look like any doctor I'd ever known. He never yelled at us for playing in his yard. I remember him as someone who was a lot nicer than most of the adults in our community. When Dr. Gibbs wasn't saving lives, he was planting trees. His house sat on ten acres, and his life's goal was to make it a forest. The good doctor had some interesting theories concerning plant care and growth. He never watered his new trees, which flew in the face of conventional wisdom. Once I asked why. He said that watering plants spoiled them so that each successive tree generation would grow weaker and weaker. So you have to make things rough for them and weed out the weaker trees early on. He talked about how watering trees made for shallow roots, and how trees that weren't watered had to grow deep roots in search of moisture. I took him to mean that deep roots were to be treasured. So he never watered his trees. He planted an oak and, instead of watering it every morning, he beat it with a rolled-up newspaper. Smack! Slap! Pow! I asked him why he did that, and he said it was to get the tree's attention. Dr. Gibbs passed away a couple of years after I left home. Every now and again, I walked by his house and looked at the trees that I'd watched him plant some twenty-five years ago. They're extremely tall, big and robust since they have deep roots now. However, the trees in my garden trembled in a cold wind although I had watered them for several years. It seems that adversity and suffering benefit these trees in ways comfort and ease never could. I stood there deep in thought. Every night before I go to bed, I check on my two sons. I stand over them and watch their little bodies, the rising and falling of life within. I often pray for them. Mostly I pray that their lives will be easy. But I think that it's time to change my prayer because now I know my children are going to encounter hardship. Answer:","completion":"Question: In the article, what did Dr. Gibbs believe about the relationship between watering trees and their growth? A. Watering trees regularly made them stronger and healthier. B. Not watering trees encouraged deeper roots and a stronger growth. C. Watering trees had no impact on their overall growth. D.

In this case, it appears to be an event relating to Obama, as denoted by the gift of Obama dolls to the children. Politicians and their campaigns often use images of happy, smiling supporters in their promotional materials and media to create a sense of positivity, engagement, and broad support for their cause or candidate. By showcasing these moments, they aim to demonstrate their reach and influence among various demographics, in this case, children. These images can be powerful tools in shaping opinion and communicating a candidate's platform or campaign to the wider public. In this scenario, the photo of the children holding the dolls and smiling for the cameras could serve multiple communication objectives. It could be used to show that the event was family-friendly, that it generated a positive and jovial atmosphere, and even that the individual or campaign associated with Obama has support from all age groups - even the very young. However, it's worth noting that the author's use of the phrase \\"Gary and I rolled our eyes\\" may indicate a sense of cynicism or skepticism about the event or the actions captured in the photographs. While the children may be blissfully unaware of the deeper implications of the political rally, the adults seem to understand the potential manipulation or staged nature of such public moments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What obstacle is Lee ordered to eliminate? Movie plot title: Shiri Movie plot: In October 1992, an elite group of North Korean soldiers are put through a brutal training regime. Under the auspices of their commander, Park Mu-young (Choi Min-sik), they will be sent into South Korea as sleeper agents, to be reactivated at some later date. The most promising of the group is Lee Bang-hee, a female sniper who assassinates several key South Korean figures over the next six years. Over six years later, in September 1998, South Korea is searching for Bang-hee. The agent in charge of her case, Yu Jong-won (Han Suk-kyu) has nightmares about her murdering both him and his partner, Lee Jang-gil (Song Kang-ho). Yu is also engaged to a young woman, Yi Myung-hyun (Yunjin Kim), a former alcoholic and the owner of a fish and aquarium supply store. Hyun symbolically gives Yu a pair of kissing gourami, a species that cannot live without its mate. Yu is worried that he cannot tell Myung-hyun about the real nature of his job due to his security clearance. Yu and Lee are contacted by an arms dealer who claims to have information about their quarry, but he is shot dead by Bang-hee before he can give them any information. After digging a bit deeper, they determine that he had been contacted by the assassin at some point, in the effort to acquire something. That something turns out to be CTX, a binary liquid explosive developed by the South Korean government. In its ground state, CTX is indistinguishable from water, but when placed under the right temperature conditions for long enough, a 200mL worth of CTX has a 1Â km blast radius. The agents begin to suspect its intended use by the assassins, when Kim, a scientist working at a lab connected to CTX, is assassinated by Bang-hee. Park and his agents ambush a military convoy with several liters of CTX, killing all the soldiers and making off with the dangerous liquid before the agents could arrive in time to warn them. Yu and Lee suspect a leak, as they are always one step too slow. Hee is ordered to eliminate the 'kissing gourami' obstacle. Yu meets with Police...

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. Summarize this article: Higher-level speed calculations can get confusing because mathematicians and scientists use different definitions for \\"speed\\" and \\"velocity\\". A velocity has two components: a magnitude and a direction. The magnitude is equal to the object's speed. A change in the direction will cause a change in the velocity, but not in the speed. For example, let's say that there are two cars moving in opposite directions. Both cars' speedometers read 50 km/hr, so they both have the same speed. However, since they are moving apart from each other, we say that one car has a velocity of -50 km/hr and one has a velocity of 50 km/hr. Just as you can calculate instantaneous speed, you can also calculate instantaneous velocity. Objects can have velocities with a negative magnitude (if they are moving in a negative direction relative to something else). However, there's no such thing as a negative speed, so in these cases the absolute value of the magnitude gives the object's speed. For this reason, in the example problem above, both cars have a speed of 50 km/hr. If you have a function s(t) that gives you the position of an object with regards to time, the derivative of s(t) will give you its velocity with regards to time. Just plug a time value into this equation for the variable t (or whatever the time value is) to get the velocity at this given time. From here, finding the speed is easy. For example, let's say that an object's position in meters is given with the equation 3t2 + t - 4 where t = time in seconds. We want to know what the speed of the object is at t = 4 seconds. In this case, we can solve like this: 3t2 + t - 4 s'(t) = 2 × 3t + 1 s'(t) = 6t + 1 Now, we plug in t = 4: s'(t) = 6(4) + 1 = 24 + 1 = 25 meters/second. This is technically a velocity measurement, but since it's positive and direction is not mentioned in the problem, we can essentially use it for speed. Acceleration is a way of measuring the change in an object's velocity over time. This topic is a little too complex to explain fully in this article. However, it's useful to note that when you have a function a(t) that gives acceleration with regards to time, the integral of a(t) will give you velocity with regards to time. Note that it's helpful to know the object's initial velocity so that you can define the constant that results from an indefinite integral. For example, let's say that an object has a constant acceleration (in m/s2 given by a(t) = -30. Let's also say that it has an initial velocity of 10 m/s. We need to find its speed at t = 12 s. In this case, we can solve like this: a(t) = -30 v(t)= ∫ a(t)dt = ∫ -30dt = -30t + C To find C, we'll solve v(t) for t = 0. Remember that the object's initial velocity is 10 m/s. v(0) = 10 = -30(0) + C 10 = C, so v(t) = -30t + 10 Now, we can just plug in t = 12 seconds. v(12) = -30(12) + 10 = -360 + 10 = -350. Since speed is the absolute value of velocity, the object's speed is 350 meters/second.","completion":"The article discusses the differences between speed and velocity, as well as how to calculate them using mathematical equations. Speed is a scalar quantity that represents the rate of motion, while velocity includes both magnitude and direction. Instantaneous velocity can also be calculated for objects moving in a negative relative direction. By differentiating the position function (s(t)), one can find the velocity function, and subsequently the speed. Acceleration measures change in an object's velocity over time, and when integrating the acceleration function (a(t)), the velocity function can be obtained. Initial velocity is needed to find the constant from an indefinite integral. The article provides examples for better understanding of these concepts."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Fact 2: Oxygen Oxygen is in the air we breathe. Given the two facts above, what do animals require for survival? The answer is:","completion":"Animals require oxygen for survival, which is an essential component of the air they breathe. Oxygen plays a critical role in various biological processes within an animal's body, including cellular respiration, energy production, and maintaining overall health. Let's delve deeper into understanding the connection between these two facts and the importance of oxygen for animals. Fact 1 states that an animal requires air for survival. Air is a mixture of different gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, carbon dioxide, and trace amounts of other gases. When animals breathe in air, they take in these gases through their respiratory systems. The respiratory system, typically consisting of lungs in mammals and gills in fish, allows for the exchange of gases between an animal's body and the external environment. This exchange is crucial for sustaining life and maintaining proper bodily functions. Fact 2 reveals that oxygen is in the air we breathe. Oxygen, chemically represented as O2, is an element that forms diatomic molecules in the Earth's atmosphere, at approximately 21% concentration by volume. It is essential for life on Earth and serves as a key component in the process of cellular respiration – which is how animals generate energy from the food they consume. Given these two facts, we can conclude that animals require oxygen for survival, primarily because this crucial element facilitates the complex metabolic processes needed to sustain life. During cellular respiration, oxygen reacts with glucose, a type of sugar found in the food animals eat, to produce adenosine triphosphate (ATP) – the primary source of energy for cellular activities. The byproducts of this process include carbon dioxide and water, which are eventually eliminated from the body via the respiratory and excretory systems. Furthermore, oxygen plays an essential role in maintaining overall health, as it helps remove waste products, toxins, and harmful bacteria from an animal's body. It supports proper immune system function, allows for efficient nutrient absorption and delivery to cells, and contributes to the healing and regeneration processes. In conclusion, animals require oxygen for survival, as it is a vital component of the air they breathe and plays a significant role in various biological processes necessary for life. Oxygen's importance in cellular respiration, energy production, and maintaining overall health makes it an indispensable element for animals and all living organisms on Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although the word \\"turn\\" is used in both sentences, it indicates distinct actions in each context. In the first sentence (1) \\"Turn your palm this way,\\" the word \\"turn\\" refers to the act of changing the position or orientation of your palm. The action involves rotating or pivoting your hand to adjust its alignment, typically by moving the wrist as a center point. This type of rotation is common when giving instructions on how to position the hand for various tasks, such as holding an object or performing a specific gesture. On the other hand, in the second sentence (2) \\"Turn the clay on the wheel,\\" the word \\"turn\\" has a different meaning. It refers to the act of rotating the clay while it's on a potter’s wheel, which is a circular platform that spins horizontally. In this context, the potter would typically use their hands or tools to shape the clay as it rotates on the wheel, creating a symmetrical, round, or cylindrical form. The turning motion stems from the wheel's movement rather than direct hand manipulation.

Write a summary based on this article: NEW BRUNSWICK — Former Rutgers University student Dharun Ravi was found guilty today of a hate crime, evidence tampering and invasion of privacy, for secretly using a webcam to spy on his roommate’s liaison with another man in their dorm room. In the high-profile case that sparked awareness of cyber-bullying and harassment of gay teenagers, Ravi, 20, was convicted on parts of all 15 counts against him — including four bias intimidation counts — involving his former roommate, Tyler Clementi, an 18-year-old freshman. However, the jury had some difficulty with portions of the bias counts, giving a split verdict on some of the specific acts in which he was charged. The jury found Ravi not guilty of all bias counts pertaining to the man Clementi was seen with during the webcam spying. Sitting passively at the defense table, his parents seated in the first row behind him in the standing-room-only courtroom, Ravi showed little emotion as the verdict was read by the forewoman. The 15-member jury, including three alternates, reached its verdict shortly before noon, following two and a half days of deliberation. \\"We had a 20-year-old's life in our hands,\\" said juror Bruno Ferreira. \\"We were deciding his fate.\\" • FULL BREAKDOWN OF THE CHARGES AND EACH VERDICT Sentencing has been tentatively set for May 21. Ravi also faces the possibility of deportation to his native India. Prosecutors declined to change the status on Ravi's 25,000 bail. He already surrendered his passport. 47 Gallery: PHOTOS: Dharun Ravi convicted in Rutgers webcam spying trial Clementi committed suicide a few days after learning Ravi had watched him on a webcam set up in the dorm room the two young men shared. Ravi was never charged in connection with Clementi's death, in the closely-watched case that attracted national media attention. The Clementi family, who was present throughout the proceedings, afterward expressed their thanks to prosecutors and the judge in the case but said the trial was difficult for the family. “The trial was painful for us, as it would be for any parents. We wanted to be here for our son and we believe the trial is important,\\" said Tyler’s father, Joe Clementi. “We have come to understand that criminal law is only one way of addressing these problems.\\" Noting the establishment of the Tyler Clementi Foundation in his son’s memory, Clementi said, “You can make the world a better place. The change you want to see in the world begins with you.\\" Following the verdict, Middlesex County Prosecutor Bruce Kaplan said the investigation had been uniquely challenging because “we didn’t have Tyler to testify.” He added that identifying and analyzing all of the social media was another challenge of prosecuting. Kaplan said the prosecution went to \\"extraordinary efforts\\" to protect the identity of the man Clementi was kissing when Ravi saw them, who testified during the trial. Named only as “M.B.” in court proceedings and documents, his identity was protected because he was considered a sex crime victim in the case. “Tyler Clementi and M.B. were the victims of invasion of privacy,” said Kaplan. “Regardless of public opinion we were obligated to follow the law, we were obligated to follow the facts.” Attorneys for Ravi had no immediate comment, but one of them later told The Star-Ledger he plans to file an appeal. \\"We have a large number of issues surrounding evidence and law, as we dictated during the course of the trial,\\" defense attorney Steve Altman said. \\"Some of that evidence was determined by the judge to be irrelevant, that we think is very relevant.\\" After the judge set a sentencing date, Ravi and his family were ushered out the front of the courtroom. As Ravi stepped out of the courtroom to the flashing cameras, his mother placed her arm around the small of his back. The family and their lawyers headed to the elevators and were surrounded by a crush of media as they waited to board the elevators, while some reporters and camera crews ran downstairs to try to catch them on the way out. Before the case went to trial, Ravi rejected a plea deal that would have allowed him to avoid jail. Under the terms, he would have gotten probation and be required to perform 600 hours of community service and receive counseling. JURY NOT IN CONFLICT Ferreira said the jurors were not in conflict with each other during deliberations. \\"I'm actually satisfied with the verdict. It was very hard, very difficult. Nothing means we would be personally biased toward the defendant. You have to look at all the facts and the evidence. That's why you have 24 counts guilty and 11 not guilty. Witness statements and the evidence were not there to prove those,\\" he said. \\"This was very difficult, but it was a really good experience. You feel like justice has been served. Prosecutors presented more than 20 witnesses over 12 days of testimony, including students who lived in Ravi and Clementi's dormitory, Davidson Hall, law enforcement officials, Rutgers residence life staff and computer experts. Clementi, a shy violinist from Ridgewood, and Ravi, a tech-savvy computer geek from Plainsboro, were seemingly ill-matched from the start. The two roommates were worried about living together from nearly the moment they learned each other's names, according to documents filed in court. When Clementi asked to use their room on Sept. 19, 2010, Ravi went to the room of a friend, Molly Wei, and turned on his webcam from her laptop. Witnesses for the state testified that Ravi built an ”automatic accept” feature on his webcam to access it from elsewhere. Wei and Ravi saw Clementi and M.B. kissing for a few seconds, and Ravi tweeted to his followers that he saw his \\"roommate making out with a dude.\\" Two days later, when Clementi asked for the room again, Ravi set up the webcam and double-checked that it was angled at Clementi's bed, according to two students who testified. He also dared his Twitter followers to chat him during the hours Clementi had asked for their room. One witness testified that Ravi was \\"uncomfortable\\" having a gay roommate. Another read a text message in which Ravi explained his computer would \\"keep the gays away.\\" But on cross-examination, about a half dozen friends and dorm neighbors of Ravi's told Steve Altman, his lawyer, that Ravi never said anything malicious or derogatory about his gay roommate or about gay people in general. After the prosecution rested last Thursday, the defense called seven witnesses in quick succession, all friends and co-workers of Ravi's father who said they had never heard him say anything negative about gay people, though they had never actually discussed the topic with him. Throughout the trial, Altman maintained that Ravi only looked at the webcam to see what was going on in his room because he was put off by M.B.'s scruffy appearance. Ravi told police in a statement that M.B. didn't acknowledge him, appeared much older than a college student, and he got a \\"bad vibe\\" from him. On the evidence charges, prosecutors said Ravi deleted dozens of relevant text messages and tweets, and tried to influence what Wei told police. Clementi, who leaped to his death from the George Washington Bridge, came after a series of suicides of other young teenagers around the country who were bullied because they were gay or perceived to be gay. The trial lasted nearly four weeks. Star-Ledger staff writers Jessica Calefati, Sue Epstein, Peggy McGlone and Ted Sherman contributed to this report.

Mr. Ravi, 20, wearing a dark suit over his slight frame, sat expressionless as the jury forewoman read the verdict on the first count, of invasion of privacy. But he seemed surprised when she pronounced him guilty on the next charge, of bias intimidation. His eyes popped and he quickly turned his head from the jury. As he left the courtroom in a swarm of television cameras, his mother clutching his arm, he looked straight ahead and said nothing. The jury also found him guilty of lying to investigators, trying to influence a witness and tampering with evidence after he tried to cover up Twitter and text messages inviting others to join in the viewing. Some of the charges carry penalties of 5 to 10 years in prison. Mr. Ravi has surrendered his passport; prosecutors said he could face possible deportation to his native India , but that decision would be left to immigration officials. Judge Glenn Berman set sentencing for May 21. The case was a rare one in which almost none of the facts were in dispute. Mr. Ravi’s lawyers agreed that he had set up a webcam on his computer, and had then gone into a friend’s room and viewed Mr. Clementi kissing a man he met a few weeks earlier on a Web site for gay men. He sent Twitter and text messages urging others to watch when Mr. Clementi invited the man again two nights later, then deleted messages after Mr. Clementi killed himself. That account had been established by a long trail of electronic evidence — from Twitter feeds and cellphone records, dormitory surveillance cameras, dining hall swipe cards and a “net flow” analysis showing when and how computers in the dormitory connected. What the jury had to decide, and what set off debate outside as well as inside the courtroom, was what Mr. Ravi and Mr. Clementi were thinking. Photo Had Mr. Ravi set up the webcam because he had a pretty good idea that he would see Mr. Clementi in an intimate moment? Had he targeted Mr. Clementi and the man he was with because they were gay? And had Mr. Clementi been in fear? Advertisement Continue reading the main story Without Mr. Clementi to speak for himself, that last question was perhaps the most difficult to determine, and jurors struggled with it. “That was the hardest because you really can’t get into someone’s head,” said one, Bruno Ferreira, as he left the court. The jury deliberated longest — for well more than an hour, he said — on the bias intimidation charge. Mr. Ferreira said he ultimately voted guilty on the bias intimidation charge because Mr. Ravi had sent multiple Twitter messages about Mr. Clementi. “They were being done twice, not just one day,” he said. Another juror, Kashad Leverett, himself a student and a Twitter user, said he could relate to Mr. Ravi’s constant stream of Twitter and text messages. But the defense’s insistence that Mr. Ravi had set up the webcam because he was afraid Mr. Clementi’s visitor would steal something, he said, rang hollow. “If I knew someone was going to steal something from me, I would definitely take it with me,” Mr. Leverett said, adding, “Just from the fact of the second incident, it seemed that it was intentional.” Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

Reflecting the difficulty of defining hate crimes, it had taken the judge more than an hour simply to instruct the jury on the questions they had to answer to reach a verdict. The jury concluded that Mr. Ravi had not knowingly or purposely intimidated the men when he watched the first time, on Sept. 19, 2010. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But it found him guilty of the charge because Mr. Clementi “reasonably believed” he had been made a target because he was gay. Photo The prosecution had pointed out that Mr. Clementi had checked Mr. Ravi’s Twitter feed — where Mr. Ravi told others he had seen his roommate “kissing a dude” — 38 times in the days after the first webcam viewing. Records showed that Mr. Clementi had gone online to request a room change, and a resident assistant testified that Mr. Clementi had complained to him. Mr. Clementi’s parents, Joe and Jane, attended the trial each day, sitting in the front row and showing little emotion. After the verdict, Joe Clementi, the director of public works in the northern New Jersey town of Hawthorne, read a brief statement, saying the trial had been “painful for us, as it would be for any parent who must sit and listen to people talk about bad and inappropriate things that were done to their child.” Mostly, he said, he wanted to deliver a message to middle- and high-school students. “You’re going to meet a lot of people in your lifetime,” he said. “Some of these people you may not like. Just because you don’t like them doesn’t mean you have to work against them. When you see somebody doing something wrong, tell them: ‘That’s not right. Stop it.’ The change you want to see in the world begins with you.” Mr. Clementi’s suicide came up only in passing during the trial. Still, the death defined the trial, turning what might have been a peeping Tom case or, as the resident assistant said, “a roommate issue” into something far more grave. The testimony painted a picture of two college freshmen, both from top-performing high schools in well-off suburbs, who could not have been more different. Mr. Clementi was shy and awkward, an accomplished violinist who had only recently told his parents he was gay. Mr. Ravi was popular but boastful, a computer wizard and ultimate Frisbee player who communicated with friends constantly via Twitter, text message and iChat. Mr. Ravi’s parents, who brought him here from India when he was young, sat vigil behind him each day, with a large group of friends, including several who had served as character witnesses for Mr. Ravi, testifying he was not biased against gay people. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Ravi had rejected plea deals, because prosecutors would have required him to admit to bias intimidation. His lawyers said he simply did not believe he had committed a hate crime. They argued that he was “a kid” with little experience of homosexuality who had stumbled into a situation that scared him. His lead lawyer, Steven Altman, made only a brief statement via e-mail following the verdict, saying “rest assured” he would appeal. Gay rights advocates, who had used the example of Mr. Clementi’s suicide to push New Jersey to pass what is considered the nation’s toughest antibullying law, hailed the jury’s decision. “This verdict sends the important message that a ‘kids will be kids’ defense is no excuse to bully another student,” said Steven Goldstein, the chairman of Garden State Equality. Mr. Kaplan, the county prosecutor, rejected suggestions that Mr. Ravi would not have been on trial if Mr. Clementi had not killed himself. Even if he had not, he said, “under these facts, under this evidence, we would prosecute this case.” ||||| Summary:","completion":"Dharun Ravi, a former Rutgers University student, was found guilty of a hate crime, evidence tampering, and invasion of privacy for secretly using a webcam to spy on his roommate Tyler Clementi's intimate encounter with another man in their dorm room. This high-profile case raised awareness about cyber-bullying and harassment of LGBTQ+ teenagers. Ravi was convicted on parts of all 15 counts against him, including four bias intimidation counts, but the jury had difficulty with some bias counts, resulting in a split verdict on specific acts. Ravi was found not guilty on all bias counts pertaining to the man Clementi was seen with during the webcam spying. Clementi committed suicide a few days after learning Ravi had watched him through the webcam. However, Ravi was never charged in connection with Clementi's death. Sentencing has been tentatively set for May 21, and Ravi faces possible deportation to his native India. The case brought the issues of cyber-bullying and hate crimes targeting LGBTQ+ individuals to the forefront and contributed to the push for stronger anti-bullying laws in response to several high-profile suicides of LGBTQ+ teenagers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: If I tell you that Electricity flows when the wire touches the battery, and ask you the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\", is the correct answer \\"chemical reaction\\"? -- Yes -- No The answer is:","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"chemical reaction.\\" When the wire touches the battery, the correct answer is that \\"Electricity flows.\\" However, it is important to note that a chemical reaction does take place within the battery, which is responsible for creating the flow of electricity. The battery contains a positive and a negative end, known as terminals. Inside the battery, there is an electrolyte solution and two electrodes (cathode and anode) that allow chemical reactions to occur when a conductive wire connects the battery's positive and negative terminals. Upon connecting the wire to the battery, an electrical circuit is formed, allowing electrons to flow. This flow of electrons is what we refer to as electricity. It facilitates the transfer of energy and is the driving force behind powering electrical devices. The chemical reaction inside the battery causes the anode to lose electrons (oxidation) while the cathode gains electrons (reduction). This difference in charge is what enables electrical current to flow through the conductive wire and complete the circuit. Hence, when the wire touches the battery, the flow of electricity occurs due to the chemical reactions inside the battery. So, while the chemical reaction inside the battery is an essential factor contributing to this process, the correct answer to the question \\"what happens when the wire touches the battery?\\" is still \\"Electricity flows.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The company has reached agreement on the terms for buying the paper division of the Dutch office supplies group Buhrmann , the largest paper distributor in Europe . Are these sentences conveying the same meaning?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same meaning. Both sentences essentially communicate that \\"the company\\" has successfully negotiated and agreed upon the terms for acquiring the paper division of Buhrmann, a Dutch office supplies group that holds the distinction of being the largest paper distributor in Europe. To break down the similarities in the two sentences more closely: 1. In both sentences, \\"the company\\" is mentioned as the subject that is carrying out the action. It is clearly established that \\"the company\\" will be acquiring the paper division. 2. Both sentences emphasize the Dutch office supplies group as \\"Buhrmann.\\" This ensures that the audience knows exactly which organization is being referred to. 3. The attribute of Buhrmann being the \\"largest paper distributor in Europe\\" is specified in both sentences. This highlights the significance of the acquisition and its potential impact on the paper distribution market. 4. The crucial action highlighted in both sentences is that \\"the company\\" has reached an \\"agreement on the terms\\" for the purchase of the paper division. This phrasing implies that the negotiations have been completed and the parties have mutually agreed upon the terms of the acquisition. The difference in word order and sentence structure between the two sentences does not change the overall meaning, but rather serves as a stylistic variation. Regardless of the differences in phrasing, the key points - the company acquiring the paper division, the identity of the Dutch office supplies group, and the agreed-upon terms - remain consistent across both sentences.

Question: Why do insects want to be pollinators? Context: Pollination is the process by which pollen is transferred in the reproduction of plants, thereby enabling fertilisation and sexual reproduction. Most flowering plants require an animal to do the transportation. While other animals are included as pollinators, the majority of pollination is done by insects. Because insects usually receive benefit for the pollination in the form of energy rich nectar it is a grand example of mutualism. The various flower traits (and combinations thereof) that differentially attract one type of pollinator or another are known as pollination syndromes. These arose through complex plant-animal adaptations. Pollinators find flowers through bright colorations, including ultraviolet, and attractant pheromones. The study of pollination by insects is known as anthecology. The answer is:","completion":"Insects want to be pollinators because they usually receive benefits for the pollination in the form of energy-rich nectar. This is a grand example of mutualism, where both the plant and the insect benefit from the interaction.

As obligations in international law are traditionally viewed as arising only from the consent of states, many treaties expressly allow a state to withdraw as long as it follows certain procedures of notification. For example, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs provides that the treaty will terminate if, as a result of denunciations, the number of parties falls below 40. Many treaties expressly forbid withdrawal. Article 56 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties provides that where a treaty is silent over whether or not it can be denounced there is a rebuttable presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced unless:\\" Answer: A:","completion":"Some treaties, when they don't allow a state to withdraw, establish certain conditions and restrictions with the aim of maintaining stability and predictability in the international legal order. In the context you provided from the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, when a treaty is silent about the possibility of withdrawal, there is a general presumption that it cannot be unilaterally denounced. However, this presumption can be rebutted under certain conditions: 1. It can be proven that the parties intended to allow for withdrawal. 2. The nature of the treaty implies the right to withdraw. These conditions ensure that, in the absence of an explicit provision, the parties have a shared understanding of their rights and obligations under the treaty, and that the possibility of withdrawal is consistent with the essence and purpose of that treaty. There are several reasons why some treaties may expressly forbid withdrawal: 1. To safeguard the long-term objectives of the treaty: Restricting the ability to withdraw from a treaty ensures that signatory states remain committed to the core objectives of the treaty, which may be important for the overall success and effectiveness of the agreement. 2. To maintain stability and certainty: By preventing states from easily withdrawing from a treaty, the agreement becomes more predictable and stable. This fosters trust and cooperation among the parties and allows them to make long-term plans based on the treaty. 3. To protect weaker states: In some cases, particularly in treaties concerning human rights or disarmament, an outright ban on withdrawal aims to protect the rights of weaker states against powerful states that could potentially exploit the possibility of withdrawal to avoid fulfilling their treaty obligations. When a treaty does allow for withdrawal, it usually prescribes specific procedures for notification, which can include waiting periods, opportunities for negotiation, and consultation among other signatory states. These procedural requirements help to ensure that withdrawal is a carefully considered decision and not a rash, impulsive action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Carla, a lonely woman burdened by lack of respect from her co-workers and her only friend, Annie, begins to change after a younger man enters her life. Carla is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting in her hearing aids. She is an overworked and under-appreciated secretary for a construction company, ridiculed behind her back by her co-workers who do not know she is deaf but despise her homely appearance and subservient position. After she faints from exhaustion she accepts the boss's offer to hire an intern to lighten her load. The first applicant to be her assistant, Paul, is an ex-convict who is not technically qualified to be Carla's assistant, but she hires him.

Write a title: NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. stocks showed small gains at the open on Monday as easing oil prices alleviated investors' worry about the effect of higher fuel costs on corporations and consumers.","completion":"Title: \\"U.S. Stocks Experience Moderate Gains Amidst Subsiding Oil Prices: A Positive Outlook for Corporations and Consumers Alike\\" Introduction: The stock market has consistently been a cornerstone of economic news, flitting between rapid recoveries and volatile plummets to reflect the global state of affairs. Recently, however, investors and analysts have begun to observe a more positive trend in U.S. stocks as oil prices begin to gradually decline. This phenomenon has prompted an enhancement in the overall financial landscape, sparking optimism among corporations and individual consumers. Body: 1. The Shifting Landscape of U.S. Stocks: With the opening of the stock market on Monday, financial experts were quick to notice that U.S. stocks displayed small but promising gains. These minor achievements followed a tumultuous period defined by erratic fluctuations in the market, causing investors to anxiously monitor the constantly shifting landscape. By taking a closer look at the underlying factors driving these changes, it becomes clear that it is the decrease in oil prices that have allowed for a more encouraging financial outlook. 2. Easing Oil Prices and Their Impact on the Market: A prominent influence on the movement of U.S. stocks has been the recent decline in oil prices. Fuel costs have long been a versatile factor capable of swaying the developments in various markets, especially when it comes to corporate expenses and consumer spending habits. As oil prices dip, corporations have greater opportunities to invest in other sectors and expand their growth potential, leading to enhanced stock performances. 3. Corporate Impacts: Lower oil prices work to alleviate many of the concerns that tend to plague corporations. The resulting reduction in operating expenses frees up additional resources that can ultimately be channeled towards growth, rather than being consumed by the steep costs of fuel. This newfound financial flexibility not only bolsters a corporation's internal operations but also reflects in its stock market performance, often translating to higher returns for investors. 4. Consumer Benefits: As fuel costs continue to decrease, the positive effects will not only be felt by businesses, but by consumers as well. Reduced prices at the pump lead to greater disposable income, empowering consumers to make more purchases and contribute to economic growth. The surge in consumer spending will, in turn, benefit corporations, causing stock market performance to strengthen even more. 5. The Positive Feedback Loop: In essence, the decline in oil prices has initiated a positive feedback loop in the U.S. stock market. Lower fuel costs have brightened the outlook for corporations, leading to stronger stock market results, which then further uplift consumer spending. This perpetuating cycle embodies a promising trend for both business entities and individual consumers, with stock market rebounds signaling long-lasting stability in the market. Conclusion: The small but notable gains witnessed in the U.S. stock market – driven by the easing of oil prices – showcase a more optimistic financial landscape for all involved. As corporations benefit from reduced operating expenses and consumers enjoy increased disposable income, the stock market will continue to experience a resounding rebound that perpetuates long-term growth and stability. While unforeseen changes are always a possibility, one thing is clear: a relieving trend has emerged in the stock market, breathing new life into the economy and fostering a sense of optimism for corporations and consumers alike."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: O my god this is a great book!

That to -do list that keeps multiplying. It is no wonder many of us find it difficult to have a sufficient amount of sleep. But will sleeping more on the weekend make up for hours of lost snoozing ? One sleep expert, W. Christopher Winter raised the question. Sleeping binge Getting eight hours of shut-eye each night is generally recommended, but many people don't. As the week rolls from Monday to Friday, they accumulate a sleep debt. Spending a few extra hours in bed on a Saturday morning, people assume, will help them \\" catch up\\" on lost sleep. They're likely right, \\" Nobody knows how long the horizon is, probably a few nights, but studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work,\\" says Dr. Winter, a member of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine. Sleep banking Recent data suggests that banking sleep in advance of a long night can actually offset upcoming sleep deprivation . If you knew you were going to have to stay up all night on a particular day, for example, you could sleep for 10 hours a day for multiple days before the event, and be fine, Dr. Winter says. Just plan ahead. Routine naps A scheduled nap is healthier than catching up on or banking sleep. \\" Because sleep extension can make you feel groggy , I always recommend a short nap [if a person feels they need it ], at the same time, every day,\\" says Dr. Winter. He adds that 25 minutes is ideal. \\" When you schedule a short nap, your body anticipates it and slows down, without falling into a deep dream sleep,\\" he says. That refreshing, scheduled break is better than an occasional weekend lie-in. \\" The body likes routine,\\" he says, \\" When it's prepared, it works more efficiently.\\" Question: From Monday to Friday, many people _ . Answer: +accumulate a sleep debt; +have no time to sleep; +work hard to achieve their goals; +have to stay up all nights; The answer is:","completion":"From Monday to Friday, many people accumulate a sleep debt. This is due to various factors such as ceaseless technology, a punishing workweek, and a constantly growing to-do list. Many individuals find it challenging to get the recommended eight hours of sleep each night during the weekdays. As a result, they accumulate sleep debt and try to catch up on their sleep over the weekend, hoping that the extra hours on Saturday or Sunday morning will make up for the hours of lost sleep throughout the week. Although studies show that recovery sleep in the short term does work, sleep experts like Dr. W.

Paragraph: Bin Laden reportedly discussed the planes operation with KSM and Atef in a series of meetings in the spring of 1999 at the al Matar complex near Kandahar. KSM's original concept of using one of the hijacked planes to make a media statement was scrapped, but Bin Laden considered the basic idea feasible. Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM developed an initial list of targets. These included the White House, the U.S. Capitol, the Pentagon, and the World Trade Center. According to KSM, Bin Laden wanted to destroy the White House and the Pentagon, KSM wanted to strike the World Trade Center, and all of them wanted to hit the Capitol. No one else was involved in the initial selection of targets. Bin Laden also soon selected four individuals to serve as suicide operatives: Khalid al Mihdhar, Nawaf al Hazmi, Khallad, and Abu Bara al Yemeni. During the al Matar meetings, Bin Laden told KSM that Mihdhar and Hazmi were so eager to participate in an operation against the United States that they had already obtained U.S. visas. KSM states that they had done so on their own after the suicide of their friend Azzam (Nashiri's cousin) in carrying out the Nairobi bombing. KSM had not met them. His only guidance from Bin Laden was that the two should eventually go to the United States for pilot training. Hazmi and Mihdhar were Saudi nationals, born in Mecca. Like the others in this initial group of selectees, they were already experienced mujahideen. They had traveled together to fight in Bosnia in a group that journeyed to the Balkans in 1995. By the time Hazmi and Mihdhar were assigned to the planes operation in early 1999, they had visited Afghanistan on several occasions. Khallad was another veteran mujahid, like much of his family. His father had been expelled from Yemen because of his extremist views. Khallad had grown up in Saudi Arabia, where his father knew Bin Laden, Abdullah Azzam, and Omar Abdel Rahman (the \\"Blind Sheikh\\").

However, if the purpose of this exercise is to practice the task of removing spaces in a string, one can achieve this using various programming languages and built-in string manipulation functions. For example, in Python, you can use the \`replace()\` method to remove spaces in a string: \`\`\`python text = \\"Major news and very important changes in the project are announced here.\\" no_spaces = text.replace(\\" \\", \\"\\") print(no_spaces) \`\`\` This code would output: \\"Majornewsandveryimportantchangesintheprojectareannouncedhere.\\" In JavaScript, you can achieve the same result using the \`split()\` and \`join()\` methods: \`\`\`javascript const text = \\"Major news and very important changes in the project are announced here.\\"; const noSpaces = text.split(\\" \\").join(\\"\\"); console.log(noSpaces); \`\`\` This code would log: \\"Majornewsandveryimportantchangesintheprojectareannouncedhere.\\" Keep in mind that removing spaces without any context or proper format could lead to confusion and difficulty interpreting the intended message, so it's always crucial to consider the purpose before applying such modifications to written text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It is important for the narrator to honor their daughter's wishes and make her feel loved and appreciated on her special day. The daughter specifically requested an angel food cake, which indicates that this type of cake holds some significance or preference for her. Therefore, the narrator wants to ensure they fulfill this request, demonstrating their care and attention to her desires. Furthermore, baking a cake from scratch, especially an angel food cake, tends to be more time-consuming and labor-intensive than using a store-bought cake or mix. This type of cake typically involves beating egg whites, sifting flour multiple times, and carefully folding ingredients together to create a light and fluffy texture. By committing the time and effort to make this cake, the narrator is emphasizing the importance of their daughter's birthday and showing their dedication to making it an enjoyable celebration. Additionally, baking a cake at home often carries emotional value, as it can strengthen the bond between family members and create long-lasting memories. Preparing a homemade cake can serve as a symbol of love and devotion, and the time the narrator spends in the kitchen shows their commitment to ensuring their daughter has a memorable and heartwarming birthday experience. However, the narrator encountered an issue with their oven not preheating as expected, causing further delay in the cake-making process. This complication may lead to additional time spent in the kitchen troubleshooting the issue and finding a solution in order not to disappoint their daughter.

Summarize the following: Real estate agents are licensed by the state. Most states maintain a website and include forms on the web to lodge a complaint. Perform an Internet search to locate your area's real estate licensing board. For example, if you live in California, use keywords such as \\"California real estate licensing\\" to locate the website for the Department of Real Estate in California. Most states require that you download a PDF and fill it out before mailing it back. Provide all information requested. Incomplete forms may not be processed or could detract from your credibility. For increased legibility type the form or print with black ink. Forms vary by state, but they typically require filling out your personal information (name and address) as well as the name, address, and business name of the agent. Forms also may ask whether a legal action has been started. If so, they will ask for the name of your attorney as well as the attorney’s contact information (address and phone number). You must sign the form under penalty of perjury. If you do not feel comfortable doing this, you may want to schedule a meeting with the agent’s supervisor instead of lodging a formal complaint. After selecting the category of complaint, you must inform the state agency of the factual grounds for the dispute. Some forms will provide a space for this information, but feel free to type this out on a separate piece of paper and attach it to your complaint. Answer the questions “who, what, where, when, and how.” That is, describe who did what, where it happened, when it happened, and how it happened. Note any promises that were made and the actual language used. Include the names of witnesses as well as their contact information. Describe events in chronological order for increased clarity. You don’t want to confuse the state board. Provide a complete copy of receipts, cancelled checks, contracts, closing documents, title documents, and correspondence. Send only copies of supporting documentation, never the originals, and make sure that they are legible. The address should be on the form. Be sure to keep a copy of the entire complaint, including any attachments. You can refer to this copy to refresh your memory should someone contact you later about your dispute.

What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation for r, we will follow these steps: 1. Combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation 2. Divide both sides by the coefficient of r (692 in this case) So let's perform these steps: Step 1: We have three constant terms on the right side: 222, 125, and 12801. 222 + 125 + 12801 = 347 + 12801 = 13148 Now our equation looks like this: 692*r = 13148 Step 2: Now we need to divide both sides by 692: (692*r) / 692 = 13148 / 692 Since 692 / 692 is 1, this simplifies to: r = 13148 / 692 Now we'll perform the division: r = 19 So, r = 19 is the solution to the given equation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During a workshop, black tulle and neoprene have been formed into contemporary answers to that question. The idea of reviving the black bridal dress is fascinating as it breaks the conventional norms of wearing white or ivory wedding dresses. Historically, people associated white wedding dresses with purity and innocence. However, the modern bride is continuously looking for ways to express her individuality and stand out during her wedding. Incorporating black into a wedding dress, or even opting for a completely black bridal gown, can signify a combination of elegance, boldness, and a personal statement that represents the bride. The use of black tulle and neoprene in a wedding dress workshop is an excellent example of contemporary fashion meeting tradition. Black tulle, a lightweight and versatile material made of silk or nylon, can be used to create delicate layers or adornments to the gown. This material is both sultry and sophisticated, adding a unique and luxurious touch to the bridal attire. Neoprene, on the other hand, is a synthetic rubber material known for its durability and flexibility. It is mostly used in modern fashion for its fascinating contrasts, as it gives structure to garments while offering comfort and ease of movement. When used in a bridal gown, neoprene can provide a contemporary and avant-garde touch, breaking the mold of the traditional wedding dress. By bringing black tulle and neoprene together during a workshop, designers can explore various ways to create stunning, innovative, and captivating wedding dresses that transform the idea of the black bridal gown.

These allies played a significant role in supporting the French military efforts during the French and Indian War (1754-1763), which was part of the larger global conflict known as the Seven Years' War. At Fort Oswego, a key British outpost on the southern shore of Lake Ontario, French forces led by General Montcalm, alongside Native American allies, attacked and captured the fort in August 1756. The successful siege led to the capture of significant military supplies and weakened the British position in the region. Fort William Henry, located on the southern shore of Lake George in what is now upstate New York, was also targeted by French forces. In August 1757, Montcalm, along with a sizable force of French soldiers and Native American allies, laid siege to the British-held fort. The British, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel George Monro, surrendered after a week of bombardment. The French granted the British troops and their families safe passage to nearby Fort Edward. The French and Indian War saw a series of alliances between European powers and Native American tribes. The French were successful in winning the support of various tribes due to their established fur trading networks and their policy of not encroaching on tribal lands, as the British often did. These alliances ultimately influenced the outcome of many battles and campaigns during the war, including the taking of forts Oswego and William Henry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Do people ever consider the possibility that, if they're exposed to increased reports about a social problem, it's the reporting that has increased rather than the problem? It's increasingly clear that this is the case with school bullying :Only news reports about it have increased, not the behavior itself. In fact, both bullying and fear of it are down among US middle school students The rate of students who reported fearing an attack or harm at school at all has dropped dramatically, from nearly 12% in 1995 to less than 4% in 2011. For black and Hispanic students, it's an even more encouraging shift--from more than 20% of both groups of students worried about being attacked at school to less than 5% in 2011. The decline in actual physical violence in schools is even more dramatic: It was down 74% between 1992 and 2010, according to the latest US Department of Justice data. What about cyberbullying? Online _ increased from 6% in 2000 to 9% in 2005 to 11% in 2010 between, and it's interesting to note that it increased less between 2005 and '10 than in the first 5 years tracked. Because social media is very much a reflection of school social life for young people, the peer aggression seen in social media is a lot like the peer aggression seen on school bathroom walls. So once it finds its \\"dead level,\\" it will probably decline in the same way verbal and written aggression have. Besides education and crime prevention at the social level, medicine treatment and better access to mental healthcare also contribute to this downward trend in victimization of self and others.

He detonates the TNT, and an unprecedented earthquake devastates the area. A few hours later government seismologist Dr. Amy Lane arrives at the quake's epicenter. She realizes that the quake has opened a deep fault running through the center of North America, ending at the San Andreas Fault. Any further instability will cause massive earthquakes and tsunamis, devastating Los Angeles, San Francisco and other cities all around the Pacific Ocean, leading to the deaths of millions. Dr. Lane and Boomer chase just behind the expanding crack in the Earth's crust, developing a plan to stop the next quake. They decide to use a satellite orbiting above the continent which can trigger earthquakes. They fire it off when they reach the Grand Canyon, thinking that when the new fault hits the canyon it will be forced to turn south into the Gulf of Mexico. When the fault crosses with the canyon, the plan goes wrong. Instead of heading south it travels north, towards the Yellowstone Caldera. They realize that if the fault crosses with the caldera it would erupt, expelling 2,000,000 tons of ash into the atmosphere, killing millions immediately and causing a Volcanic winter. They decide to set explosives to block the fault's path. Later, when it reaches the park, Boomer detonates the explosives causing the fault to stop just short of reaching the volcano, but costing Boomer's life. In the end, an orbiting shot of the United States shows a giant, miles-wide canyon across most of the continent. My question: What is Charles Baxter's nickname?

It is the second time in just four years that such devastation – not previously seen in more than 50 years of observation – has been wrought on the population. The finding has prompted urgent calls for the establishment of a marine protected area in East Antarctica, at next week’s meeting of 24 nations and the European Union at the Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR) in Hobart. Penguins starving to death is a sign that something’s very wrong in the Antarctic | John Sauven Read more In the colony of about 18,000 breeding penguin pairs on Petrels Island, French scientists discovered just two surviving chicks at the start of the year. Thousands of starved chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the island in the region called Adélie Land (“Terre Adélie”). The colony had experienced a similar event in 2013, when no chicks survived. In a paper about that event, a group of researchers, led by Yan Ropert-Coudert from France’s National Centre for Scientific Research, said it had been caused by a record amount of summer sea ice and an “unprecedented rainy episode”. The unusual extent of sea ice meant the penguins had to travel an extra 100km to forage for food. And the rainy weather left the chicks, which have poor waterproofing, wet and unable to keep warm. This year’s event has also been attributed to an unusually large amount of sea ice. Overall, Antarctica has had a record low amount of summer sea ice, but the area around the colony has been an exception. Ropert-Coudert said the region had been severely affected by the break-up of the Mertz glacier tongue in 2010, when a piece of ice almost the size of Luxembourg – about 80 km long and 40km wide – broke off. That event, which occurred about 250km from Petrels Island, had a big impact on ocean currents and ice formation in the region. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Thousands of dead chicks and unhatched eggs were found across the region called Adélie Land. Photograph: Y Ropert-Coudert/CNRS/IPEV “The Mertz glacier impact on the region sets the scene in 2010 and when unusual meteorological events, driven by large climatic variations, hit in some years this leads to massive failures,” Ropert-Coudert told the Guardian. “In other words, there may still be years when the breeding will be OK, or even good for this colony, but the scene is set for massive impacts to hit on a more or less regular basis.” The link between climate change and the sea-ice extent around Antarctica is not very clear. Sea ice has been increasing in recent years, which could be attributed to a rise in the amount of freshwater in the ocean around the continent caused by climate change. However, over the long term, climate change is expected to cause the sea ice to shrink dramatically. “For the moment, sea ice is increasing and this is a problem for this species as it pushes the feeding place – the sea ice edge – farther away from their nesting place,” Ropert-Coudert said. “If it shrinks it would help but if it shrinks too much then the food chain they rely on may be impacted. Basically, as a creature of the sea ice they need an optimum sea-ice cover to thrive.” Elsewhere, human pressures including climate change have already been having a severe impact on the numbers of Adélie penguins. On the Antarctic Peninsula, which has been badly affected by climate change, populations have been decreasing, and some researchers suggest they may become extinct there. Ropert-Coudert said there were more anthropogenic threats on the horizon – fishing and possibly tourism – that the penguins needed protection from. He has called for a marine protected area (MPA) to be established there. Freedom for Miss Simpson, the penguin found 2,000km from home Read more “An MPA will not remedy these changes but it could prevent further impacts that direct anthropogenic pressures, such as tourism and proposed fisheries, could bring,” he said. Next week, 24 countries and the European Union will meet at the CCAMLR in Hobart to discuss the potential creation of more MPAs around Antarctica. At last year’s meeting, after years of failed negotiations, the members agreed to create the world’s largest MPA in the Ross Sea, and many expect the group to agree on East Antarctica next. This has also been proposed by Australia and has been on the table at the CCAMLR for eight years. The head of polar programs at WWF, Rod Downie, said: “Adélie penguins are one of the hardiest and most amazing animals on our planet. This devastating event contrasts with the image that many people might have of penguins. It’s more like ‘Tarantino does Happy Feet’, with dead penguin chicks strewn across a beach in Adélie Land. “The risk of opening up this area to exploratory krill fisheries, which would compete with the Adélie penguins for food as they recover from two catastrophic breeding failures in four years, is unthinkable. So CCAMLR needs to act now by adopting a new Marine Protected Area for the waters off East Antarctica, to protect the home of the penguins.” Ropert-Coudert and his colleagues are in the process of completing a scientific paper on the breeding failure and plan to submit it to a journal in the coming weeks. ||||| (CNN) A penguin colony in Antarctica has suffered a massive breeding failure, with only two chicks surviving the disaster.

The only one who questions the family's sheltered life is his teenaged daughter Eep, who frequently disobeys her father's orders out of curiosity, which he finds dangerous. Grug and Eep, along with her mother and his wife Ugga, her grandmother Gran, and her younger brother and sister, Thunk and Sandy, face time sheltered in their cave home. Eep sneaks out when she sees what she discovers to be a torch of fire, and she encounters an inventive modern human boy named Guy and his pet sloth Belt. He warns her of an impending apocalypse and offers to take her with him, but concerned for her family, Eep stays, getting a shell horn from him to blow in case she needs his help. Reuniting with her frantic family, she tries to tell them what Guy told her, but fearing things that are \\"different\\" and \\"new\\", they destroy her horn. A massive earthquake then destroys their home, and to avoid carnivores and omnivores, they descend down into a tropical forest that lay hidden behind their cave all the time.

True as a Turtle is a 1957 British comedy film directed by Wendy Toye and starring John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn and Keith Michell. In the film, a young couple embark on a voyage on a ketch named \\"Turtle\\". John Coates wrote the screenplay, based on his novel of the same name. Can we infer the following? The voyage was made on a sailboat.","completion":"Yes, we can infer that the voyage in the movie \\"True as a Turtle\\" (1957) was made on a sailboat, specifically aboard a ketch named \\"Turtle\\". A ketch is a type of sailboat that is characterized by its two-masted design. In a ketch, the aft (rear) mast, also called the mizzen mast, is shorter than the mainmast, which is the vertical spar that supports the main sails. This design allows for better maneuverability and simpler sail handling, as well as increased sail area, making it a popular choice for cruising sailboats. The film, directed by Wendy Toye, stars John Gregson, Cecil Parker, June Thorburn, and Keith Michell, and it narrates the story of a young couple who set off together on a voyage aboard the ketch \\"Turtle\\". The script for the movie was written by John Coates, based on his own novel of the same name, which likely provided additional details about the sailboat adventure and the challenges faced by the characters on their journey. Given this information, the central theme of the movie revolves around the couple's adventures and experiences on a sailboat and the water, which also serves as the primary setting for the unfolding narrative. This, combined with the description of the ketch as the mode of transportation, allows us to confirm that the voyage was indeed made on a sailboat. In conclusion, based on the provided information about the 1957 British comedy film \\"True as a Turtle,\\" we can infer that the voyage embarked upon by the young couple in the film occurs on a sailboat, specifically aboard the ketch named \\"Turtle\\". The movie's plot and setting, as well as the character interactions and development, help to further accentuate the role that the sailboat voyage plays in the overall story, providing a unique setting and mode of transportation for the characters' journey."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q with options: Give answer the following question using evidence from the above passage: What movie would the OP NOT be a fan of ? OPTIONS: 1. Waiting 2. Terminator 3. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas 4. Mr. Deed","completion":"Based on the passage provided, the OP expresses some discomfort or uneasiness with the idea that we are becoming more like machines - efficient, effective, productive, but soulless. They mention that this prospect haunts them. Given this context, we can analyze each movie option to determine which one the OP would likely NOT be a fan of: 1. Waiting: A comedy film about restaurant employees who pass their time by playing pranks and goofing off at work. This movie doesn't strongly emphasize on people turning into machines or losing their souls. The theme is more focused on antics within a workplace setting. 2. Terminator: A science-fiction film where a cyborg assassin, the Terminator, is sent back in time to kill the mother of the eventual leader of the human resistance in a post-apocalyptic future. This movie heavily revolves around the conflict between human beings and advanced machines, with machines being soulless and emotionless, intent on exterminating humanity. Given the OP's concern about becoming more like machines, it's quite likely that they would not be a fan of this movie. 3. Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas: A movie adaptation of the novel, which follows the adventures of a journalist and his attorney as they descend into chaos, drugs, and debauchery during a trip to Las Vegas. The film primarily deals with the theme of excess and hedonism, rather than the transformation of humans into machines or soulless beings. 4. Mr. Deeds: A comedy film in which a small-town man inherits a massive corporation and uses his newfound wealth to help others while also finding love. The film's plot is centered on the protagonist's morals and kindness, which again doesn't explicitly involve the theme of humans becoming machine-like or losing their souls. Comparing all these four movies, based on the concerns mentioned in the passage, the OP would likely NOT be a fan of \\"Terminator\\". The central theme of human vs. machine conflict in Terminator resonates with the OP's uneasiness and aligns with the notion that people are haunted by the idea of turning into machines. Consequently, the movie \\"Terminator\\" is the strongest candidate for what the OP may not be a fan of among the given options."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer by more, less or no effect The answer to this question is:","completion":"less effect. At night, the temperature generally decreases and the Earth's surface cools down. This cooling can cause water in the clouds to become colder instead of warmer, as stated in the question. Thus, the night's cooling effect will have less influence on the formation of ice crystals, in comparison with the daytime when the temperature is higher and the sun's energy is available to heat the water. Since the second effect mentioned is the formation of ice crystals, this perturbation would lead to a reduced rate of ice crystal formation due to the lower temperature affecting the water in the clouds.

In the old days at the school, discipline was applied with a stick rather than the hand, as the pick from the following. A). stick tended to strike softer.; B). hand tended to strike softer.;","completion":"In the old days at the school, discipline was applied with a stick rather than the hand, as the stick tended to strike softer. This method of discipline is reflective of a time when the educational system implemented strict measures for the maintenance of order in classrooms. Back then, it was assumed that the presence of a strict regime would facilitate a well-disciplined learning environment. Using a stick as a disciplinary measure was seen as a more controlled way to reprimand students compared to utilizing one's hand. Even though the force applied with a stick might have been greater in some occasions, the primary notion behind using a stick was to maintain a level of consistency and distance between the teacher and the student. With the use of a stick, the inflicted pain was considered more bearable and less personal as there was no direct contact between the teacher's hand and the student's body. The thought process behind this method was twofold. Firstly, the consistency of the punishment allowed students to anticipate the consequences of their actions and potentially deter them from misbehaving. Secondly, the distance maintained between the teacher and the student through the use of a stick symbolized the authority that teachers held over their students. This authority was meant to assert the teacher's role as the guiding figure in the classroom, responsible for correcting and molding the student's behavior. Additionally, using a stick as a tool for discipline indicated a more systematic and impartial approach to punishment. The hand, in contrast, was seen as personal and subjective, as the force of physical punishment could significantly vary between incidents and teachers. The choice of the stick, in this sense, demonstrated a methodical and uniform method of regulation, allowing for the establishment of a hierarchy in the school environment. However, it is essential to note that contemporary research in education and child psychology has substantially discredited the use of physical punishment as an effective form of discipline. Studies have shown that physical punishment can lead to adverse effects on a child's mental health, hampering their ability to develop healthy relationships and emotional regulation. Given the current understanding of the impact of physical punishment on children, it is unlikely that the phrase \\"the stick tended to strike softer\\" would resonate with educators today. Instead, educational institutions now promote more compassionate and constructive approaches to maintaining discipline, such as developing resilience, fostering respect, and nurturing an intrinsic motivation to learn. These methods better align with the goals of modern education: to create lifelong learners who understand the importance of knowledge and possess the skills to navigate an ever-evolving world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

To provide more context, I can elaborate on the process and the organizations involved: Step 1: Identify the type of organizations involved in generating loss estimates Both private companies and government organizations look into the data and information on security breaches. Private companies include computer security consulting firms, while government organizations have specific agencies responsible for cybersecurity and data protection. Step 2: Understanding the process for estimating losses These organizations collect data from various sources, including incident reports, client surveys, and research studies. They analyze trends and assess the impact of security breaches on businesses, industries, and countries. This allows them to estimate the financial consequences of such incidents. Step 3: Referencing popular organizations that produce loss estimates Some well-known computer security consulting firms that provide loss estimates include FireEye, CrowdStrike, and Kaspersky Lab. Government organizations may include US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA), and the United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC).

Plot title: Shutter Island Movie plot: In 1954, two U.S. Marshals â Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels and his new partner, Chuck Aule â travel to the Ashecliffe Hospital for the criminally insane on Shutter Island located in Boston Harbor. They are investigating the disappearance of patient Rachel Solando, who was incarcerated for drowning her three children. Their only clue is a cryptic note found hidden in Solando's room: \\"The law of 4; who is 67?\\" They arrive just before a storm hits, preventing their return to the mainland for a few days. Daniels and Aule find the staff confrontational; Dr. John Cawley, the lead psychiatrist, refuses to turn over records, and they learn that Solando's doctor, Dr. Lester Sheehan, left the island on vacation immediately after Solando disappeared. Though they are given access to the hospital, they are told Ward C is off limits, while the lighthouse has already been searched. Whilst being interviewed, one patient secretly writes the word \\"RUN\\" in Daniels' notepad. Daniels starts to have migraine headaches from the hospital's atmosphere and experiences waking visions of his involvement in the Dachau liberation reprisals. He has disturbing dreams of his wife, Dolores Chanal, who was killed in a fire set by Andrew Laeddis, a local arsonist. In one instance Chanal tells Daniels that Solando is still on the island somewhere. The same applies to Laeddis who everyone claims was never there to begin with. Daniels later explains to Aule that locating Laeddis was an ulterior personal motive for taking the case. During their investigation Daniels and Aule find that Solando has abruptly resurfaced with no explanation as to her former whereabouts or how she escaped. This prompts Daniels to break into the restricted Ward C. There he encounters George Noyce who is a patient in solitary confinement. Noyce warns Daniels that the doctors are performing questionable experiments on the patients, some of whom are taken to the lighthouse to be lobotomized. Noyce warns Daniels that everyone else on the island, including Aule, is playing an... My question: Why is the doctor satisfied? A:","completion":"The doctor, specifically Dr. John Cawley, is satisfied because he is conducting a ground-breaking, albeit controversial, psychological experiment on Edward \\"Teddy\\" Daniels. The entire situation on Shutter Island, including the investigation, the disappearance of Rachel Solando, and Chuck Aule's presence have all been orchestrated to try to help Daniels, who is actually Andrew Laeddis, confront his own guilt and severe mental trauma. Daniels is an unreliable narrator and plagued by delusions and hallucinations due to his past traumas. Dr. Cawley believes that this immersive and manipulative approach has the potential to break through Daniels' deeply ingrained denial, repression, and resistance to treatment. His satisfaction stems from the belief that his experimental method might ultimately free Daniels/Laeddis from the grips of his mental illness, through facing the truth about his own actions in killing his wife (Dolores Chanal) because she drowned their children. By witnessing Daniels' progress, unraveling the clues laid out for him, and gradually unlocking the repressed memories of his past, Dr. Cawley is content that the experiment is pushing Daniels towards a moment of self-realization and potential healing. The unfolding events on Shutter Island, along with Cawley's own determination and secretive demeanor, create an ongoing sense of tension and conflict. However, deep down, Dr. Cawley is satisfied with the experiment's direction, because it offers hope for a new treatment avenue for extreme cases of psychosis and delusion. Even though his methods are unorthodox and met with resistance by others, Dr. Cawley sees the potential outcome as a justification for his satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

All my jeans could not fit in my new bag bag because the","completion":"bag was too small for my entire collection. In an attempt to solve this problem, I went through the following steps: Step 1: Assess the situation First, I assessed the situation to determine the extent of the issue. I counted the number of jeans I had and compared that to the capacity of my new bag. Step 2: Categorize the jeans To better understand the bag's limitations, I categorized my jeans into three groups based on their size and importance: must-haves, nice-to-haves, and can-live-withouts. Step 3: Prioritize the jeans Next, I prioritized the jeans based on their importance to me, setting aside the 'must-haves' for packing first. This would ensure that I have all the necessary jeans with me. Step 4: Experiment with packing techniques Rather than just folding the jeans in the traditional way, I researched and experimented with different packing techniques. For example, I tried rolling the jeans tightly, which can save space and prevent wrinkles. I also considered using vacuum bags, as they compress clothes and create more room. Step 5: Maximize the use of space I reevaluated the layout of my new bag and looked for unused areas where I could slip in a pair of jeans. For instance, I placed jeans in smaller pockets or stuffed them between other items to make the best use of every available space. Step 6: Minimize the number of jeans After trying various packing techniques and maximizing the use of space, I still found that not all of my jeans would fit. At this point, I had to make some tough decisions about which jeans to leave behind. I decided to leave behind some of the 'can-live-withouts' and a few of the 'nice-to-haves' based on factors such as recent wear, versatility, and sentimental value. Step 7: Double-check the packing Lastly, I double-checked the packing to ensure I hadn't missed any crucial jeans or other items, zipping up my new bag with a sense of satisfaction knowing that I had packed smartly and efficiently. In conclusion, although not all my jeans could fit in my new bag, by prioritizing, experimenting with packing techniques, maximizing space, and minimizing the number of jeans, I managed to fit the most important ones and learned valuable lessons about efficient packing for the future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Class A studied a pond filled with protozoa, while class B studied a pond with almost no protozoa. Which class observed less engulfing and digesting of other organisms? Hint: Protozoa generally feed by engulfing and digesting other organisms. As consumers, they have various roles in food chains and webs. Some are predators. They prey upon other single-celled organisms, such as bacteria. In fact, protozoa predators keep many bacterial populations under control. Other protozoa are herbivores. They graze on algae. Still others are decomposers. They consume dead organic matter. There are also parasitic protozoa that live in or on living hosts. For example, the protozoan that causes malaria lives inside a human host. Protozoa are also important food sources for many larger organisms, including insects and worms.

Answer the following question: What was the last name of the person who was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar? Answer the above question based on the context below: The album was generally well received. Several music critics favorably compared the album to Deal's work with the Pixies, among which were William Van Meter, Rob Sheffield, and Steve Kandell of Spin. Kandell and Sheffield mentioned tracks including \\"Fortunately Gone\\" as superior to songs by that group. Kandell noted Pod appealed to fans of the Pixies' \\"Gigantic\\", which was written and sung by Deal. In AllMusic, Heather Phares described Pod as a \\"vibrantly creative debut\\" that was better than the Pixies' 1990 album Bossanova, and argued that the Pixies should have recorded more of Deal's compositions.The Rough Guide to Rock's Piers Clifton and Melody Maker's Simon Reynolds viewed Pod as lacking energy in comparison to the Pixies' work. To Clifton, it was \\"plodding\\", while Reynolds felt it sounded \\"inhibited, moribund, stilted\\" and \\"never [let] it rip like the Pixies\\". Reynolds added that \\"Whenever a song gathers momentum or thrust, [the Breeders] throw in a weird bit, a gear change or an abrupt stop. They seem unhappy with the idea of simple rock exuberance.\\" Steve Taylor of The A to X of Alternative Music also found Pod inferior to music of the Pixies, but was impressed with Deal's ability to move from bass to guitar.Some reviews found Pod under-developed or insubstantial.

News article: Caterpillar's Terrible, Horrible, No Good, Very Bad Day Caterpillar Inc. is about as American as you can get, except that these days it’s not, having been partially shuffled off to Switzerland. But it still must deal with the IRS, and the IRS isn’t happy with the heavy equipment maker. In fact, the IRS is trying to add 1 billion in taxes and penalties to the company’s 2007-2009 year. Many of the proposed adjustments evidently relate to the Swiss entity as well as to foreign tax credits. Caterpillar has said it is fighting the IRS. But Caterpillar faces other legal process too, including a grand jury subpoena requesting information about the movement of cash among U.S. and non-U.S. units. The company was in the Senate hot seat in 2014. A report by the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigation said the company avoided 2.4 billion in U.S. taxes over 13 years by shifting profits to Switzerland. Senator Carl Levin (D-MI) grilled Caterpillar execs and PricewaterhouseCoopers accountants over the company’s offshore move of 85% of its parts sales. Most of Caterpillar’s parts business remained in the U.S., including employees and execs. Only 65 of over 8,000 parts employees are in Switzerland, claimed Sen. Levin, noting that “nothing changed in the operations.” Sen. Levin called it a sweetheart “tax deal pure and simple to shift profits between related parties.” But Caterpillar V.P. Julie Lagacy defended the deal saying it was legit. This echoes others who have appeared before Levin, including Apple CEO Tim Cook. The biggest surprise of the hearing was the Republican pushback defending Caterpillar and noting that the tax code was to blame. In fact, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., went so far as to suggest that Caterpillar deserved an award, not an inquisition. Sen. Paul said Caterpillar and its accountants have an obligation to shareholders to minimize their taxes. The hearing was perhaps most uncomfortable for the accountants asked about emails that seemed to poke fun at the fact that they might be retired by the time of an audit. Nevertheless, there was nothing definitive in the hearing, other than that taxes are terribly complex, and that multinational companies can and do try to move things around to save. Apple’s Tim Cook testified to the same effect, though without the Republican support Caterpillar mustered. Individuals may scratch their heads at how U.S. multinational companies plop profits offshore. After all, the Swiss banking scandals since 2008 make it clear that for individuals, everything is income worldwide. Multinational companies are different, and even “stateless” income is possible. Yet Sen. Levin and others would like to see more harmony in the tax code and a tightening of this “stateless” income. Tax havens like Ireland are favored by global giants like Apple, Google, HP, Facebook and Twitter. In 2013, the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations said Apple avoided 9 billion in U.S. taxes in 2012 alone via offshore units with no tax home. Apple’s CEO Tim Cook testified it was nothing illegal. Calling it the “holy grail of tax avoidance,” Sen. Levin claimed that Apple saved billions by claiming companies registered in Ireland are not tax resident in any country. Even Facebook flipped more than 700 million to the Cayman Islands as part of a “Double Irish” tax reduction strategy. Google used the Double Irish and the Dutch Sandwich, saving billions in U.S. taxes. Global companies like Apple, Starbucks and Hewlett-Packard put income in foreign pockets in ways the IRS doesn’t like. And the IRS isn’t alone in its criticism. The G20 countries and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) call it tax manipulation. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article talks about Caterpillar Inc., a big American company that makes heavy equipment, and how they are in trouble with the IRS (the people who collect taxes) for not paying enough taxes. The article says Caterpillar tried to save money by moving some business to a place called Switzerland, which helped them pay less taxes. But now, the IRS wants Caterpillar to pay 1 billion more in taxes and penalties. Some important people like senators and accountants are talking and arguing about this situation. They also mention that other big companies like Apple, Google, and Facebook have used similar ways to save money on taxes too."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Keith landed a job with the EPA. As part of his training he needed to learn how the Geiger counter works. To learn more about the counter he tested it in three different locations, location A, location B, and location C. Location A had very high radiation; location B had low radiation; and location C didn't have any radiation. Keith learned how the counter works in locations with varying degrees of radiation. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In which location the Geiger counter would click, location A or location C? Hint: You generally can’t see, smell, taste, hear, or feel radiation. Fortunately, there are devices such as Geiger counters that can detect radiation. A Geiger counter, like the one pictured in the Figure below , contains atoms of a gas that is ionized if it encounters radiation. When this happens, the gas atoms change to ions that can carry an electric current. The current causes the Geiger counter to click. The faster the clicks occur, the higher the level of radiation. You can see a video about the Geiger counter and how it was invented at the URL below. A:","completion":"In the given scenario, the Geiger counter would click in location A, where there is very high radiation.

Article: Today, almost everyone has heard of Harry Potter.The books detailing his experiences at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry have aroused passion, creativity, and interest in reading throughout the world. But have you ever considered why you are a fan of the Harry Potter series? JK Rowling has created a list of characters and an environment for them to inhabit that appeals to both adults and children. The fantasy aspect of the wizarding world expands the imagination, and takes the mind to new and exciting places.Anything could happen there.Her stories contain parts of the believable and unbelievable, changing the predictability that readers commonly come across and bear in fiction. The main theme of the series, including good versus evil, prejudice, love, death, sacrifice, friendship and loyalty, in actuality contributes to the ever-lasting nature of the stories.At the same time, these themes remind us of classic literature, offering mature readers tales that wear like a comfortable pair of shoes, while introducing younger readers to concepts they will meet throughout their lives. Much of the appeal also comes from the characters.In each book, JK Rowling introduces and describes the characters in such a way that we wonder not only about their futures, but also about their pasts.Even supporting characters are suddenly more than just extras in the background.And what of Harry Potter himself? We care about Harry, because we watch him grow from an innocent boy to a powerful wizard.We see him as both Hero and Victim.He experiences endless love and extreme pain, and as readers, we experience them with him. This perfect combination of emotion, suspense and fantasy, together with the fact that JK Rowling is a superb storyteller is the reason why we are Harry potter fans.People are fond of Harry Potter series.With books like these, it' s hard not to be.

Is Santa Monica was called Kecheek in the Tongva language. a good answer to this question?","completion":"While it is true that the city of Santa Monica was called Kecheek by the indigenous Tongva people, it does not provide a direct answer to the question about the date the explorer reached Santa Monica. To provide a detailed and long answer, we will look into the history of the city and identify the associated explorers. The area of present-day Santa Monica was first inhabited by the Tongva people, who called the place Kecheek, meaning \\"the place of the Alkali fly larvae,\\" referring to the hatching ground of a particular species of fly along the creeks that fed from the nearby Santa Monica and San Pedro Mountains. It wasn't until the arrival of European explorers that the area began to experience significant changes. Spanish explorer Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo is credited with discovering the Santa Monica area in 1542. Cabrillo, who initially sailed under the Spanish flag but later for Portugal, was the first European to navigate the coast of present-day California. The exact date that Cabrillo first set foot in Santa Monica, or what he called the \\"Bay of Smokes\\" (Bahía de los Fumos) due to the smoke from the Tongva peoples' fires, is not precisely known. Records suggest that Cabrillo's expedition passed by the Santa Monica area on October 10, 1542. However, it is not clear whether the expedition actually made landfall or merely viewed the coast from their ships. In 1769, another Spanish explorer, Gaspar de Portolá, led an overland expedition that reached the Santa Monica area. He, along with a group of Spanish soldiers and missionaries, essentially established the Spanish claim on the region. On August 3, 1769, the Portolá expedition reached present-day Santa Monica, and it is this date that is most commonly associated with the \\"explorer reaching Santa Monica.\\" In conclusion, while the indigenous name of Kecheek provides interesting background information on Santa Monica's history, it does not answer the question about the date when the explorer reached Santa Monica. The most accurate answer would be August 3, 1769, when Gaspar de Portolá's overland expedition arrived in the area, although Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo's expedition sailed by the coastline on October 10, 1542."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For grown-ups,an afternoon snooze is often easier said than done.But many of us have probably experienced just how simple it can be to catch some sleep in a gently rocking hammock .By examining brain waves in sleeping adults,researchers reported in the June 21issue of Current Biology,a Cell Press publication,that they now have evidence to explain why that is. \\"It is a common belief that rocking causes sleep:we fall asleep in a rocking chair soon and,since ancient times,we cradle our babies to sleep,\\"said Sophie Schwartz of the University of Geneva.\\"Yet,how this works had remained a mystery.The goal of our study was made up of two parts:to test whether rocking does indeed improve sleep,and to understand how this might work at the brain level.\\" Schwartz,Michel Muhlethaler,and their colleagues Laurence Bayer and Irina Constantinescu asked twelve adult volunteers to nap on a custom-made bed or\\"experimental hammock\\"that could either remain still or rock gently.All participants were good sleepers who didn't typically nap and did not suffer from excessive sleepiness during the day.Each participant took two 45-minute afternoon naps,one with the bed still and one with the bed in motion,while their brain activity was monitored. \\"We observed a faster transition to sleep in each and every subject in the swinging condition,\\"Muhlethaler said.\\"Surprisingly,we also observed a dramatic boosting of certain types of sleep-related brain waves.\\" More specifically,rocking increased the length of stage N2sleep,a form of non-rapid eye movement sleep that normally occupies about half of a good night's sleep.The rocking bed also had a lasting effect on brain activity,increasing slow brain waves and bursts of activity known as sleep spindles . Schwartz and Muhlethaler say the next step is to find out whether rocking can improve longer periods of sleep and to find out whether it may be useful for the treatment of sleep disorders,such as insomnia . Question: What can we learn from Sophie Schwartz's words? Options: A: Her team aimed to answer two questions. B: The study is going to benefit babies a lot. C: The study had been kept secret before finished. D: People used to believe rocking was bad for sleep. A:","completion":"Sophie Schwartz's words indicate that her team aimed to answer two questions.

He refuses to reveal his true identity, and when one of Napoleon's generals in exile with him tries to turn the imposter in, the imposter has the general sent away, as having lost his mind in the isolation of St. Helena. Meanwhile, the real Napoleon can't just stand in the square in Paris and announce his return, because the people all believe he is on St. Helena. Almost none of the citizenry has ever seen Napoleon up close, and in any case he's older and seedier looking now. In fact, we learn that whole groups of inhabitants of the Paris insane asylum walk around in Napoleon costumes, claiming to be the emperor!So the real Napoleon is stuck.

By stating \\"nothing interesting,\\" the reviewer conveys a sense of disappointment or dissatisfaction with the film. It is evident that the reviewer did not find any engaging or enjoyable aspects within the movie \\"Unfaithful.\\" The appraisal's brevity is suggestive of strong disinterest or repudiation. A longer, more elaborate review could have potentially provided a comprehensive account of the viewer's thoughts and guided potential audiences in making their decision. Conversely, this short critique may not be sufficient in persuading others or providing a thorough understanding of the film's subtleties. Additionally, the use of the adjective \\"unfaithful\\" might insinuate a disconnection or disagreement with the film's content, themes, or characters, which could also contribute to the negative evaluation. Whether this refers to the film's narrative, performances, or production values, it is an indication that the reviewer did not find much worth in watching the movie. Overall, it is reasonable to conclude that this review offers a negative opinion of the movie; however, it is essential to consider that everyone's perspective and preferences are subjective.

He gave his dog enough to eat and drink, but sometimes he was not polite to it. He didn't know that an unkind work sometimes could cut one's heart like a knife.

A Facebook album uploaded to the ministry's official page featured a photograph of Minister of State Teo Ser Luck lying on a worker's dormitory bed. It was accompanied by the caption: \\"I learnt that some workers prefer to sleep without a mattress as they are used to it back in their home country\\". Mr Teo denied making that comment when contacted by the BBC. In a later statement the ministry said an administrator wrote the caption, not Mr Teo. The statement issued on behalf of the Ministry of Manpower said the caption would be removed and a clarification issued. \\"We regret the unintended implications, and any misunderstanding that the post has caused,\\" the statement said. It said Mr Teo had visited the dormitory to mark International Migrants Day, and that it was \\"unfortunate\\" that the visit \\"was over-shadowed by this turn of events\\". Singapore is home to hundreds of thousands of foreign workers brought in to work in the shipping and construction industries, jobs that not many Singaporeans are eager to take on. Employers provide accommodation for migrant workers, however, advocacy groups have raised concern over their living conditions which can be crowded and unsanitary. The post has drawn criticism among the country's vocal online community. While some Facebook users defended the caption, others criticised Mr Teo for being \\"insensitive and condescending\\". \\"Is your head so far up the ivory tower? Our politicians really need to reflect on how far out of touch they are with reality,\\" said Facebook user Johnny Tang. Jeff Chua suggested that most foreign workers made the choice to sleep without mattresses because of \\"bed bug infestations\\" in dormitories. A Facebook user criticised Mr Teo for his \\"million dollar salary\\" and using \\"migrant workers as a photo opportunity\\". The most popular comment on the post however, came from Ibrahim Khalil, a foreign construction worker in Singapore. \\"In our own homes, we sleep with mattresses. But in Singapore, it is due to the hot weather in our rooms, with (up to) 12 people. Sometimes dormitory management don't allow for more than two fans in the rooms,\\" he said, adding that migrant workers like himself would be happier if they received a \\"more comfortable dormitory life\\". Many of Singapore's politicians, including Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, maintain an active social media presence and are popular with internet users. However, Mr Teo is not the first to have been criticised by some over what seemed like an insensitive post. Minister Tan Chuan-Jin faced negative comments after he suggested in a Facebook post that some elderly people who collect cardboard as a way of making money, were doing it as a \\"form of exercise and activity\\". Another politician Baey Yam Keng drew outrage after he condemned the Paris terror attacks in November by uploading a photo of himself standing next to the Eiffel Tower which some users thought was doctored - although he denied this. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"A photograph of Singapore's Minister of State Teo Ser Luck lying on a worker's dormitory bed with the caption: \\"I learnt that some workers prefer to sleep without a mattress as they are used to it back in their home country\\" has drawn criticism from Singapore's online community. The minister denied making the comment, and the Ministry of Manpower later issued a statement clarifying that an administrator wrote the caption. Some Facebook users found the caption insensitive and condescending, pointing out that foreign workers often slept without mattresses due to bed bug infestations or dormitory rules. The incident highlights concerns over the living conditions of Singapore's hundreds of thousands of foreign workers, many of whom work in shipping and construction industries."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: James Proud, a British businessman who settled in San Francisco launched a Twitter campaign called \\"Stop DST\\". Daylight Saving Time (DST) refers to the time during the summer when clocks are one hour ahead of standard time. \\"Daylight saving was created to save energy, and it doesn't really do that.\\" Proud said, \\"but what's even worse are its negative health effects. It's both outdated and harmful.\\" daylight saving has been linked to a surprising number of health issues such as heart attacks, but Proud has a particular interest in the topic because of its disruptive effects on sleep. Last year, German researchers suggested that our body cocks never really adjust t daylight saving, which causes a host of health problems. Till Roenneberg of Ludwig-Maximillians University said that because of DST, \\"the majority of the population has severely decreased productivity, decreased quality of life, increasing chance of getting illness, and is just plain tired.\\" The week after daylight saving also witnesses a sudden increase in fatal traffic accidents, according to the University of Colorado. It is believed that this is caused both by disrupted sleep schedules and the shift of daylight hours from the morning to the evening. \\"Daylight saving is an economic tradition. And all economic choices involve achieving a balance. \\" said behavioral economist David Gerard. \\"Even if we decide to abolish daylight saving, there would be a large number of unhappy people.\\" Some such people are shift works, students and parents of schoolchildren, all of whom get to enjoy an extra hour of daylight after work or class with DST. Plus, restaurants love the extra evening sales DST allows. Daylight saving has also been linked to lower crime rates, due to the \\"deterrent effect\\" of longer daylight. Basically, more light increase a criminal's chances of being seen by witnesses or police, which discourages criminal activity. Gerard also point out that an extra hour of daylight has vastly more influence in the American South, where the sun sets... Question: What causes Proud's greatest concern? Options: A: DST not keeping up with economic development B: DST resulting in disorder in people's sleep schedule C: DST stopping people from working productively. D: DST not helping to save energy any more","completion":"Proud's greatest concern, as mentioned in the article, is the negative health effects of DST, particularly the disruptive effects on sleep.

Primarily an illustrator, as well as a scholar and archaeologist, Pullan trained with Alfred Waterhouse in Manchester, before joining Burges's office in the 1850s. In 1859, he married Burges's sister. Following Burges's death in 1881, Pullan lived at The Tower House and published collections of Burges's designs, including Architectural Designs of William Burges (1883) and The House of William Burges (1886). In his preface to Architectural Designs Pullan expressed the hope that illustrated volumes of his brother-in-law's work \\"would be warmly welcomed and thoroughly appreciated, not only by his professional brethern, but by all men of educated taste in Europe and America.\\" This hope was not to be fulfilled for a hundred years but Burges's work did continue to attract followers in Japan. Josiah Conder studied under him, and, through Conder's influence, the notable Japanese architect Tatsuno Kingo was articled to Burges in the year before the latter's death. Burges also received brief, but largely favourable, attention in Muthesius's Das Englische Haus, where Muthesius described him as \\"the most talented Gothicist of his day\\". From the later twentieth century to the present a renaissance has occurred in the study of Victorian art, architecture and design and Crook contends that Burges's place at the centre of that world, as \\"a wide-ranging scholar, an intrepid traveller, a coruscating lecturer, a brilliant decorative designer and an architect of genius,\\" is again appreciated. Crook writes further that, in a career of only some twenty years, he became \\"the most brilliant architect-designer of his generation,\\" and, beyond architecture, his achievements in metalwork, jewellery, furniture and stained glass place him as Pugin's only \\"rival [.] as the greatest art-architect of the Gothic Revival.\\", what would be the answer ?

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: When you're loading creatine, 5 grams is the recommended dosage to start with; unless a doctor has recommended otherwise, 5 grams is a safe bet. Use the plastic measuring cup that came with the powder to measure it out. If your can of powder didn't come with a measuring tool, measure one heaping teaspoon, which is roughly equivalent to 5 grams. Pour the powder directly into the water and use a spoon to quickly stir it. If you're using a bottle with a cap, you can close the cap and shake it. If you don't have a container that is exactly quart-sized, measure four cups of water into a large container and mix in the powder. You may find it convenient to buy a quart-sized water bottle with a lid, which you can carry with you for times when you want to take a dose of creatine outside the house. You can also mix creatine with juice or an electrolyte-containing energy drink. As mentioned above, creatine beings to degrade when it is mixed with water, so you must consume it right away to get the maximum benefit from the supplement. Chase the creatine with more water. It's important to stay well hydrated while you take creatine, so follow it up with another cup or two. Eat and drink as normal. There are no dietary contraindications for creatine, so you may eat a normal meal before or after consuming it. When you're loading creatine, you need a total of 20 grams a day for the first five days. Space out the doses so you have one at breakfast, one at lunch, one at dinner and one before bed. After the initial 5-day load, taper off to a comfortable maintenance routine. You can safely take up to 4 doses a day, but taking 2 or 3 has the same effect once you're in maintenance mode.

Output:","completion":"2, I received a puzzle as a gift. Explanation: The task is asking us to complete a story by inserting a missing sentence in between the given sentences. We need to find the appropriate position for the missing sentence and also write the sentence that logically fits in the story. Guidelines: 1. Understand the context of the story. 2. Identify the logical position of the missing sentence in the story. 3. Write the missing sentence that makes the story complete. Solution: We read the sentences and understand the context of the story. It appears to be a story about someone who has a puzzle that they have not yet opened and they always get interrupted. 1. Sentence1: I haven't opened it yet. 2. Sentence2: I always keep planning to but something keeps coming up. 3. Sentence3: Like right now talking with you. 4.

Chapter XXXIV Violence It had been arranged at Folking, before Hester had started, that Caldigate himself should drive the waggonette into Cambridge to take her back on the Wednesday, but that he would bring a servant with him who should drive the carriage up to the Grange, so that he, personally, should not have to appear at the door of the house. He would remain at Mr. Seely's, and then the waggonette should pick him up. This had been explained to Mrs. Bolton. 'John will remain in town, because he has so much to do with Mr. Seely,' Hester had said; 'and Richard will call here at about twelve.' All her plans had thus been made known, and Mrs. Bolton was aware at what hour the bolts must be drawn and the things removed. But, as the time drew nearer, her dislike to a sudden commencement of absolute hostilities became stronger,--to hostilities which would seem to have no sanction from Mr. Bolton himself, because he would then be absent. And he too, though as he lay awake through the dreary hours of the long night he said no word about the plan, felt, and felt more strongly as the dawn was breaking, that it would be mean to leave his daughter with a farewell kiss, knowing as he would do that he was leaving her within prison-bars, leaving her to the charge of jailers. The farewell kiss would be given as though he and she were to meet no more in her old home till this terrible trial should be over, and some word appropriate to such a parting would then be spoken. But any such parting word would be false, and the falsehood would be against his own child! 'Does she expect it?' he said, in a low voice, when his wife came up to him as he was dressing. 1.

We did end up opening escrow on a house the week of the first class . The day before the first class was filled with house inspections and piles of paperwork , and I could hardly think straight . But the class turned out okay . Based on the preceding passage, answer the following question What would need to happen for this scenario to be possible ?","completion":"Several steps and scenarios need to occur in order to make the above situation possible. 1. Financial Preparation: Before thinking about purchasing a house, there should be adequate financial readiness. This could involve saving for a down payment, ensuring a good credit score for mortgage approval, or having a steady income that can comfortably bear the mortgage payments and other house-related costs. 2. House Hunting: The person or family will have to undergo a process of house hunting to find the suitable house that fits their needs and financial capabilities. This could involve days, weeks, or even months of searching, visiting different listings, comparing prices, and locations. 3. Making an Offer and Opening Escrow: Once the perfect house is found, the interested buyer makes an offer. If the offer is accepted by the seller, escrow is opened. An escrow is a process where the funds and the title deeds are held by a neutral third party until all conditions of the contract are met. 4. House Inspections: Before the closing on a house, inspections need to occur. These inspections are conducted to evaluate the house condition and to ensure that the house is in the agreed-upon shape. In some cases, the result of the inspection may give room for further negotiation. 5. Paperwork: There will be a lot of paperwork required in this process. This could range from the initial purchasing contract, escrow instructions, title deeds, inspection reports, mortgage agreements, to insurances. All these documents must be reviewed and signed by the respective parties involved. 6. Class Attendance: Concurrently, the person mentioned in the passage is also attending a class. The person might be a student or professional attending some sorts of educational or training courses. The class could be part of their routine schedule or could be a new commitment that they started. Despite the busy schedule and distracting situation, they successfully attend the class as intended. 7. Emotional Stress and Multitasking: It's quite clear that the person is under some level of stress and is dealing with multiple things at the same time - buying a house, attending class, and more. The person has to manage their time and energy efficiently to navigate through all these simultaneously. In summary, various interconnected events and conditions would need to happen for the above scenario to be possible. The processes of purchasing a house and attending class both require significant time and focus, and managing both concurrently underscores the person’s ability to multitask and handle pressure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

In fact, it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. On the other hand, the Earth enjoys a close proximity to the Sun. Only Mercury and Venus are closer to the Sun than the Earth. Which planet would travel longer distance, Neptune or Earth? A:","completion":"Neptune would travel a longer distance in its orbit around the Sun than Earth, given that it is the farthest planet from the Sun in our solar system. To understand this, we must look into the concept of orbits and their sizes, as well as the distances planets need to cover in order to complete their respective orbits. An orbit is the path taken by an object in space when it moves around another, due to the force of gravity. In our solar system, the planets travel around the Sun in elliptical orbits. The size of a planet's orbit is determined by its distance from the Sun, specifically in terms of semi-major axis, which is the average distance between the planet and the Sun. Earth is the third planet from the Sun with an average distance of approximately 93 million miles (150 million kilometers) from the solar-massive body. This distance denotes Earth's semi-major axis and forms the basis for an astronomical unit (AU) – a measurement used to describe the scale of our solar system. Earth completes one orbit around the Sun in 365.25 days or one solar year. Neptune, being the eighth planet from the Sun, has an astronomically greater semi-major axis, averaging at around 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers) or approximately 30 AU. Given this immensely larger distance from the Sun, Neptune's orbit is substantially more extended than Earth's. It takes Neptune approximately 165 Earth years to complete one orbit around the Sun. So, in comparing the distances that Earth and Neptune travel in their individual orbits, it becomes evident that Neptune traverses a vastly larger path. This is due to Neptune’s substantial distance from the Sun compared to the Earth. Consequently, Neptune would travel a longer distance in its orbit around the Sun than Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

While William, with a higher salary, had more disposable income to spend, Samuel had to budget his money more carefully due to his limited financial resources. As people generally allocate a portion of their earnings for entertainment and personal items, William's larger salary allowed him to spend more on various expenses. Step 1: Analyze the options given. - I. William had a much smaller salary. - II. Samuel had a much smaller salary. Step 2: Determine which option makes more sense in the context of more money being spent by William. - Option I would indicate that William spent more money despite having a smaller salary, which seems counterintuitive. - Option II would indicate that Samuel had a smaller salary, which explains why William was able to spend more money. Step 3: Choose the appropriate option from the selections. Based on the analysis, Option II (Samuel had a much smaller salary) provides a more logical explanation for why William spent more money.

The second is to place their hand anywhere on the body of a car, and keep it there. This is where things start getting difficult. Lots of other people are doing the same thing. And the winner of the \\"handathon\\" contest is the person who can carry on doing it for the longest time. That person gets to own the car. It still seems to be an easy thing to do. At the beginning it is. Anyone can stand still. But when the contest has been going for four or five days, standing still seems like the most difficult job in the world. And keeping the hand in place over this time becomes an act of serious attention. After a few days, the hand seems to belong to someone else--someone who wants to go home and get some sleep. Competitors are allowed to take a five-minute break every hour to eat, drink or do whatever else is necessary. No one is allowed to lean on the car for support. Winners need to be able to show great powers of attention. They also need to be able to develop special skills. Maybe the popularity of the handathon is due to the fact that it is not necessary to be a trained athlete to enter. Entrants in the Longview handathon certainly don't seem to do much preparation. Most say they will prepare by \\"getting lots of sleep\\". Others say they will \\"eat healthy food\\" or \\"pray for success\\".

Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis holds true given the premise, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components and examine the relationship between them. Premise: \\"oh yeah i just got mine in the mail so it kind of inspires me to keep calling\\" From this premise, we can summarize the following points: 1. The speaker has recently received something in the mail. 2. This received item inspires the speaker to continue calling (though the exact context or purpose of the calling is unspecified). Hypothesis: \\"I wanted to keep calling before I received mine in the mail.\\" The hypothesis essentially states that, prior to receiving the item in the mail, the speaker already had a desire to keep calling. Now, let's attempt to deduce the validity of the hypothesis based on the premise. The premise focuses on the impact of the received item on the speaker's motivation to continue calling. The hypothesis, however, seeks to establish the speaker's motivation preceding the reception of the item. Taking these elements into account, it is not necessarily possible to conclude that the hypothesis is true, solely based on the premise. While the premise does establish that the speaker is currently inspired to keep calling, it neither confirms nor denies any motivation that may have existed prior to receiving the item in the mail. To determine the validity of the hypothesis with certainty, more information regarding the speaker's motivations and feelings before receiving the item would be required.

His co-anchor, Dulcie Niles finds Barry's body, calls the police and prepares to film the investigation, but before the police can arrive Barry's body is stolen by the building's cleaner, Chafuka, who uses her voodoo powers to reanimate Barry's corpse as a zombie, allowing her to take over Barry's luxury apartment. In order to keep up appearances, Chafuka has Barry, who is otherwise unable to speak, continue performing his news broadcasts by controlling him with a voodoo doll, while Dulcie continues to investigate the drug ring with the help of incompetent police detective Jordan Penrose. Meanwhile, the head of the drug ring, Nolan sees one of Barry's news broadcasts and assumes that his henchmen bungled Barry's murder, and sends them to finish the job off. When they arrive at the station however, they end up being killed in a series of mishaps, and Chafuka turns them into more zombies. On seeing his zombified former henchmen, Nolan panics and takes refuge with the station's owner, Alex Cavanaugh, who it turns out is the mastermind behind the drug ring. He takes Dulcie and Jordan hostage and has Nolan drive them to safety, while Barry, Chafuka and the zombie henchmen give chase. During the course of the chase Dulcie and Jordan are rescued, and then Nolan loses control of the car, with both he and Cavanaugh being killed in the resulting crash. Chafuka turns Cavanaugh and Nolan into zombies and then takes full control of the station, with Barry continuing as lead anchor after his original personality fully returns, and Jordan quitting the police to become the station's head of security, with the zombie Nolan and his henchmen becoming security guards.

Summarize: Gayle Nix Jackson is also seeking 10m (Â£6.6m) in compensation over the film shot by Orville Nix in November 1963. He sold the film to a news agency that year but it was later handed to the government for its inquiries. Ms Nix Jackson says she was told this year the government agency believed to be in possession did not have the film. The 8mm Nix film was shot from the opposite side of the presidential limousine from where the famous Zapruder film was taken on 22 November 1963. Why the legend of JFK endures The Nix film shows the bullet hitting the president, First Lady Jackie Kennedy climbing on to the boot of the limousine, and secret service agent Clint Hill jumping into the vehicle. The film is shot from Dealey Plaza, showing Zapruder across the street and the famous grassy knoll, from where some witnesses thought they heard a shot fired. It is not as complete as the Zapruder movie, as it shows only part of the assassination. However, the lawsuit cites the Warren Commission - which investigated the assassination - as saying the Nix film was \\"nearly as important as the Zapruder film\\". The government purchased the Zapruder film for 16m in 1999 in a settlement with his heirs. Orville Nix sold his film to UPI for 5,000 with an agreement for its return after 25 years. But it was handed over to the government for the inquiry. Its last known sighting was with the House Select Committee on Assassinations in 1978. It was believed to have been handed to the National Archives and Records Administration, but the lawsuit says the agency has told Ms Nix Jackson, who lives in Fort Worth in Texas, it no longer has the movie. Ms Nix Jackson told the Associated Press it was incomprehensible authorities would lose \\"an important piece of historical evidence\\". She said: \\"I can understand little clerical issues.

Solve -171*m = 185*m - 339*m + 153 for m.. What is the answer??","completion":"To solve the equation -171*m = 185*m - 339*m + 153 for m, we will first simplify the equation by combining the terms with the variable m on the right side of the equation. -171*m = 185*m - 339*m + 153 Now, we will combine the terms 185*m and -339*m: -171*m = (185 - 339)*m + 153 -171*m = -154*m + 153 Next, we want to isolate the m variable. To do that, we will add 171*m to both sides of the equation: -171*m + 171*m = -154*m + 171*m + 153 0 = 17*m + 153 Now, we will subtract 153 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term with m: -153 = 17*m Finally, we will divide both sides of the equation by 17 to solve for m: -153 / 17 = m m = -9 So, the solution to the equation -171*m = 185*m - 339*m + 153 is m = -9."},{"prompt":"In this task you are expected to write an SQL query that will return the data asked for in the question. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

George Jones adopted Tina and her sisters shortly after the birth of their Daughter Georgette . Shortly after the birth of her daughter , Georgette , Tina and her sisters adopted Tina George Jones .","completion":"Step 1: Analyzing the first sentence: \\"George Jones adopted Tina and her sisters shortly after the birth of their Daughter Georgette.\\" Meaning: In this sentence, George Jones is the one who adopted Tina and her sisters. This adoption took place after the birth of a daughter named Georgette. Step 2: Analyzing the second sentence: \\"Shortly after the birth of her daughter, Georgette, Tina and her sisters adopted Tina George Jones.\\" Meaning: This sentence is either incorrect or ambiguously written. If the intended meaning is that Tina and her sisters adopted someone named Tina George Jones, then the sentence is incorrect because 'Tina George Jones' should be replaced with 'George Jones' only. Alternatively, if the intended meaning is that Tina and her sisters were adopted by George Jones, the sentence structure is ambiguous and should be rephrased. Step 3: Comparing the meanings of both sentences: The first sentence clearly states that George Jones adopted Tina and her sisters after the birth of their daughter Georgette. On the other hand, the second sentence is either incorrect or ambiguously constructed. As a result, I'd say that the sentences do not have the same meaning with the current wording of the second sentence. To make the second sentence have the same meaning as the first sentence, it could be rephrased as: \\"Shortly after the birth of her daughter, Georgette, Tina and her sisters were adopted by George Jones.\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Francis Tiafoe, Top-Ranked Junior, Grew Up at Tennis Center, and It Shows From 1999 to 2010, its tenants were three members of the Tiafoe family: Constant and his twin boys, Francis and Franklin. While Tiafoe, the center’s maintenance man, made his rounds, tending to the courts and emptying the trash bins, Francis would follow, occasionally drifting away to hit a few balls. The costs of elite tennis are prohibitive for many parents — the full-time junior program here is 27,500 a year — but Francis had ready and free access to the sport and some of the best coaches because of his father’s job. From that unusual arrangement, a young tennis star was born. Today, Francis Tiafoe, 14, is the nation’s top-ranked boys player in his age group. “It could be argued that Francis is the luckiest kid in the world,” Ray Benton, the tennis center’s chief executive, said. “It was pure serendipity. He didn’t pick tennis; tennis picked him.” When the French Open begins May 27, analysts and fans will lament the state of men’s tennis in the United States. John Isner is the top-ranked American at No. 10, and he is hardly considered a formidable threat to win a Grand Slam tournament. The last American man to win a major was Andy Roddick, at the 2003 United States Open. If Francis continues his ascent, he could be the country’s next best hope in the sport — a notion that would have been inconceivable to his parents when they immigrated from Sierra Leone in the early 1990s. Tiafoe and his wife, Alphina, had twin boys in 1998, and two years later he took a job on the construction crew that was building the tennis facility. “I worked harder than everybody else as I was the only black guy on the crew,” he said. When the club was completed, Tiafoe was hired to do maintenance. Responsible for opening and closing the center, and everything in between that did not directly involve tennis, he often slept only three hours a night. His starting salary was 21,000 a year. When the staff told him he could stay in the spare office, he made it a home for him and the boys, who stayed at least five days a week. The rest of the time the children stayed with Alphina, who lived with relatives in a one-bedroom apartment in nearby Hyattsville. “We didn’t have a certificate of occupancy, so I was really nervous about telling people he lived in a back room,” Benton said. Alphina said she liked the arrangement because the center was a safe haven from her blighted neighborhood. At first, no one at the center paid much attention to the boys. But the boys, especially Francis, paid attention to the action on the courts. Frank Salazar, one of the coaches, said that from the time Francis was 4, “he had a tennis racket in his hands.” For years, Francis would watch instructors give lessons to older boys. “When we would get done training the bigger boys, he would roll the basket out there and try to serve by himself or play some mini-tennis with whoever had a few minutes,” Salazar said. “Suddenly he started to get really good. He’s probably watched more tennis than all the kids here combined.” When Francis was 8, Mikhail Kouznetsov was hired to coach at the club’s Junior Tennis Champions Center. He became a second father of sorts to the Tiafoe children. Alphina called him “a godsend and a miracle.” “I would come in early, around 5, 6 a.m., and wake the boys up to play and feed them balls or whatever,” Kouznetsov said. “Me and my wife loved them, so we helped feed them, buy them shoes and when we needed to, we drove Francis to tournaments and paid his entrance fees out of our own pockets.” Constant Tiafoe left his maintenance job at the center in 2010 and is unemployed. The family now lives in the apartment in Hyattsville. But the boys remain immersed in tennis almost exclusively. Francis said he had no friends outside the center. His girlfriend, he said, is also a world-class player there. The Tiafoe boys’ development was not always smooth. Franklin also exhibits impressive skills on the court, along with some petulance. “You would know Franklin is playing because all you would hear is curse words ringing from somewhere in the courts,” said Ken Brody, who founded the Junior Tennis Champions Center in 1999. “Roger Federer was the quintessential hothead when he was a junior. They grow out of it.” Schoolwork can be a struggle for Francis, and the fitness regimen and practice drills sometimes flustered him. “Iʼd give him a C in gym glass,” said Frank Costello, the senior director of fitness. “There’s good days and bad days.” But Francis’ results on the court have been so promising that shortcomings may be easy to dismiss. In January he won the boys’ singles title at an international tournament in Bolton, England. A week later, he won Les Petits As, a prestigious tournament in Tarbes, France, which attracts many of the world’s best young players. He now has endorsement deals with Adidas and Wilson. “I knew I was going to play pro tennis when I was 12,” Francis said. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"This article is about a young tennis player named Francis Tiafoe. He grew up at a tennis center where his dad worked as a maintenance man. This allowed Francis to learn and play tennis for free. Now, at 14 years old, he is the top-ranked boys' tennis player in his age group in the United States.

Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Persian: syd rwHllh mwswy khmyny [ru:hol'la:he khomei'ni:] ( listen); 24 September 1902 - 3 June 1989), known in the Western world as Ayatollah Khomeini, was an Iranian Shia Muslim religious leader and politician. He was the founder of Iran as an Islamic republic and the leader of its 1979 Iranian Revolution that saw the overthrow of 2500 years of Persian monarchy and Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, the last Shah of Iran. In January 1963, the Shah announced the \\"White Revolution\\", a six-point programme of reform calling for land reform, nationalization of the forests, the sale of state-owned enterprises to private interests, electoral changes to enfranchise women and allow non-Muslims to hold office, profit-sharing in industry, and a literacy campaign in the nation's schools. Some of these initiatives were regarded as dangerous, especially by the powerful and privileged Shi'a ulama (religious scholars), and as Westernizing trends by traditionalists (Khomeini viewed them as \\"an attack on Islam\\"). Ayatollah Khomeini summoned a meeting of the other senior marjas of Qom and persuaded them to decree a boycott of the referendum on the White Revolution. On 22 January 1963 Khomeini issued a strongly worded declaration denouncing the Shah and his plans. Two days later the Shah took an armored column to Qom, and delivered a speech harshly attacking the ulama as a class. Khomeini continued his denunciation of the Shah's programmes, issuing a manifesto that bore the signatures of eight other senior Iranian Shia religious scholars. In it he listed the various ways in which the Shah had allegedly violated the constitution, condemned the spread of moral corruption in the country, and accused the Shah of submission to the United States and Israel. He also decreed that the Nowruz celebrations for the Iranian year 1342 (which fell on 21 March 1963) be canceled as a sign of protest against government policies. On the afternoon of 'Ashura (3 June 1963), Khomeini delivered a speech at the Feyziyeh madrasah drawing parallels between the Sunni Muslim caliph Yazid, who is perceived as a 'tyrant' by Shias, and the Shah, denouncing the Shah as a \\"wretched, miserable man,\\" and warning him that if he did not change his ways the day would come when the people would offer up thanks for his departure from the country. On 5 June 1963 (15 of Khordad) at 3:00 am, two days after this public denunciation of the Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, Khomeini was detained in Qom and transferred to Tehran. This sparked three days of major riots throughout Iran and led to the deaths of some 400. That event is now referred to as the Movement of 15 Khordad. Khomeini was kept under house arrest and released in August.","completion":"This text is about Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini, also known as Ayatollah Khomeini.

She said: 'After one month of taking the drugs, I became less itchy but hives remained on my skin. Then I switched to traditional medicine. and all the hives disappeared, together with my itching. However, my. skin began to sag and fold.' Mrs Nguyen then took another kind of. traditional medicine to treat her rapid-aging skin problem - but to no. avail. Doctors say it may have been the long-term use of traditional medicines that caused the condition as they are often spiked with corticoids. These steroids speed up the effects of the unregulated remedies but could also have triggered the rare skin disease mastocytosis, where the body produces too many mast cells. The couple do not remember what the medicine was or which pharmacy they got it from. Our love hasn't faded: Tuven (pictured) said he still loved his wife but they hadn't had children as their lives were too difficult. Mrs Nguyen said: 'We considered that it was. our destiny and I quit treatment in 2009. Now I always wear a face mask. whenever I go out. 'The skin on my face, chest and belly. have folds like an old woman who has given birth several times although I. have never had a child. 'But the rapid-aging syndrome hasn't affected. my menstrual cycle, hair, teeth, eyes and mind.' In 2010, the couple. migrated to the southern province of Binh Phuoc's Bu Dop District where. they rent a small wooden house. It could be.... Lipodystrophy. This is a rare syndrome which causes a layer of fatty tissue beneath the surface of the skin to disintegrate while the skin itself continues to grow at a startling pace. It has no cure and leaves victims with loose folds of skin on their bodies as well as wrinkled faces and features of people much hold. Only 2,000 people are thought to have the condition. Or it might be.... Cushing’s Syndrome. This can be triggered if a person has very high levels of a hormone called cortisol in their blood. Common symptoms include weight gain, rounding of the face due to deposits of fat developing there and thinning of the skin. It often occurs as a side effect of treatment with corticosteroids. Women are five times more likely to develop endogenous Cushing’s syndrome than men, with most cases affecting people who are 25 to 40 years old. Mr Nguyen continued to work as a carpenter. while Phuong got a job at a cashew-nut processing factory. Both earn a. total of less than £92 a month - which means they cannot. afford an examination at a major hospital in Ho Chi Minh City. Tuyen said his wife's disease has not affected his love for her or their relationship. He said: 'I married Phuong when she was a. beautiful woman. I have followed her through her disease and have never. been shocked at all. 'It's not easy to talk about one's own. marital affairs. Just simply understand that I still love her very. much.' Mrs Nguyen said her husband's love is the reason she is able to. persevere in the face of adversity. She said: 'He still loves me like before. despite the fact that I look old and ugly. With him, I feel more. confident to live and work.' On October 2, doctors from Nguyen Dinh. Chieu Hospital in Ben Tre Province said they would examine Phuong for. free and send her to the HCMC Dermatology Hospital if they failed to. diagnose her condition. There is already some disagreement among doctors over the cause of the rare condition. Doctor Vo Thi Bach Suong of the HCMC University of Medicine and Pharmacy, said: 'She might have taken corticoid for a. long time. Many traditional pharmacists use corticoid in their medicine,. leading to side effects like swelled face and abnormally-growing skin. sections.' Nguyen Hoai Nam, another lecturer at the university, agreed that Phuong may suffer from the wrongful use of corticoid. He said: 'A sudden stop in using. corticoid could easily lead to Cushing's Syndrome, which is clearly seen. through affected skin.' However, doctor Huynh Huy Hoang of. the HCMC Dermatology Hospital has doubts over this diagnosis. He said: 'It's really strange. This is. the first time I've heard of such a case of rapid-aging process on an. adult. It's not lipodystropy syndrome. 'However, aging is not a common sign of Cushing's Syndrome either.' Doctor Yen Lam Phuc of the Vietnam. Military Medical Academy agreed with Hoang, saying the rapid aging could. not be a side effect of a medical substance. He said: 'It could be a. totally new syndrome.' Meanwhile Tuyen said that he and his wife do not dare to have a child, even though they have been married several years, because their lives are so difficult. He said: 'Our only wish is to have some philanthropists or doctors help my wife to make her normal face again.' Doctor Hoang Van Minh from the Ho Chi Minh City Medicine and Pharmacy University Hospital claims Phuong, could regain some of her previous beauty with medical treatment. Dr Hoang visited Phuong this week at her house in the Mekong Delta province of Ben Tre where he said it was likely she did have mastocytosis. He said Phuong's face still swells and she is itchy with frequent diarrhoea, which are common signs of the disease. There is currently no cure but there are many medicines to help treat its symptoms. 'She needs to be treated for her allergies first,' Dr Hoang said. He added that his treatment plan could restore between 50-70 percent of her skin to normal and laser therapy could reduce the folds. Dr Hoang said there should be more tests to verify his initial diagnosis and find any other diseases she might have.","completion":"A Vietnamese woman named Nguyen Thi Phuong claims to have undergone a drastic transformation within just a few days due to an extreme allergy to seafood. In 2008, Phuong, then 26, claims she developed a puffy face and sagging skin but could not afford treatment. In October 2011, doctors agreed to examine her free of charge. Phuong's husband maintains the story is true, and his love for his wife remains strong. Phuong believes her condition is the result of a lifelong allergy to seafood after suffering a severe reaction in 2008. She took medication from a local pharmacy instead of going to the hospital because they were too poor to afford it. After switching to traditional medicine, her hives and itching disappeared, but her skin began to sag and wrinkle, leading her to take more traditional medicine for her rapid-aging skin problem, with no success. Doctors suggest that long-term use of traditional medicines, which can contain corticoids, might have caused her condition, leading to the excessive production of mast cells in her body. Phuong and her husband were unable to recall the name of the medicine or the pharmacy from which they bought it. They decided to quit treatment in 2009, and Phuong always wore a face mask whenever she went out. However, the rapid-aging syndrome did not affect her menstrual cycle, hair, teeth, eyes, or mind. The cause of Phuong's condition remains uncertain, with some doctors suggesting lipodystrophy, a rare syndrome causing fatty tissue to disintegrate while the skin grows rapidly, or Cushing's Syndrome, which may occur due to high levels of cortisol in the blood. Medical treatment may restore some of her previous appearance, but further tests are needed to confirm the initial diagnosis and identify any other potential diseases."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Hong Kong (CNN) -- Signs of oil and gas have been found by a Chinese rig that was drilling off a disputed island chain in the South China Seas, according to Chinese state media. The drilling area does have the basic conditions and potential for oil exploration, Wang Zhen, deputy director of CNPC Policy Research Office, told Xinhua. The drilling operation, known as the Zhongjiannan Project, was completed on July 15, according to the China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The state-owned energy company will further analyze the collected geological data before announcing their next steps. When China dispatched the oil rig on May 2 to begin drilling near the Paracel Islands in the South China Seas, the move kicked off a series of confrontations between Chinese and Vietnamese vessels in the area. Both nations claim ownership over the chain China refers to as the Xisha islands. OPTIONS: - CNN continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - CNPC continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - CNPC Policy Research Office continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - China continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - China National Petroleum Corporation continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Chinese continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Hong Kong continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Paracel Islands continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - South China Seas continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Vietnam continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Vietnamese continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Wang Zhen continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Xinhua continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Xisha continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. - Zhongjiannan Project continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law.","completion":"- Vietnam continues to reject China's claims to the Paracels, calling recent drilling activities \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. The ongoing dispute in the South China Seas regarding the Paracel Islands has been a point of contention between China and Vietnam for years. Despite the recent discovery of oil and gas in the area by a Chinese drilling rig, Vietnam firmly opposes China's claims to the islands and has labeled the drilling activities as \\"illegal\\" and in violation of international law. The Vietnamese government asserts that the Paracel Islands fall within its Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) based on historical records and the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Vietnam has repeatedly urged China to respect international law and cease its provocative actions in the disputed waters, but these calls have been disregarded by the Chinese government. In response to China's aggressive actions and the subsequent confrontations between the two countries' vessels, the international community has raised concerns over the potential for escalation and has called for both nations to exercise restraint. Several countries, including the United States and Australia, have expressed support for a rules-based order in the South China Seas, emphasizing the need for all parties to respect international law and abide by the principles outlined in the UNCLOS. Moving forward, it is vital for both China and Vietnam to participate in diplomatic dialogues and negotiations to resolve the territorial dispute peacefully and to de-escalate tensions in the South China Seas. If left unaddressed, the situation could lead to further disputes and a potential risk of conflict between regional powers. In conclusion, despite the discovery of oil and gas by the Chinese drilling rig, Vietnam remains firm in its rejection of China's claims to the Paracel Islands. It is essential that international law be respected, and both nations engage in diplomatic efforts to resolve the dispute in a peaceful and constructive manner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The woman, referred to as \\"stupid\\" by the narrator, decided to prepay for the gas on the pump before she was actually at the pump. This situation caused confusion and resulted in the delay experienced by the narrator. The conventional procedure at most gas stations is for customers to arrive at the pump, refuel their vehicle, and then pay for the gasoline either at the store or through an automated service at the pump. Apparently, the woman in this instance did not adhere to this routine and disrupted the ordinary system of operations. In more detail, the woman parked her car, went inside the store to pay for the gas in advance, and then returned to her vehicle to get in line for the pump. Her actions created a situation where the narrator was unable to refuel their vehicle in a timely manner, given that another car was using a pump that was already paid for but not yet in use.

Answer: The British dealt with range measurement first, when it was realised that range was the key to producing a better fuse setting. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? OPTIONS: [+] yes; [+] no;","completion":"Answer: The fuse length could be set using height reported by specialized military personnel known as artillery observers or spotters. These individuals play a crucial role in the effective use of artillery in military operations. Their primary responsibility is to identify enemy targets and relay the information, including distance, elevation, and coordinates, to artillery units in real-time. Artillery observers work closely with several types of equipment and instruments to determine target distance and elevation accurately. Some of the gear and techniques they might use include: 1. Range finders: These devices use various methods such as laser, radar, or acoustic signals to measure the distance to the target. By emitting signals and measuring the time it takes for them to bounce back from the target, a highly accurate estimate of the range can be calculated. 2. Topographical maps: Observers use topographical maps, which illustrate the terrain and elevation of an area, to help determine the height and position of targets. This information is essential in calculating the necessary adjustments for artillery fire. 3. Binoculars and spotting scopes: These tools are used by observers to identify and track enemy movements visually. They can also assist in pinpointing specific targets and estimating their approximate distance and elevation. 4. GPS devices: Observers may employ GPS devices to determine their precise location and the coordinates of enemy targets. This information can be relayed to artillery units to help coordinate their fire. 5. Communication equipment: Secure radios and communication systems enable observers to relay the essential information, such as range, elevation, and coordinates, to artillery units to guarantee accurate targeting. In summary, the fuse length could be set using the height reported by artillery observers or spotters. These highly trained military personnel utilize a range of specialized equipment and techniques to provide critical data to artillery units to allow them to accurately target enemy forces."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Cubans will celebrate the historic pact with the U.S. This was the best Christmas gift ever for me, for hundreds of thousands of Cuban-Americans and for the 11 million Cubans on the island. I’m talking about the history-making announcement by President Obama of a sea change in U.S.-Cuba relations after more than 50 years of irrationality and hostility — something I had come to believe would not happen in my lifetime. “Incredible news I’ve waited my entire life to hear,” said Ralph Ortega, editor-in-chief of On Wall Street and a former Daily News reporter. “I wish my dad, who was Cuban, was here for this.” Yes, unexpectedly, it did happen. Not only is Alan Gross, the American who spent five years in a Cuban jail, reunited with his family on the first day of Chanukah, but three Cubans who for 15 years were imprisoned in the U.S. for spying are back in their country just in time for Christmas. As Milena Recio, an editor of the online publication Progreso Weekly, said from Havana, “It is good that the road to a re-encounter among both nations had begun with a humanitarian gesture.” The actions Obama announced Wednesday have profound implications for Cuba and Latin America. Even if only Congress can put an end to the shameful embargo, Obama and Raul Castro are opening a dialogue on everything else. The thousands of people of good will in Cuba and in the U.S. who worked hard for many years to see this day are feeling joy and accomplishment. “We did it,” said an elated Arturo López Levy, a professor in Denver who was born in Cuba. “It is everybody’s victory for peace and good relations and nobody’s defeat.” On the island ruled by the Castro brothers since 1959, University of Havana students are celebrating and there is excitement coupled with a sense of new possibilities. “It is one of the most exciting moments we have lived,” Recio said. In Miami, opinions are sharply split and emotions are at a boiling point. The Marco Rubios of this world are pulling their hair in panic, but most Cuban-Americans are hailing Obama’s move as brave and moral and fair. “At last there is a President with common sense in Washington,” said Vicente Dopico, a Miami-based Cuban-American artist. Yes, the best Christmas gift ever to Cubans and all people of good will is really happening.

News article: Bernard Madoff 'hid 9bn from prosecutors' If true, it could prove to be a significant development for Irving Picard, the court-appointed trustee charged with uncovering Madoff's secret assets, who is now likely to want to interview Madoff to find out where the money is. The fellow prisoner also claimed that Madoff told him that the only other person to know of the identities of the three is Frank DiPascali, his former right-hand man, though it is not clear whether he knew money had been passed to them. Mr DiPascali has pleaded guilty to 10 separate counts relating to the Madoff fraud and is currently working with federal prosecutors from jail to help them widen the case. Madoff allegedly told the inmate – who is not named by the paper – that he suspects Mr DiPascali may be using information relating to the secret 9bn as leverage to shorten his own sentence. He has yet to be sentenced. Mr DiPascali's lawyer declined to comment. The New York Post account also provides an insight into Madoff's alleged life behind bars, suggesting he sought the aid of a counsellor ahead of the release of Sheryl Weinstein's book last year, in which it was revealed he had had an affair with the former investor. \\"He was having problems with his wife [Ruth]\\" over the book's revelations, the inmate is reported to have said.

He is placed in the body of a 14-year-old boy named Makoto Kobayashi, who has just committed suicide by an overdose of pills. Watched over by a neutral spirit named Purapura in the form of a little boy, the soul must figure out what his greatest sin and mistake in his former life was before his six-month time limit in Makoto's body runs out. He also has a number of other lesser duties he must complete, such as understanding what led Makoto to commit suicide in the first place and learning how to enjoy his second chance at life. He finds Makoto did not like his family and he greatly dislikes them for the same reasons. He is contemptuous of his father who is an underdog at work, forced to work lots of unpaid overtime. Despite her efforts, he hates his mother who had an affair with a dance instructor, something his father seems to be oblivious of. His older brother Mitsuru has given up on him because he is too moody and has no friends at school or anywhere else. He discovers that a girl (Hiroka) he fancies sells sex to older men so she can have the clothes and things she wants. Shoko is a weird girl from Makoto's class who becomes suspicious of his unusual behavior so he tries to stay away from her. After he gets mugged and beaten up by some delinquents, Shoko comes to visit Makoto at his house, but he scares her off.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I can use this background: Some species of ants farm aphids, protecting them on the plants where they are feeding, and consuming the honeydew the aphids release from the terminations of their alimentary canals. This is a mutualistic relationship, with these dairying ants milking the aphids by stroking them with their antennae. Although mutualistic, the feeding behaviour of aphids is altered by ant attendance. Aphids attended by ants tend to increase the production of honeydew in smaller drops with a greater concentration of amino acids.Some farming ant species gather and store the aphid eggs in their nests over the winter. In the spring, the ants carry the newly hatched aphids back to the plants. Some species of dairying ants (such as the European yellow meadow ant, Lasius flavus) manage large herds of aphids that feed on roots of plants in the ant colony. Queens leaving to start a new colony take an aphid egg to found a new herd of underground aphids in the new colony. These farming ants protect the aphids by fighting off aphid predators. Now, I have a new situation: Hannah and Joe are two colleagues. They both study horticulture. They've been studying ants lately for their entomology class. Hannah studied ants that farm aphids, while Joe studied ants that farm fungus. Answer this question please: Which student learned less about ants that manage large herds of aphids ?

Write an article based on this summary: Dress professionally while still looking fit. Dress to show off that bod while you're out on the town. Maintain your image to complement your physique. A confident attitude may be the most subtle yet powerful way to show off your muscles.","completion":"Title: Striking a Balance: Dressing Professionally and Accentuating Your Physique Introduction: In today's fast-paced world, maintaining a healthy lifestyle is essential for both physical and mental well-being. Apart from the numerous health benefits, regular exercise does wonders for your body, and it only makes sense to show off your hard-earned physique. However, striking the perfect balance between dressing professionally and accentuating your body can be tricky. This article offers guidance on how to dress to impress while maintaining a professional image that complements your toned body. Step 1: Choose the Right Fit The first step in dressing professionally while showcasing your physique is selecting clothing that fits you well. Poorly fitting clothes can make even the most toned individual appear unkempt or unprofessional. Opt for tailored suits, fitted dress shirts, or sleek blouses that accentuate your body without being too tight or revealing. A well-fitted outfit will not only accentuate your toned figure, but it will also give you a confident aura while maintaining a professional appearance. Step 2: Incorporate Appropriate Colors and Patterns Colors and patterns can greatly enhance your attire and help show off your physical attributes. Dark shades, such as navy blue, black, or charcoal, provide a slimming effect and generally look more professional. These colors can be contrasted with lighter, more vibrant shades for a pop of visual interest. Vertical stripes can also create an elongating and slimming effect, drawing the eye to your toned physique. Step 3: Opt for High-Quality Fabrics Investing in high-quality fabrics will ensure that your clothing retains its form, feels comfortable on your body, and withstands washes and usage. High-quality fabrics can adapt to your body shape and look more polished, allowing your sculpted frame to stand out. Step 4: Choose the Right Accessories Accessories can enhance your overall look while adding a professional touch. Men can opt for leather belts, cufflinks, and ties, while women can choose tasteful jewelry and a flattering belt to subtly draw attention to their waistline. A high-quality timepiece, like a classic watch, can demonstrate your attention to detail and reflect a sense of sophistication and style without overtly drawing attention to your physique. Step 5: Confidence is Key Lastly, one should never overlook the importance of a confident attitude. A positive demeanor and self-assured body language can go a long way in enhancing your appearance and highlighting your fitness achievements. Stand tall, walk with purpose, and project a magnetic energy into every room you enter to showcase your muscles subtly yet powerfully. Conclusion: Dressing to accentuate your toned physique while maintaining a professional image is all about finding the perfect balance. By selecting clothing that fits well, incorporating appropriate colors and patterns, investing in high-quality fabrics, and accessorizing wisely, you can showcase your hard work without compromising your polished appearance. Most importantly, remember that a confident attitude completes the look, reflecting the strength and determination that went into crafting your impressive physique."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1947, Inspector Garvey of Scotland Yard suspects Michael Lanyard, the reformed jewel thief known as \\"The Lone Wolf\\" is behind the theft of the priceless diamonds called the \\"Eyes of the Nile\\". Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen. Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone.

As a result, your thermostat senses the lower temperature and sends a signal to the heating system to provide heat for your home. When the oil burner is engaged, heating oil travels from the tank to the burner by way of a pump. In this process, the oil becomes a fine mist mixed with air. This fuel/air mixture is crucial for the efficient and optimal operation of the heating system. Now, suppose less fine mist is mixed with air. This situation will lead to a less efficient fuel/air mixture, which in turn affects the combustion process within the heating system. Consequently, the flame produced in the combustion chamber may not be as strong and consistent as it should be. With a weaker flame, the heating system may not be able to provide sufficient heat to warm the room to the desired temperature as efficiently as it would with a proper fuel/air mixture. This means that the heating system may need to work harder to try to maintain the desired room temperature, which can lead to increased energy consumption and longer heating times. Furthermore, having less fine mist mixed with air could also potentially cause incomplete combustion, leading to the production of higher levels of undesirable emissions, such as carbon monoxide, smoke, and soot. In conclusion, the reduced efficiency of the fuel/air mixture in the heating system will lead to less heat output and could ultimately affect the overall performance of the heating system, making it more challenging to maintain a comfortable temperature in the room."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

With these factors in mind, the story unfolds in the following way: As the 2016 presidential campaign gains momentum, several strong Democratic contenders emerge, including Hillary Clinton, who eventually decides to run, believing she can bring a fresh perspective to the White House while building on the progress made during the Obama administration. Other Democratic candidates also join the race, highlighting their unique approaches to improving the country and connecting with diverse groups of Americans. The primary season is full of debates, rallies, and moments highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each candidate. In the end, Hillary Clinton emerges as the Democratic nominee due to her wealth of experience and ability to appeal to various demographics. In the general election campaign, Clinton faces a challenging Republican opponent who capitalizes on the desire for change and critiques of the Obama administration. The battle between the two candidates is intense and divisive, with each side working tirelessly to promote their vision for the country and discredit their opponent. After months of campaigning and increasingly hostile rhetoric, the election reaches its climax. The results are in, and despite a tightly contested race, Hillary Clinton becomes the President-Elect of the United States, making history as the first woman to hold the highest office in the land. Many Americans celebrate this historic achievement, while others remain concerned about the direction the country will take under her leadership. Throughout her presidency, Clinton works to achieve a balance between continuing the successful policies of the previous administration and implementing new initiatives to address ongoing challenges. Her tenure is marked by both successes and setbacks. Across the aisle, the Republican Party learns from this election cycle, making adjustments to its platform and strategy to better connect with voters and adapt to changing demographics. As Clinton's presidency comes to a close and the country prepares to elect the 46th President of the United States, a new group of candidates emerges, each with their views on how best to govern the nation. The cycle of campaigning, debating, and selecting a leader begins anew, a testament to the enduring promise of democracy and the power of the American people to shape their own future. In conclusion, the story ends with a historic election, a mixture of progress and ongoing challenges for the new administration, and a renewed determination from both major political parties to adapt and evolve in the ever-changing American landscape."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Recordings of angry bees are enough to send big, tough African elephants running away, a new study says. Beehives -either recorded or real-may even prevent elephants from damaging farmer's crops. In 2002, scientist Lucy King and her team found that elephants avoid certain trees with bees living in them. Today, Lucy wants to see if African honeybees might discourage elephants from eating crops. But before she asked farmer to go to the trouble of setting up beehives on their farms, she needed to find out if the bees would scare elephants away. Lucy found a wild beehive inside a tree in northern Kenya and set up a recorder. Then she threw a stone into the beehive, which burst into life. Lucy and her assistant hid in their car until the angry bees had calmed down. Next,Lucy searched out elephant families in Samburu National Reserve in northern Kenya and put a speaker in a close to each family. From a distance, Lucy switched on the pre-recorded sound of angry bees while at the same time recording the elephants with a video camera. Half the elephant groups left the area within ten seconds. Out of a total of 17 groups, only one group ignored the sound of the angry bees. Lucy reported that all the young elephants immediately ran to their mothers to hide under them. When Lucy Played the sound of a waterfall instead of the angry bees to many of the same elephant families, the animals were undisturbed. Even after four minutes, most of the groups stayed in one place. Lucy is now studying whether the elephants will continue to avoid the sound of angry bees after hearing it several times. She hasn't tested enough groups yet to know, but her initial results were promising enough to begin trials with farmers. She has now begun placing speakers in the fields to see if elephants are frightened away. Question: As mentioned in the passage, Lucy Answer: Options are: [A]. works by herself in Africa.

(CBC News) Courtepatte had been lured from the West Edmonton Mall, sexually assaulted and killed. Her battered body was found on a golf course west of Edmonton. In 2012, Michael Briscoe was found guilty of first-degree murder in relation to Courtepatte's death. This week, Prime Minister Stephen Harper dismissed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women. “We should not view this as a sociological phenomenon, we should view it as a crime,” Harper said. Atkinson told CBC News that she wasn't surprised by the prime minister’s response. “The government, they don’t care about us,” she said. “To the government, we are expendable. Why put money and resources into finding out how come we’re so expendable?” Melanie Omeniho, elected president of the Women of the Métis Nation, has long been advocating for this type of inquiry. “The truth is there is a [social] process that has to be acknowledged as to why people think it’s acceptable that they’re aboriginal women and they’re just kids that have gone missing or young women that have gone missing and that they don’t matter to society,” Omeniho said. While any inquiry would be too late for Courtepatte, Fontaine and other victims of crime, Atkinson hopes there will be a national inquiry soon so other mothers of aboriginal girls across the country won’t have to grieve their daughters as she does.

Among those calling for the inquiry is Peacha Atkinson, the mother of Nina Courtepatte, a 13-year-old aboriginal girl who went missing and was found murdered in 2005. Atkinson, along with family members and friends, gathered at Hawrelak Park in Edmonton for mutual support as they felt reminded of their own losses due to the recent news of Fontaine's death. The article highlights that Prime Minister Stephen Harper dismissed calls for a national inquiry into missing and murdered aboriginal women that same week, stating that it should be viewed as a crime rather than a sociological phenomenon. Atkinson expressed her disappointment and accused the government of not caring about aboriginal people. Melanie Omeniho, the elected president of the Women of the Métis Nation, also advocates for the national inquiry, arguing that the underlying social processes that contribute to the marginalization and vulnerability of aboriginal women and girls must be acknowledged.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Paragraph: Barb and Jill practiced small scale farming. Jill farmed the conventional way, while barb used the no-tillage method. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which farmer had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates? The answer is:","completion":"Barb, who practiced the no-tillage method, had soil which may delay planting to less ideal dates. This is because, in places with rigorous winters, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, potentially leading to planting later than ideal dates."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Answer a question about this article: In 1820-1830’s the Ottoman Empire endured a number of strikes which challenged the existence of the country. The Greek Uprising (began in the spring of 1821) evidenced internal and military weakness of Ottoman Empire and caused severe atrocities by Ottoman military forces (see Chios massacre). The disbandment of the centuries-old Janissary corps by Sultan Mahmud II on 15 June 1826 (Auspicious Incident) was a good deed for the country in the longer term, but it has deprived the country from its army forces for the nearest future. In 1827 the allied Anglo-Franco-Russian fleet destroyed almost all the Ottoman naval forces during the Battle of Navarino. In 1830 Greece becomes an independent state after 10 years of independence war and the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–1829. According to the Treaty of Adrianople (1829) Russian and European commercial ships were authorized to freely pass through Black Sea straits, Serbia received autonomy, and Danubian Principalities (Moldavia and Walachia) became the territories under Russian protection.

It tells the story of Eric \`\` The Kid '' Stoner , a young Depression - era poker player , as he seeks to establish his reputation as the best . This quest leads him to challenge Lancey \`\` The Man '' Howard , an older player widely considered to be the best , culminating in a climactic final poker hand between the two . The script , adapted from Richard Jessup 's novel , was written by Ring Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern ; it was Lardner 's first major studio work since his 1947 blacklisting as one of The Hollywood Ten . The film was directed by Norman Jewison and stars Steve McQueen in the title role and Edward G. Robinson as Howard . Jewison , who replaced original director Sam Peckinpah shortly after filming began , describes The Cincinnati Kid as his \`\` ugly duckling '' film . He considers it the film that allowed him to transition from the lighter comedic films he had previously been making and take on more serious films and subjects . The film garnered mixed reviews from critics on its initial release ; supporting actors Robinson and Joan Blondell earned award nominations for their performances . - A card game is any game using playing cards as the primary device with which the game is played, be they traditional or game-specific. Countless card games exist, including families of related games (such as poker). A small number of card games played with traditional decks have formally standardized rules, but most are folk games whose rules vary by region, culture, and person. - Poker is a family of gambling card games, but is often considered a skill based game. All poker variants involve betting as an intrinsic part of play, and determine the winner of each hand according to the combinations of players' cards, at least some of which remain hidden until the end of the hand. Poker games vary in the number of cards dealt, the number of shared or \\"community\\" cards, the number of cards that remain hidden, and the betting procedures. - Gambling is the wagering of money or something of value (referred to as \\"the stakes\\") on an event with an uncertain outcome with the primary intent of winning money and/or material goods. Gambling thus requires three elements be present: consideration, chance and prize. The outcome of the wager is often immediate, such as a single roll of dice, a spin of a roulette wheel, or a horse crossing the finish line, but longer time frames are also common, allowing wagers on the outcome of a future sports contest or even an entire sports season.

A large antelope, the hartebeest stands just over 1 m (3.3 ft) at the shoulder, and has a typical head-and-body length of 200 to 250 cm (79 to 98 in). The weight ranges from 100 to 200 kg (220 to 440 lb). It has a particularly elongated forehead and oddly shaped horns, short neck, and pointed ears. Its legs, which often have black markings, are unusually long. The coat is generally short and shiny. Coat colour varies by the subspecies, from the sandy brown of the western hartebeest to the chocolate brown of the Swayne's hartebeest. Both sexes of all subspecies have horns, with those of females being more slender. Horns can reach lengths of 45–70 cm (18–28 in). Apart from its long face, the large chest and the sharply sloping back differentiate the hartebeest from other antelopes. Gregarious animals, hartebeest form herds of 20 to 300 individuals. They are very alert and non-aggressive. They are primarily grazers, with their diets consisting mainly of grasses. Mating in hartebeest takes place throughout the year with one or two peaks, and depends upon the subspecies and local factors. Both males and females reach sexual maturity at one to two years of age. Gestation is eight to nine months long, after which a single calf is born. Births usually peak in the dry season. The lifespan is 12 to 15 years. answer the following question: What is the scientific name of the kongoni?

Depending on the size of your collection, you can opt for simple plastic drawer sets that only have a few drawers to more elaborate cabinets with many drawers that are usually used to hold crafting or hardware supplies. As with the plastic bins, storage cabinets that feature clear drawers are the best option because you can easily see what LEGO pieces are inside. Look for drawer systems that provide different size drawers, so you can easily organize your collection based on the size of the pieces. In order to maximize your space, it may make sense to store multiple types of LEGO bricks and pieces in a single drawer. To prevent them from becoming mixed up, it helps to have a drawer organizer with different compartments, so you can separate the pieces based on your chosen sorting system. Drawer organizers are available at office and home supply stores. They come in a variety of sizes, and some are even customizable, so you can create the ideal storage for your LEGOs. Even if your storage cabinet has drawers made of clear plastic, it’s a good idea to label them with the contents, so you don’t have to go searching for a certain piece in the middle of a build. For the most organized collection, be as specific as possible when creating the labels.

The Caribbean nation is one of the world's least connected countries, and only between 5% to 25% of Cubans have any type of internet service. Cuba's state telecom agency Etecsa said the pilot project would allow residents in the historic district of Old Havana to order broadband through fibre-optic connections operated by the Chinese telecom firm Huawei. No timeline or prices have been announced. Some Cuban citizens have dial-up home services or restricted mobile phone connections that allow access only to state-run email, The Associated Press news agency said. The public can access the internet in public wi-fi spots in Cuba, which opened last year. But many have complained about the cost of the connection: 2 (Â£1.4) an hour, or about a 10th of the average monthly salary. There are 58 wireless internet points in Cuba, 17 of them in Havana. Around 150,000 Cubans used those spots daily in 2015, according to Etecsa data.

Breathing polluted air increases the risk of developing lung diseases such as asthma and lung cancer. Breathing bad air also increases the chances of dying from other diseases. Children are most likely to be affected by air pollution. That’s because their lungs are still developing and growing. Children also take in more air for their size than adults do. Some air pollutants damage the environment as well as the health of living things. The type of damage depends on the pollutant. Air pollution can also harm the environment. Daniel visited two countries. Switzerland and India. There was almost no air pollution at all in Switzerland, while the air in India was almost impossible to breathe it was so polluted. Which country had fewer people develop lung cancer? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided about air pollution and its links to lung diseases such as lung cancer, it is likely that Switzerland, with almost no air pollution, had fewer people develop lung cancer as compared to India, where the air was extremely polluted. Air pollution exposes people to various harmful chemicals and particulate matter that can cause inflammation and harmful effects on the respiratory system. When people breathe in these polluted particles, they can damage the lungs and increase the risk of developing lung cancer. In India, with a high level of air pollution, the population is at an increased risk of developing such diseases due to continuous exposure to pollutants. Switzerland, on the other hand, has stringent regulations and practices to control air pollution, resulting in cleaner air for its residents. This clean air significantly reduces the chances of developing lung cancer as people are not inhaling harmful pollutants. Therefore, the rate of lung cancer in Switzerland is expected to be lower than that in India. It is essential to note that various other factors can contribute to lung cancer, such as genetics, lifestyle habits like smoking, and occupational exposures. Although air pollution is a significant contributor, it is vital to consider these other contributing factors when evaluating lung cancer rates in different countries. However, based on the air pollution levels in Switzerland and India, it is reasonable to conclude that Switzerland had fewer people develop lung cancer due to its comparatively cleaner air."},{"prompt":"Assagao - Assagao (pronounced [aːsɡãːw]) is a village in Bardez Goa located about 4 kilometres west of Mapusa.

How would you describe the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is overwhelmingly negative. The reviewer expresses strong dissatisfaction and disappointment with various aspects of the film, such as the script, dialogue, and acting. The use of words like \\"pretentious,\\" \\"lame,\\" \\"embarrassing,\\" \\"disaster,\\" and \\"cringe\\" emphasizes the intensity of their negative emotions. Furthermore, the reviewer mentions the audience's negative reactions, such as walking out, booing, and expressing scorn, indicating that the sentiment is not only their own but also shared by others. The mention of relatives of one of the main actors feeling sheepish drives home the point that even those with a personal connection to the film couldn't feel positive about it. The reviewer concludes by stating that the film has no redeeming features and assigns the lowest possible rating due to the lack of an option for zero. The proposed \\"shameometer\\" suggests that the reviewer believes all individuals involved in the film should feel a sense of shame for their participation in such a poorly executed project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the question: Process: - Air is pulled into the lungs - Oxygen moves from the lungs into the bloodstream - Air is pushed through the vocal chords - A person talks - Other air is pushed out of the lungs into the environment. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose a person is using less energy happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the supposed perturbation of a person using less energy, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, could have both direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration and vocalization. Direct Effects: 1. Reduced oxygen consumption: When a person is using less energy, their body's metabolic rate might decline, leading to reduced oxygen consumption. In this case, the amount of oxygen moving from the lungs into the bloodstream could be affected as there will be less demand for oxygen by various organs, tissues, and cells in the body. 2. Altered respiration rate: With less energy being used, the need for oxygen and the production of carbon dioxide will be decreased. This can lead to a decrease in the respiratory rate as the body tries to maintain the appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels, which in turn would lead to a smaller amount of air being pulled into the lungs and less oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream. Indirect Effects: 1. Impact on vocalization: Since the act of speaking involves the coordination of various muscles and movements, a person using less energy might experience changes in their vocalization abilities. Reduced energy expenditure could lead to weaker or less forceful vocalizations, which might result in changes in the pitch, tone, or volume of their voice. 2. Reduced physical activity: With less overall energy, a person might experience a decline in their physical activity levels. This could potentially limit the degree to which their respiratory and cardiovascular systems are challenged, leading to a reduction in the efficiency of oxygen delivery to the bloodstream and ultimately affecting their ability to complete physical tasks or engage in long conversations without becoming fatigued. 3. Impact on cognitive function: It's important to recognize that oxygen plays a crucial role in maintaining healthy cognitive function. With less oxygen being delivered to the brain due to reduced energy expenditure, it could indirectly affect a person's cognitive abilities, including their capacity for effective communication and speech. In conclusion, a person using less energy, leading to a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, can indeed have direct and indirect effects on the process of respiration and vocalization. The body's ability to maintain an appropriate balance of oxygen and carbon dioxide levels and the effect on vocalization, physical activity, and cognitive function are some of the factors that could be impacted by this perturbation. However, it is important to note that these effects may vary depending on the individual and the extent to which energy expenditure is reduced."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Make this proper case","completion":"The Natura 2000 network is a vast array of protected sites that span across Europe and its surrounding regions, representing the largest network of such areas in the world. Established through the European Union's Habitats Directive and Birds Directive, this extensive network aims to safeguard Europe's rich biodiversity and preserve the habitats and species most at risk. Comprised of approximately 26,000 protected sites, Natura 2000 covers almost 18% of Europe's total land area and significant portions of its marine territory. The network is home to a wide range of habitats and species, from pristine forests and wetlands to rugged coastlines and scenic landscapes, which collectively support more than 200 habitat types and 1,000 species listed under the EU directives. The primary purpose of Natura 2000 is to ensure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable and threatened species and habitats, taking into account both socio-economic considerations and ecological needs. This is achieved through the establishment of Special Areas of Conservation (SACs) and Special Protection Areas (SPAs), designated under the Habitats and Birds Directives respectively. Together, these sites form a coherent ecological network that allows for the protection and conservation of both terrestrial and marine habitats. To maintain and enhance the network, EU Member States are responsible for establishing the necessary conservation measures within each Natura 2000 site. These measures may include the creation of management plans, implementation of restoration projects, or the promotion of sustainable land-use practices. Furthermore, Member States are required to report on the progress and effectiveness of these conservation measures regularly, ensuring that the network continues to achieve its objectives. Natura 2000 plays a crucial role in preserving Europe's unique natural heritage for future generations. Through its extensive network of protected areas, it not only contributes to the achievement of global biodiversity targets but also serves as a vital resource for local communities, businesses, and governments. Natura 2000 sites provide many socio-economic benefits, such as supporting tourism and recreation, offering a source of clean water and air, and providing natural flood protection. In conclusion, the Natura 2000 network is the world's largest collection of protected areas, comprising a wide range of habitats and species that contribute to Europe's rich biodiversity. Established through the European Union's Habitats and Birds Directives, the network aims to preserve and enhance the continent's most valuable and threatened habitats and species. By fostering cooperation between Member States and stakeholders, Natura 2000 not only safeguards Europe's natural heritage but also supports vital socio-economic functions for the benefit of both human populations and the environment."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Although the wording differs slightly in each statement, the core idea remains consistent. In the first statement, \\"Man riding a bicycle on a foggy day,\\" the focus is on a specific time of day when the event occurs. However, this detail does not conflict with or negate the second statement. The second statement, \\"A man riding his bike through fog,\\" emphasizes the action of riding through fog, but it does not specify a time of day. Importantly though, this lack of specificity does not directly contradict the first statement, indicating that the core idea is still the same.

The narrator purchased a pair of Ance Max Raw jeans in size 34x32 from Barneys. This indicates that they show an interest in fashion or at least in purchasing jeans from a specific brand and store. 2. The narrator has not worn the jeans outside of their house. This could imply that they are concerned about the condition of the clothing they wear and are cautious about when and where they wear certain items, or that the jeans did not fit well enough to be worn in public. 3. They cold soaked the jeans after purchasing them. Cold soaking is a method of washing jeans without the use of detergent and is typically done with raw denim to avoid fading, shrinking, or damaging the material. This suggests that the narrator is knowledgeable about denim care and maintenance. 4. The jeans are too slim for the narrator's liking, indicating that their personal preference for jeans is more on the looser or more comfortable side. It could also be a sizing issue where the jeans do not fit properly, and the narrator prefers a different fit. 5. The narrator is willing to sell the jeans for 65, suggesting that they are open to negotiation and aware of the value of the clothing they own. They may also be motivated by the need or desire to recoup some of the money spent on the jeans since they do not fit well.

Water plays a significant role in landscape transformation, and understanding the sequence of events as the water interacts with land features is essential to comprehend the overall process. 1. Water flow initiation: The process starts with the formation or existence of a water source in the area, which may be a stream or river flowing over the land surface or frequent rainfall in the area. The water flow carries various elements like sediments, minerals, and rocks that contribute to the erosion process. 2. Surface erosion: As the water flows over the land, it begins to remove and carry away loose particles of soil, rocks, and vegetation, known as surface erosion. The removal of these materials leads to a loss of support for underlying materials, making the land more vulnerable to further erosion. 3. Channel formation: Over time, water continues to flow along the same path, and this repeated movement gradually forms a channel. The channel's depth and width depend on factors such as the volume and velocity of the water, soil composition, and the presence of vegetation. 4. Downcutting: With an established channel, the water flow becomes more focused on specific points, where it has more energy to cut into the underlying soil, rocks, and bedrock. This downward erosion, called downcutting, allows the stream to create a deeper and narrower gash in the landscape. 5. Lateral erosion: While downcutting continues, the stream also erodes the sides of the channel, expanding its width. This process, known as lateral erosion, changes the shape of the landscape around the stream as it removes earth materials from the banks and deposits them downstream, forming more gently sloping valley sides. 6. Mature stage: Over many years, the stream will continue to erode the landscape, creating a deep, V-shaped valley that will ultimately evolve into a ravine. However, this process may take a very long time, depending on factors such as the water flow, bedrock composition, and climate conditions of the area. 7. River drying up: Eventually, the river or stream may experience reductions in water flow, possibly due to changes in climate, geological shifts, or human intervention. If the water source dries up completely, the erosion process ceases, leaving a dry ravine in its place. In summary, the first step in the process of forming a ravine through erosion is the initiation of water flow, which can be attributed to a river, stream or consistent rainfall in the area. This water flow brings about surface erosion, leading to a series of events including channel formation, downcutting, lateral erosion, the mature stage, and finally, if the water source dries up, a dry ravine remains."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In a cold, wet field two hours' drive west of London, there's no mistaking the huddle of ancient shapes that emerge suddenly on the horizon, back-dropped by a distant cluster of leafless trees. Until recently, any first encounter with Stonehenge, that legendary keeper of Neolithic secrets, could prove deeply underwhelming. Two traffic-snarled highways have encroached on the brooding rocks, robbing them of their scale. Now that's changing. The site's custodians have unveiled a 44 million visitor center and a radical remodeling of the landscape that will reconnect the circle with the atmospheric terrain it has occupied for more than 4,000 years. CNN was among the first visitors through its doors -- and to experience a redesigned approach to the UNESCO World Heritage Site that its guardians hope will restore some of its once-formidable presence. Visitors are no longer directed to a cramped parking lot slapped hastily on top of historically significant earthworks. The parking lot and a roadway, which for decades has severed the stone circle from an ancient avenue, are being torn up and grassed over. Instead they arrive at the new center, an elegant modern pavilion of glass and weathered sweet chestnut wood that now forms the gateway to the enigmatic millennium-old monument -- helping to create a sense of anticipation and drama. Contrast vital. \\"One key thing has been to make it as different from the stones as possible,\\" Stephen Quinlan, one of the center's architects, told CNN. The building's undulating roof and matchstick steel pillars blend in with the area's rolling hills and sparse woodland, he said. The center officially opens on December 18, three days before the winter solstice, when druids, pagans and revelers gather to watch the sun rise in perfect alignment with the stones -- a celestial event that both explains their purpose and deepens their mystery. These time-honored traditions show how cherished Stonehenge is, not only to the people who assign it spiritual importance, but also to the archaeologists who study its origins. Not to mention the 1 million tourists who traipse here each year. It's no wonder the government bodies guarding the site have been cautious about remodeling -- enduring 30 years of wrangling over budgets, designs and locations before creating the new center. Worthwhile wait. For some, however, the wait has been worth it. \\"I think it's fabulous,\\" Mark Horton, a professor of history at Bristol University, told CNN at the center's opening. \\"It's one of the most important archaeological monuments in western Europe and has been for so long woefully neglected.\\" In one way the delays had been an advantage, he said. \\"If it was here 10 years ago, it would look out of date because we now have completely new interpretations of how and why and when Stonehenge was built.\\" Stonehenge isn't visible from the center, lying over the crest of a hill -- so visitors spend time exploring its new exhibition space before walking or catching a road train to cover the mile and a half to the stone circle. The exhibition's centerpiece is a 360-degree virtual display that tries to simulate the experience of standing within the stone circle -- something most visitors have been banned from doing since the late 1970s in order to protect the rocks. It uses laser-scanned images to zap the viewer back through history amid dramatic solstice sunrises and sunsets. For anyone who has waited in vain for a dawn obscured by the miserable British weather, this could actually be an improvement. Neolithic head reconstructed. Among 250 other antiquities, the exhibition also includes the reconstructed head of a 5,500-year-old Neolithic man found nearby. Archaeologists have used advanced 3D scanning technology on his skull to reveal his face. While this undoubtedly offers a valuable glimpse into the human story behind Stonehenge, there's no escaping the fact that the result of all that hi-tech labor bears an uncanny resemblance to Jeff Bridges in \\"The Big Lebowski.\\" The Neolithic man's skeleton is also on display, a fact that has stirred some controversy. The leader of Britain's self-proclaimed largest order of druids says the use of the bones is disrespectful to their long-dead owner. \\"Those who've been laid to rest should stay at rest -- it's not a pagan issue, it's one of common decency,\\" King Arthur Pendragon, who describes himself as the Battle Chieftain of the Council of British Druid Orders, told CNN. While it brings visitors face to face with the monument's history, what the new center cannot do is shed definitive light on how and why Stonehenge was constructed using stones quarried 150 miles away in the Preseli mountains of Wales. There have been numerous theories about their construction and purpose, ranging from outlandish claims about UFOs or mythical stories of giants and wizards to explanations concerning druidic rituals or astronomical observatories. Solstice ceremonies. The 2009 announcement that another stone circle -- Bluestonehenge -- had been discovered adjacent by the nearby River Avon has lent support to another theory: that Stonehenge was a temple forming part of a larger funeral and burial complex that only later became a place for solstice ceremonies. Back in the 21st century, with much of the remodeling yet to be completed, it's still a work in progress. Although the road train's slower approach to the stones does help build the atmosphere, the old parking lot and the remaining busy highway still blot the landscape. There are times, however, walking the circuit around Stonehenge, when the traffic, the noise and the fellow visitors taking iPhone selfies suddenly melt away. In these fleeting moments there's a sense of the power these simple rocks have conveyed to so many. But while the site's guardians hope their innovations will help visitors to connect better to the surrounding ancient landscape, for some there will always be one crucial element missing. \\"The only thing that struck me is you can't go up and touch it,\\" said fourth-time visitor Keith Foskett, of West Sussex, England. \\"I think that's a real shame. English Heritage might own it, but it really belongs to the people. You should be allowed to go up and hug the stones.\\" Stonehenge, near Salisbury, England. +44 87 0333 1181.

However, behind the glitz and glitter lies a disappointingly shallow interpretation of a story that should have delivered profound depth and meaning. The plot feels rushed and fails to capture the intricacies of Fitzgerald's writing. Moreover, the characters lack the development necessary to evoke genuine empathy from the audience. The acting is uneven, with some performances bordering on caricature. The movie's pacing is erratic, leaving viewers struggling to keep up with its storyline, while the direction often makes it difficult to discern what the film is trying to convey.

The film's stunning visual effects and elaborate set design create an immersive atmosphere that is exhilarating to the senses. The fast-paced and high-energy storytelling make for an exciting and engaging viewing experience. The cast, led by Leonardo DiCaprio and Tobey Maguire, effectively captures the spirit of their respective characters and contributes to the overall luster of the film. Although some might argue that this adaptation lacks depth, it nonetheless delivers an entertaining spectacle that would appeal to a broad audience. In conclusion, The Great Gatsby stands out as a dazzling visual extravaganza and provides a thrilling glimpse into the world of 1920s excess. I highly recommend this film to fans of Baz Luhrmann's directorial style, and those looking for a visually stunning movie experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Hundreds of people descended on Presley as he stepped from the bus; photographers then accompanied him into the fort. Presley announced that he was looking forward to his military stint, saying that he did not want to be treated any differently from anyone else: \\"The Army can do anything it wants with me.\\"Presley commenced basic training at Fort Hood, Texas. During a two-week leave in early June, he recorded five songs in Nashville. In early August, his mother was diagnosed with hepatitis, and her condition rapidly worsened. Presley, granted emergency leave to visit her, arrived in Memphis on August 12. Two days later, she died of heart failure, aged 46. Presley was devastated; their relationship had remained extremely close—even into his adulthood, they would use baby talk with each other and Presley would address her with pet names.After training, Presley joined the 3rd Armored Division in Friedberg, Germany, on October 1. While on maneuvers, Presley was introduced to amphetamines by a sergeant. He became \\"practically evangelical about their benefits\\", not only for energy but for \\"strength\\" and weight loss as well, and many of his friends in the outfit joined him in indulging.

Fact 1: Lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds. Fact 2: Lake trout season opens in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, excluding the refuges. Given the two facts above, trout are found in places generally bigger and deeper than what? Answer:","completion":"Given the two facts above, trout are found in places generally bigger and deeper than ponds. To provide a detailed explanation, we can analyze both facts and the habitats of lake trout. Fact 1 states that lakes are generally bigger and deeper than ponds. This is a significant distinction because the size and depth of a body of water can influence its temperature, oxygen levels, and overall ecosystem. Lakes, due to their size, often have varying temperature zones within them. They can have deep, cold waters that typically retain a consistent, low temperature, as opposed to shallow areas that can warm more easily. Ponds, on the other hand, have less water volume and are shallower, leading to more uniform temperatures and oxygen levels throughout the pond. Fact 2 specifically mentions that lake trout season opens in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, which are both part of the Great Lakes system in North America. This information indicates that lake trout inhabit these large lakes, which are significantly larger and deeper than ponds. Lake trout (Salvelinus namaycush) are a species of char, closely related to other cold-water fish such as brook trout and Arctic char. They are native to North America and are found primarily in large, deep, cold lakes. The preferred habitat for lake trout consists of deep waters with a temperature range of around 40°F to 52°F (4°C to 11°C). These cold, well-oxygenated conditions are ideal for lake trout, enabling them to thrive and grow to significant sizes. Given that lakes provide the necessary conditions of size, depth, and low temperatures, it is evident that lake trout are better adapted to thriving in lakes than in ponds, which tend to lack the extensive depth and size found in lakes. Furthermore, larger lakes, like Lake Huron and Lake Michigan, are part of complex ecosystems that can support more diverse and stable populations, providing ample food sources and suitable habitats for lake trout. On the other hand, ponds may not be able to offer the same optimal living conditions for lake trout due to their smaller size and limited depth. Therefore, based on the provided facts and additional information on lake trout habitats, these fish are predominantly found in places generally bigger and deeper than ponds."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Jennifer really got on Victoria's nerves, because","completion":"Jennifer had acquired a particularly condescending manner when dealing with Victoria. She always seemed to find ways to belittle Victoria's accomplishments and constantly reminded her where she fell short. With each passing day, it appeared as though Jennifer made it her personal mission to undermine Victoria's confidence. To make matters worse, Jennifer exhibited a knack for ingratiating herself with their mutual friends and colleagues, leaving Victoria feeling isolated and alienated from her own social circle. This had been going on for months, and Victoria was at her wit's end trying to salvage her self-esteem and make sense of why Jennifer was so hell-bent on eroding her spirit. One prominent issue was Jennifer's incessant need to engage in one-upmanship. If Victoria achieved something she was proud of, Jennifer would counter with an even greater accomplishment of her own, never failing to point out how insignificant Victoria's achievements were in comparison. For instance, when Victoria earned a promotion at work, Jennifer \\"congratulated\\" her through a text message, casually mentioning that she had received two promotions in the past year, making it painfully clear that Victoria's success paled in comparison to her own. Another trait that irked Victoria was Jennifer's habitual interruption of conversations. Whenever Victoria tried to share her thoughts or feelings, Jennifer would dive in without allowing her to finish a sentence, giving little validation to Victoria's input. This constant disregard for Victoria's perspective exacerbated the already strained relationship and fueled Victoria's frustration with Jennifer's egocentric persona. Jennifer was also notorious for her thinly veiled, passive-aggressive comments. She delivered these remarks, known as 'backhanded compliments,' with a condescending smile that made Victoria's blood boil. Despite this infuriating behavior, Victoria constantly found herself second-guessing her own interpretation of Jennifer's intentions, questioning whether Jennifer truly meant any harm or if perhaps Victoria was just overreacting. One unforgettable incident was when Victoria excitedly shared her designs for an upcoming project at their weekly work meeting. Jennifer smiled sweetly and said, \\"That's such an interesting concept, Victoria. I wouldn't have thought to do it that way—simple yet kinda quirky.\\" It was clear to everyone but Victoria that Jennifer was undermining her ideas in front of their colleagues, masking her subtle jab as a compliment. As time went on, Victoria found herself growing increasingly tired and disheartened by Jennifer's antics. While she attempted to confide in her friends about her feelings, Jennifer had already cemented herself as the group favorite, making it difficult for others to sympathize with Victoria's plight. Furthermore, Jennifer’s charm made it almost impossible for others to recognize her snide comments or dismissive behavior for what they truly were: manipulative power plays. In order to regain her peace of mind and self-confidence, Victoria made a conscious effort to build a support system outside of her shared social circle with Jennifer. She sought out new friendships, hobbies, and interests that were separate from Jennifer's life. By doing so, she began to rediscover her sense of self-worth, which empowered her to confront Jennifer and gradually limit her presence in her life. Ultimately, Victoria realized that she had the power to rise above Jennifer's pettiness and negativity, allowing her to cultivate relationships built on mutual respect and understanding. This newfound strength and perspective served as a reminder that she deserved more than to be surrounded by those who sought to belittle and undermine her."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

One day, while commuting on his scooter, he catches a glimpse of Gomathi, a beautiful and charming classical dancer performing on the streets during a local festival. Sundharam is instantly captivated and feels a deep connection with her grace and fluidity. He later discovers that Gomathi is the daughter of a renowned dance teacher who lives nearby. From this moment, the lives of Sundharam and Gomathi unfold and intertwine. Sundharam finds himself drawn to Gomathi's beauty, talent, and kindness, frequently attending her performances and cheering for her from the audience. Gomathi, intrigued by Sundharam's sincerity and humility, starts to take notice of the constant support and warmth he offers her, gradually developing feelings for him as well. Their friendship blossoms over time, and they share their love for music, art, and culture with one another. As their bond deepens, Gomathi teaches Sundharam some classical dance moves, and in return, he shows Gomathi his father's silk saree shop, where they develop a profound connection over the intricacies of the traditional fabric designs. However, their growing love faces a series of challenges. Gomathi's parents strongly disapprove of the relationship, as they believe that Sundharam's modest background and lack of artistic talent make him an unsuitable match for their daughter. On the other hand, Sundharam deals with pressure from his family - especially his father, who wishes to see his son marry a girl of their choice and continue the family's saree business. Sundharam's love for Gomathi transcends all boundaries, and he decides to prove his worth. Determined to win over her parents, Sundharam takes lessons to learn the classical dance. As his skills develop, he showcases his newfound talent at a dance competition held by Gomathi's prestigious dance academy. Gomathi admires Sundharam's determination and passion for not just her, but also for her culture and art form, which strengthens the love between the couple even more. Simultaneously, Gomathi decides to stand up to her parents and assert her love for Sundharam. She visits his family's silk saree shop and learns in-depth about the art of weaving sarees, gaining an appreciation for the skill and commitment it takes. Gomathi then applies her artistic talent by designing a beautiful and unique classical dance costume using Sundharam's family sarees. Together, Sundharam and Gomathi prove to their respective families that love knows no boundaries, and that art and tradition can thrive and blend when joining hearts that are truly meant for each other. Impressed by Sundharam's resolve and Gomathi's immense talent blossoming in the light of their love, both families come to appreciate and accept their relationship. The movie ends with a celebration of their union - a traditional South Indian wedding ceremony filled with love, happiness, and colorful sarees, where Gomathi performs a mesmerizing classical dance routine in her saree-inspired costume, while Sundharam joins her in the dance, showcasing not just their love for each other but for their cultures and traditions as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In each sentence, the word \\"resistance\\" takes on different connotations relative to the context in which it is used. To better understand, let us break down the meaning of \\"resistance\\" in both cases. In the first sentence, \\"He encountered a general feeling of resistance from many citizens,\\" the term \\"resistance\\" refers to the opposition or reluctance of people to accept, agree with, or follow a particular idea, course of action, or change. The citizens in this context may object to a proposed policy, decision, or adjustment, demonstrating their disapproval or disagreement. This kind of resistance can manifest in various forms, including protests, strikes, or vocal dissatisfaction. In the second sentence, \\"These trees are widely planted because of their resistance to salt and smog,\\" the term \\"resistance\\" signifies resilience or the ability to withstand and not be negatively affected by specific environmental factors or conditions. In this case, the trees possess a natural capacity to tolerate high levels of salt and smog exposure, allowing them to thrive in such environments where other species may fail to do so. The concept of resistance in this context is primarily tied to the trees' biological and ecological characteristics. In conclusion, the word \\"resistance\\" carries distinct meanings in the sentences provided. In the first instance, it pertains to opposition against a particular idea, change, or course of action expressed by citizens. Conversely, it refers to the ability of trees to withstand harsh environmental factors such as salt and smog in the second sentence.

Police, Ferentz probe incident at bar By MEGAN MANFULL and TOM WITOSKY Register Staff Writer 09/28/2001 Iowa City, Ia. - A criminal investigation is under way into an alleged assault that involves at least one member of the Iowa football team. Tom Widmer, an Iowa City police captain, said Wednesday that the investigation began early Sunday morning after police responded to a call from a bar named Etc. The tavern is located in the downtown Iowa City pedestrian mall. \\"It is an active investigation,\\" Widmer said. Widmer said police received the call about 2:30 a.m. Sunday. He declined to identify any suspects. Ryan Rooney, a manager at Etc., said at least one assailant was a member of the Iowa football team. He would not identify the player or say if more than one player was involved. Rooney said one of his bartenders sustained a concussion from the assault and required medical attention. \\"It was more of a jumping than a fight,\\" he said. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz said Thursday morning he was looking into the matter. He said he was told of the incident Wednesday evening. \\"I'm fuzzy on the details right now,\\" Ferentz said. \\"A player told a coach about something that took place, and then they told me. I'm going to look into what happened and get more details about it. \\"I want to find out if anything did happen . . . then I will see if any action needs to be taken on the team.\\" Iowa's season already has been marred by one violent assault. Offensive lineman Sam Aiello attacked quarterback Jon Beutjer in July, although the incident did not become public until the first week of the season. Beutjer said he received a concussion, although he did not file a report with police. He later left Iowa and enrolled at Illinois, saying he felt betrayed by the school's handling of the incident. Ferentz said he had not been contacted by police about the incident at Etc. A report obtained from police says two people were injured at Etc. Rooney said the second victim, a woman, was \\"shaken up pretty bad.\\" Kevin Prestegard, the investigating officer, confirmed Thursday the probe was continuing, but refused further comment. \\"It all depends on the police and how diligently they will pursue this,\\" Rooney said. \\"They have a lengthy amount of time before they have to do something.

(Rating: 21 by The Film Snob.) (See our blog What-To-See-Next for details on our rating system.) Here's a movie that will have you clawing at your own face in an attempt to earn release from the on-screen tedium. You'll not be wringing your hands, nor rolling your eyes, nor sighing into your popcorn. No indeed. For a movie of *this* averagousity, only clawing at your own face will do. When you begin to claw your own face -- as begin you must! -- start in at the lower portion. You'll need your upper portion, with its handy tear ducts, intact for the Truly Tear-jerking third act which may bring you to your knees if you haven't clawed your way clear of the entire theatre by then. In a season celebrating Joe Six-Pack and Hockey Moms as the new Gold Standard for leadership and foreign diplomacy, permaybe a movie this tedium will be welcomed as A Thing that anyone could create. *Watching* it, however, is a much more dangerous undertaking. Here's our story... Sidney Young, the London publisher of a fourth-tier celebrity/entertainment magazine is just about to see his magazine go under. He needs a miracle, and what he gets is a phone call from New York City, in the USA. The publisher of Sharp's magazine, Clayton Harding (played by Jeff Bridges) says \\"Come work for me!\\" With his own employees carrying out the fax machine out of his apartment/office in the background, saying \\"Yes\\" is a no-brainer. Soon Sidney is at work in New York City, doing allllllll the wrong things. His interviews consist of asking Broadway musical directors if they are (1) Jewish, and (2) gay. He kills the pet dog of Sohpie Maes, the industry's hottest movie star, when she leaves it in the magazine's offices during a business luncheon. This is a spot of bad luck for everyone, for, among other things, Sidney imagines that he is in love with Maes, before he wakes up to the Dunst character. Worst of all, he totally alienates Alison Olsen (played by winsome scripting-confusion by Kristen Dunst), a colleague assigned to show him the ropes of the magazine *and* The Big Apple. (We have, of course, been to a movie before, and so we know how this relationship is going to end up. This is therefore why we'll need intact tear ducts for the movie's third act.) The problem with The Thing is, the script just never jells, excepting for the one tear-duct set piece in which True Love prevails. Publisher Harding is supposed to be a son-of-a-bitch who also wants to just throw the whole job over. The script never comes down firmly on one or the other sides of this dichotomy, however, and Bridges is left to twist and waffle in the breeze. Alison Olsen is supposed to despise Sidney Young, but whenever he comes up to her (as he does constantly) she makes a point of engaging him in conversation, instead of attempting to discourage his existence. The \\"comedy\\" of early scenes is built around a piglet destroying an expensive hotel room, and then taking the elevator downstairs to urinate on the expensive high heels of a celebrity at a cocktail reception. The hot starlet Maes confesses that she is attracted to Young because he is \\"wounded.\\" The character never shows us *why* he is wounded, however. This is yet another resultant of the movie's mortally wounded script. At one hours and fifty minutes, This Thing feels longer (and more deadly) than Napoleon's retreat from Moscow.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Cheating can happen in a lot of different ways. When people cheat, it's not fair to other people, like the kids who studiedfor the test or who were the true winners of a game. Many people like the action of cheating. It makes difficult things seem easy, like getting all the right answers on the test. But it doesn't solve the problem of not knowing the material and it won't help on the next test --- unless the person cheats again. Some people lose respect for cheaters and think less of them. The cheaters themselves may feel bad because they know they are not really earning that good grade. And, if they get caught cheating, they will be in trouble at school, and maybe at home, too. Some kids cheat because they're busy or lazy and they want to get good grades without spending the time studying. Other kids might feel like they can't pass the test without cheating. Even when there seems to be a \\"good reason\\" for cheating, cheating isn't a good idea. If you were sick or upset about something the night before and couldn't study, it would be better to talk with the teacher about this. And if you don't have enough time to study for a test because of swim practice, you need to talk with your parents about how to balance swimming and school.

She is the half-naked cavorting star of Robin Thicke's steamy Blurred Lines video. And while the uncensored video may have reportedly been banned from YouTube, Emily Ratajkowski is still cashing in. The American model and actress has seen her star rocket since being cast alongside two other semi-clad models in the video for the song featuring rappers T.I. and Pharrell. And now she has stripped off again as the star of GQ magazine's July/August 2013 issue, in a shoot by acclaimed celebrity photographer Tony Kelly, who has snapped the likes of Justin Bieber, Kate Upton and Bruno Mars. Scroll down to see the video. Remember me? Emily Ratajkowski, the model star of Robin Thicke's number 1 hit is back as the star of this month's GQ. While the 21-year-old model left her pants on for Robin Thicke's video, she has dared to bare all for the iconic men's magazine. In one of the shots that we can publish the London-born model can be seen carrying a bunch of balloons and concealing her modesty with just one arm. In another she poses in a giant. cocktail glass in a revealing pair of black underwear with a bottle of. champagne and sky-high stilettos. Big break: Emily was the almost naked star of Robin Thicke's music video for Blurred Lines, which was blocked from YouTube for being too racy. Champagne showers: The 21-year old poses in a giant cocktail glass in a revealing pair of black underwear with a bottle of champagne and sky-high stilettos. Emily,. who grew up in California, was signed by Ford Models at the tender age. of 14 but continued to attend high school in San Diego as she modeled. and acted in Los Angeles. She has starred in campaigns for the likes of Forever 21, Nordstrom, and various swimwear and lingerie clients. Her big break came when she was shot. by industry legend Tony Duran. After that, she began to be recognised as. a fashion model and shot more and more fashion editorials, including. gracing the cover of GQ Turkey. Sultry: The London-born model now resides in America and also works as an actress. But she really caught the world's attention as the star of Thicke's video, which was released in. March. The uncensored version was released a few days later and garnered more than 1 million views in days before being banned by YouTube. Thicke said in an interview that he had sought the approval of his wife, actress Paula Patton, to shoot with nude models. 'Obviously if she didn't like it, I wouldn't put it out,' he said. The 36-year-old singer said director Diane Martel came up with the idea of using nude models. 'As long as it's fun and the girls are comfortable, let's do something silly,' Thicke said. 'Let's take some chances.' And it looks like taking a chance certainly paid off for Emily. In bed with Robin: The clip features Emily topless in bed.

Tim was more moderate, he went to the beach to get a sun tan, but he got an infection as well. Tim found out he got a bacterial infection and had to take antibiotics. Hint: While people have been able to prevent certain viral diseases by vaccinations for many hundreds of years, the development of antiviral drugs to treat viral diseases is a relatively recent development. Antiviral drugs are medications used specifically for treating the symptoms of viral infections. The first antiviral drug was interferon , a substance that is naturally produced by certain immune cells when an infection is detected.

Write a summary based on this article: Major League Baseball's new collective bargaining agreement will include blood testing for human growth hormone, sources confirmed to ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney. A report in the New York Times, citing two league sources familiar with the deal, said testing would begin in February during spring training. According to the sources, the penalty for a positive HGH test will be the same as a positive steroid test -- a 50-game suspension. MLB would become the first major professional sports league in North America to test for HGH. The NFL agreed upon on HGH testing in its latest CBA, but has yet to implement it. MLB already conducts random testing for HGH in the minor leagues, a program it began last year. Baseball's new labor contract also will include a rise in the minimum salary to 480,000 and luxury taxes on both amateur draft signings and international free agents coming to the major leagues. There also will be a slight increase in the total of players eligible for salary arbitration after the 2012 season, when there also will be a new method to determine compensation for clubs losing top major league free agents. There also will be modifications to the luxury tax on high-payroll teams, but the threshold will remain at 178 million next year. Sources told ESPN.com's Jayson Stark that MLB's labor negotiators have reached a \\"handshake agreement\\" on all major issues, and the sport's new five-year collective bargaining agreement is likely to be announced Tuesday. The new labor deal will run through the 2016 season, meaning it will ensure two full decades of continuous labor peace for the first time since the formation of the Major League Baseball Players Association in the 1960s. The changes would be the most numerous since the 1997 agreement that came nearly two years after a 7½-month strike that wiped out the 1994 World Series. The five-year deal, replacing one set to expire Dec. 11, ensures 21 consecutive years of labor peace for MLB at a time when the NBA season is being threatened by a lockout that already has wiped out a quarter of the regular season. As part of the deal, baseball's minimum salary will go from 414,000 this year to 480,000 in 2012 and 500,000 later in the deal -- matching what the average salary was in 1989. Owners gained one of their chief objectives: a restraint on the bonuses paid to amateur free agents, both those entering professional baseball from high schools and colleges and those coming to MLB organizations from abroad. A tax of 75 percent to 100 percent will be imposed on the amount a team exceeds a threshold, and teams exceeding the threshold by higher amounts could lose first- and second-round draft picks. For international free agents, such as players from the Dominican Republic and Venezuela, there will be a separate threshold and tax with penalties, and there will be a study committee that could put a new system in place later during the agreement. After the 2012 season, about five to six additional major leaguers will become eligible for salary arbitration each year. The group of players with at least two but less than three years of major league service lost the right to arbitration in the 1985 agreement, but players regained it for the top 17 percent of 2-3-year players by service time in the 1990 deal. That will rise to 22 percent following the 2012 season. For this offseason, the number of Type A free agents, requiring the highest draft-pick compensation from the team signing a player, will be cut from 21 as part of a one-year deal bridging the way to a new system. There will be no change for the most-prized free agents, such as Albert Pujols and Prince Fielder. Starting next year, teams will have to make a \\"qualifying offer\\" of a one-year guaranteed contract to their players eligible to become free agents in order to receive compensation if the player signs with another club. That amount will be at least 12.4 million and could rise by next year, depending on a formula. The new \\"qualifying offer\\" does away with the statistical formula for ranking free agents that has existed since the 1981 strike settlement. In addition, there are modifications to baseball's revenue-sharing formula and to its benefit plan. Players and owners did not agree to a tax on low-payroll teams, although they did have some discussion during negotiations. The sides have essentially been in agreement on most significant issues for several days. But following this week's owners meetings, they met outside Chicago on Thursday evening to settle on the specifics on a number of matters that had needed to be resolved before the agreement could be put in writing. That session concluded early Friday. Commissioner Bud Selig already has announced the move of the Houston Astros to the American League. That will pave the way for realignment of the sport into two 15-team leagues, adding a second wild-card playoff team in each league and spreading interleague play throughout all six months of the regular season. But this agreement also will lead to significant changes to the schedule, free agency, the draft, the signing of international players, revenue sharing and the so-called \\"competitive balance tax.\\" And the addition of two more wild-card teams likely won't be the only significant change to baseball's postseason structure. A source told Olney that a past rule that teams in the same division can't play in the Division Series round likely will not be part of the new agreement. Information from ESPN The Magazine's Buster Olney, ESPN.com's Jayson Stark and The Associated Press was used in this report. ||||| Advertisement Continue reading the main story Major League Baseball’s owners and players are on the verge of completing a new labor deal that for the first time will include blood testing for human growth hormone, according to two people in baseball briefed on the matter. The testing will be a significant step for baseball, allowing it to move ahead of other professional sports leagues, including the N.F.L., in confronting the troublesome issue of a drug that has long evaded detection. The bargaining agreement, which is expected to be announced early this week, calls for blood testing to begin in February, when players report to spring training. Players who test positive will face a 50-game suspension, which will be the same as the first-time penalty for a positive steroid test, according to the two people. Although minor elements of the overall agreement still need to be completed, the two people said that a full understanding on H.G.H. testing had been reached and that no further negotiations on that issue were needed. As such, baseball will be the first of the major North American professional sports to do any type of blood testing for drugs at a league’s highest level. In 2010, baseball introduced H.G.H. blood testing for minor league players because the step could be taken without the consent of the major league players union. Photo Commissioner Bud Selig, who is sensitive about his legacy and the longstanding criticism that he was too slow to react to the use of performance-enhancing drugs in his sport, will now be able to cite the H.G.H. testing in stressing how seriously baseball treats the issue of drug use. And without mentioning the N.F.L. by name, he will be able to take satisfaction in accomplishing what football has been unable to do. Last summer, the N.F.L. and its union reached an agreement on a new labor contract that included blood testing for human growth hormone, leaving the details of the testing to be worked out after the deal was ratified. But the players have since refused to sign off on the testing, citing various reservations. Members of Congress have become involved in the stalemate, but the N.F.L. players union continues to raise questions about the testing, in particular expressing concerns that the natural level of H.G.H. in football players might be higher than that of the general population and that too many players would unfairly test positive as a result. The two people with knowledge of baseball’s labor agreement said they were confident that this pattern of last-minute objections would not arise in their sport. H.G.H. is believed to boost lean muscle mass, aid in recovery and improve stamina, but it is illegal to possess in the United States without a prescription. Although there is no urine test for H.G.H., Olympic athletes have been blood-tested for the substance for nearly a decade. Within baseball, however, there was skepticism about the test, with some critics pointing to the fact that it was not producing any positives. Meanwhile, evidence emerged that the substance was indeed being used in the sport. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story In 2007, an investigation into a ring of pharmacies and doctors in Florida led to disclosures that tied numerous players to H.G.H. And at the end of 2007, George J. Mitchell, at the behest of Selig, produced a report on drug use in baseball that linked a number of players — including Andy Pettitte and Roger Clemens — to the substance. Sentiment in baseball began to change in 2010, when a professional rugby player in England was suspended for testing positive for H.G.H. It was proof that at least some were seeking. Selig embraced the development and several months later started the blood tests at the minor league level. This year, first baseman Mike Jacobs, who had played in the major leagues for a number of seasons, became the first minor league player to test positive for the substance. Although H.G.H. testing may be the most notable element of the new bargaining agreement, there were other issues the two sides had to wrestle with as they moved toward a deal that will last for five seasons and will guarantee two decades of peace in a sport that endured numerous work stoppages before that. In particular, baseball wanted a tougher financial slotting system for draft picks to better control what teams now spend on players coming out of high school and college. In the end, the sides agreed on a luxury tax of sorts that would penalize teams that go over an overall threshold for money spent signing picks. In addition, the system of free-agent compensation, in which teams surrender first-round picks in exchange for signing a Type A player, is being eased and there will be changes to the system that governs the signing of players from outside the country. But perhaps most significant for Selig and everyone else in the sport is that an overall agreement is within reach without public rancor in a year in which the N.F.L. went through a protracted lockout and the N.B.A. is in a labor standoff that could cost it the 2011-12 season. And that the agreement will have a drug-testing clause that will put baseball ahead of other sports. |||||","completion":"Major League Baseball (MLB) is set to introduce blood testing for human growth hormone (HGH) as part of its new collective bargaining agreement (CBA).

PURE COMMUNISM refers to a hypothetical society where people collectively own and manage resources, property, and the means of production. In a purely communist society, wealth, goods, and services would be distributed based on individual need, and there would be no private ownership. In the context of the sentence: \\"PURE COMMUNISM: You have two cows,\\" it could imply a scenario where you, as an individual, do not own the cows. The cows represent a common resource shared with others, and no one person would have exclusive claims to the cows or their products. LIBERTARIAN/ANARCHO-CAPITALISM refers to a political philosophy that advocates for minimal or no government intervention in the economy and civil affairs. Proponents of these ideologies argue for private property rights, free markets, and voluntary associations in lieu of a centralized government. In the context of the sentence: \\"LIBERTARIAN/ANARCHO-CAPITALISM: You have two cows,\\" it could imply that you, as an individual, own the two cows with exclusive rights over them. In this system, you can decide what to do with the cows, their products, and with the profits derived from them without government interference. To rate the similarity between these two sentences: - Both sentences involve the same object: two cows. - Each sentence refers to different ideologies in terms of how property and resources are managed. Given these factors, I would rate the similarity of the two sentences at a 2 out of 5.

Context: Mowat-Wilson syndrome is a genetic condition characterized by a recognizable facial phenotype in addition to moderate to severe cognitive disability with severe speech impairment and variable multiple congenital anomalies. The anomalies may include Hirschsprung disease, heart defects, structural eye anomalies including microphthalmia, agenesis of the corpus callosum, and urogenital anomalies. Microcephaly, seizure disorder and constipation are common. All typical cases result from haploinsufficiency of the ZEB2 (also known as ZFHX1B or SIP-1) gene, with over 100 distinct mutations now described. Approximately 80% of patients have a nonsense or frameshift mutation detectable by sequencing, with the rest having gross deletions necessitating a dosage sensitive assay. Here we report on the results of comprehensive molecular testing for 27 patients testing positive for MWS. Twenty-one patients had a nonsense, frameshift, or splice site mutation identified by sequencing; 14 of which localized to exon 8 and 17 of which are novel. Six patients had deletions in the ZEB2 gene, including two novel partial gene deletions. This report, the first such analysis in North American patients, adds to the growing list of both novel pathogenic mutations associated with MWS, as well as other variants in the ZEB2 gene.

Answer the following question: This article: The Monadnock was commissioned by Boston real estate developers Peter and Shepherd Brooks in the building boom following the Depression of 1873–79. The Brooks family, which had amassed a fortune in the shipping insurance business and had been investing in Chicago real estate since 1863, had retained Chicago property manager Owen F. Aldis to manage the construction of the seven-story Grannis Block on Dearborn Street in 1880. It was Aldis, one of two men Louis Sullivan credited with being \\"responsible for the modern office building\\", who convinced investors such as the Brooks brothers to build new skyscrapers in Chicago. By the end of the century, Aldis would create over 1,000,000 square feet (93,000 m2) of new office space and manage nearly one fifth of the office space in the Loop.Daniel Burnham and John Wellborn Root met as young draftsmen in the Chicago firm of Carter, Drake, and Wight in 1872 and left to form Burnham & Root the following year. At Aldis's urging, the Brooks brothers had retained the then-fledgling firm to design the Grannis Block, which was their first major commission.

Article: Everyone seems to be in favor of progress. But \\"progress\\" is a funny word. It doesn't necessarily mean that something has become stronger, wiser or better. It simply means changing it from being one thing to another and sometimes it turns out to be worse than before. Consider medicine, for instance. No one can deny that medical progress has enriched our lives greatly. Because of medical advancements, we eat better, live easier and are able to take care of ourselves more efficiently. We can cure disease with no more than one injection or a pill. If we have a serious accident, doctors can put us back together again. If we are born with something defective , they can repair it. They can ease our pain, replace worn parts and give us children. They can even bring us back from death. These are wonderful achievements, but there is a price we have to pay. Because medicine has reduced death, the population has been rising steadily, in spite of serious efforts to reduce the rate of population growth. A child born in the United States today has better than a 90% chance of survival . Furthermore, medical advances have ensured that most of those new-born children will live to be seventy years of age or more.

The movie \\"Table Talk\\" revolves around the lives of a group of eclectic waiters who, between serving customers and satisfying their every need, bond over the endless gossip and complaints about their eccentric patrons. Ryan, the bistro's seemingly charming and suave head waiter, aspires to transition from the world of waiting tables to the big screen. He constantly finds himself in unexpected situations with intriguing guests, fueling his collection of anecdotes to entertain his coworkers when the day is slow. Samantha, an aspiring writer, secretly uses her experiences with customers to sketch vivid characters for her novel. Somehow, this perpetually single woman always seems to run into romantic mishaps, even during her work shifts. The gossip begins to escalate when the seasoned waiter, Jake, arrives after working at a number of high-profile restaurants. This caustic veteran openly despises the customers, frequently complaining about their demands and peculiar habits. Armed with a seemingly endless supply of entertaining stories and industry rumors, Jake becomes the go-to source for juicy gossip. As the assorted waitstaff swap tales and continue to complain about a particularly infamous customer – a food critic named Bonnie – they realize she's been eavesdropping on their conversations. To their horror, she is dining in their restaurant for an upcoming review. Fearing the repercussions of their candidness, the waiters band together to ensure Bonnie leaves with a fantastic impression of \\"Le Petit Plaisir.\\" This results in an abundance of comical and heartwarming interactions, as hardly anything goes as planned amidst their frantic efforts. Despite the mishaps, Bonnie becomes unexpectedly charmed by the endearing group of waiters. In her review, she discloses their vulnerability and candid discussions with each other, not to humiliate them but to praise their camaraderie and ability to still deliver excellent service despite their complaints. In the end, Samantha's novel, inspired by her experiences at the bistro, becomes a bestseller, and Ryan lands a small but meaningful role in a movie. Co-workers-turned-friends celebrate their transformative experiences together, reminiscing on all the gossip and complaints that have brought them closer. \\"Table Talk\\" is a heartfelt and hilarious exploration of genuine connections, the importance of friendship, and the untold stories of those who serve others. The bonds and pressure of working in the service industry serve as the backdrop to this narrative packed with laughter, tears, and heart."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Given the following context: White Deer Hole Creek is in a sandstone, limestone, and shale mountain region, entirely in the Ridge-and-valley Appalachians. South and North White Deer Ridge and Bald Eagle Mountain are composed of sedimentary Ordovician rock, while the valley rock is Silurian, with a small Devonian region closer to the river, in the north. The watershed has no deposits of coal, nor natural gas or oil fields. The creek is in a narrow mountain valley with steep slopes in its upper reaches. In its middle and lower reaches it has steep mountain slopes to the south, and a wide valley with rolling hills and gentle slopes to the north. The channel pattern is transitional, with a trellised drainage pattern.From 1961 to 1995, the United States Geological Survey (USGS) operated one stream gauge on White Deer Hole Creek at the Gap Road bridge (upstream of Elimsport), for the uppermost 18.2 square miles (47 km2) of the watershed. The highest yearly peak discharge measured at this site was 4,200 cubic feet (120 m3) per second and the highest yearly peak gauge height was 11.83 feet (3.61 m), both on June 22, 1972, during Hurricane Agnes. The lowest yearly peak discharge in this time period was 135 cubic feet (3.8 m3) per second and the lowest yearly peak gauge height was 4.29 feet (1.31 m), both on November 26, 1986. The USGS also measured discharge at Allenwood, very near the creek's mouth, as part of water quality measurements on seven occasions between 1970 and 1975. The average discharge was 70.4 cubic feet (1.99 m3) per second, and ranged from a high of 111 cubic feet (3.1 m3) per second to a low of 33 cubic feet (0.93 m3) per second.

The APEX system is indeed used to represent the different variables related to photographic exposure, like aperture, shutter speed, and ISO. However, to answer the specific question, \\"What is the effective f-number proportional to?\\" we need to dive deeper into the concept of the f-number in photography. The effective f-number, commonly referred to as \\"f-stop\\" or \\"focal ratio,\\" is a dimensionless number that indicates the relative aperture size of a camera lens. The f-number is the ratio of the lens's focal length (the distance between the lens and the image sensor) to the diameter of the aperture. Mathematically, it is expressed as: N = f / D where N is the f-number, f is the lens's focal length, and D is the aperture diameter. The f-number is critical in photography as it helps determine the amount of light entering the camera and, consequently, the exposure of the photograph. A smaller f-number (indicating a larger aperture) allows more light to enter the camera, resulting in a brighter image; a larger f-number (indicating a smaller aperture) reduces the light entering the camera, resulting in a darker image. Now, let's address the proportionality aspect of the question. The effective f-number is proportional to the inverse square root of the lens's entrance pupil area. The entrance pupil area is the effective aperture area as seen through the front of the lens, which affects the exposure. This relationship can be written as: N ~ 1 / sqrt(A) where N is the f-number, A is the entrance pupil area, and ~ denotes \\"proportional to.\\" It is important to note that the f-number also affects the depth of field (DOF) in a photograph. A smaller f-number (wider aperture) results in a shallow DOF, making the subject in focus while the background is blurry. A larger f-number (smaller aperture) increases the DOF, allowing more objects in the scene to be in focus. In summary, the original statement does not directly provide the correct answer to the question, \\"What is the effective f-number proportional to?\\" The effective f-number is proportional to the inverse square root of the lens's entrance pupil area, which influences the exposure and depth of field in a photograph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Well we're not married (yet), but one time my boyfriend playfully spanked me. Hard. I know he didn't mean to hurt me, but I was mad about it all. Day. Long. I just couldn't get over the fact that he technically hit me! I started to consider things like, “Is he really sorry?” “Will he do it again?” “Should I leave him?” And gave myself reasons like “He didn't mean to!” “He's been apologizing all day!” “He was just playing!” “He meant to have fun, He's sorry!” Yet countered it with one simple statement, “Yeah that's what all abused women say.” In the end, I felt the question that should determine whether or not I should leave is: “If I stop talking to him tomorrow and can never see him or speak to him again, will I be okay with that?” and the answer was “No”, so obviously I shouldn't leave him. He is very well aware that I was considering leaving him, (I have a very strict 0 tolerance policy of abuse in my relationships, as I was abused terribly growing up,) and he still apologizes to this day, but he has certainly made it a point to never do that again. I definitely trust him, and he actually was being playful, but otherwise that has been the only “real” hitch we have come across. I mean, we argue, but that's only when either of us are mad, and it's usually over small stupid stuff. Like, really stupid stuff. We argued over traffic signs before, LOL.

Article:","completion":"Title: Anonymous Strikes Back: The Hacking Saga Continues Subtitle: In retaliation to the recent persecution of hackers, the activist group 'Anonymous' targets the US Government, breaching personal data of over 104,000 individuals. The activist hacker group, Anonymous, has taken a bold step in retaliation against the government's continuous persecution of computer hackers, such as Lauri Love and Aaron Swartz. Both individuals were famously targeted by the US government for their hacking initiatives, sparking an ongoing debate regarding computer privacy, civil liberties, and security. Anonymous has now turned its attention to the US government itself, hitting back by infiltrating and stealing the personal data of more than 104,000 employees, contractors, family members, and affiliates of various government sectors, including the Department of Energy, US Army, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The staggering number of affected individuals suggests that this cyber attack could have vast implications for the government and perhaps several other key agencies. Anonymous exploited a flaw in Adobe System Inc's software, allowing them access to classified information, potentially resulting in severe security breaches and irreparable damages. The incident has raised eyebrows in the government, as key officials express their concerns about the scale of the attack and the possible ramifications of the stolen information. Among the details obtained during the breach were banking information and financial records of the targeted individuals. This raises a major cause for concern, as there is potential for widespread attempts at theft and fraud, in addition to the severe breach of privacy. As retaliation measures continue and the scale of the infiltration grows larger, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the government's ongoing crackdown on hackers is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, it displays a proactive approach to safeguarding national security and attempting to prevent further instances of cybercrime. However, it also provides an incentive for hacktivist groups, like Anonymous, to strike back and make even bolder moves in the digital warzone. This most recent attack is a glaring reminder that the cybersecurity landscape is continually evolving and that no individual or organization is truly impervious to such threats. Hackers, like Anonymous, are motivated by their ideologies, often focusing on targeting governments and exposing what they perceive as institutionalized corruption and injustice. The government's response to this most recent infiltration will be crucial in determining its future effectiveness in combatting the growing threat of cyberattacks. As Anonymous maintains its momentum, it is unclear what measures the government will take to protect itself against such breaches, as well as ensuring the continued security of its employees and citizens. The lines between activism and cyber-terrorism become increasingly blurred, leaving the government with a difficult decision to make: to what extent will they go to quell the ever-present threat of hacktivism? And will their efforts ultimately be sufficient in ensuring national security, while maintaining the delicate balance of civil liberties and privacy rights? Only time will tell, but as the digital landscape continues to evolve and the struggle between hackers and governments intensifies, it is certain that the outcome will shape the future of cybersecurity and the ongoing battle for privacy and freedom in the digital age."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The movie takes place in an USA prison, not in a \\"banana republic\\" like most WIP films. I'm not sure if that was a wise move, but it is an acceptable change of pace.

B: A barrier - A barrier has no direct relevance to initiating a chemical reaction or change. C: Activation energy - As mentioned in Fact 1, activation energy is required to initiate a chemical reaction. Since chemical changes are a result of chemical reactions, this choice aligns with the requirements given in the facts.

Review title: Trying to keep up with the times... Product review: Compairing this album to other bands that are coming out today this is a good record. But by Metallica standards this album is horrible. The band has lost there golden touch. The druming has an over-bearing feel and it seems to be mis-directed. The bass lines, are hard to make out. I don't however think that James Headfield's voice is still going fine, I saw them live in July and he sounded better than ever. I also can understand why there aren't any guitar solo's - because they want to be more current with the music today. While listening to this record you can tell that Metallica is trying to fit in with the new-style bands that don't usually do flashy guitar stuff.I think we all want our old Metallica back... this band needs to realize that they can't just stop and try to become more modern in there outlook they have to keep the formula that made them great... this album is sad. A:","completion":"The given review would likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product for several reasons. Firstly, the reviewer compares the album to other current bands and mentions that, although the record may be good by today's standards, it is disappointing compared to Metallica's past works. This indicates that the album may not have met the reviewer's expectations, and long-time fans of the band could be similarly disappointed. Secondly, the reviewer points out specific technical aspects that they find to be problematic, such as the overpowering drums, indiscernible bass lines, and the absence of guitar solos. These criticisms suggest that the sound of the album may be lacking or not up to par with Metallica's previous works. If these elements of the album matter significantly to potential buyers, the review may discourage them from purchasing the product. On a positive note, the reviewer does mention that James Hetfield's voice is still good, which is a favorable aspect. However, they attribute the absence of guitar solos to the band’s desire to conform to the contemporary music scene, which might be perceived as a negative by those who appreciate Metallica's traditional sound. The reviewer's longing for the \\"old Metallica\\" back, along with their belief that the album is a sad attempt by the band to modernize, suggests the album has not maintained the essence that made the band great in the past. In conclusion, the review is more negative than positive, which will likely decrease the chances of purchasing the product.

Answer:","completion":"The prestigious Palme d'Or award at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival was won by Chinese filmmaker Chen Kaige. Born on August 12, 1952, Chen Kaige is one of the key figures in China's fifth generation of filmmakers and has earned international acclaim for his works. The film that brought home the Palme d'Or was his masterpiece \\"Farewell My Concubine\\" (Chinese: 霸王别姬). This epic Chinese drama was adapted from the novel of the same name by Lilian Lee (Li Pik-Wah). The powerful narrative of the film covers a period of 53 years and explores the turbulent lives of two male Peking Opera performers. The story uniquely presents the changes and political upheavals in China from the end of the Qing Dynasty to the events of the Cultural Revolution. \\"Farewell My Concubine\\" was the first Chinese film to ever receive this prestigious award, an honor it shared with Jane Campion's \\"The Piano,\\" as both films were declared joint winners at the 46th Cannes Film Festival. Chen Kaige's film not only received critical acclaim but also achieved commercial success worldwide. Since then, it has become a cultural phenomenon and one of the most significant Chinese films of all time. Tonya Suzanne Holly, on the other hand, is an American film producer, writer, and director who gained prominence in the early 2000s. Although she was not involved in the 1993 Cannes Film Festival, she has contributed to the independent film industry by producing and contributing to socially relevant films such as \\"When I Find the Ocean,\\" \\"The Mirror,\\" and \\"The Story of Bonnie and Clyde.\\" In conclusion, the Palme d'Or at the 1993 Cannes Film Festival was awarded to Chen Kaige for his groundbreaking film \\"Farewell My Concubine,\\" which marked an important milestone in the history of Chinese cinema and brought international recognition to its creator."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Title: 1st Marathon Product review: I'm 58 yrs old and training for my first Marathon.

He had been suffering from dementia and died peacefully at his home on Saturday aged 87, his family said. The peer had been accused of 22 counts of historical sex offences against boys - allegations his family denied. A \\"trial of the facts\\" set for April will no longer take place. A lawyer representing alleged victims said they had been denied justice. Liz Dux, who represents six alleged victims, said: \\"This is devastating news for my clients. They have waited so long to see this case come before the courts, to be denied justice at the final hurdle is deeply frustrating.\\" The Goddard inquiry, which is examining child sexual abuse claims, may now examine the allegations, the BBC's Tom Symonds said. It had set aside the case while it was being dealt with in the courts. Lord Janner's family said he would be \\"deeply missed\\" and requested their mourning be respected. They had previously said he was a man of \\"great integrity\\" and \\"entirely innocent of any wrongdoing\\". Labour MP Simon Danczuk, who led calls for Lord Janner to face justice, said: \\"Obviously it is very sad for Lord Janner's family that he has passed away, though it is also extremely sad for his alleged victims.\\" He added: \\"It is disappointing that all the evidence is not now to be brought before a court. \\"It is a very sad day for justice.\\" By Chris Mason, BBC political correspondent Should a man with what was described as \\"advanced and disabling dementia\\" face a trial over allegations of child sexual abuse spanning four decades? It is that question - and the conflicting answers offered to it - that places Lord Janner's death so prominently in the news. A High Court judge, just weeks ago, said his answer was no: there was little point in hauling a man who could barely recognise his own family in front of a jury, to answer for his alleged behaviour a generation ago. That was galling enough for his alleged victims. But they sought solace in the so-called \\"trial of the facts\\" due to begin in the spring. That will now not happen - leaving them devastated, and so many questions about Lord Janner's alleged behaviour permanently unaddressed. The peer had been on a leave of absence from the House of Lords since October 2014. He was accused of 15 counts of indecent assault and seven counts of a separate sexual offence against a total of nine alleged victims. The Old Bailey heard the allegations spanned the years 1963 to 1988. The judge who ruled that he was unfit to stand trial earlier this month said he made his decision based on four experts. \\"The defendant has advanced and disabling dementia that has deteriorated and is irreversible,\\" Justice Openshaw said at the time. Born in Cardiff, he was the grandson of eastern European Jews who fled to Britain. After being evacuated to Canada during the Second World War, he returned to Britain to complete his education before joining the Army. He was first elected to the House of Commons in 1970, winning the seat of Leicester North West after his father's retirement from representing the seat. As a backbencher, he campaigned for Israeli and Jewish causes, as well as on consumer safety, women's equality and workers' rights. And in the 1980s, he helped to launch the Parliamentary War Crimes Commission, set up to report on ex-Nazis living in Britain. Sir Mick Davis, chairman of the Jewish Leadership Council, said: \\"The passing of Greville Janner marks the end of an era for the Jewish community. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with the Janner family at this most difficult time.\\" The Holocaust Educational Trust also paid tribute. Its chief executive, Karen Pollock, said: \\"In 1988 Greville Janner had the foresight to know we as a nation needed to know about and remember the Holocaust and so established the Holocaust Educational Trust. \\"Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Lord Janner, a former British Labour MP who had been charged with historical child sex abuse offenses, passed away at the age of 87.

The vertical distance between a crest and a trough is the height of the wave. Wave height is also called amplitude. The horizontal distance between two crests is the wavelength. Both amplitude and wavelength are measures of wave size. The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows.

They return to Paul's home where his Creole housekeeper Female (pronounced feh-MAH-leh) helps Irena settle into her brother's house. Later, as Irena sleeps, Paul watches her with a predatory stare. That same night, a prostitute walks into a fleabag motel to meet a johnÂ â and is instead mauled by a black panther. The police capture the panther, aided by a team of zoologists: Oliver Yates, Alice Perrin, and Joe Creigh. That same morning, Irena wakes to find her brother missing. Female guesses he went to the mission, and will be home later. She pushes Irena to enjoy New Orleans on her own. When Irena visits the local zoo, she is drawn to the newly captured panther, and stays long after closing hours. When Oliver, the zoo's curator, discovers her, she runs and scales up a tree. Oliver calms her, takes her to dinner, and eventually offers her a job in the gift shop. Irena enjoys her time working alongside Oliver and Alice, until one day she witnesses the new panther rip Joe's arm off during a routine cage cleaning, which leads to Joe's death. Oliver resolves to euthanize the cat, only to find that the animal has escaped, leaving behind a puddle of melted flesh and viscera in its cage. Soon, Paul turns up and tells Irena of their family's werecat heritage. If a werecat mates with a human, the werecat transforms into a panther, and only by killing a human can the werecat regain human form. He also tells her that their parents were actually brother and sister because werecats are ancestrally incestuous and only sex with another werecat prevents the transformation.

The boys always tried to stop her but no one could. I began to notice her at other times, basketball in hand, playing alone. One day I asked her why she practiced so much. Without a moment of hesitation she said, \\"I want to go to college. The only way I can go is to get a scholarship. I am going to play college basketball. I want to be the best. My Daddy told me if the dream is big enough, the facts don't count.\\" Well, I had to give it to her--she was determined. I watched her through those junior high years and into high school. Every week, she led her school team to victory. One day in her senior year, I saw her sitting in the grass, head in her arms. I walked across the street and sat down in the cool grass beside her. Quietly I asked what was wrong. \\"Oh, nothing,\\" came a soft reply, \\"I am just too short.\\" The coach told her that at 5'5\\" she would probably never get to play for a top ranked team--much less offered a scholarship--so she should stop dreaming about college.

Sarah Henderson of Mabank is accused of killing her daughters Kaylee, 7 and Kenlie, 5. WFAA Courtesy The two children were asleep in the living room and Jacob Henderson was asleep in bed when the shootings occurred, according to the recordings. “She was asleep when I went to sleep last night and I woke up, she come in there and she said ‘Babe, I just shot the kids.’ I didn’t want to believe it and I went in there and they were dead,” he says. “I just need some help.” A woman screams in the background, “Please shoot me please, I’m sorry.” The children were both shot in the head, Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher. Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher that his wife was not under the influence of drugs that night. Deputies had responded to the home earlier Wednesday night, at about 11:30 p.m., when Jacob Henderson called 911 asking for help with his wife. He called back and canceled the request, but deputies had already arrived and were told the couple was fine, the recordings indicate. The second call reporting the children had been shot came at 2:24 a.m. The children were taken to Dallas for autopsies. The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County district attorney’s office are assisting in the investigation. “The family has had previous contact with CPS in 2010 but not recently,” CPS spokeswoman Marissa Gonzales said Thursday in an email. “Details of those interactions are confidential.” ||||| Sarah Henderson has been charged with capital murder in the death of her two daughters. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office) The first EMS call came in at 11:29 p.m. Wednesday. “I want to get somebody out here to check my wife out,” Jacob Henderson said, his voice calm and even. He didn’t think his wife was trying to commit suicide, he told the dispatcher, but she was “freaking out like somebody is out to get her.” Seven minutes later, Henderson called again. His wife was “fine now,” and he wanted to cancel his earlier request for help. Still, deputies from the Henderson County Sheriff’s Office came to Henderson’s home in Mabank, Tex., roughly 55 miles southeast of Dallas. It was the home he shared with his wife, Sarah Nicole Henderson, 29, and her daughters, ages 7 and 5. “A male and female told the Deputies they were fine and no one was in danger or jeopardy,” read a news release from the Sheriff’s Office. Henderson’s next call came in at 2:24 a.m. Thursday. Choking back tears, panting for breath, and at times wailing, Henderson told the 911 dispatcher that his wife had shot her children. Jacob Henderson called 9-1-1 after his wife, Sarah Henderson, shot her 5-year-old and her 7-year-old in Mabank, Tex. on Nov. 2. (Henderson County Sheriff’s Office) And now, Sarah Henderson was clutching onto her neck, as if trying to choke herself. She kept trying to pry back the gun Jacob Henderson took away from her. In the background of that distraught 911 call, Sarah Henderson can be heard asking: “Why did I do that, Jake?” [Student charged after bragging about putting roommate’s toothbrush ‘where the sun doesn’t shine’] He had fallen asleep and awakened to hear his wife say, “Jake, I shot the kids,” Jacob Henderson told the dispatcher. In his 911 call, Jacob Henderson alerted police to what they would find: The girls, reported to be 7-year-old Kaylee and 5-year-old Kenlie, had been shot in the head. Recordings of Jacob Henderson’s EMS and 911 calls were released by the Sheriff’s Office on Friday. County Sheriff Botie Hillhouse told The Washington Post that officials had yet to determine a motive in the killings. Hillhouse said officers had been dispatched to the house in 2015 for a “verbal disturbance,” but all they found was Sarah Henderson standing in her yard, arguing with someone over the phone. “We hadn’t had much to do with her until Wednesday night and then again Thursday,” Hillhouse said. CBS News reported that Texas Child Protective Services confirmed it had been in contact with the family six years ago, but other details were confidential. Sarah Henderson has been charged with one count of capital murder, with another capital murder charge pending, officials said. She was arraigned Friday morning with bail set at 2 million and remains in jail under suicide watch. Hillhouse said the punishment for capital murder in Texas is life in prison or the death penalty. The gruesome case took another dark turn Friday when investigators announced Sarah Henderson had planned for at least two weeks to kill her children, though authorities did not provide further details to support this claim. She had also intended to kill her husband, “but the entire crime did not go as planned,” a news release said. ABC News quoted Hillhouse as saying that the gun malfunctioned when Sarah Henderson tried to kill Jacob. [Disney knew its property had alligators. It caught hundreds before a boy was killed.] “She was very matter of fact, to the point and just didn’t show any remorse,” Hillhouse said of officials’ interviews with Sarah Henderson. Hillhouse said Jacob Henderson was not the biological father of the victims and has been cooperating with authorities. He added that Sarah Henderson has another son who lives with his father outside the county. The Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services and the Henderson County District Attorney’s Office are assisting with the investigation. It was not clear if Sarah Henderson had obtained an attorney. A neighbor, Jaylyne Palmer, told NBCDFW that she had never had a conversation with Sarah Henderson, but that the girls would ride their bikes through her driveway. “They would draw pictures and put them in the mailbox for us,” Palmer said. Jacob Henderson’s 911 call recorded Sarah Henderson saying, “I’m sorry.” “Why though?” Jacob Henderson cried. “Why? Why? Why?” Then he saw flashes of red and blue light come down the street. “They’re here,” he told the dispatcher, before hanging up.

The children were asleep in the living room when Sarah Henderson woke her spouse to confess she had shot the kids. The shocked father immediately called 911, although the children were already dead. In a heartrending conversation with the 911 dispatcher, Jacob explained that his wife was also asking him to shoot her. Sarah Nicole Henderson was arrested and faces charges of two counts of capital murder, with bail set at 2 million. She was arraigned at the scene and is currently jailed in Henderson County. According to Sheriff Botie Hillhouse, she confessed to the killings that had reportedly been planned for about two weeks. Hillhouse's investigation indicates that she had also intended to kill her husband, although this part of the plan failed. Jacob Henderson had reached out to law enforcement services earlier that night, requesting help with his wife's strange behavior. She apparently was acting paranoid, fearing somebody was out to get her. Later, however, he called off his request claiming his wife was now \\"fine\\". Despite this, the deputies from the Henderson County Sheriff's Office visited the Hendersons’ home, but they were assured by Sarah and her husband that everything was okay. Sarah Henderson was not under the influence of drugs that night, as noted by Jacob while communicating with the 911 dispatcher. She tried to strangle herself after committing the murders and even tried to get hold of the gun again, as heard in the background of the 911 call. The children were transported to Dallas for autopsies, and the case is under investigation with assistance from the Texas Rangers, Child Protective Services, and the Henderson County District Attorney's Office. The family had previously had some contact with Child Protective Services back in 2010, but recent interactions are unknown. The investigators uncovered Sarah Henderson's plan to kill her children, and her husband, holding her for at least two weeks. It is reported that the gunfire malfunctioned when she attempted to murder Jacob. Her demeanor remained unapologetic and matter-of-fact throughout her interaction with the authorities. Authorities also noted that Jacob Henderson was the stepfather of Kaylee and Kenlie, while Sarah has another son who lives with his father outside the county. Sarah Henderson remains in jail, under suicide watch, with charges of capital murder pending. If she is found guilty of capital murder in Texas, the punishment could be a life sentence or even the death penalty."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Summarize this article: Chisako Kakehi stands accused of killing three partners and attempting to murder a fourth. Prosecutors say Ms Kakehi targeted the men for their money and poisoned them all with cyanide. Her lawyers pleaded not guilty on her behalf, only for Ms Kakehi to seemingly admit killing her last partner. Isao Kakehi, her fourth husband who she reportedly met via a match-making site, died on 28 December 2013, a month after they got married. On Monday, she appeared to confirm she had killed him, saying she committed crime because her husband was not treating her well financially, and that she had obtained the cyanide from a business associate. But on Wednesday she told the court: \\"I don't remember (what I said)\\", according to the Mainichi daily newspaper. Lawyers for Ms Kakehi had previously said her testimony could not be trusted, because she has mild dementia and \\"barely remembers things that happened recently\\". Investigations into the wealthy widow began after a post-mortem examination was carried out on her fourth husband, revealing traces of cyanide in his body. Ms Kakehi is on trial for murdering him and two other boyfriends, all aged between 70 and 80, and the attempted murder and robbery of another boyfriend - who later died of cancer - between 2007 and 2013. Ms Kakehi's three other husbands also all died, but she has not been charged in connection with their deaths. Some media have dubbed Ms Kakehi a \\"black widow\\" - a term derived from the female spider that eats its partner after mating. In April another Japanese woman, Kanae Kajima, who was convicted of killing three lovers, lost a final appeal against her death sentence at the Supreme Court.

Story highlights The early voting in the runoff left neither party feeling comfortable The 36,000 early voters who didn't participate in the primary are among the major question marks (CNN) More than 140,000 voters had cast their ballots by the time early voting in Georgia closed Friday -- another indication of sky-high turnout in the closely watched runoff for a House seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel. And that's leaving neither side confident of victory in what is likely to be a tight race for Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat. The pool of early voters includes more than 36,000 who did not participate in the April primary contest for the seat, which was vacated when former Rep. Tom Price became President Donald Trump's health and human services secretary, according to the Georgia secretary of state's office. The early vote total soared past the 57,000 who voted early in the primary, where Ossoff reached 48%, just shy of the majority that would have avoided the runoff entirely. Ultimately, more than 192,000 people voted in the primary -- close to the 210,000 who participated in the 2014 midterm election in the district. The early voting in the runoff left neither party feeling comfortable and has aides on both sides forecasting a close contest Tuesday -- even as Republicans celebrated turnout that is approaching presidential election levels in the conservative-leaning district. Read More ||||| As the most expensive House race in history rushes toward the finish line Tuesday, the latest public polls are unanimous: The Georgia special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is too close to call. The race for the suburban Atlanta seat, closely watched for clues about the shape of the 2018 midterm elections, appears to be within a few percentage points — with perhaps the slightest edge to Ossoff, the 30-year-old Democrat seeking to wrest away a traditionally Republican seat in the first major election of Donald Trump’s presidency. Story Continued Below “It’s all well within the margin of error,” said Matthew Towery, whose firm, Opinion Savvy, released a poll last Friday conducted for Atlanta’s Fox affiliate showing Ossoff leading by a single point. “I’d say the preponderance of evidence suggests that Ossoff has a very, very slight lead. But it really is a coin flip right now.” The tight polling has both parties — which have each made eight-figure investments in the race — expecting a nail-biter Tuesday night. The current state of play: Of the six public polls conducted in June, Ossoff leads in five of them — and hits the 50-percent mark in each of the five — with the fifth showing a tie. But Ossoff’s lead is far from safe. Outside of an early June Atlanta Journal Constitution poll showing Ossoff ahead by 7 points, the Democrat’s lead is within the margin of error in each of the polls showing him ahead. Here are five questions about the latest polls — and what they tell us about the eventual outcome in Tuesday's vote: Are the polls correctly picking up early voting? In-person early voting concluded last week, and about 140,000 votes have already been cast — that’s more than 70 percent of the 193,000 total votes tallied in the 18-candidate April vote that led to the upcoming runoff. During early voting for the April race, Ossoff was the only serious Democratic candidate, which allowed him to bank a large share of the early vote. GOP voters, on the other hand, mostly waited through election night as Handel and three other competitive Republican candidates slugged it out. But now it’s down to just two candidates — Ossoff and Handel. And while polls and the profile of the early-voting electorate both suggest Ossoff is banking more votes, Handel is more competitive than in the first round of voting, when she was one of many Republicans running.

You can unsubscribe at any time. Ossoff has a 15-point lead among self-described early voters in the Opinion Savvy poll, a 13-point lead in a poll from The Trafalgar Group, a 14-point lead in a SurveyUSA poll conducted for WXIA-TV in Atlanta and a 9-point lead in a WSB-TV/Landmark Communications poll . Then there is the Atlanta Journal-Constitution poll, the only live-caller poll, where Ossoff led by 31 points among early voters. The huge early vote raises another issue: Are the candidates drawing out new voters, or are they merely cannibalizing voters who would have cast their ballots on Election Day? “I do see a higher participation from Handel voters in the early voting and see that gap getting a little tighter,” said Robert Cahaly, a senior strategist at The Trafalgar Group, the Atlanta-based firm that found Ossoff with a 3-point lead in a poll last week. “The question is: Does it come at the cost of votes on Election Day?” Can Ossoff’s ground game change the electorate — and can the polls pick up those changes? Ossoff may be a first-time candidate running in what has been a reliable GOP district, but he’s managed to raise more campaign cash for a single race than any other congressional hopeful in history: 23.6 million as of May 31, a figure that will likely swell by millions before next Tuesday’s election. While television advertising still dominated most candidates’ campaign budgets, Ossoff is pouring millions into an unprecedented ground game to turn out new voters and those who haven’t voted in nonpresidential elections previously. That scrambles the calculus for pollsters, who usually rely on past performance to determine whom they call and who comprises their surveys. In a typical special election, pollsters can rely on data from past midterm and off-year races to establish a likely electorate. “I like to joke that Ossoff has spent enough money that he could pay Uber to give every single voter a ride to the polls,” Cahaly said. “You can’t duplicate that effort on a national level.” Will younger voters show up? This is the most practical — and perhaps most important — question about Ossoff’s ground game: Can he turn support among younger residents of the district into votes? Turnout among young voters always slumps outside presidential races, but it’s critical for Ossoff. In the Opinion Savvy poll, Ossoff has an astounding, 62-point lead over Handel among voters younger than 30 years of age, 81 percent to 19 percent. But Handel leads by 25 points among seniors — who are typically more reliable voters in off-year races — 62 percent to 37 percent. While the Opinion Savvy poll shows a more dramatic break among voters by age, it’s still consistent with the general pattern of the race, where younger voters prefer Ossoff. But young voters’ levels of support and turnout weren’t enough to help Ossoff win a majority of the vote in April and avoid the runoff altogether; he finished with 48.1 percent of the vote. “All the [demographics] will look almost exactly the same as the first round,” Opinion Savvy’s Towery predicted. “He’s performing well with younger voters; she’s performing well with older voters.” Will GOP voters skeptical of Trump stick with Handel? When Trump plucked four House members to join his administration, he did so carefully: Each of the four won reelection last year by at least 16 percentage points. Tom Price, the Republican congressman who resigned the Georgia seat to become secretary of Health and Human Services, won by more than 23 points. But even as Price cruised to reelection, there were signs of trouble for the GOP in the traditionally affluent, Republican suburbs that make up much of the district. Trump carried the seat only narrowly over Hillary Clinton, 48 percent to 47 percent. (Compare that to 2012, when Mitt Romney won the district by a 23-point margin, similar to Price last year.) Any path to victory for Ossoff has always centered around winning those Clinton-Price voters: traditional Republicans repelled by Trump’s contentious persona and policies. The Opinion Savvy poll shows Ossoff winning 97 percent of voters who “strongly disapprove” of Trump’s job performance — a group that makes up 44 percent of the sample. But he’s only winning 49 percent of those who “somewhat disapprove” of Trump, compared to 39 percent for Handel. Handel needs to win only a small percentage of the voters aligned against the president. Overall, voters in the district are divided on Trump: Half approve, and half disapprove. Handel is winning roughly 92 percent of voters who approve of Trump’s job performance, the Opinion Savvy poll shows. What about late-breaking voters? Voters in Georgia’s 6th District have been inundated with door knocks, telephone calls and television advertisements — the last of which can been seen throughout Metro Atlanta. The polls reflect this: There are few undecided voters left. But just because few voters tell pollsters they haven’t made up their minds doesn’t mean they can’t change their minds. And Cahaly, the Trafalgar Group pollster, says he thinks Handel has been gaining in recent weeks. “What I saw is momentum on her part. I saw her growing strength,” Cahaly said. “I believe this race was 5 or 6 or 7 or 8 points a few weeks ago.” That runs counter to a POLITICO report last week that Republicans are increasingly worried that Handel is “trending downward” in internal surveys. But Cahaly cited one other factor that the newest polls might not be picking up: last week’s shootings at congressional Republicans’ baseball practice in Northern Virginia that wounded five people, including House Majority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana. Cahaly said Trump’s handling of the shooting might bring home enough traditional Republican voters uneasy with the president to carry Handel across the finish line. “I think it’s an interesting dynamic, and I’d like to see how that affects it,” he said. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The closely-watched runoff for Georgia's 6th Congressional District seat between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel is looking to be a tight race.

The sat-cannon, or satellite-cannon, was an innovative piece of technology designed by a joint team of scientists and engineers from Earth and Titan, working together to further their knowledge of Titan's unique atmosphere and weather patterns. Dalrin, a seasoned scientist himself, had been a part of this ambitious project since its inception. Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and the second largest moon in the solar system, boasted of an atmosphere much denser and thicker than the Earth's. This made it an ideal subject for studying and understanding the behavior of various weather phenomena happening within its atmosphere. Packed with nitrogen and methane, Titan's atmosphere is home to exotic clouds, polar winds, and massive cryovolcanoes that spew out water and other compounds instead of molten rock. These peculiar conditions puzzled scientists and sparked a strong sense of curiosity amongst them. As a result, they teamed up to design an experimental tool that would enable them to study Titan's weather patterns more closely—a satellite-cannon capable of launching test-satellites into Titan's orbit. This marvelous machine, standing tall as a symbol of cross-planetary cooperation, had a uniquely sleek and futuristic appearance. It was adorned with various instruments, sensors, and satellite-launching mechanisms. Its mainframe extended towards the sky, equipped with a powerful and precise firing mechanism that enabled the team to propel satellites into space with incredible accuracy and minimal energy consumption. The sat-cannon's core function lay in its ability to send small test satellites, laden with various scientific instruments, into orbit around Titan. Here, these satellites could measure atmospheric conditions such as temperature, pressure, and wind patterns. They could also capture images and spectral data, shedding light on the unique meteorological phenomena that occur on this enigmatic moon. Ultimately, the data collected from these test satellites would help scientists and researchers to develop a better understanding of Titan's climate, weather patterns, and its overall compatibility with human life. Thanks to this groundbreaking project, the sat-cannon quickly became a point of interest and pride for both the Earthlings and the Titanians. As Stowik continued to gaze at the sat-cannon in awe, Dalrin went on to share more details about its development, the scientific progress it had made possible, and the collaboration that had brought together the brightest minds from two distant worlds. He spoke of challenges faced, questions answered, and of the countless mysteries still waiting to be unraveled, with the strange-yet-intriguing machine serving as the centerpiece of this grand interplanetary endeavor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

FILE - In this May 13, 2017 file photo, Japanese soldiers use rubber rafts as part of an amphibious drill during joint military exercises between the U.S., Japan, France and the United Kingdom, on Naval... (Associated Press) HAGATNA, Guam (AP) — Residents of the tiny Pacific island of Guam say they're afraid of being caught in the middle of escalating tensions between the U.S. and North Korea after Pyongyang announced it was examining plans for attacking the strategically important U.S. territory. Though local officials downplayed any threat, people who live and work on the island, which serves as a launching pad for the U.S. military, said Wednesday they could no longer shrug off the idea of being a potential target. \\"I'm a little worried, a little panicked. Is this really going to happen?\\" said Cecil Chugrad, a 37-year-old bus driver for a tour bus company in Guam. \\"If it's just me, I don't mind, but I have to worry about my son. I feel like moving (out of Guam) now.\\" Guam is used to the threats from North Korea but advances in the country's nuclear program paired with fiery rhetoric from President Donald Trump has raised the already high animosity and heightened worries that a miscalculation might spark conflict between the nuclear-armed nations. Reports suggested North Korea mastered a technological hurdle needed to strike the U.S. with a nuclear missile. The advances were detailed in an official Japanese assessment and later a Washington Post story that cited U.S. intelligence officials and a confidential Defense Intelligence Agency report. In response, Trump on Tuesday threatened the communist country \\"with fire and fury.\\" On Wednesday, the North Korean army said in a statement that it was studying a plan to create an \\"enveloping fire\\" in areas around Guam with medium- to long-range ballistic missiles. While it is extremely unlikely that Pyongyang would risk the assured annihilation of its revered leadership with a pre-emptive attack on U.S. citizens, some residents are concerned. \\"If anything happens, we all got to be ready, be prepared, and pray to God that it doesn't happen,\\" Daisy Mendiola, 56, said after finishing lunch with her family at a restaurant near Hagatna. \\"Everyone's afraid, because we're dealing with powers that's beyond us.\\" Other residents are worried about the political atmosphere and the government's ability to find a peaceful solution. Todd Thompson, a lawyer who lives on Guam, said he laughed off past threats because he \\"figured cooler heads in Washington would prevail, and it was just an idle threat.\\" \\"But I have to say, I'm not laughing now,\\" Thompson said. \\"My concern is that things have changed in Washington, and who knows what's going to happen?\\" His brother Mitch Thompson, who also lives on Guam, added he believes \\"a lot of people have no confidence that the White House will do the right thing under the circumstances.\\" However, the brothers say they haven't seen anyone panicking or stocking up on supplies. \\"I think people are just stunned and really don't know what to think,\\" Todd Thompson said. Guam is about 2,100 miles (3,380 kilometers) southeast of Pyongyang and 3,800 miles (6,115 kilometers) west of Honolulu in the Pacific Ocean. For years, North Korea has claimed Guam is within its missiles' striking distance, making furious statements each time when the U.S. flew powerful bombers from the island's air base to the Korean Peninsula. In August last year, the North's Foreign Ministry warned that all U.S. military bases in the Pacific including Guam would \\"face ruin in the face of all-out and substantial attack\\" by the North's military. In the spring of 2013, state media cited leader Kim Jong Un as having ordered his military to prepare plans on launching strikes on U.S. military bases in Guam, Hawaii and South Korea as well as the American mainland. Guam is armed with the U.S. Army's defense system known as Terminal High Altitude Area Defense, or THAAD, which can intercept missiles. Similar threats in 2013 led Guam's U.S. Congresswoman Madeleine Z. Bordallo to advocate for the THAAD system, she said in a statement Wednesday. \\"North Korea's most recent threat to target Guam is dangerous and it further heightens tensions in our region,\\" Bordallo said. \\"While we have heard threats like this in the past, I take them very seriously.\\" Guam's Homeland Security Adviser George Charfauros urged calm and said defenses are in place for such threats. \\"An attack or threat to Guam is a threat or attack on the United States,\\" said Guam Gov. Eddie Calvo, who said he spoke with White House officials Monday morning. \\"They have said that America will be defended.\\" A travel agent on Guam said they haven't had a surge of customers seeking to book flights off the island. \\"It's not bad at all, no chaos,\\" said Mariah Sablan, who works for Golden Dragon Travel Inc. \\"It's just like a regular business day.\\" ___ Bussewitz reported from Honolulu. Associated Press writer Mark Thiessen in Anchorage contributed to this report. ___ This story has been corrected to show that the North Korean announcement came Wednesday in Guam due to the international date line. ||||| Image copyright Reuters Image caption The Pacific island of Guam is home to the US Air Force's Andersen air base North Korea has said it is considering carrying out missile strikes on the US Pacific territory of Guam. The North's official news agency said on Tuesday the plan involved firing medium-to-long-range rockets at Guam, where US strategic bombers are based. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, flying into Guam, said there was no imminent threat from North Korea. He also defended President Donald Trump, who on Tuesday threatened Pyongyang with \\"fire and fury\\". Mr Tillerson said that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un did not understand diplomatic language, and a strong message was needed that he would understand. \\"I think the president just wanted to be clear to the North Korean regime that the US... will defend itself and its allies,\\" he said. On Wednesday, Mr Trump tweeted that the US nuclear arsenal was \\"more powerful than ever before\\", but added he was hopeful \\"we will never have to use this power\\". The recent exchanges mark a sharp rise in rhetoric between Washington and Pyongyang, but China has urged calm. A foreign ministry statement quoted by Reuters called on all sides to avoid words or actions which might escalate the situation and to make greater efforts to resolve the issue via talks. The UN recently approved further economic sanctions on North Korea, which Pyongyang said were a \\"violent violation of our sovereignty\\", warning the US would \\"pay a price\\". Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' On Wednesday, the official KCNA news agency said North Korea was \\"carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam\\" using its domestically made medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles. The news agency reported a military statement issued on Tuesday, which probably came in response to US military drills in Guam. However, there has been no indication that any attack on Guam by North Korea is imminent. In a message to the public, the governor of Guam Eddie Baza Calvo said there was currently \\"no threat\\" to the island and the Marianas archipelago, but that Guam was \\"prepared for any eventuality\\". North Korea's statement is the latest stage in a heating up of rhetoric and tension. Pyongyang, which has tested nuclear devices five times, launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) in July, claiming it now had the ability to hit mainland US. On Tuesday, media reports in the US claimed the North had achieved its goal of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption North Korea's second intercontinental missile launched last month was \\"seen from Japan\\" While not confirmed, this was seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in the Washington Post, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence white paper also said the weapons programme had \\"advanced considerably\\" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. North Korea's missile programme explained In response, President Trump warned North Korea to stop threatening the US, saying they would be \\"met with fire and fury like the world has never seen\\". However, veteran US Senator John McCain was sceptical about Mr Trump's statement, saying he was \\"not sure that President Trump is ready to act\\". 'Scary' situation - BBC's Yogita Limaye in Seoul, South Korea On the streets of Seoul, barely 50km (30 miles) from the border with North Korea, the latest developments have drawn mixed reactions. Kim Seong-su, 62, said he thought Pyongyang was bluffing to preserve its regime and justify its nuclear programme. But others are more concerned. Yeon Eui-sook says she finds the situation scary. \\"I hope everyone can live in peace. Kim Jong-un keeps doing this and making us worry,\\" she said. Analysts say the language from Pyongyang always gets more aggressive in August, when the US and South Korea conduct joint military exercises. But this time - with a US president who also uses strong words - the confrontation is getting even fiercer than usual. North Korea had reacted angrily after the fresh sanctions were announced on Saturday by the UN, in an attempt to pressure it into giving up its nuclear ambitions. The sanctions aim to reduce North Korea's export revenues by a third. KCNA said North Korea would retaliate and make \\"the US pay a price\\" for drafting the new measures. It called the sanctions a \\"violent violation of our sovereignty\\", the news agency said. Meanwhile on Wednesday the UK Foreign Office said it would \\"continue to work with the US and our international partners to maintain pressure on North Korea\\". \\"We have been consistently clear and forthright in our condemnation of North Korea's destabilising and illegal behaviour, including through support for UN Security Council resolutions to bring in sanctions that will limit North Korea's ability to pursue its nuclear weapons programme,\\" a spokesman said. A spokesman for Germany's foreign ministry, quoted by AFP, said it was watching the situation \\"with the greatest concern\\" and called on all sides to use restraint. The tiny but important island of Guam The 541sq km (209 sq miles) volcanic and coral island in the Pacific between the Philippines and Hawaii. It is a \\"non-incorporated\\" US territory, with a population of about 163,000. That means people born in Guam are US citizens, have an elected governor and House Representative, but cannot vote for a president in US national elections. US military bases cover about a quarter of the island. About 6,000 personnel are based there and there are plans to move in thousands more. It was a key US base in World War Two, and remains a vital staging post for US operations, giving access to potential flashpoints like the South China Sea, the Koreas and the Taiwan Straits. Guam profile from BBC Monitoring Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning ||||| President Trump, left, greets pastor Robert Jeffress on July 1 during the Celebrate Freedom Rally at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington. (Oliver Douliery/Pool/European Pressphoto Agency) Texas megachurch pastor Robert Jeffress, one of President Trump’s evangelical advisers who preached the morning of his inauguration, has released a statement saying the president has the moral authority to “take out” North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. “When it comes to how we should deal with evildoers, the Bible, in the book of Romans, is very clear: God has endowed rulers full power to use whatever means necessary — including war — to stop evil,” Jeffress said. “In the case of North Korea, God has given Trump authority to take out Kim Jong Un.” Jeffress said in a phone interview that he was prompted to make the statement after Trump said that if North Korea’s threats to the United States continue, Pyongyang will be “met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” [Trump threatened ‘fire and fury.’ Here’s why to some that’s perfectly God-like.] The biblical passage Romans 13 gives the government authority to deal with evildoers, Jeffress said. “That gives the government … the authority to do whatever, whether it’s assassination, capital punishment or evil punishment to quell the actions of evildoers like Kim Jong Un,” he said. He said that many pacifist Christians will cite Romans 12, which says, “Do not repay evil for evil,” but Jeffress says that the passage is referring to Christians, not to the government. “A Christian writer asked me, ‘Don’t you want the president to embody the Sermon on the Mount?’ ” he said, referring to Jesus’s sermon. “I said absolutely not.” In his sermon on the morning of Trump’s inauguration in January, Jeffress, senior pastor of First Baptist Dallas, compared Trump to the story of the biblical leader Nehemiah, who helped rebuild the city of Jerusalem. The first step of rebuilding the nation, Jeffress said, was the building of a wall around Jerusalem to protect its citizens. “You see, God is not against building walls,” Jeffress said in his sermon at St. John’s Episcopal Church in Washington. [‘God is not against building walls!’ The sermon Trump heard from Robert Jeffress before his inauguration.] Jeffress is no stranger to controversy. He has said in the past that former president Barack Obama paved the way for the Antichrist and drew wide attention for calling Mormonism a cult during the 2012 Republican primaries. Jeffress knows his comments on North Korea could be considered controversial, even among fellow evangelicals. His megachurch in Dallas is a prominent Southern Baptist church, one where evangelist Billy Graham had membership for many years. In 2016, the church reported an average weekly attendance of about 3,700. “Some Christians, perhaps younger Christians, have to think this through,” Jeffress said. “It’s antithetical to some of the mushy rhetoric you hear from some circles today. Frankly, it’s because they are not well taught in the scriptures.” Over the past two years, Jeffress said, Trump has been “very measured, very thoughtful in every response.” “People instinctively know that this president is not going to draw an imaginary red line and walk around it like President Obama did,” he said. Attitudes about North Korea among evangelicals are unclear, he said. An overwhelming number of white, evangelicals voted for Donald Trump, 81-16 percent, according to exit poll results. Politics anchor Libby Casey talks to religion reporter Sarah Pulliam Bailey about how Trump appealed to this group and what they expect from him in office. (The Washington Post) “I think many evangelicals, like most Americans, really don’t pay attention to global affairs,” Jeffress said. “I believe we’re all going to be forced to soon if North Korea isn’t dealt with decisively.” Jeffress is unusual for an evangelical pastor because most pastors do not speak about specific foreign policy issues from the pulpit, except sometimes about Israel, said Amy Black, a political-science professor at Wheaton College, an evangelical institution in Illinois. Theologians and church leaders have debated the interpretation of Romans 13 for millennia, Black said. Most mainstream interpretations of the passage, she said, would suggest that God works through governmental leaders, but ultimate authority comes from God. Debate broke out among Christians in Germany during World War II over how to interpret this passage; some Christians believed they should follow the government while others set up a resistance movement. “If anything, Romans 13 creates a conundrum, because it could be interpreted that Kim Jong Un has authority to govern,” she said. Jeffress last met with Trump in July when a group of pastors laid hands on the president in the Oval Office. He said now that health care is off the table, evangelicals are hoping for tax reform, though he didn’t have any specifics in mind. The access Jeffress has to the White House, Black said, may explain why many evangelicals have been so attracted to Trump. “Some of the approval of Trump is less about the specific person and even specific policy, but it’s about someone who is listening to us,” she said. “Jeffress is a piece of that story of having access.” Black says that Jeffress represents an “old guard” of evangelicals, closely aligned to leaders like popular radio personality and psychologist James Dobson and Pat Robertson, who founded the Christian Broadcasting Network. Many evangelicals now look to leadership from pastors like Rick Warren in California or Tim Keller in New York City, though Warren and Keller do not speak about politics very often. “We’re in a weird vacuum; we’re past the Jim Dobson and Pat Robertson era, but it’s not 100 percent clear who will fill their place,” Black said. Jeffress, who was an early supporter of Trump, has said that after sharing Wendy’s cheeseburgers in Iowa, he believed Trump would be the next president and that it would be because God placed him there. In July, his church choir and orchestra performed a song called “Make America Great Again” at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in D.C., where Trump was in attendance.

Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain said he took exception to Trump's comments, warning that the President might not be able to follow through with the threats he is making. \\"I take exception to the President's comments because you've got to be sure that you can do what you say you're going to do,\\" the Arizona Republican said in an interview with Phoenix radio station KTAR. \\"The great leaders I've seen don't threaten unless they're ready to act and I'm not sure President Trump is ready to act.\\" Trump issued his warning to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on Tuesday during a photo op at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey. \\"North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States.

They will be met with fire, fury and frankly power the likes of which this world has never seen before,\\" he said. ||||| The inhabitants of Guam were shocked to wake up on Wednesday to the news that they are being targeted by North Korean ballistic missiles, although the local government has reassured local people that the Pacific island is \\"prepared for any eventuality\\". In a release just hours after US President Donald Trump threatened that any North Korean attack would be met with \\"fire and fury\\", Pyongyang's state media said its military was \\"carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam\\". The North's threat is to use medium-to-long-range Hwasong-12 missiles and is the latest and most specific threat directed against the US. ||||| US airbase in Guam threatened by North Korea as Trump promises 'fire and fury' North Korea has said it is considering a missile strike on the US Pacific territory of Guam, just hours after Donald Trump warned the regime that any threat to the United States would be met with “fire and fury”. The threat, carried by the state-run KCNA news agency, marked a dramatic rise in tensions and prompted warnings to Washington not to become embroiled in a bellicose slanging match with North Korea. Pyongyang said it was “carefully examining” a plan to strike Guam, located 3,400km (2,100 miles) away, and threatened to create an “enveloping fire” around the territory. Guam is home to a US military base that includes a submarine squadron, an airbase and a coastguard group. Guam’s governor, Eddie Calvo, on Wednesday attempted to reassure residents that there was “no threat” of a North Korean strike, but added that the island was prepared for “any eventuality”. Calvo added: “Guam is American soil … We are not just a military installation.” In an online video message he said he had been told by the US defence and homeland security departments that there was no change in the threat level. A Korean people’s army (KPA) spokesman said in a statement Wednesday that a plan would be put into practice as soon as the order to attack Guam was issued by the country’s leader, Kim Jong-un. “The KPA strategic force is now carefully examining the operational plan for making an enveloping fire at the areas around Guam with medium- to long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 in order to contain the US major military bases on Guam, including the Anderson airforce base,” the spokesman said. KCNA quoted a second army spokesman accusing Washington of devising a “preventive war”, adding that any attempt to attack the North would provoke “all-out war, wiping out all the strongholds of enemies, including the US mainland”. The US should cease its “reckless military provocation” against North Korea to avoid such a reaction, the spokesman added. In response, South Korea’s president, Moon Jae-in, called for an overhaul of the country’s armed services, citing an “urgent” need to improve its ability to defend against North Korean missile attacks. “I believe we might need a complete defence reform at the level of a rebirth, instead of making some improvements or modifications,” Moon told senior military officials, according to Yonhap news agency. “Another urgent task now facing us is securing defence capabilities to counter North Korea’s nuclear and missile provocations.” The unification ministry, which handles cross-border relations, said the threat against Guam would damage attempts to improve inter-Korean ties. A ministry spokesman said the South was committed to dialogue and sanctions, and urged Pyongyang to end its provocations. Q&A What are North Korea's nuclear capabilities? Show Hide North Korea has carried out five nuclear tests since 2006, so it unquestionably has the capacity to create some form of nuclear bomb. To function effectively, however, the bomb needs to be small enough to fit on to a missile. Some experts believe the North has already \\"miniaturised\\" its nuclear capability, while others believe the regime is still several years away from being able to do so. Japan's defence ministry warned on 8 August that it was possible that Pyongyang had mastered miniaturisation. North Korea would also need a reliable delivery system for any bomb. Its proven short- and medium-range missiles could reach South Korea and Japan. In July it test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles, placing US cities in range of potential attack, according to US experts. Beijing issued a brief foreign ministry statement on Wednesday calling on “all parties to avoid any words or actions that might escalate the situation” France and Germany also called on all sides to use restraint. “We are watching the increasing rhetorical escalation regarding the Korean Peninsula with the greatest concern,” German foreign ministry spokesman Martin Schaefer told reporters. Tensions in the region have risen since North Korea carried out two nuclear bomb tests last year and test-launched two intercontinental ballistic missiles last month. The UN security council responded last weekend by unanimously agreeing sanctions designed to deprive the regime of around a billion US dollars in hard currency. Q&A Why is North Korea threatening Guam? Show Hide Guam, a 210 sq mile sovereign US territory in the western Pacific Ocean, is used by America as a strategic military base. Almost a third of its land is controlled by the US military and about 6,000 American troops are based there. The island's location, within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles, and military significance to the US make it a logical target for Pyongyang. As recently as Monday, two US air force B-1B bombers flew from Guam to join their counterparts from South Korea and Japan for a mission over the Korean peninsula, about 2,100 miles away. Read more North Korea’s bellicose language is causing anxiety in Japan. Its defence ministry warned on Tuesday that it was possible that Pyongyang had miniaturised its nuclear weaponry. A leaked US intelligence assessment also claimed the regime had successfully produced a miniaturised nuclear warhead that can fit inside its missiles. Japanese fighters conducted joint air drills with US supersonic bombers near the Korean peninsula on Tuesday, Japan’s air self-defence forces said. A day earlier, two US B-1 bombers flew from Guam over the Korean peninsula as part of its “continuous bomber presence”, a US official said. US security and defence officials in Guam, which is within range of North Korean medium- and long-range missiles, said there was no imminent threat to people there or elsewhere in the Northern Mariana Islands. Guam’s department of homeland security and office of civil defence said they were monitoring North Korea with US military and government officials. Guam’s homeland security adviser, George Charfauros, said officials were confident that the US defence department was “monitoring this situation very closely and is maintaining a condition of readiness”. But the speaker of the Guam legislature, Benjamin J Cruz, said people on the island were “just praying that the United States and the … defence system we have here is sufficient enough to protect us”. Cruz told the Associated Press that the threat was “very disconcerting”. He added: “It forces us to pause and to say a prayer for the safety of our people.” In his strongest warning yet to North Korea, Trump told reporters in New Jersey on Tuesday: “North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen.” The New Zealand prime minister condemnded Trump’s comments, in an unusually strong statement. North Korea v the US: how likely is war? Read more “I think the comments are not helpful in an environment that is very tense,” Bill English told local media. He said his government had yet to express concerns to the US administration directly, but “certainly if that type of commentary continued we would”. English added: “I think we are seeing reaction from North Korea that indicates that kind of comment is more likely to escalate rather than settle things.” But North Korea experts played down the potential for a military strike on Guam. “There’s rhetoric on both sides – it’s like two bullies in the playground yelling at each other,” said Robert Kelly, associate professor at Pusan National University. “I think the North Koreans just pulled the Guam threat out of the air. Sure, there’s some sort of rough plan on a shelf somewhere, because Guam is an important American reinforcement point, but I don’t think there is anything immediately in the offing. “They just needed to say something in response – you poke the North Koreans in the eye and they poke you back.” Additional reporting by Eleanor Ainge Roy and agencies ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Residents of Guam have voiced their concerns after North Korea said it was \\"carefully examining\\" a plan for missile strikes on the US Pacific territory.

The Duke of York told entrepreneurs at the Davos summit in Switzerland that foreign firms should invest in Britain, not other European nations, because ‘unlike them it is open for business’. And he boasted it had another huge advantage – its own currency, not the ailing euro. Fresh questions were being raised about the Prince's attendance at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, where he is staying in a luxury ski chalet - at the expense of the taxpayer, it has emerged. His controversial remarks were made at a private. cocktail party at the conference, attended by international. political and business leaders. They. came on the eve of tomorrow’s EU summit in Brussels, where Prime. Minister David Cameron faces another bruising confrontation over his. refusal to accept EU curbs on the City of London. Chancellor. George Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson were also at the Davos. reception, hosted by the Prince to promote British business, even though. he is no longer a special envoy for UK Trade & Investment, the. Government-backed body. Prince. Andrew was forced to quit the role last year following disclosures in. The Mail on Sunday about his friendship with US billionaire Jeffrey. Epstein, a convicted sex offender. But. he was allowed to maintain a lower-profile role and was guest of honour. at its reception for British business leaders in Davos on Thursday. According. to witnesses, he said in his welcoming speech: ‘The message to get. across here tonight is that Britain is open for business – unlike one or. two other countries I could mention.’ To warm applause, he added: ‘And what is more, we have our own currency!’ A man sleeps before a panel session at the World Economic Forum summit in Davos, Switzerland, where Prince Andrew this week gave his speech.

Yesterday, he was spotted going in. skiing in nearby Klosters, where he is staying in a luxury,. eight-bedroom chalet - accommodation which could up to £39,000. The bill for the chalet - which. features its own chef, chauffeur, sauna and steam room - could cost. anything between £21,000 and £39,000, and it is expected to be paid for. out of taxpayers' pockets.

Answer: increases Output:","completion":"An explanation of the given question and answer: The question asks about the impact of increased temperature on the rate of cellular respiration. The given answer is 'increases,' which indicates that the rate of cellular respiration increases with increasing temperature. When the temperature in the environment increases, it generally leads to increased cellular kinetic energy, causing molecules to move more rapidly. This increased molecular movement results in a higher frequency of collisions between substrates and enzymes involved in cellular respiration. Consequently, it speeds up the various chemical reactions within the process, leading to an increase in the overall rate of cellular respiration. However, it is essential to note that this increase is only beneficial to a certain extent. If the temperature becomes too high, it can cause enzymes to denature, losing their function and reducing the efficiency of cellular respiration altogether. In summary, an increase in temperature in the environment can lead to an increase in the rate of cellular respiration due to increased molecular movement and reaction rates. Still, there is an upper limit to the temperature increase, beyond which enzyme function may be compromised."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

His loveable character first made an appearance in 1963 and went on to star in more than 40 stories, selling 120 million copies worldwide. Clifford's image has gone on to appear on merchandise and in US buildings, including the White House. Bridwell had completed two more books which are due for release next year. Dick Robinson, president of the author's long-time publisher Scholastic said: \\"We are deeply saddened by the loss of our loyal and talented friend whose drawings and stories have inspired all of us and generations of children and their parents.\\" His wife of 56 years, Norma, said: \\"A lot of people were Clifford fans and that makes them Norman fans too.\\" She was responsible for naming the character Clifford after her imaginary childhood friend. Over the decades, the bright red dog featured in a host of stories, including Clifford Goes To Hollywood and Clifford and The Grouchy Neighbours, which became popular bedtime reading for children across the US and beyond. The dog regularly got into trouble before redeeming himself with a daring rescue or doing a good deed. Bridwell's wife said there were parallels between the author and his creation. \\"He's never been able to recognise that. Clifford tries to do the right thing, Norman tries to do right the thing, and he makes a mess of it. But he's the most lovable grown-up man.

He made numerous attempts to break into children's publishing, until a New York book editor suggested he created a story around an illustration he had submitted of a child and her oversized dog. Further rejections followed, until publishers Scholastic saw his creation's potential - a move which led to lasting success for the company. \\"I said to my wife, 'Now don't count on there being any more.

In the fourth quarter, quarterback Drew Brees connected with tight end David Thomas to pull within 10, but another Dawson field goal and a second Bowens interception return sealed the win for the Browns. With the win, the Browns entered their bye week at 2-5. This win also marked the third consecutive season in which the Browns defeated the defending Super Bowl champion. Answer this question: How many more yards was the rush on the fake punt by Reggie Hodes than the punt return by Eric Wright?","completion":"To answer the question, we need to find the difference in yards between the fake punt rush by Reggie Hodges and the punt return by Eric Wright. Reggie Hodges had a 68-yard rush on a fake punt, and Eric Wright had a 62-yard punt return. To find the difference, we subtract the smaller number (62) from the larger number (68): 68 - 62 = 6 yards The rush on the fake punt by Reggie Hodges was 6 yards more than the punt return by Eric Wright."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a summary based on this article: View Images As Philae closes in for a landing, the shadow-pocked surface of the comet 67P is revealed. Photograph by ESA/Rosetta/Philae A misfire of harpoons, an ancient technology, may have spelled the end of one of the most advanced: Philae, the first spacecraft to send images from the surface of a comet. Unanchored to its comet, the spacecraft drifted into darkness, sending back scientific data even as its solar-powered batteries faded. The lander successfully delivered data on the composition of the comet, before losing contact early Friday with the European Space Agency at the Rosetta Mission Operations Centre in Darmstadt, Germany. \\"With its batteries depleted and not enough sunlight available to recharge, Philae has fallen into 'idle mode' for a potentially long silence,\\" an ESA statement announced. \\"It was a very successful mission; it has returned a lot of great data already,\\" said space scientist Alan Stern of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder, Colorado, a member of the Rosetta science team. When Rosetta was originally designed more than a decade ago, the comet lander Philae was conceived of as a 24-hour mission, he says. \\"People are focusing on the wrong thing to ignore the success of carrying a lander to a comet and getting it on the surface.\\" The lander detached from the Rosetta spacecraft orbiting 13.7 miles (22 kilometers) above comet 67P Churyumov–Gerasimenko on Wednesday, landing on the 3.1-mile-long (5-kilometer-long) comet that same day. During the landing at its intended site, called Agilkia, the lander's stabilizing rocket and two anchoring harpoons failed to fire. On Earth, Philae weighs 187 pounds (85 kilograms), but gravity is so weak on Comet 67P—hundreds of thousands of times weaker than Earth—that it weighs about an ounce there. The harpoons were intended to keep the probe from drifting off the surface of the comet. Instead, the unsecured lander bounced off the comet's surface, touching down again nearly two hours later, and then bouncing once more before finally settling, apparently in a shadowed crater beside a cliff. (See \\"Space Probe Philae Bounces on a Comet.\\") Japan's Hayabusa spacecraft, which landed on an asteroid in 2005, encountered similar travails. Its MINERVA mini-lander was designed to hop on the space rock but instead drifted into space. In the shadows, the solar panels of Philae failed to recharge, leaving it helpless after its 2.5-day batteries died. \\"From now on, no contact would be possible unless sufficient sunlight falls on the solar panels to generate enough power to wake it up,\\" said mission controllers. There is some hope of rousing Philae from its sleep. Before the lander shut down, mission controllers rotated Philae's main body about 125 degrees (some 35 percent of the way around its axis), which should have shifted its main solar panel. \\"This may have exposed more panel area to sunlight,\\" said the ESA, perhaps allowing the lander's batteries to recharge. Even if Philae is never revived, the mission will continue to deliver more new science. Scientists are analyzing data from Philae's final communication, and will receive much more information from the Rosetta orbiter, expected to keep orbiting the comet until December 2015. The orbiter, currently about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) away from 67P, will slowly spiral in until it's only a mile or two from the comet's surface, at which point its cameras will be able to pick out details just a few inches across. Light reflected from the surface and into spectrographs will tell scientists the contents of 67P's outer crust. Rosetta will also add to Philae's data on the composition of gases released from the interior. Already, the orbiter has detected hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, formaldehyde, and hydrogen cyanide along with water and carbon dioxide. As the comet makes its closest approach to the sun next summer, the orbiter will study the comet as it heats up. Michael D. Lemonick contributed to this article. ||||| A probe named Philae is seen after it landed safely on a comet, known as 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, in this CIVA handout image released November 13, 2014. A pioneering robotic spacecraft shut down on Saturday after radioing results of its first and probably last batch of scientific experiments from the surface of a comet, scientists said. Batteries aboard the European Space Agency’s Philae comet lander drained, shutting down the washing machine-sized probe after an adventurous and largely unscripted 57-hour mission. Carried aboard the orbiting Rosetta mothership, Philae floated to the surface of comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko on Thursday, but failed to deploy anchoring harpoons. Upon contacting the comet’s unexpectedly hard surface, it bounced back up into space twice then came to rest at a still-unknown location about 1 km (0.6 mile) from its original target. Photos and other data relayed by Philae show it finally landed against a cliff or crater wall where there was little sunlight to recharge its batteries. Racing against the clock, scientists activated a series of automated experiments, the first to be conducted from the surface of a comet. Before dying, Philae defied the odds and radioed its science results back to Earth for analysis. Its last task was to reposition itself so that as the comet soars toward the sun, Philae’s batteries may recharge enough for a follow-on mission. “Perhaps when we are nearer to the sun we might have enough solar illumination to wake up the lander and re-establish communication,” spacecraft operations manager Stephan Ulamec said in a statement. Scientists are particularly interested in learning about the chemical composition of any organic molecules in samples drilled out from the comet’s body. Comets are believed to be pristine remnants from the formation of our solar system some 4.6 billion years ago. They contain rock and ice that have preserved ancient organic molecules like a time capsule and may provide insight into how the planets and life evolved. Philae's drill descended more than 25 cm (10 inches) on Friday, penetrating the comet’s surface. Rosetta in August became the first spacecraft to put itself into orbit around a comet. It will accompany the comet as it travels toward the sun for at least another 13 months.

Since the moon is the primary force driving tides, a reduction in the moon's gravitational pull could lead to smaller waves and lower tides. This change could result in less force exerted on the coastline, reducing the overall erosion by the ocean. In the erosion process described: - Ocean waves hitting land might be smaller and less powerful. - Ocean water pulling sand off of beaches might occur at a slower rate. - Ocean water breaking rocks off of cliffs might be less frequent or less intense. - Ocean water carrying sand and rocks into the ocean might be less effective.

Who's film \\"Le Monde du silence\\" won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957, Louis Malle or Arne Sucksdorff? A:","completion":"Louis Malle did not win the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957 for the film \\"Le Monde du silence.\\" Instead, it was Jacques-Yves Cousteau who co-directed the film with Louis Malle and whose film won these prestigious honors. \\"Le Monde du silence\\" (The Silent World) is a French documentary film co-directed by Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle. The film was released in 1956 and is based on Cousteau's book of the same name. It showcased the beauty of the underwater world and highlighted the importance of protecting the marine environment for future generations. Jacques-Yves Cousteau, a renowned French naval officer, explorer, and conservationist, had a deep passion for the oceans and their mysterious underwater inhabitants. In fact, Cousteau was one of the primary inventors of the \\"aqua-lung,\\" the predecessor to modern scuba diving equipment, which allowed divers to explore the oceans with unprecedented freedom. Louis Malle, on the other hand, was a prominent French film director, screenwriter, and producer. Malle is known for his groundbreaking, thought-provoking, and often controversial works such as \\"The Lovers\\" (1958), \\"Murmur of the Heart\\" (1971), and \\"Au revoir les enfants\\" (1987). While initially working on the \\"Le Monde du silence\\" project as an underwater cinematographer, Malle's artistic and storytelling vision gave the film a unique and captivating direction that contributed to its success. Together, Cousteau and Malle's collaborative effort resulted in the creation of \\"Le Monde du silence,\\" which captured the magic and wonder of the underwater world using innovative underwater filming techniques. The film fascinated global audiences and garnered critical acclaim, winning the Palme d'Or at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival and the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1957. The success of the film marked a pivotal moment in both French cinema and marine conservation awareness, paving the way for future generations of oceanographers and filmmakers to follow in Cousteau and Malle's footsteps. In summary, while both Jacques-Yves Cousteau and Louis Malle played significant roles in the making of \\"Le Monde du silence,\\" it was Cousteau, not Arne Sucksdorff, who is often credited as the primary driving force behind the film. With Malle's cinematic expertise and Cousteau's unmatched passion for ocean exploration, the two artists forged an unforgettable film that won the Palme d'Or in 1956 and the Academy Award for Best Documentary in 1957."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Sorry, I Left My Memory in the Other Room Ever forget the reason why you walked into a room seconds after you enter, even though you know you are there for a reason? You stand in the doorway wondering, “I know I came in here for something!” If you answered yes, you may go as far as to rationalize that this is why it happens: ‘Well, our lives are so overburdened, and that’s why so many of us buzz around like caffeinated cheetahs crossing things our mental checklists. So many things to remember: gym clothes, umbrella, kids’ soccer practice and piano lessons…’ And then it happens — just as you walk into another room to perform one of those super important tasks, you can’t, for the love of God, remember what it was! It’s annoying … and as it turns out, pretty common. A recent study out in the Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology validates this kind of forgetfulness and says the trigger may be as benign as passing through a doorway. Who knew? The study authors refer to the phenomena as the “location-updating effect,” which suggests there may be a decline in memory when you move from one location to another. The location change doesn’t have to be dramatic; walking into the next room is all it takes. The study questions whether this memory lapse has to do with a shift in context or whether there is something more to be learned about how we experience certain environments. The working theory is that when you enter a new room or environment, your brain works to update your understanding of what’s going on around you. As it turns out, this is a lot of work (it’s “effortful”, the authors say) for your buzzing brain. The study consisted of three experiments in which college students performed memory tasks either while changing their location in a room or while exiting a doorway into another room. The lead author, University of Notre Dame psychology professor Gabriel Radvansky, found that students forgot more when walking through a doorway than when they just moved across the room. Radvansky suggests that doorways create a sort of “event boundary” and prevent us from being able to retrieve thoughts and decisions we, ironically, likely left in the previous room. This isn’t the first study in this area. Previous research has shown that environment can affect memory and that we are better at accessing information we have learned if we try to retrieve it in the same social context. Guess that means it’s a good thing that most of us work in the same office every day. Otherwise, our jobs might be a lot more taxing on our memories. The series of experiments within the study, conducted at University of Notre Dame, had participants move through both virtual environments and real ones, suggesting that there may be some validity to this idea. But even personal experience may point to this forgetting phenomenon. When this study was sent around the Medical Unit here at ABC News, there was a roar of approval for the theory. Senior producer Ann Reynolds said, “I get an invitation and I think, ‘Are we busy that night? I’ll check the calendar.’ I know the calendar is in the kitchen, so I think ‘kitchen’ — and when I get there, I think, ‘What could I possibly have wanted in the kitchen at 10 o’clock at night?’ So I head back to the bedroom, where I see the invitation I was wondering about. … Arrrgh.” Arrrgh is right. But at least now, we have the beginnings of understanding why.

Today, we are going to learn some simple and easy ways to fix a leaking reservoir and solve the problem of drop in water pressure in a way that even a five year old can understand. So let's get started! First of all, you might wonder, what is a reservoir? A reservoir is a big container or tank that holds water. You might have seen one in your house, maybe in your kitchen, the bathroom or somewhere else. Now, let's learn some steps to fix the problems. Step 1: Read the Instruction Manual Before we do anything, it is very important to read the instruction manual. This is a booklet with lots of pictures and words that tell us how to use or fix something. Ask your mommy or daddy to read it to you or help you understand what it says. The manual will give you lots of helpful information on how to fix the leaking reservoir and the drop in water pressure. Step 2: Buy Replacement Parts Sometimes, when a reservoir is leaking or the water pressure is low, it means you might need to buy new parts to replace the old ones that are not working properly. You can go to a shop where they sell these parts with your mom or dad, and ask the shopkeeper to show you the parts that you need. Make sure to take the instruction manual with you, so you can tell the shopkeeper exactly which parts you need. Step 3: Fix the Drop in Water Pressure Now, let's learn how to fix the drop in water pressure. This means the water is not coming out as fast as it should be, and we will need your help to fix it! First, find the water valve. A water valve is like a little door that lets more or less water through when you open or close it. It might be a round wheel or a handle you need to turn. The instruction manual will help you find it. With the help of your parents, carefully turn the valve to open it up a little bit more so that more water can flow through and your water pressure will go back to normal! Step 4: Fix the Leaking Reservoir It's now time to fix that leak! A \\"leak\\" means that water is coming out of something when it should not be. The leaking might be happening because a part is broken or not in the right place. Remember those replacement parts you bought earlier? This is when they will come in handy! Ask your parent to help you find the part that is causing the leak and show you how to replace it using the instruction manual. Make sure to be patient and follow each step slowly and carefully. And that's it! By following these simple steps, you have learned how to fix a leaking reservoir and a drop in water pressure. Congratulations, little helper! You have done a great job, and now you can enjoy fresh water without any problems!"},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Please answer the following question: I have a new situation: The Madrigal Ocean and the Listy Ocean are two bodies of water currently under observation by scientists on a planet nearly identical to Earth. Although the studies have just started, the scientists have already discovered that the salinity of the Madrigal Ocean is much lower than that of the Listy Ocean. This isn't much information, but it's progress and the scientists are not going to stop their studies until they learn all that they can about these waters.

It is partly covered by sea ice throughout the year and almost completely in winter. The Arctic Ocean's surface temperature and salinity vary seasonally as the ice cover melts and freezes; its salinity is the lowest on average of the five major oceans, due to low evaporation, heavy fresh water inflow from rivers and streams, and limited connection and outflow to surrounding oceanic waters with higher salinities. The summer shrinking of the ice has been quoted at 50%. The US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC) uses satellite data to provide a daily record of Arctic sea ice cover and the rate of melting compared to an average period and specific past years. What is an answer for this question: Which ocean is probably connected to less oceans with higher salinities?

Q:Information: - Color (American English) or colour (Commonwealth English) is the characteristic of human visual perception described through color \\"categories\\", with names such as red, yellow, purple, or bronze. This perception of color derives from the stimulation of cone cells in the human eye by electromagnetic radiation in the spectrum of light. Color categories and physical specifications of color are associated with objects through the wavelength of the light that is reflected from them. This reflection is governed by the object's physical properties such as light absorption, emission spectra, etc. Human trichromacy is the basis for all modern color spaces that assign colors numerical coordinates and associate corresponding distances between colors. - Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 185329 July 1890) was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. His suicide at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty. - Theodorus \`\` Theo '' van Gogh ( Dutch pronunciation : ( teodors teo vn x ) ; 1 May 1857 -- 25 January 1891 ) was a Dutch art dealer . He was the younger brother of Vincent van Gogh , and Theo 's unfailing financial and emotional support allowed his brother to devote himself entirely to painting . Theo died at the age of 33 , six months after his brother died at the age of 37 . - Painting is the practice of applying paint, pigment, color or other medium to a solid surface (support base).

Article: I'm a blind teenager girl, but I am ashamed of it if it is known. I refuse to use a white stick and hate asking for help, and I couldn't bear people to look at me and think I am not like them. I must be a terrible danger on the roads. Coming across me wandering through the traffic, motorists probably would have to step rapidly on their brakes. Apart from that, there are all sorts of disasters that used to occur on the way to and from work. One evening, I got off the bus about halfway home where I had to change buses, and as usual I ran into something. \\"I'm awfully sorry,\\" I said and stepped forward only to run into it again. When it happened a third time, I realized I had been apologizing to a lamppost. This was just one of the stupid things that constantly happened to me. So I carried on and found the bus stop, which was a request stop, where the bus wouldn't stop unless passengers wanted to get on or off. No one else was there and I had to try to guess if the bus had arrived. Generally in this situation, because I hated showing I was blind by asking for help, I tried to guess at the sound. Sometimes I would stop a big lorry and stand there feeling stupid as it drew away. In the end, I usually managed to swallow my pride and ask someone at the stop for help. But on this particular evening no one joined me at the stop; it seemed that everyone had suddenly decided not to travel by bus. Of course I heard plenty of buses pass, or I thought I did. But because I had given up stopping them for fear of making a fool of myself, I let them all go by. I stood there alone for half an hour without stopping one. Then I gave up. I decided to walk on to the next stop.

The text does not mention her parents, her trying to find the bus herself, or her hoping to hear more buses at the next stop.

The Chinese New Year is now known as the Spring Festival because it starts from the beginning of spring. Though there are some sayings about its origin, all agree that the word Nian, which in modern Chinese means \\"year\\", was originally the name of a beast that started to eat people the night before the beginning of a new year. One story goes that the beast Nian had a very big mouth that would take in a great many people at one time. People were very afraid. One day, an old man came to their help and said he would stop all this. He said to Nian, \\"I hear that you are very strong, but can you eat up all the beasts on earth instead of people who are too weak to be your enemies?\\" \\"Yes,\\" Nian agreed with him and went to kill many of the beasts on earth. People were very happy because those beasts also did bad things to people and killed their farm animals from time to time. After that, the old man, who was a god, rode on the beast Nian and left. Nian was gone, and other beasts also went into forests; people began to enjoy their happy life. Before the old man left, he had told people to put up red paper-cuts on their windows and doors at each year's end to drive Nian away, because red is the color the beast felt most afraid of. From then on, every year at the beginning of spring, people prepare to \\"Guo Nian\\". The word \\"Guo Nian\\" means \\"go through the Nian safely\\". Putting up red paper-cuts to drive Nian away and making dumplings for a better new year are still an every-year doing by the Chinese people. However, people today have long forgotten why they are doing all this, they just feel the color and the food make the New Year very enjoyable.","completion":"Which of the following best describes the origin of the Chinese New Year traditions mentioned in the article?

Cancer deaths were up 8 percent from 7.6 million in a previous survey in 2008 and breast cancer killed 522,000 women last year, up 14 percent in the same period, according to the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC). \\"Breast cancer is also a leading cause of cancer death in the less developed countries of the world,\\" said David Forman, head of IARC's Section of Cancer Information, the group that compiles the global cancer data. RELATED: ALL AIR POLLUTION CAUSES CANCER: WHO He said this was \\"partly because a shift in lifestyles is causing an increase in incidence, and partly because clinical advances to combat the disease are not reaching women living in these regions.\\" An estimated 14.1 million people developed cancer in 2012, up from 12.7 million in 2008. And 1.7 million women were newly diagnosed with breast cancer last year, up by more than 20 percent from 2008. IARC's report, called GLOBOCAN 2012, gives the most up-to-date estimates for 28 different types of cancer in 184 countries and offers an overview of the global cancer burden. RELATED: GENE THERAPY SHOWS ‘EXTRAORDINARILY HIGH’ PROMISE IN CURING BLOOD CANCERS It found that the most commonly diagnosed cancers worldwide in men and women combined were lung, breast and colorectal cancers. The most common causes of cancer death were lung, liver and stomach cancers. Projecting forward, IARC experts said they expected \\"a substantive increase\\" in cancer cases worldwide, with annual new cases predicted to rise to 19.3 million by 2025 as the global population both grows and ages. RELATED: VIDEO: WOMAN THROWS FLASH MOB DANCE PARTY BEFORE DOUBLE MASTECTOMY Worldwide trends show that in developing countries going through rapid societal and economic change, the shift towards lifestyles more typical of richer industrialised countries leads to a rising burden of cancers linked to reproduction, diet and hormones. The IARC report said cancer incidence — the number of new cases each year — has been increasing in most regions of the world, but noted what it said were \\"huge inequalities\\" between rich and poor countries. While rates of new cancer cases are still highest in more developed regions, death rates are relatively much higher in less developed countries because people's tumours are often not detected and diagnosed early enough due to a lack of screening and access to treatment. RELATED: NYPD COPS’ CANCER RATE SOARS POST-9/11 \\"An urgent need in cancer control today is to develop effective and affordable approaches to the early detection, diagnosis, and treatment of breast cancer among women living in less developed countries,\\" said Christopher Wild, IARC's director. He said it was critical to bring rates of disease and death in poorer countries in line with progress made in recent years in treating and curing some cancers on wealthier countries. One stark example of the inequality is in cervical cancer - which kills hundreds of thousands of women in Africa each year but can be largely avoided with a vaccine or successfully treated if it is picked up early enough with screening. In sub-Saharan Africa, 34.8 new cases of cervical cancer are diagnosed per 100,000 women each year, and 22.5 per 100,000 women die from the disease. That compares with 6.6 and 2.5 per 100,000 women respectively in North America. \\"These findings bring into sharp focus the need to implement the tools already available for cervical cancer, notably HPV vaccination combined with well organised national programmes for screening and treatment,\\" Wild said.

Cynics such as Diogenes of Sinope rejected all material possessions and social conventions (nomos) as unnatural and useless. The Cyrenaics meanwhile, embraced hedonism, arguing that pleasure was the only true good. Stoicism, founded by Zeno of Citium, taught that virtue was sufficient for eudaimonia as it would allow one to live in accordance with Nature or Logos.

Question: Machines make work easier by increasing the amount of force that is applied, increasing the distance over which the force is applied, or changing the direction in which the force is applied. Contrary to popular belief, machines do not increase the amount of work that is done. They just change how the work is done. So if a machine increases the force applied, it must apply the force over a shorter distance. Similarly, if a machine increases the distance over which the force is applied, it must apply less force. John wanted to invent a machine. To that end, he devised an experiment in which he used three components, comp A, comp B, and comp C. Comp A was a machine that applied force over a shorter distance. Comp B was also a machine, but it applied force over a longer distance. Comp C was not a machine. Would comp A increase or not increase the force applied compared to comp B? Answer:","completion":"Given the principles of machines, Comp A, which applies force over a shorter distance, would typically increase the force applied compared to Comp B, which applies force over a longer distance. This is based on the concept of mechanical advantage in physics. If a machine applies force over a shorter distance, it tends to increase the force that it applies. Similarly, if a machine applies the force over a longer distance, it tends to apply less force. This is in order to maintain the balance of work done because work is the product of force and distance (Work = Force x Distance). So if a machine increases the distance (like Comp B), it decreases the force. And if a machine decreases the distance (like Comp A), it increases the force. In other words, Comp A, due to its function of applying force over a shorter distance in your description, it should increase the force applied when compared to Comp B. This would hold true as long as the total work done remains the same, which is the underlying principle of how machines work. They make the work easier by changing the way it's done, not by changing the total amount of work. However, the specific increase in force would depend on the actual design and efficiency of the machine, among other factors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Austin will likely make some money from selling their shoes. Selling unused or unwanted items is a common practice in many cultures, whether through traditional methods like garage sales or flea markets, or via online platforms like eBay, Depop, or Facebook Marketplace. It's often seen as a practical and environmentally friendly way to get rid of things you no longer need. Firstly, by selling their shoes, Austin is also likely to make a bit of a profit which can then be invested in new items or even saved up for future use. This could be especially beneficial if the shoes being sold are of good quality or from a renowned brand, as this could potentially increase their market value. Moreover, selling items that are still in good condition instead of throwing them away helps to reduce waste. It's a great example of the concept of a circular economy, where items are reused or repurposed instead of being discarded, thus minimizing the amount of waste that goes to landfill. This can also contribute to resource efficiency, as it reduces the need to produce new items. Additionally, by selling the shoes, Austin is providing an opportunity for someone else to use and enjoy them. Many people appreciate the possibility of buying second-hand items for a variety of reasons - it's often more affordable than buying new, it's a method of sustainable consumption, and sometimes, it even implies finding unique or vintage items that aren't available in conventional stores. Lastly, selling their unwanted items could be a learning experience for Austin. They're likely to develop skills such as negotiation and pricing methods, online advertising, customer service, and possibly even business management. These are some of the outcomes that could result from Austin deciding to sell their shoes in the market. While it might not be a significant change in their life, it's definitely a step towards a more sustainable lifestyle, and it could also contribute to their personal development or financial situation. Ultimately, the result of these actions depends on multiple variables such as the demand for the shoes in the market, their condition and brand, and Austin's selling skills.

(CNN) -- A flurry of last-minute legal maneuvers Tuesday spared, for now, the life of John Ferguson, a Florida death row inmate who suffers from mental illness and at one point called himself the 'prince of God.' Ferguson, a diagnosed schizophrenic convicted of killing eight people, was scheduled to get the lethal injection Tuesday at 6 p.m. ET at a Florida State Prison. But an appeals court in Atlanta granted an emergency stay of execution Tuesday night. Florida officials then asked the Supreme Court to allow the lethal injection to proceed. Just before midnight the high court denied Florida's request, keeping in place the stay of execution, according to court documents. Some had questioned why authorities would kill a man who suffered from mental illness. Laurel Bellows, the president of the American Bar Association, released a statement earlier Tuesday saying she was concerned about how thoroughly Ferguson's competency was evaluated. \\"The American Bar Association is alarmed that Florida is poised to execute John Ferguson, a man diagnosed as severely mentally ill for more than 40 years, before the constitutionality of his execution is fully evaluated.\\" Chris Handman, one of Ferguson's attorneys, told CNN. \\"We think the court should intervene to stop that execution from going forward.\\" Handman said a court had earlier found that Ferguson was mentally ill and had delusions that caused him to think he is the \\"Prince of God.\\" Ferguson is on death row for the murders of eight people in Hialeah and Carol City, Florida, in the late 1970s.

Step 2: Identify the possible sources of the name Based on the historical context, I will identify the potential sources of the word 'Rome,' which may include names of prominent figures, geographical features, or cultural references related to the city. Step 3: Determine the most likely origin of the name After assessing the various possibilities, I will determine the most likely origin of the name 'Rome' based on the evidence available and the best knowledge we have about the city's history. From my research: Rome, the capital of Italy, was founded in 753 BC according to the Roman mythology. The name \\"Rome\\" is most likely derived from its legendary founder and the first king, Romulus. The legend says that Romulus and his twin brother, Remus, were raised by a she-wolf after being abandoned as infants. The two brothers decided to create a city, but due to a disagreement on the location, Romulus killed Remus and founded the city on Palatine Hill, naming it after himself.

You may recall that I’d been helping out a local charity with their website?

I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

In the first test the air flow works as it would in an airplane wing. He labels it as case A. In the second test the air flow works as it would in a race car spoiler. He labels it as case B. He is surprised to see that air flow behaves differently in different situations. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would case A have faster or slower air flow above it than case B? Hint: Bernoulli’s law explains how the wings of both airplanes and birds create lift that allows flight (see Figure below ). The shape of the wings causes air to flow more quickly — and air pressure to be lower — above the wings than below them. This allows the wings to lift the plane or bird above the ground against the pull of gravity. A spoiler on a race car, like the one in Figure below , works in the opposite way. Its shape causes air to flow more slowly — and air pressure to be greater — above the spoiler than below it. As a result, air pressure pushes the car downward, giving its wheels better traction on the track. Answer:","completion":"Given the information provided, it can be concluded that case A, which represents the air flow as it would be in an airplane wing, would have faster air flow above it than case B, which represents the air flow as it would be in a race car spoiler. The reason for this difference can be explained using Bernoulli's law, which states that the pressure of a fluid decreases as its velocity increases. In an airplane wing, the shape causes the air to flow more quickly above the wing, and as a result, the air pressure is lower above the wing than below it. This difference in pressure generates lift, allowing the airplane to rise above the ground and maintain flight. On the other hand, a race car spoiler operates in the opposite manner. The shape of the spoiler causes the air to flow more slowly above it, resulting in greater air pressure above the spoiler than below it. This increased air pressure pushes the car downward, providing better traction between the wheels and the track surface, allowing the car to maintain stability and achieve higher speeds without losing contact with the track. Therefore, case A would have faster air flow above it, while case B would have slower air flow above it, as their respective designs serve different purposes in terms of manipulating air pressure and flow to achieve either lift for an airplane or increased traction for a race car."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Native Americans, also known as American Indians, Indians, Indigenous Americans and other terms, are the indigenous peoples of the United States. There are over 500 federally recognized tribes within the U.S., about half of which are associated with Indian reservations. The term excludes Native Hawaiians and some Alaska Natives. The ancestors of modern Native Americans arrived in what is now the United States at least 15,000 years ago, possibly much earlier, from Asia via Beringia. After the Indian wars in the late 19th century, the government established Native American boarding schools, initially run primarily by or affiliated with Christian missionaries. At this time, American society thought that Native American children needed to be acculturated to the general society. The boarding school experience was a total immersion in modern American society, but it could prove traumatic to children, who were forbidden to speak their native languages. They were taught Christianity and not allowed to practice their native religions, and in numerous other ways forced to abandon their Native American identities. Before the 1930s, schools on the reservations provided no schooling beyond the sixth grade. To obtain more, boarding school was usually necessary. Small reservations with a few hundred people usually sent their children to nearby public schools. The \\"Indian New Deal\\" of the 1930s closed many of the boarding schools, and downplayed the assimilationist goals. The Indian Division of the Civilian Conservation Corps operated large-scale construction projects on the reservations, building thousands of new schools and community buildings. Under the leadership of John Collier the BIA brought in progressive educators to reshape Indian education. The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) by 1938 taught 30,000 students in 377 boarding and day schools, or 40% of all Indian children in school. The Navajo largely opposed schooling of any sort, but the other tribes accepted the system. There were now high schools on larger reservations, educating not only teenagers but also an adult audience. There were no Indian facilities for higher education. They deemphasized textbooks, emphasized self-esteem, and started teaching Indian history. They promoted traditional arts and crafts of the sort that could be conducted on the reservations, such as making jewelry. The New Deal reformers met significant resistance from parents and teachers, and had mixed results. World War II brought younger Indians in contact with the broader society through military service and work in the munitions industries. The role of schooling was changed to focus on vocational education for jobs in urban America. Since the rise of self-determination for Native Americans, they have generally emphasized education of their children at schools near where they live. In addition, many federally recognized tribes have taken over operations of such schools and added programs of language retention and revival to strengthen their cultures. Beginning in the 1970s, tribes have also founded colleges at their reservations, controlled, and operated by Native Americans, to educate their young for jobs as well as to pass on their cultures.

A Unique Method of Protest: The Free Keene movement, which primarily consists of two dozen activists led by Ian Freeman, has made a splash in the city by targeting parking regulations. Members of the group approach parking enforcement officers, feed meters before 5 tickets can be written, and engage in discussions about their faith and military service while recording these interactions with video cameras. In addition, the group distributes leaflets condemning parking regulations and pretends to drink alcohol during City Hall meetings. Mixed Reactions from Residents: Some Keene residents have expressed gratitude and even made donations to the Free Keene movement. However, there have also been reports of harassment allegations and litigation against the group, causing discomfort amongst locals. A nurse and beekeeper living in Keene described the current atmosphere as being on edge. Leader’s Background and Controversies: Ian Freeman, originally from Florida, arrived in New Hampshire to promote libertarianism in a state whose license plates boldly declare \\"Live Free or Die.\\" Freeman’s activism has led to several arrests, one of which was for allegedly obtaining multiple identification cards from the Department of Motor Vehicles. Freeman also supports the use of video cameras to capture interactions with parking enforcement officers, arguing that if their job is too stressful, it may not be the right one for them. In addition to leading the Free Keene movement, Freeman also broadcasts a Free Talk Live radio show.

One opposing organizer questioned the group's intentions, asking, \\"Who asked you to come free us?\\" Conclusion: While the Free Keene movement's unique tactics have garnered attention and support, they have also created controversy and tensions within the city.

Le Deuxième Concile du Vatican, également connu sous le nom de Vatican II, a été un concile œcuménique très important de l'Église catholique. Il s'est déroulé en plusieurs sessions entre 1962 et 1965 et a rassemblé les évêques du monde entier pour discuter de questions clés concernant la doctrine, la liturgie et les relations de l'Église avec le monde moderne. La première période du concile a commencé le 11 octobre 1962 et s'est terminée le 8 décembre de la même année. Durant cette première session, les évêques et autres participants ont engagé des discussions sur les divers documents préparés à l'avance par la commission théologique. Ces débats portaient sur des sujets tels que la réforme liturgique, la nature de l'Église et la liberté religieuse. Cependant, la clôture de la première période n'a marqué que la fin des premières réflexions et débats sur ces questions importantes. Les trois sessions suivantes, qui se sont déroulées au cours des années suivantes, ont permis d'approfondir ces discussions et d'établir un ensemble de documents conciliaires qui traduisent les réformes et les engagements du Concile Vatican II. Parmi les documents importants issus de ce concile figurent la Constitution dogmatique sur l'Église \\"Lumen gentium\\", la Constitution sur la sainte liturgie \\"Sacrosanctum Concilium\\" et la Déclaration sur la liberté religieuse \\"Dignitatis humanae\\". En fin de compte, le Second Concile du Vatican a représenté un tournant majeur dans l'histoire de l'Église catholique, marquant le début d'une nouvelle ère de dialogue, de coopération œcuménique et d'engagement avec la société moderne. La clôture de la première période du concile le 8 décembre 1962 a été une étape importante dans le processus qui a conduit à ces changements significatifs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In this task, you are given a context, a subject, a relation, and many options. Based on the context, from the options select the object entity that has the given relation with the subject. Answer with text (not indexes). Context: Afghan (Pashto also Persian: ; see \\"etymology\\") refers to someone or something from Afghanistan, in particular a citizen of that country. Prior to the rise of the nation as Afghanistan, it was used by Persian speakers and those influenced by the Persian language to denote the Pashtun people. In modern times, \\"Afghan\\" is rarely used as an ethnic term for the Pashtuns, but is rather used as the national demonym for all citizens of Afghanistan Pashtuns, Tajiks, and also a large number of Hazaras, Uzbeks, Aimaqs, Turkmens, Balochs, Nuristanis, Pashayis, Pamiris, Arabs, and others. According to the \\"Encyclopædia Iranica\\", the word Afghan (afn) in current political usage means any citizen of Afghanistan, regardless of their tribal or religious affiliation. According to the 1964 Constitution of Afghanistan, all Afghans are equal in rights and obligations before the law. The fourth article of the current Constitution of Afghanistan states that citizens of Afghanistan consist of Pashtuns, Tajiks, Hazara, Uzbek, Turkmen, Aymaq, Arab, Baluch, Pashayi, Nuristani, Qezelbash, Gujjars, Brahui, and members of other tribes., Urbanization refers to the population shift from rural to urban areas, \\"the gradual increase in the proportion of people living in urban areas\\", and the ways in which each society adapts to the change. It is predominantly the process by which towns and cities are formed and become larger as more people begin living and working in central areas. The United Nations projected that half of the world's population would live in urban areas at the end of 2008. It is predicted that by 2050 about 64% of the developing world and 86% of the developed world will be urbanized. That is equivalent to approximately 3 billion urbanites by 2050, much of which will occur in Africa and Asia. Notably, the United Nations has also recently projected that nearly all global population growth from 2016 to 2030 will be absorbed by cities, about 1.1 billion new urbanites over the next 14 years., Afghanistan (Pashto/Dari: , \\"Afnistn\\"), officially the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, is a landlocked country located within South Asia and Central Asia. It has a population of approximately 32 million, making it the 42nd most populous country in the world. It is bordered by Pakistan in the south and east; Iran in the west; Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, and Tajikistan in the north; and China in the far northeast. Its territory covers , making it the 41st largest country in the world., Pashto (; \\"Paxt\\" ), also known in older literature as Afghn or Pahn, is the South-Central Asian language of the Pashtuns. Its speakers are called Pashtuns or Pukhtuns and sometimes Afghans or Pathans. It is an Eastern Iranian language, belonging to the Indo-European family. Pashto is one of the two official languages of Afghanistan, and it is the second-largest regional language of Pakistan, mainly spoken in the west and northwest of the country. Pakistan's Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) are almost 100% Pashto-speaking, while it is the majority language of the province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and the northern districts of Balochistan. Pashto is the main language among the Pashtun diaspora around the world. The total number of Pashto-speakers is estimated to be 4560 million people worldwide., Kabul (Pashto/) is the capital of Afghanistan as well as its largest city, located in the eastern section of the country. According to a 2015 estimate, the population of the city was around 3,678,033 which includes all the major ethnic groups. Rapid urbanization had made Kabul the world's 64th largest city and the fifth fastest-growing city in the world., Parween Pazhwak ( born in 1967 in Kabul ) is an Afghan artist from Afghanistan and a modern poet and writer of the Persian language .

Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"The perturbation of leaving bread out in the air and its effect on global warming causing winters to be warmer can be considered as indirectly impacting a step of the process relating to animal hibernation. To fully understand the connection between these factors, let us break down the sequence of events. 1. Bread left out in the air: This act on its own doesn't have a significant impact on global warming. However, the production of bread and its ingredients (wheat, transportation, etc.) contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Global warming causes winters to be warmer: As greenhouse gas emissions increase due to various human activities, Earth's average temperature rises, leading to warmer winters in many regions. Now, let's examine the indirect impact of warmer winters on the animal hibernation process: A. Animals eat a lot during good (warm, clear) weather: Warmer winters can lead to an extension of the feeding season for certain animals, potentially resulting in increased food consumption and weight gain before hibernation. B. The season changes to one with bad (cold, snowy) weather: With warmer winters, the severity and duration of harsh winter conditions might be reduced. This could affect the timing and length of hibernation periods for some animals. C. Animals find a place to hibernate and enter hibernation: The alterations in weather patterns and temperatures might affect an animal's ability to find suitable hibernation sites or trigger hibernation at the appropriate time. D. Body processes slow down, heart rate and breathing rate slow, animal loses weight more slowly: Warmer ambient temperatures during winter may cause an animal's metabolic rate to remain more elevated than in colder conditions, possibly resulting in lower energy conservation during hibernation. E. The animal survives without eating or drinking: Since the overall hibernation process may be affected by warmer winters, an animal's ability to survive without food and water might be indirectly impacted. In conclusion, the act of leaving bread out in the air does not have a direct impact on the animal hibernation process. However, the indirect effects of global warming on winter temperatures can influence various steps in the hibernation process, altering the feeding patterns, hibernation timing, and energy conservation mechanisms for some animals."},{"prompt":"Given the question: Title: WACK AS H@# Review: This CD is totally wack, I cant belive I bought this crap.

Kim In Ryong claimed that North Korea had hoped for a nuclear-free world, however, due to the \\"extreme\\" threat from the US, the country has been forced to become a \\"full-fledged\\" nuclear power. The tensions between North Korea and the United States have escalated significantly, as North Korea continues to develop its nuclear capabilities. The country now claims that the \\"entire US mainland is within our firing range.\\" North Korea's nuclear program has been a significant cause of concern for the international community, with numerous countries, including the United States, South Korea, Japan, and China, urging Pyongyang to halt its aggressive pursuit of nuclear weapons. In response to the substantial threat, the United Nations has imposed multiple rounds of sanctions on North Korea, aiming to cut off sources of funding and support for the country's nuclear and ballistic missile development. Despite these sanctions, North Korea continues to test-launch ballistic missiles and carry out nuclear tests in direct defiance of the international community. While UN sanctions have had some impact on the North Korean economy, they have not deterred the regime's pursuit of nuclear weapons. In fact, the situation has only grown more precarious, as evidenced by the increasing number and range of missile tests conducted by Pyongyang throughout the past year. As part of the international response to North Korea's nuclear ambitions, Russia has also committed to cutting ties with the country to comply with new UN sanctions. Russian President Vladimir Putin announced this decision recently, which may signify a substantial shift in global efforts to curb the North Korean nuclear threat. While Moscow has been seen as a long-time benefactor of North Korea, this latest move puts increased pressure on China – North Korea's primary ally – to become more proactive in handling the crisis. Another significant factor in the situation is the anticipated visit of US President Donald Trump to Asia next month, where he may visit the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) that separates North and South Korea. This visit could heighten tensions between Washington and Pyongyang even further, potentially pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a tipping point. In conclusion, the complex web of geopolitics, diplomacy, and military threats surrounding the Korean Peninsula has escalated to new heights, with the potential for a catastrophic conflict becoming increasingly palpable. North Korea's efforts to perfect a long-range intercontinental missile capable of reaching the US mainland have intensified global anxieties and may only serve to push the two adversaries closer to the precipice of nuclear war. While diplomatic efforts are still ongoing, it remains uncertain what the future may hold and whether the prospects for peace on the Korean Peninsula can be secured."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Given the below context: In 1894 Wood went to the Wagner festival at Bayreuth where he met the conductor Felix Mottl, who subsequently appointed him as his assistant and chorus master for a series of Wagner concerts at the newly built Queen's Hall in London. The manager of the hall, Robert Newman, was proposing to run a ten-week season of promenade concerts and, impressed by Wood, invited him to conduct. There had been such concerts in London since 1838, under conductors from Louis Antoine Jullien to Arthur Sullivan. Sullivan's concerts in the 1870s had been particularly successful, because he offered his audiences something more than the usual light music. He introduced major classical works, such as Beethoven symphonies, normally restricted to the more expensive concerts presented by the Philharmonic Society and others. Newman aimed to do the same: \\"I am going to run nightly concerts and train the public by easy stages. Popular at first, gradually raising the standard until I have created a public for classical and modern music.\\"Newman's determination to make the promenade concerts attractive to everyone led him to permit smoking during concerts, which was not formally prohibited at the Proms until 1971. Refreshments were available in all parts of the hall throughout the concerts, not only during intervals. Prices were considerably lower than those customarily charged for classical concerts: the promenade (the standing area) was one shilling, the balcony two shillings, and the grand circle (reserved seats) three and five shillings.Newman needed to find financial backing for his first season. Dr George Cathcart, a wealthy ear, nose and throat specialist, offered to sponsor it on two conditions: that Wood should conduct every concert, and that the pitch of the orchestral instruments should be lowered to the European standard diapason normal. Concert pitch in England was nearly a semitone higher than that used on the continent, and Cathcart regarded it as damaging for singers' voices. Wood, from his experience as a singing teacher,...

Kenya McQueen is a successful, single African American woman who has sacrificed romance in order to pursue a career as a certified public accountant. Her obsessive compulsive desire for perfection and control has manifested itself in the bland, monochromatic decor of her new home and the rigid rules she follows in her personal life. Urged to loosen up by her friends, Kenya accepts a blind date with landscape architect Brian Kelly arranged by her co-worker Leah Cahan, who is in the process of planning the kind of wedding Kenya wants herself. The two meet at Starbucks, and she is surprised to discover Brian is white. She quickly excuses herself and leaves. The two unexpectedly meet again at a party at Leah's parents' home, where Brian landscaped the grounds. Impressed with his work, Kenya decides to hire him to renovate her unkempt backyard garden. As time passes, their employer-employee relationship evolves into a friendship and then love. Although Brian is helping her feel more comfortable about her living environment, Kenya finds it difficult to dismiss her reservations about their romance. The opinions of her girlfriends Cheryl, Nedra, and Suzette, her upper class parents Joyce and Edmond, and her womanizing younger brother Nelson begin to have a deleterious effect and Brian's unwillingness to discuss issues of color drives them apart.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Although Bin Laden, Atef, and KSM initially contemplated using established al Qaeda members to execute the planes operation, the late 1999 arrival in Kandahar of four aspiring jihadists from Germany suddenly presented a more attractive alternative. The Hamburg group shared the anti-U.S. fervor of the other candidates for the operation, but added the enormous advantages of fluency in English and familiarity with life in the West, based on years that each member of the group had spent living in Germany. Not surprisingly, Mohamed Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah would all become key players in the 9/11 conspiracy. Mohamed Atta was born on September 1, 1968, in Kafr el Sheikh, Egypt, to a middle-class family headed by his father, an attorney. After graduating from Cairo University with a degree in architectural engineering in 1990, Atta worked as an urban planner in Cairo for a couple of years. In the fall of 1991, he asked a German family he had met in Cairo to help him continue his education in Germany. They suggested he come to Hamburg and invited him to live with them there, at least initially. After completing a course in German, Atta traveled to Germany for the first time in July 1992. He resided briefly in Stuttgart and then, in the fall of 1992, moved to Hamburg to live with his host family. After enrolling at the University of Hamburg, he promptly transferred into the city engineering and planning course at the Technical University of Hamburg-Harburg, where he would remain registered as a student until the fall of 1999. He appears to have applied himself fairly seriously to his studies (at least in comparison to his jihadist friends) and actually received his degree shortly before traveling to Afghanistan. In school, Atta came across as very intelligent and reasonably pleasant, with an excellent command of the German language. When Atta arrived in Germany, he appeared religious, but not fanatically so. This would change, especially as his tendency to assert leadership became increasingly pronounced. According to Binalshibh, as early as 1995 Atta sought to organize a Muslim student association in Hamburg. In the fall of 1997, he joined a working group at the Quds mosque in Hamburg, a group designed to bridge the gap between Muslims and Christians. Atta proved a poor bridge, however, because of his abrasive and increasingly dogmatic personality. But among those who shared his beliefs, Atta stood out as a decisionmaker. Question: \\"Who were the jihadists that met in Germany and determined that fluency in English would better their odds in a successful attack on the US?\\" Response: \\"Atef, KSM, Marwan al Shehhi, and Ziad Jarrah\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"No, the response to the question is not factually correct.

Since german shepherds large, active dogs and are known to have hips that give out, it's important to make sure they have good nutrition throughout their lives. Make sure to buy healthy food that is not full of filler ingredients.","completion":"Taking care of a German Shepherd involves a combination of proper nutrition, regular exercise, grooming, socialization, and preventive healthcare, among other essentials. Below are some detailed steps to ensure your German Shepherd leads a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 1. Feed your German Shepherd high-quality food: As you've already mentioned, nutrition plays a crucial role in your dog's overall health. Choose a food specifically designed for German Shepherds, consisting of high-quality ingredients like real meat, vegetables, and whole grains rather than by-products and fillers. The food should contain the appropriate balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals for your dog's age, size, and activity level. Consult your veterinarian for specific recommendations based on your dog's unique needs. 2. Establish a regular feeding schedule: Feed your adult German Shepherd twice daily, dividing the recommended daily amount of food between the two meals. Be consistent with feeding times to establish a routine. Make sure to measure the food portions accurately to avoid overfeeding and obesity. Keep fresh water available for your dog at all times. 3. Exercise your German Shepherd daily: These dogs are known for their high energy levels and are bred to work. They need daily physical exercise to stay mentally and physically healthy. Schedule at least two 30-minute sessions of exercise every day, such as brisk walks, running, hiking, or playing fetch. Alongside physical exercise, engage in mental stimulation with activities like training exercises, puzzle toys, and indoor games. 4. Socialize your German Shepherd: Expose your dog to various people, other dogs, and environments from a young age to help them become well-adjusted and adaptable. Regular socialization helps prevent behavioral issues, such as fear-based aggression or anxiety. 5. Train your German Shepherd: Begin training at an early age and use positive reinforcement techniques to teach essential commands. This breed is intelligent and eager to learn, so don't limit your dog to just basic training—introduce agility courses, scent work, or other advanced options to keep their minds occupied. 6. Groom your dog regularly: German Shepherds have a thick double coat that requires brushing two to three times a week to remove dead hair, promote healthy skin, and minimize shedding. Regular brushing also strengthens the bond between you and your pet. Bathe your dog every two months or so to keep their coat clean, and check their nails, ears, and teeth regularly for potential issues. 7. Schedule regular veterinary appointments: Take your German Shepherd to a veterinarian for routine checkups, vaccinations, and parasite control measures. Regular exams help detect any health issues early on and ensure that your dog remains in the best possible condition. Discuss your dog's dietary needs and potential breed-specific health concerns with your vet. 8. Provide a comfortable living environment: Offer a comfortable, warm, and dry bed or sleeping area for your dog, and keep the temperature in your home at a comfortable level. Ensure that your German Shepherd has a safe, fenced outdoor space to move around and eliminate. 9. Spay or neuter your dog: If you don't intend to breed your German Shepherd, consider spaying or neutering them to avoid unwanted litters and some health issues, such as uterine infections or prostate problems. By following these guidelines, you will be well on your way to keeping your German Shepherd happy, healthy, and well-cared for throughout their life. Their hardworking, loyal, and energetic nature makes them exceptional companions, and proper care is essential for a strong bond and lasting relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Analyze the structure and content of each question. Question 1: \\"Who do you vote for president?\\" - This question asks about the person someone votes for as president, without specifying any time period or specific election. Question 2: \\"Which candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election do you support?\\" - This question specifically asks about a person's preferred candidate in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 2. Compare the focus of each question. - Question 1 focuses on one's vote for president without any context. - Question 2 narrows down the context to the 2016 U.S. presidential election. 3. Evaluate the similarities and differences. Similarities: - Both questions are about one's preferences in an election. - Both questions ask for the preferred candidate for a presidential position. Differences: - Question 1 does not have a specific time frame or election. - Question 2 is explicitly about the 2016 U.S. presidential election.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? emotionally stirring","completion":"The given review, \\"emotionally stirring,\\" suggests a positive opinion of the movie. Although the phrase is brief, it carries significant weight in terms of describing the movie-going experience. To begin with, the term \\"emotionally\\" implies that the movie was successful in evoking strong feelings and resonating with the audience on a deeper level. The usage of this word typically refers to a positive experience, as the emotions elicited by the movie must have been impactful enough for the reviewer to mention it. It is often considered a mark of quality for a movie or a work of art to provoke emotions, as it indicates the film's ability to engage viewers effectively. Additionally, the word \\"stirring\\" further supports the positive nature of the review. This suggests that the movie had a moving or even awakening effect on the reviewer, stirring their emotions or thoughts in some way. Much like the term \\"emotionally,\\" using \\"stirring\\" to describe a movie implies that the experience was likely thought-provoking and left a lasting impression on the viewer. This capacity to have a lasting impact can be interpreted as a compliment to the movie and contribute to its overall positive reception. In essence, the review appears to praise the movie for its success in eliciting a profound emotional response. The viewer found the film to be engaging and impactful, hence this review points towards a positive opinion of the movie. However, it is crucial to note that while the review is primarily positive, the emotional nature of the experience could vary among viewers, and different individuals may perceive the movie differently depending on their own personal interpretations or emotional connections.

GloboTech CEO Gil Mars (Denis Leary) pays a visit to Heartland to meet with Larry Benson (Jay Mohr) and Irwin Wayfair (David Cross) concerning their newest projects, which involve the creation of intelligent, interactive toys.Irwin offers the Gorgonites, peaceful creatures whose mission is to gather information about Earth, prompting children to learn with them, whereas Larry presents the Commando Elite, a special task force of action figures. Despite Irwin's objections, Mars chooses the ugly-looking Gorgonites as the Commando Elite's enemies and imposes a three-month deadline, which Irwin protests as 'impossible' due to the rigorous testing and design period required.Through Larry's inexperience with the GloboTech database, he commits a critical mistake: rather than standard toy-related computer chips, the action figures are fitted with surplus X-1000 \\"intelligence\\" chips designed for use by the military.Three months later, schoolboy Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) and his parents Stuart (Kevin Dunn) and Irene (Ann Magnuson) have moved to Cleveland, Ohio, hoping for a fresh start after Alan's expulsion from two schools for playing practical jokes. His father Stuart owns an unpopular traditional toy store that does not sell electronic toys or violent action figures. Stuart goes on a business trip, leaving Alan in charge of the store, hoping that Alan will prove worthy of his trust. During his absence, Alan sees a box containing Commando Elite and Gorgonite toys bound for another larger toy store, and convinces the delivery truck driver Joe (Dick Miller) to leave him a complete set of each to sell, so as to make the shop wealthier and more sophisticated. Joe initially resists, but relents after Alan pleads with him. When released from their boxes, the toys become animated and begin to wage war against each other. Alan's neighbor and romantic...

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Forcing yourself to feel happy without first validating your feelings of sorrow will lead to greater problems down the road. However, don’t use this as an excuse to get stuck in a rut; feel your sadness, acknowledge it, and use the wisdom you’ve gained from the experience to move on. It's possible you don't even know why you're feeling like this. Sometimes our minds get on a track all their own that we can't decipher. If this sounds like you, then take it as a cue that your logical brain has taken a little vacation and simply needs to be put back to work. Telling yourself to “think positive” can be pretty underwhelming advice, especially when the mortgage payment is due, the car breaks down, and life seems out of control. Instead of trying to convince yourself that your situation is just rosy, focus your energy on approaching the unpleasantness in a positive way. This starts with monitoring and reshaping your internal monologue. If you catch yourself thinking, “I can’t believe I’m in this mess again,” correct the thought by adding, “but I’ll pull through just like I always do.” Keep correcting these negative statements until it becomes second-nature; after that, make it your goal to eliminate the negativity altogether. You can even write it down on paper to help you get it out and view it more objectively as you correct your thoughts. Doing this has been shown to have a number of health benefits -- including increased lifespan, a reduced risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and greater resistance to the common cold. Sometimes you may feel unsure of who you are. In these times, it can help to write down a values list to help you determine what drives you and motivates you in your life. This can also help you address problems that are causing negative feelings. To write a values list: Identify a time that you were the happiest, a time when you were the proudest, and a time when you were the most fulfilled or satisfied. Use these times to help you determine your top values. Then prioritize them in your daily life. Don't forget to reaffirm your values when you're feeling low. \\" This means not only your possessions (hot running water, a computer, a full refrigerator), but also the things that add value to your life (your friends, your hobbies, your convictions). Call it a \\"Gratitude List\\" because it's a list of what you're grateful for. Sometimes it's a little hard to be grateful when you're not in the right mood. To get the juices flowing, look at someone else' life. What should they be thankful for? Alright, now how many of those things do you have too? Probably quite a few. Take one minute to think about this question, \\"What is shame and how often is it useful?\\" Hopefully you came up with something like, \\"An emotion determined by society and rarely.\\" Because that'd be true! When you feel shame, you're worried about what others think of you. And where's the value in that?! The second you start feeling a twinge of that feeling, grab it by its horns and analyze it. If you were 7 years old, would this bother you? If you were 70, would it bother you? How about if you lived in a different culture? Chances are you'd be able to answer \\"no\\" to all those questions. Your reasons for shame have been taught to you for no good reason. Get 'em out of your brain to make room for useful feelings! If you find that shame is a constant in your life, consider seeking professional help from a therapist. Spend a whole day in your PJs relaxing, get into a good book, and don't let anyone disturb you. If you don’t have time for this type of mini-escape, listen to an audiobook while driving to work or riding the bus. Keep your mind focused on something besides your negativity. It's easy to forget that we can control our minds. They are us, we are not them (in a manner of speaking). If you give your mind a new world to take it, you'll get a new world out. Relaxing and distracting yourself is the first step to finding a new outlook.","completion":"This article is about learning to acknowledge and cope with negative feelings, improving our thoughts, and finding ways to be grateful and happy in life."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You're welcome. Methodology The Top 10 Songs Of 2018 10. Drake — 'Nice For What' \\"Prepare to play this song at every single one of your pre-games. It's a certified head-banger, and makes our list of top music videos of the year for its star-studded cameos, including Yara Shahidi, Rashida Jones, Issa Rae, Tiffany Haddish, Olivia Wilde, Emma Roberts, Misty Copeland, and more.\\" [Marie Claire] 9. Ariana Grande — 'no tears left to cry' \\"It begins as a quailing power ballad before shaking that mood off in favour of a sassy pop strut, showing that the only way out from rock bottom is up. By making statements such as this and 'Thank U, Next' part of her public grapple with trauma, Grande is crafting her own bracingly resilient narrative.\\" [The Guardian] 8. Robyn — 'Honey' \\"Drizzled in synth, pulsing like a heartbeat, 'Honey' is where pop's lovelorn dancefloor queen delivers ecstasy merely by promising it. The song overwhelms with glittery intimacy but keeps its own secrets.\\" [Pitchfork] 7. Travis Scott — 'Sicko Mode' \\"[I]t's one of the most exciting rap songs of the decade, and it telegraphs its attempts to be one of the most exciting songs of the decade by tapping en vogue producers like Cardo and Tay Keith, 'A Fever You Can't Sweat Out'–type beat switches, Drake, and Swae Lee in the margins.\\" [The Ringer] 6. Janelle Monáe — 'Make Me Feel' \\"With the click of her tongue, Janelle Monáe reminded everybody in 2018 why she so naturally takes up the mantle of Prince... The singer co-wrote this infectious lead single with Julia Michaels, Mattias Larsson, Robin Fredriksson, and Justin Tranter, resulting in a soulful, retro-funky groove that sizzles and vibrates, with a sensuous music video to match: So good and so f—ing real.\\" [EW] 5. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper — 'Shallow' \\"Really, the magic of 'Shallow' is that it is several things all at once. There's the song itself, which serves as a reminder that Gaga is one of the great vocalists of our time. There's the song as a plot point, which launches us into one of the most cuckoo bananas movies of the year. And there is the song, but mostly the wail, as a cultural moment. There were few better moments of catharsis this year than playing this song with a group of friends and listening to them belt their hearts out.\\" [The Fader] 4. Childish Gambino — 'This Is America' \\"Childish Gambino wrote the new national anthem in blood this year and it left a permanent stain. But thank God we can dance to it. Let's thank America, too.\\" [NPR] 3. Cardi B — 'I Like It' \\"With her storied fairytale come-up, Cardi would be the one to inject new thrill into flexing wealth, a hip-hop tradition as time-honored as the genre itself.\\" [Billboard] 2. The 1975 — 'Love It If We Made It' \\"'Love It If We Made It' is the sound of this moment in time because of its zeitgeisty lyrics of course, but it's also because of how they are communicated: an endless scroll of tweets and headlines with no space for thought or emotion before the next one rolls into view. Levelled, loud, persistent. The song itself is a monolith, maximalist to the extreme. Each electronic trill and whoosh is like digital overspill from the overpacked whole. Collapse is a constant threat.\\" [Line of Best Fit] 1. Ariana Grande — 'Thank U, Next' \\"[It's] the anthem 2018 deserves: Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage — specifically, her history with love — and rebuilds from the ground up, rekindling her most crucial relationship: Ariana and Ariana. Though she gives her exes their flowers, do not mistake this for a song about men; it's dedicated to the woman at the eye of their storm who survived.\\" [Vulture] Honorable Mention Kacey Musgraves and Mitski were their own worst enemies, placing a variety of songs on top 10 lists, with no single song racking enough votes to crack the top 10.

Click here to see selections for every subject and more. Photo: Photo-illustration: Maya Robinson/Vulture and Photos by Getty Images There is no denying that we currently have more music immediately available to us than at any other point in the history of recorded music. This is a gift and a curse: There’s so much good stuff out there, but there’s also just so much stuff. As such, top-ten lists like this serve a dual purpose. On one hand, these are ten songs that altered the course of popular music as we understand it, and the hope here is to emphasize that fact. On the other hand, these are also just very good songs, even devoid of the context of where they sit in the 2018 musical canon. These are either the very best songs of the year, or ten of many very best songs of the year, but they’re here because they are undeniable jams, or they said something about who we are or the world we live in. In a couple cases, they just held up really well. 10. The Carters, “Apeshit” In Beyoncé and Jay-Z’s world, black opulence isn’t a luxury but the standard. “Apeshit,” a “Niggas in Paris” for 2018 where Bey out-raps both members of the original Throne, outlines its master plan for dismantling the racial class divide brazenly: trade debt for equity, calculate your worth then triple it, and flex accordingly. Who knew you could have the run of the Louvre until Bey and Hov unlocked the doors? “Apeshit” functions as a petri dish of aspirational candy for a generation to devour, a gold mine of Migos-brand gaudiness and one-percenter reverie that remains in awe of its own excess (“I can’t believe we made it,” the Carters repeat). That Bey can reduce her own rap legend of a husband into background hype man for her own dizzying bars (“She went crazy!” he ad-libs) only further serves their point: The time for abiding by limitations is over. —Dee Lockett 9. Travis Scott ft. Drake, “Sicko Mode” No one was surprised that “Sicko Mode” was good. It’s Drake and Travis Scott in top form: Drake manages to make reminiscing about how he used to take the bus to dances in high school, but now takes Xanax to go to sleep on the plane, sound like the biggest come-up in the world, instead of just, like, some adult shit that happens because everyone — including Drake — is anxious and tired all the time. But “Sicko Mode” ultimately shines as the centerpiece of Astroworld, an album that is credited to Travis Scott alone, but is actually more of an ensemble piece that welds blown-out bass to blurry organ runs and sucks the entire history of hip-hop into a psychedelic universe grounded by absolutely nothing at all. “Sicko Mode” changes up so much that it sounds like it’s a million minutes long, and that isn’t a bad thing. —Sam Hockley-Smith 8. The 1975, “Love It If We Made It” If every generation needs its clarion call to address the times, Matty Healy won’t give it to this one the way history’s used to. The 1975’s “Love It If We Made It” takes stock of all that is wrong with the world in the language that speaks loudest to this Zeitgeist: by shouting, sans context, references to the headlines of the last two years. From Lil Peep’s death, to the Syrian refugee crisis, to quoting Donald Trump praising Kanye West, and also the time Trump said “moved on her like a bitch,” our societal grievances are all presented in one giant clusterfuck of a scrawl. But what to do about it? This is not a diagnosis with an antidote. Healy proposes no action, just sentiment: hope that we’ll make it out of this alive. It’s all there’s really left to say. —D.L. 7. Pusha T, “If You Know You Know” A great bane of social media is that too many people using it know too little about the history of what they’re speaking on. Case in point: Pusha T, whom the uninitiated thought to be acting out of pocket when he dropped the bomb about Drake’s secret son in his juicy diss track over the summer. How did this guy, a supposed relic of the Clipse days to anyone under the age of, say, 25, acquire that kind of intel? “If You Know You Know” won’t answer that (though he did eventually reveal his sources) because Push is the rap type whose old-school ethos trades in quiet, calculated movements, the code of the streets he used to run. If you know Push’s story, then you’ll know how he’s always finessed the game to put himself in the position of those in the know. If you don’t, you’ll just have to take his word for it. —D.L. 6. Kacey Musgraves, “Slow Burn” There’s a specific quality to a Kacey Musgraves turn of phrase that she’s perfected over the years: featherweight verses heavy with emotion. “Slow Burn” comes at you like a long exhale after a lifetime of breathing in hot air. “Good in a glass, good on green / good when you’re putting your hands all over me” are maybe all things you’re not supposed to say when you’re a woman in country music, but Musgraves has never cared much for tradition and gatekeeping. If she wants to take the edge off life a bit — and shed some of the self-seriousness of this genre while she’s at it — by sparking up a blunt paired with a stiff glass of whiskey, she will. Her life, her career, on her terms. Musgraves knows exactly who she is and what kind of artist she wants to be and, amazingly, even so, will keep pace with everyone else while they’re still catching up to where she’s at: “Taking my time, let the world turn.” —D.L. 5. Robyn, “Human Being” You know those videos of those Boston Dynamics robots that all for some reason look like large dogs and move so fluidly that for a brief second you can envision a very near future (maybe tomorrow?) where they take over and suddenly America is run by a robot with four legs and no discernible face? “Human Being,” a song about a probably not-so-distant-future (also maybe tomorrow?) where AI is the majority, and run-of-the-mill humans with hearts and blood, etc. are the minorities, is not about those robots, but if it were then it would probably lose some of its emotional resonance, of which there is quite a bit. To wit: If you listen to this song without knowing that Robyn wrote it after reading Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind and began to compare that book’s description of humans’ relationship to animals to a hypothetical relationship we might have with AI, you’ll hear it as an affecting piece about emotional disconnect and what happens when we forget about the interior histories of those around us. In other words, it’s about the future, but it’s also about right now. —S.H-S. 4. Mitski, “Nobody” Written while Mitski was on a very long tour and was stranded in Malaysia over the holidays due to the evils of capitalism (very expensive plane tickets), and a misguided idea that because she’d spent a lot of time there as a kid she’d feel at home as an adult, “Nobody” is about being completely alone. It is also about time-zone-based alienation and the primal desire to just have someone around when you’re at your loneliest. The disco backbeat prevents it from veering into mopey territory, and also helps make a case for the song as an instant classic. You know the kind: It’s new, but may as well have been a radio staple for the last 40 years. —S.H-S. 3. Juice WRLD, “Lucid Dreams” If Juice WRLD never makes another great song, he will always have “Lucid Dreams,” which crashes the best (and a couple of the worst) parts of the Ghosts of Emo’s Past with a fluid, singsong flow that sounds like a run-on sentence. Yes, this song is built on a sample of Sting’s “Shape of my Heart,” but the appeal of the song is all Juice WRLD. It’s not what he’s saying — which is at times rote (“You were my everything / Thoughts of a wedding ring.” Come on, man!) and at other times heartbreaking (“I take prescriptions to make me feel okay.” That vocal lilt!) Basically, it’s not perfect, but it is still great. —S.H-S. 2. Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper, “Shallow” We don’t need to wonder about when Bradley Cooper first knew he had a hit on his hands, because in interviews he talks about A Star Is Born like it was the movie he was destined to make, and we were all destined to love with the same furor the entire population of the year 1997 had for Titanic. Still, it’s surprising that the songs were, well, so good. “Shallow” is the song that everyone you know loves: your old college roommate, that snobby dude who cloaks his love of big hits in karaoke performances he pretends are ironic, your mom, her sister, your dad, and probably your small child, pet, fish, or other living thing whose thoughts are not easily communicable, too. “Shallow” is undeniably the hit of the movie, and a major song in general, and it’s due to the interplay between Lady Gaga and Cooper. Gaga in particular soars (is there a more triumphant moment than around 2:33 into the track?), but it’s a testament to the power of this song that even the fake crowd noise sounds legit. Cooper may have manufactured the triumphant moment as a plot point in his movie, but it has officially crossed over into reality. —S.H-S. 1. Ariana Grande, “Thank U, Next” Following a year that culturally conditioned people to feed off of spite and vengeance, Ariana Grande decided for the public good to end it with an alternative: maturity. The past year and a half for Grande has been defined by more tragedy than most will encounter in a lifetime, from the Manchester massacre to the sudden death of her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller to the fast rise and faster fall of her relationship with former fiancé Pete Davidson. She’d already released one album this year, Sweetener, trying to rebound from the bombing, but then every other shoe that could drop did so with a seismic thud. Musicians create to pull through, so Ari returned to the studio to make a whole other forthcoming album, Thank U, Next. Its title track is the anthem 2018 deserves: Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage — specifically, her history with love — and rebuilds from the ground up, rekindling her most crucial relationship: Ariana and Ariana. Though she gives her exes their flowers, do not mistake this for a song about men; it’s dedicated to the woman at the eye of their storm who survived. So 2018 will go down as the year that Ariana Grande entered pop immortality. What can she possibly do next? —D.L. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"The article presents a list of the top 10 songs of 2018, compiled from various sources. The list is as follows: 1.

As seems to be the general gist of these comments, the film has some stunning animation (I watched it on blu-ray) but it really falls short of any real depth. Firstly the characters are all pretty dull. I got a hint of a kind of Laputa situation between Agito, Toola and the main antagonist Shunack. However maybe my mind wanderd and this was wishful thinking (Laputa being my favourite animé, original Engilsh dub). The characters are not really lovable either and as mentioned in another post they fall in love exceptionally quickly, leaving poor old Minka jealous and rejected (she loves Agito, who seems oblivious of this). However she promptly seems to forgive Toola at the end with no explanation for the change of heart other than it makes the ending a little bit more \\"happy\\". There is also a serious lack of explanation. Like who are the druids really? Are they people? and who are the weird women/girls who seem to hang out with them and run the forest? There is nothing explaining why they are there and how they can give regular humans superpowers. The plants coming from the moon still does not fill in the blanks about this. It is almost like a weird version of The Day of the Triffids. And who does call Toola? why bother with this if it wont be explained? I really wanted to like this film but I found the plot no where near as deep as a film like Ghost in the Shell or having any real character like those of Miyazaki. I do not resent watching it but I do sort of wish I hadn't bought it. My advice? Give it a go if you have a couple of hours to spare, but borrow it, or buy it cheap! Perhaps if your new to animé films and don't have much to go by you will enjoy it. It certainly is visually pleasing.

While the reviewer acknowledges the stunning animation and visual aspects of the film, they express disappointment with the dull characters, lack of depth, and unanswered questions in the plot. They also suggest that the movie might be enjoyable for those who are new to the anime genre, but they recommend borrowing or buying it at a low price instead of investing in it.

Information: - Outlaw country is a subgenre of American country music, most popular during the 1970s and early-1980s, sometimes referred to as the outlaw movement or simply outlaw music. The music has its roots in earlier subgenres like honky tonk and rockabilly and is characterized by a blend of rock and folk rhythms, country instrumentation and introspective lyrics. The movement began as a reaction to the slick production and popular structures of the Nashville sound developed by record producers like Chet Atkins. - The Nashville sound originated during the mid 1950s as a subgenre of American country music, replacing the chart dominance of the rough honky tonk music which was most popular in the 1940s and 1950s with \\"smooth strings and choruses\\", \\"sophisticated background vocals\\" and \\"smooth tempos\\". It was an attempt \\"to revive country sales, which had been devastated by the rise of rock 'n' roll.\\" - Willie Hugh Nelson (born April 29, 1933) is an American musician, singer, songwriter, author, poet, actor, and activist. The critical success of the album \\"Shotgun Willie\\" (1973), combined with the critical and commercial success of \\"Red Headed Stranger\\" (1975) and \\"Stardust\\" (1978), made Nelson one of the most recognized artists in country music. He was one of the main figures of outlaw country, a subgenre of country music that developed in the late 1960s as a reaction to the conservative restrictions of the Nashville sound. Nelson has acted in over 30 films, co-authored several books, and has been involved in activism for the use of biofuels and the legalization of marijuana. - Shotgun Willie is a 1973 album by Willie Nelson. The recording marks a change of style for Nelson, who later stated that the album \\"cleared his throat\\". When Nelson refused to sign an early extension of his contract with RCA in 1972, the label decided not to release any further recordings. Nelson hired Neil Reshen as his manager, and while Reshen negotiated with RCA, Nelson moved to Austin, Texas, where the ongoing hippie music scene at the Armadillo World Headquarters renewed his musical style. In Nashville, Nelson met producer Jerry Wexler, vice president of Atlantic Records, who was interested in his music. Reshen solved the problems with RCA and signed Nelson with Atlantic Records as their first country music artist. - Red Headed Stranger is a 1975 album by American outlaw country singer Willie Nelson. After the wide success of his recordings with Atlantic Records, coupled with the negotiating skills of his manager, Neil Reshen, Nelson signed a contract with Columbia Records, a label that gave him total creative control over his works. The concept for the album was inspired by the \\"Tale of the Red Headed Stranger\\", a song that Nelson used to play as a disk jockey on his program in Fort Worth, Texas. After signing with Columbia he decided to record the song, and arranged the details during his return to Austin, Texas, from a trip to Colorado. It was recorded at low cost at Autumn Sound Studios in Garland, Texas. The songs featured sparse arrangements, largely limited to Nelson's guitar, piano and drums. Nelson presented the finished material to Columbia executives, who were dubious about releasing an album that they at first thought was a demo. However, Nelson had creative control, so no further production was added. - Island in the Sea is a 1987 album by country singer Willie Nelson . Its title track was a minor hit .

I think that one of the people who caused me the most misery for the longest was someone that I’ll call “Luna”. So, most people have probably met that person that acts all suicidal and then uses that against you. For example, you’re talking to someone like that and you’re having some sort of argument and the moment they realize they aren’t winning they send you pictures of their bloodied wrists and say “This is your fault”. Well, that person was my friend for a long time. Every time I would try to leave her to go to sleep she would threaten to do “something bad” and I knew what she meant, and me, first meeting her when I was around 9 or 10, and I was still extremely naive. So most of the time, I ended up staying awake til 3 AM on school nights and I would get only a few hours of sleep, and she’d be happy because her life wasn’t worsened at all. But I think the thing that made me the most miserable, was the fact that it never got better. No matter how much I talked to her, or how sympathetic I tried to be, or how much I tried to convince her to be happier, it never got better. She still acted super depressed, but like it was a joke. All of these things combined to make me completely miserable because it seemed like it was all for nothing. But I just let it happen, because she was the only person I had and she was really my only “friend” at that point, and all the way up to seventh grade. So for that entire period of time, she certainly wasn’t the only source of misery for me, but she made me feel way worse than I would have if I hadn’t been friends with her. According to the above context, answer the following question. The friend probably thinks what about the writer of the text?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (May 2010) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) On holiday in Egypt with George and Emily Hacker (Christopher Connelly and Martha Taylor), her archaeologist father and journalist mother, ten-year-old Susie Hacker (Brigitta Boccoli) is approached by a mysterious blind woman who gives her an amulet. Soon after, George is struck blind when he enters a previously unexplored tomb. Upon their return in New York City, George is informed that the loss of his eyesight will only be temporary. Susie begins to act strangely, and her younger brother Tommy (Giovanni Frezza), who stayed behind in New York with the family's au pair Jamie Lee (Cinzia de Ponti), is also affected by the mysterious amulet. Both Susie and Tommy have gained supernatural access to dimensional doorways. A few days later, George's eyesight returns, and he describes the design on the wall of the tomb he'd entered to a colleague called Wiler. A little while later, Luke Anderson (Carlo De Mejo), an eccentric colleague of Emily's, arrives to work with her on her latest story detailing her travels in Egypt. When Luke hears a noise coming from Susie's bedroom, he goes in, only to be sucked into the dimensional portal and finds himself transported to the deserts of Egypt where he later dies from dehydration in the vast, arid desert. The Hackers think Luke's disappearance is merely a practical joke, but they never learn of his fate, nor find any trace of him. Jamie Lee takes the kids out to nearby Central Park to play where she takes photos of them. A woman picks up a discarded Polaroid photo taken of Susie. It shows nothing but the amulet against the grassy background. The woman contacts a man called Adrian Marcato (Laurence Welles) with her find.

Hypothesis: Man is DJing. .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Yes, based on the given premise, we can conclude the hypothesis. To explain this conclusion in a detailed manner, let's break down the premise and hypothesis into their core components. Premise: 1. Man wearing a blue shirt: This part of the premise specifies the subject's appearance, i.e., a man who has a blue shirt on. 2. DJing: In this context, DJing refers to the activity in which the man is involved. The man is performing as a DJ, controlling music and creating a curated aural experience for listeners or a crowd of people. Hypothesis: 1. Man: The hypothesis states the general subject, that is, the man, regardless of his shirt color or what he is doing. 2. DJing: Again, this refers to the action the man is performing within the hypothesis. Now, when a hypothesis is being deduced from a premise, it is crucial to determine whether the given information in the premise supports or logically leads to the hypothesis. In this case, the premise states that a man is wearing a blue shirt and is DJing. The hypothesis states that a man is DJing. The action of DJing present in both the premise and hypothesis remains consistent. The only notable difference between the premise and the hypothesis is the description of the subject's appearance (the blue shirt). However, the color of the shirt is irrelevant to whether the man is DJing or not. The action of DJing is not dependent on the color of the shirt worn by the subject. As a result, given that the hypothesis 'Man is DJing' matches the action of DJing provided in the premise 'Man wearing a blue shirt is DJing,' we can confidently conclude that the hypothesis is true based on the premise provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But I had a crippling fear of going where? - outside - vacation - idle - apartment - neighborhood The best answer is","completion":"The best answer given your description of a crippling fear would be \\"outside,\\" which is, in general, a fear of leaving the safety and familiarity of one's home and engaging with the world beyond. It is important to examine why this fear may be crippling and how it can be understood and addressed. A crippling fear of going outside can be attributed to agoraphobia, which is an anxiety disorder characterized by an irrational fear of being in open or public spaces. Individuals with agoraphobia often experience extreme anxiety when confronted with situations where they feel exposed, unsafe, or unable to escape. This anxiety can manifest in physical symptoms, such as panic attacks, and can become so debilitating that affected individuals may become housebound. This fear can be caused by a variety of factors, such as past traumatic experiences, heightened anxiety, or an entrenched pattern of avoidance and negative thinking. When faced with the prospect of going outside, individuals may experience a range of concerns, from specific fears like encountering a particular situation or person to more general apprehensions about losing control while away from their home. If you find yourself crippled by the fear of going outside, it is important to seek professional help from a mental health professional. A psychologist or therapist with experience in anxiety disorders can work with you to develop a tailored plan for addressing your fears and guiding you towards an increased level of independence in your daily life. Some common strategies for addressing the fear of going outside include: 1. Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT): This form of therapy helps individuals identify the root causes of their fears, challenge irrational thoughts, and develop strategies for managing their anxiety in a healthy and constructive manner. 2. Exposure therapy: Gradually exposing individuals to situations that trigger their fears can help to desensitize them to these anxieties and build confidence in their ability to cope with such circumstances. 3. Breathing and relaxation techniques: Mindfulness, deep breathing exercises, and progressive muscle relaxation can help individuals manage their anxiety symptoms and develop techniques for calming themselves when faced with stressors. 4. Medication: In some cases, medication may be prescribed to help manage the symptoms of anxiety and facilitate therapeutic progress. 5. Support system: Developing a strong support system of friends, family members, and professionals who understand and validate the individual's experiences can be invaluable in the process of overcoming agoraphobia. While it might be tempting to avoid the situations that trigger your fear of going outside, it is essential to confront these anxieties in order to regain control of your life. By working with a mental health professional, you can develop an understanding of your specific fears and establish a plan for moving forward with greater confidence and self-assurance."},{"prompt":"Title: VHS is a dead media format Review: Mighty Max is an awesome show and needs to make the transition to DVD soon.

To do this, we need to move the constants to the other side of the equation. To shift the constant -75638 to the left side of the equation, we can add 75638 to both sides. This gives: 37955 + 75638 = -3917*j Step 2: Simplify the equation. Combine the constant terms on the left side of the equation: 113593 = -3917*j Step 3: Solve for j. To find the value of j, divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of -3917: 113593 / (-3917) = (-3917*j) / (-3917) Step 4: Calculate the value of j.

Options: - sporting goods store - sears - pool - sporting event - school Explain why a human would choose \\"sporting goods store\\" to answer the question above: The answer to this question is:","completion":"A human would choose \\"sporting goods store\\" to answer the question above because a sporting goods store primarily focuses on selling a wide range of sports equipment, gear, and accessories. These stores are designed to cater specifically to the needs of individuals who are looking to buy equipment for various sports and fitness activities. Here are the reasons why each of the other options may not be suitable: 1. Sears: While Sears is a department store that sells a variety of items, including some sports equipment, it does not specialize in this area. As a result, the selection of sports equipment at Sears might be limited compared to a sporting goods store. 2. Pool: A pool is a place where people go to swim and is not a store or a location where someone can buy sports equipment. While there might be some pool-related equipment available at a pool, it does not offer a comprehensive range of sports equipment. 3. Sporting event: A sporting event is a competition or game involving teams or individuals participating in a specific sport. Although some sporting events have booths or stands that sell team merchandise and basic sports equipment, the primary focus of the event is the competition, and the selection of sports equipment available would be limited compared to a dedicated sporting goods store. 4. School: A school is an educational institution where students learn various subjects, and while schools might have sports facilities and equipment for their students, they do not typically sell sports equipment to the general public. In summary, a human would choose a sporting goods store to get sports equipment because it is a specialized store that offers a broad selection of equipment for various sports, making it the ideal place to find and purchase any sports gear they may need."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The effectiveness of such a form is evident for instance in Sura 81, and there can be no doubt that these passages impressed the conscience of the hearers.

Answer choices: - erosion - Loose - slippery - loose soil - homogenous - coiled - imbalanced - threatened Answer:","completion":"To answer this question, let's consider the information given and analyze the provided answer choices step-by-step. Step 1: Understand the question The question states that contact between rocks over long periods of time causes rocks to be slippery. Step 2: Analyze the answer choices A. Erosion: Erosion refers to the wearing away of rocks due to natural processes like water, wind, or ice. While erosion could lead to the rocks being slippery, it's not the direct cause mentioned in the question. B. Loose: Loose refers to rocks that are not firmly held in place. Being slippery isn't the same as being loose. C. Slippery: The question statement already mentions that contact between rocks leads them to be slippery. This could be the correct answer. D. Loose soil: This isn't related to the rocks being slippery. E. Homogeneous: This refers to a uniform composition and isn't related to the rocks being slippery. F. Coiled: This term doesn't apply to rocks and is irrelevant to the given information. G. Imbalanced: Imbalanced implies an unstable state, which is not the direct result of contact between rocks over long periods. H.

Question: Given the following context: It is not clear why, in 1873, Alkan decided to emerge from his self-imposed obscurity to give a series of six Petits Concerts at the Érard piano showrooms. It may have been associated with the developing career of Delaborde, who, returning to Paris in 1867, soon became a concert fixture, including in his recitals many works by his father, and who was at the end of 1872 given the appointment that had escaped Alkan himself, Professor at the Conservatoire. The success of the Petits Concerts led to them becoming an annual event (with occasional interruptions caused by Alkan's health) until 1880 or possibly beyond. The Petits Concerts featured music not only by Alkan but of his favourite composers from Bach onwards, played on both the piano and the pédalier, and occasionally with the participation of another instrumentalist or singer. He was assisted in these concerts by his siblings, and by other musicians including Delaborde, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Auguste Franchomme.Those encountering Alkan at this phase included the young Vincent d'Indy, who recalled Alkan's \\"skinny, hooked fingers\\" playing Bach on an Érard pedal piano: \\"I listened, riveted to the spot by the expressive, crystal-clear playing.\\" Alkan later played Beethoven's Op. 110 sonata, of which d'Indy said: \\"What happened to the great Beethovenian poem ... I couldn't begin to describe – above all in the Arioso and the Fugue, where the melody, penetrating the mystery of Death itself, climbs up to a blaze of light, affected me with an excess of enthusiasm such as I have never experienced since.

Carlo Ricci's henchmen and Vinnie A:","completion":"Title: The Alloy of Trust Genre: Crime, Thriller, Action Plot Summary: A twisted web of loyalty, deceit, and betrayal unfolds when Vinnie, a small-time criminal, joins forces with the feared mobster, Carlo Ricci's henchmen. Together, they must locate a stolen artifact that is essential to the stability of the criminal underworld. Unknown to them, they are being manipulated by forces within their own organization with motives that could bring their entire world crashing down around them. Act 1: A mysterious and powerful artifact, known as the Alloy of Trust, is stolen from the safehouse of a notorious crime lord, Carlo Ricci. The artifact is said to possess the power to unite the criminal underworld, and whoever controls it, holds the loyalty of organizations from across all major cities. The loss of the artifact leaves a power vacuum in the criminal world, with different factions vying for control. Carlo Ricci is desperate to reclaim the missing artifact to restore his power and control. He instructs his most trusted henchmen to join forces with Vinnie, an outsider whose cunning and street smarts could help locate the missing item faster. Act 2: Carlo Ricci's henchmen, along with Vinnie, start their search for the Alloy of Trust. They proceed to visit bars and underground gambling dens, trying to gather information through bribes, threats, and coercion. In a seedy bar on the outskirts of town, they learn that a rival gang, the Black Hand, is rumored to be behind the Artifact's theft. They decide to infiltrate the Black Hand to find out more. During this time, we see glimpses of an inner tension between Vinnie and the henchmen. Carlo Ricci's crew initially did not want Vinnie to be part of their mission, believing him to be untrustworthy. But as Vinnie proves his worth, he gradually starts gaining their loyalty and respect. However, Vinnie always seems to be one step ahead, as if he knows more than he is letting on. As they infiltrate the Black Hand, it becomes apparent that the rival gang does indeed have possession of the Alloy of Trust. But Vinnie and the henchmen discover that the theft of the artifact was actually orchestrated by someone within Carlo Ricci's own organization, who has been secretly working with the Black Hand to usurp and take down Ricci. Act 3: Vinnie and the henchmen make a choice – they decide to bring this traitor to justice to restore Carlo Ricci's power and regain control of the criminal underworld. They devise a plan to ambush the traitor and the rival gang during an exchange of the Alloy of Trust. In the climax of the movie, a thrilling gunfight ensues between Vinnie, the henchmen, the vengeful traitor, and the rival gang members. Our protagonists emerge victorious against all odds, retrieving the Alloy of Trust, and presenting it back to Carlo Ricci. In a surprise twist, it is revealed that Vinnie was an undercover agent assigned to infiltrate the criminal underworld and dismantle it from the inside. He presents vital evidence to law enforcement, leading to the arrest of the traitor, Carlo Ricci, and several members of the criminal organizations. However, in order to preserve the loyalty he built with Carlo Ricci's henchmen, Vinnie helps them escape from imprisonment, preserving their respect for him, and completing his mission to rid the city of organized crime. The movie ends with Vinnie disappearing into the night, leaving his criminal past behind, and the henchmen, now free and loyal to him, given a second chance to reform their lives. The true power of the Alloy of Trust is revealed in the end as it brought out the loyalty among men where none thought was possible."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Media playback is not supported on this device Go to a restaurant in this pretty Belgian town, and all the diners know her. They come over to congratulate her on winning two medals at the 2016 Rio Paralympics; she raises a glass to a family celebrating a birthday. For a few hours, she's the life and soul of the party. But, at 37, the Belgian wheelchair racer suffers such pain she wakes her neighbours by screaming in the night. As she watches her precious, fiercely defended independence dwindling, she has planned her own death. Euthanasia is legal in Belgium, and eight years ago Vervoort signed the papers which will, eventually, allow a doctor to end her life. It's not that she wants to die. She wants to live. But she wants to live on her terms. It is three months since she won silver and bronze at her second Paralympics and Vervoort is still the toast of Diest, where a large billboard bearing an image of her face declares the town is \\"so proud\\" of her. We're greeted at the door of her specially adapted flat by Zenn, Vervoort's assistance labrador. Nurses come in four times a day to tend to Vervoort's medical needs, but Zenn gives her mistress an extra degree of independence, fetching items and helping her dress. She is, most of all, a mood-enhancer. \\"When I'm happy, she's happy,\\" says Vervoort. \\"When I'm mad, she's scared, and she goes to sit in another part of the house so she's not bothering me. When I'm crying, she'll come to lie down with me, lick my face, hug me. \\"When I'm going to have an epileptic attack, she pushes her head between my knees. She is saying to me, 'Marieke, you have to lay down. Go to a safe spot because something is going to happen to you.'\\" The walls of her flat are crammed with framed photos and paintings of her winning moments, while medals, trophies, and bottles of champagne jostle for space on cupboards and counter tops. Her achievements have been hard won. A progressive, incurable spinal condition, diagnosed when she was 21, ravages her body and no two days are the same. \\"I know how I feel now, but I don't know how I'll feel after half an hour,\\" she says. \\"It can be that I feel very, very bad, I get an epileptic attack, I cry, I scream because of pain. I need a lot of painkillers, valium, morphine. \\"A lot of people ask me how is it possible that you can have such good results and still be smiling with all the pain and medication that eats your muscles. For me, sports, and racing with a wheelchair - it's a kind of medication.\\" Just getting to the start line in Rio was an achievement. In 2013, a racing accident left her shoulder so badly damaged a doctor told her she would never reach the top again. To that, as to so many setbacks in life, her response was a defiant hand gesture. \\"I turned my bed into a gym - physio, elastic belts,\\" she says. \\"I was doing my own physio, my own exercises. After the rehabilitation, I broke three world records.\\" She went back to her doctor and thanked her for telling her she would not reach the top again. \\"You gave me the power to fight back like an animal,\\" she told her doctor. \\"You make my mind only stronger.\\" The silver medal in the T52 400m in Rio came after 30 hours of violent sickness and a day on a rehydrating drip in the Paralympic village. The bronze in the 100m came after a bladder infection sent her temperature soaring. She said they were medals with two sides - happy and sad. \\"I can't imagine a better way to end your career, but also there's a side of sadness, to say goodbye to the sports that I love,\\" she explains. \\"Other people stop with their sports because they say they don't want to do it any more. I have to stop because my mind says yes, go further, you still can do it. But my body cries, says help, stop training, you break me.\\" To get a fuller picture of the athlete known as 'The Beast from Diest', we travel to see her close friend Lieve Bullens, the woman Vervoort calls her 'Godmother'. Ask Vervoort's friends and family to describe her and they will use a variety of adjectives. Determined, independent, joyful, stubborn. I would add funny, thoughtful and a terrible back-seat driver. The constant threat of an epileptic episode and her deteriorating sight mean she is no longer allowed to drive her car, emblazoned with her picture, fist punching the air after another race win. I take the wheel. It's clear my caution is damaging her image as Belgium's fastest woman on three wheels. \\"You are driving like an old woman! Ha ha ha!\\" Bullens welcomes us into a house which is part home, part Buddhist retreat. Large windows overlook the winter garden, drums and dreamcatchers are suspended from the ceiling. The open cooking range has been converted into a candle-laden altar. It's the perfect place to recuperate from the stress of the car journey. Vervoort met Bullens, a mental coach and therapist, when competing at the 2007 Hawaii Ironman triathlon for para-athletes. Triathlon had become her passion when the onset of her disease made her reliant on a wheelchair. She was para-triathlon world champion twice, but in 2008 her condition deteriorated to such an extent she had to give up the sport. It was the lowest point in her life. The pain was agonising, the loss of independence insupportable. She told her friend she wanted to kill herself. \\"She said 'there's no point in living, no point in going on because it's too hard, it's too bad',\\" Bullens says. But Vervoort's psychologist recommended she speak to Dr Wim Distelmans, a leading palliative care expert. He suggested an alternative option: euthanasia. Euthanasia - in which a doctor intervenes to end a life - has been legal in Belgium since 2002. It is available only if a patient has an incurable condition, is in unbearable pain, and is able to make a rational decision to request it, and even then two doctors have to agree it is the correct course of action. In 2015, MPs in the UK rejected the Assisted Dying Bill, which would have allowed some terminally ill adults to end their lives with medical supervision. Bullens was the first person Vervoort told about her decision. She is also the person she wants with her when she dies. \\"I immediately supported her,\\" Bullens says. \\"She is stubborn. She knows what she wants. But she also knows what she doesn't want. A living hell is not the life that she wants. \\"I immediately had the feeling it was something that she could control, and if she had control of her life, she would live longer. The pain is always there. She doesn't have to wait for the pain to have an end for her life. She says to the pain - I decide when to go. Not you.\\" In the hall of Bullens' house is a wall upon which friends and guests have written inspirational messages. But, until now, not Vervoort. She puts that right. It's a painful process, as her hands are beginning to fail her. Bullens knows it's a precious moment. \\"The woman who's writing it is forever in my heart,\\" she says. \\"She's not forever physically. It's a peaceful thought that she will go in a beautiful way, and not a hard way. In a strong way.\\" Jos and Odette Vervoort are no different to many proud sporting parents, travelling extensively to support their daughter. They get out a photo album of memorable moments on Copacabana Beach, Sugarloaf Mountain, and - the highlight - Vervoort being presented with her silver medal and getting a hug from Princess Astrid of Belgium. They've watched their sporty child grow into a world-beating adult. Like all parents, they know they need to let their child go. But for them, letting go means having to support her decision to end her life with euthanasia. \\"She's always been independent,\\" Jos says. \\"When she came in a wheelchair, she was frightened she would live all her life as a disabled person with mum and dad under the same roof. \\"You can see her situation, you are realistic, and you say yes, if she feels better with [the decision to choose euthanasia], I can live with it. \\"In the beginning we knew it was a decision for the future. Now we know the future is coming near. \\"It may be a question of months, a question of years. But we see as she becomes more dependent, it becomes more difficult.\\" Her parents don't know, and she doesn't know, when the moment will come. What is clear is she is not ready for it yet. She has given up wheelchair racing and taken up indoor sky diving - the vertical wind tunnel allows her battered body a sense of precious freedom - with the aim of doing an unassisted dive from a plane. She wants to fly in a stunt plane, and bungee jump from a bridge. She loathes not being able to drive her car, but her friends, family and Zenn give her much to live for. \\"I'm the richest girl in the world,\\" she says. \\"I'm a real rich girl, a really lucky person, even with this miserable, ugly disease which I hate.\\" Is she afraid of dying? \\"No, if you asked me 10 years ago, do you want to do a bungee jump - are you crazy? I'm not afraid any more. I risk everything, and I love it, to do all these things, because I'm not afraid to die any more,\\" she says. \\"To me, death is peaceful, something that gives me a good feeling.\\" Vervoort's fridge is well stocked. Not with food on the day we're there, but with sparkling wine. She opens a bottle before dinner. It's part of her pain relief. We go to eat with her at a restaurant in Diest, where she is the guest of honour. She recommends the sizzling beef and the shrimp tagliatelle, both delicious. It's a great night. The next day we arrive to do one last interview but find Vervoort curled up on the couch, exhausted and barely conscious after a pain-racked night. She called the nurses in the early hours to administer morphine. Zenn keeps close to her mistress' side. It's hard to believe this is the irrepressible woman we spent the previous day with, and a stark reminder of how unpredictable her illness is. But 40 minutes later, she wants to talk again. We talk about the reason she chose euthanasia over suicide. \\"If I didn't have those papers, I wouldn't have been able to go into the Paralympics. I was a very depressed person - I was thinking about how I was going to kill myself,\\" she explains. \\"In England, I hope, and every country, they will look at euthanasia in another way - it's not murder. I'm the best example. It's thanks to those papers that I'm still living. \\"All those people who get those papers here in Belgium - they have a good feeling. They don't have to die in pain. They can choose a moment, and be with the people they want to be with. With euthanasia you're sure that you will have a soft, beautiful death.\\" The conversation finishes in gales of laughter when Zenn, sensing the mood, decides to lighten it by passing wind. Seconds later, Vervoort's eyes roll backwards. She's having an epileptic fit. We hit the red button and medical staff are there within a minute. It's become part of her life. A couple of hours later she is in Brussels, giving a motivational speech and saying yes to selfies and autographs for anyone who wants them. She is determined not to waste a second of the life she has remaining. She has planned her funeral, and it involves a lot of sparkling wine. She also knows what she wants her eulogy to say. \\"I prepared everything. I wrote to every person who's in my heart. I wrote to every person a letter when I could still do it with my hands,\\" she says. \\"I wrote texts that they have to read. I want that everybody takes a glass of Cava, [and toasts me] because she had a really good life. She had a really bad disease, but thanks to that disease, she was able to do things that people can only dream about, because I was mentally so strong. \\"I want people to remember that Marieke was somebody living day by day and enjoying every little moment.\\" What is a summary of this text?","completion":"Belgian wheelchair racer Marieke Vervoort, who won two medals at the 2016 Rio Paralympics, suffers from a progressive, incurable spinal condition.

What is the answer to this question? what is the meaning of holy spirit in hebrew?","completion":"To find the answer to what the meaning of the Holy Spirit is in Hebrew, I will perform the following steps: 1. Understand the term \\"Holy Spirit\\": The Holy Spirit is a term used in Christianity, describing a divine being that is part of the Holy Trinity (Father, Son, and Holy Spirit). The Holy Spirit is a presence and a guide for Christians, often associated with inspiration, comfort, wisdom, and the teaching of divine truth. 2. Identify the equivalent Hebrew terms: The Hebrew language has two primary terms associated with the concept of the Holy Spirit. - Ruach HaKodesh (רוּחַ הַקֹּדֶשׁ): Ruach means \\"Spirit\\" or \\"Wind,\\" and HaKodesh means \\"The Holy.\\" So, Ruach HaKodesh directly translates to \\"The Holy Spirit.\\" This term is prevalent in Jewish texts and, by extension, used in Hebrew translations of Christian texts as well. - Shekhinah (שכינה): Although not an exact equivalent of the Holy Spirit, Shekhinah refers to the divine presence or the \\"indwelling\\" of God in the world. This concept aligns with some aspects of the Holy Spirit in Christianity, particularly the idea of God's presence among people and providing guidance. So, the meaning of the Holy Spirit in Hebrew can be summarized as \\"Ruach HaKodesh,\\" which means \\"The Holy Spirit,\\" with some similarities to the concept of Shekhinah, denoting God's presence in the world."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Gustaf V was born in Drottningholm Palace in Ekero, Stockholm County, the son of Prince Oscar and Princess Sofia of Nassau. At birth Gustaf was created Duke of Varmland. Upon his father's accession to the throne in 1872, Gustaf became crown prince of both Sweden and Norway. On 8 December 1907, he succeeded his father on the Swedish throne, which had been separated from the Norwegian throne two years earlier. According to Prime Minister Per Albin Hansson during the Midsummer crisis, the King in a private conversation had threatened to abdicate if the Government did not approve a German request to transfer a fighting infantry division - the so-called Engelbrecht Division - through Swedish territory from southern Norway to northern Finland in June 1941, around Midsummer. The accuracy of this claim is debated, and the King's intention (if he did in fact make this threat) is sometimes alleged to be his desire to avoid conflict with Germany. This event has later received considerable attention from Swedish historians and is known as midsommarkrisen, the Midsummer Crisis. Confirmation of the King's action is contained in German Foreign Policy documents captured at the end of the war. On 25 June 1941, the German Minister in Stockholm sent a \\"Most Urgent-Top Secret\\" message to Berlin in which he stated that the King had just informed him that the transit of German troops would be allowed. He added: The King's words conveyed the joyful emotion he felt. He had lived through anxious days and had gone far in giving his personal support to the matter. He added confidentially that he had found it necessary to go so far as to mention his abdication. According to Ernst Wigforss, both Gustaf V and Prince Gustav Adolf attempted to persuade the Swedish Government to allow the Allies to transport troops through Sweden, though this was rejected by the Government because it was felt it would cause retributions from Germany. Answer the following question by taking a quote from the article: was there anything else in the message","completion":"Yes, there was something else in the message.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who are the communists demanding for the US to withdraw? The War Game depicts the prelude to, and the immediate weeks of the aftermath of, a Soviet nuclear attack against Britain. The narrator says that Britain's current nuclear deterrent policy threatens a would-be aggressor with devastation from Vulcan and Victor nuclear bombers of the British V bomber force. The film begins on Friday, 16 September (presumably 1966; this date wouldn't appear again until 1977). A news report tells of a Chinese invasion of South Vietnam; tensions escalate when the United States authorises tactical nuclear warfare against the Chinese. Although Soviet and East German forces threaten to invade West Berlin if the US does not withdraw, the US does not acquiesce to communist demands and the invasion takes place; two US Army divisions attempt to fight their way into Berlin to counter this, but the Russian and East German forces overwhelm them in conventional battle. In order to turn the tide, President Johnson authorises the NATO commanders to use their tactical nuclear weapons, and they soon do so. An escalating nuclear war results, during which larger Soviet strategic IRBMs are launched at Britain. The film remarks that many Soviet missiles were, at the time, believed to be liquid-fuelled and stored above ground, making them vulnerable to attack and bombings. It hypothesises that in any nuclear crisis, the Soviet Union would be obliged to fire all of them as early as possible in order to avoid their destruction by counterattack, hence the rapid progression from tactical to strategic nuclear exchange.

Brad Drewett is reluctant to divulge exact numbers, but the ATP World Tour Finals is a big deal for men's tennis. The season-ending event, worth 5 million in prize money this year, is the tour's marquee event -- an elite eight-man showpiece that attracts top sponsors and acts as a massive advert for the game. \\"It's one the of the ATP's biggest assets,\\" longtime tournament director Brad Drewett told CNN during this week's round-robin matches. \\"For it to be a commercial success is extremely important for us.\\" Drewett, a 58-year-old former tennis prodigy, has been running the finals for more than a decade now. It came to London's glitzy O2 Arena -- best known as a concert venue -- in 2009 after Drewett took it back to Shanghai for three years. Rihanna to Rafa: Tennis gets popstar makeover. \\"The actual financial structure is a bit different. We have a partnership here with AEG, the owners of the O2, whereas in Shanghai we had a partnership with the municipal government who were very keen to have the event for the purpose of promoting China and Shanghai and also promoting the sport of tennis in China,\\" he said. \\"Here it was us wanting to bring the event back to the traditional market of Europe, and in particular London.\\" The UK capital has a contract until 2013, but doubts have been raised about the event's future on the banks of the River Thames due to complaints about British laws which require players to be taxed on all endorsements during the time they are in the country. The Lawn Tennis Association, which runs Wimbledon and is also an event partner of the ATP finals, is lobbying the government for an exemption. \\"If we lose events like this it will have a big impact not just on the economy but also on sponsors and television and in other areas,\\" LTA chief executive Roger Draper told the UK Press Association. Can Federer make finals history in London? Drewett said the ATP is happy for the event to stay in London, which is one of the ruling body's global headquarters alongside Florida, Sydney and Monte Carlo. \\"That decision won't be made until the second or third quarter of next year. That's a decision for our board. We're very happy here,\\" he said. \\"We have every reason to believe that next year and the following year will be just as popular.\\" More than 250,000 people attended the 17,500-capacity arena over eight days in the first two years, and sponsorship has \\"sold out\\" with title partner Barclays bank joined by luxury-goods brands such as Rolex, Lacoste and Moet & Chandon along with the likes of FedEx, South African Airways, Nissan, Ricoh and Italian power giant Enel. It is broadcast in the UK by public and subscription channels, and in more than 150 countries around the world. \\"It's our marquee event and it generates a significant amount of money for us,\\" Drewett said. \\"And from a promotional point of view this week is the event that everyone is talking about.\\" The 2009 rebranding from the Masters Cup has also given the tournament a distinct identity from the four grand slam events of the tennis calendar. \\"A grand slam has two or three major courts, men and women, plus the outside courts over 14 days. To have quarter of a million in that time frame on one court is testament to the strength of the event and the players we have right now and their popularity,\\" Drewett said. \\"I personally like the rebranding. It tells a good story, it's pretty clear what it is. The message is very clear to the consumer. \\"We're not looking to compete in any way with the grand slams. This event is what it is -- the format being eight players, only men, indoors, round-robin -- it speaks for itself as being totally different from a grand slam. The public understand that.\\" Drewett was one of the most promising young players of the 1970s, winning the Australian Open junior title twice, but was not quite so successful on the senior circuit as he reached a career-high ranking of 34. However, he did appear at the season-ending event once, in the doubles at London's Royal Albert Hall in 1988 when it was a separate tournament -- now both formats are run during the same week. At that time, Madison Square Gardens was nearing the end of a 13-year run of hosting the singles -- and Drewett believes that the O2 is taking on a similar status to the iconic New York venue. \\"In its time it was one of the special ones, like here. The finals was a very special event. People still talk about playing at Madison Square Gardens, and this is going to be the same,\\" he said. \\"When you go out there, the court, the crowd -- there's a certain atmosphere you don't get very often at sporting events.\\" After ending his career, Drewett became involved in businesses before being asked to run for a place on the ATP board to represent the players. He did so for five years before taking on the role of chief executive of the ATP's International Group. \\"I was always interested in the politics and business. I was interested in what made the tour tick even as a player,\\" Drewett said. \\"Tennis has been, in relative terms, pretty big business for a long time. In terms of professional sport it's one of the most mature. \\"Tennis was one of the first where pro athletes could make a serious living from it, back in the 1950s.

Charles-Valentin Alkan (French: [ʃaʁl valɑ̃tɛ̃ alkɑ̃]; 30 November 1813 – 29 March 1888) was a French-Jewish composer and virtuoso pianist. At the height of his fame in the 1830s and 1840s he was, alongside his friends and colleagues Frédéric Chopin and Franz Liszt, among the leading pianists in Paris, a city in which he spent virtually his entire life. Alkan earned many awards at the Conservatoire de Paris, which he entered before he was six. His career in the salons and concert halls of Paris was marked by his occasional long withdrawals from public performance, for personal reasons. Although he had a wide circle of friends and acquaintances in the Parisian artistic world, including Eugène Delacroix and George Sand, from 1848 he began to adopt a reclusive life style, while continuing with his compositions – virtually all of which are for the keyboard. During this period he published, among other works, his collections of large-scale studies in all the major keys (Op. 35) and all the minor keys (Op. 39). The latter includes his Symphony for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 4–7) and Concerto for Solo Piano (Op. 39, nos. 8–10), which are often considered among his masterpieces and are of great musical and technical complexity. Alkan emerged from self-imposed retirement in the 1870s to give a series of recitals that were attended by a new generation of French musicians. Alkan's attachment to his Jewish origins is displayed both in his life and his work. He was the first composer to incorporate Jewish melodies in art music. Fluent in Hebrew and Greek, he devoted much time to a complete new translation of the Bible into French. This work, like many of his musical compositions, is now lost. Alkan never married, but his presumed son Élie-Miriam Delaborde was, like Alkan, a virtuoso performer on both the piano and the pedal piano, and edited a number of the elder composer's works. Following his death (which according to persistent but unfounded legend was caused by a falling bookcase) Alkan's music became neglected,...

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What people sometimes hold funerals for whales?, using the article: Whales have evolved from land-living mammals. As such whales must breathe air regularly, although they can remain submerged under water for long periods of time. Some species such as the sperm whale are able to stay submerged for as much as 90 minutes. They have blowholes (modified nostrils) located on top of their heads, through which air is taken in and expelled. They are warm-blooded, and have a layer of fat, or blubber, under the skin. With streamlined fusiform bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers, whales can travel at up to 20 knots, though they are not as flexible or agile as seals. Whales produce a great variety of vocalizations, notably the extended songs of the humpback whale. Although whales are widespread, most species prefer the colder waters of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres, and migrate to the equator to give birth. Species such as humpbacks and blue whales are capable of travelling thousands of miles without feeding. Males typically mate with multiple females every year, but females only mate every two to three years. Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them. Mothers of some species fast and nurse their young for one to two years. Once relentlessly hunted for their products, whales are now protected by international law. The North Atlantic right whales nearly became extinct in the twentieth century, with a population low of 450, and the North Pacific grey whale population is ranked Critically Endangered by the IUCN. Besides whaling, they also face threats from bycatch and marine pollution. The meat, blubber and baleen of whales have traditionally been used by indigenous peoples of the Arctic. Whales have been depicted in various cultures worldwide, notably by the Inuit and the coastal peoples of Vietnam and Ghana, who sometimes hold whale funerals. Whales occasionally feature in literature and film, as in the great white whale of Herman Melville's Moby Dick. Small whales, such as belugas, are..., what would be the answer ?

Rockefeller was the second of six children and eldest son born in Richford, New York to con artist William Avery \\"Bill\\" Rockefeller (November 13, 1810 - May 11, 1906) and Eliza Davison (September 12, 1813 - March 28, 1889). His siblings were Lucy (1838-1878), William Jr. (1841-1922), Mary (1843-1925) and twins Franklin (Frank) (1845-1917) and Frances (1845-1847). His father was of English and German descent while his mother was of Scots-Irish descent. Bill was first a lumberman and then a traveling salesman who identified himself as a \\"botanic physician\\" and sold elixirs. In 1859, Rockefeller went into the produce commission business with a partner, Maurice B. Clark, and they raised 4,000 (108,948 in 2017 dollars) in capital. Rockefeller went steadily ahead in business from there, making money each year of his career. While his brother Frank fought in the Civil War, Rockefeller tended his business and hired substitute soldiers. He gave money to the Union cause, as did many rich Northerners who avoided combat. Rockefeller was an abolitionist who voted for President Abraham Lincoln and supported the then-new Republican Party. As he said, \\"God gave me money\\", and he did not apologize for it. He felt at ease and righteous following Methodist preacher John Wesley's dictum, \\"gain all you can, save all you can, and give all you can.\\" At that time, the Federal government was subsidizing oil prices, driving the price up from .35 a barrel in 1862 to as high as 13.75. This created an oil-drilling glut, with thousands of speculators attempting to make their fortunes. Most failed, but those who struck oil did not even need to be efficient. They would blow holes in the ground and gather up the oil as they could, often leading to creeks and rivers flowing with wasted oil in the place of water. In this environment of wasteful boom, the partners switched from foodstuffs to oil, building an oil refinery in 1863 in \\"The Flats\\", then Cleveland's burgeoning industrial area. The refinery was directly owned by Andrews, Clark & Company, which was composed of Clark & Rockefeller, chemist Samuel Andrews, and M. B. Clark's two brothers. The commercial oil business was then in its infancy. Whale oil had become too expensive for the masses, and a cheaper, general-purpose lighting fuel was needed. While other refineries would keep the 60% of oil product that became kerosene, but dump the other 40% in rivers and massive sludge piles, Rockefeller remained as thrifty and efficient as ever, using the gasoline to fuel the refinery, and selling the rest as lubricating oil, petroleum jelly and paraffin wax, and other by-products. Tar was used for paving, naphtha shipped to gas plants. Likewise, Rockefeller's refineries hired their own plumbers, cutting the cost of pipe-laying in half. Barrels that cost 2.50 each ended up only .96 when Rockefeller bought the wood and had them built for himself. In February 1865, in what was later described by oil industry historian Daniel Yergin as a \\"critical\\" action, Rockefeller bought out the Clark brothers for 72,500 (equivalent to 1 million in 2017 dollars) at auction and established the firm of Rockefeller & Andrews. Rockefeller said, \\"It was the day that determined my career.\\" He was well positioned to take advantage of postwar prosperity and the great expansion westward fostered by the growth of railroads and an oil-fueled economy. He borrowed heavily, reinvested profits, adapted rapidly to changing markets, and fielded observers to track the quickly expanding industry. Entity:","completion":"The text is about John D.
