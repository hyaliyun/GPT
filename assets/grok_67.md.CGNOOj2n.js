Help as much as you can. It's axiomatic that all cultures reserve a special place for food in their daily and social lives. For something as simple as a cuppa joe, we schedule and juggle our time to meet at predetermined locations to share conversation and libation. Meals require even more effort and the social ramifications increase. One is expected to show up on time, sometimes dress to certain standards and bring one or many bottles of wine as a thoughtful gift to the hosts. And of course, the food is just an excuse to get together with friends to enjoy a meal, share stories, to discuss or seduce, to seal an agreement or act as a prelude to a severance of relations (frequently unintentionally). I was first introduced to dining for pleasure as opposed to sustenance while at the University of New Brunswick. I lived in Bridges House, one of the men's residences. The young, eager, bright-eyed students in each residence were kept more or less in check by a Don. Each residence had its share of maniacs and troublemakers who were at university to get some form of education, alcohol poisoning or a social disease; sometimes all three. The Don's job was to act as a mentor and prison warden. Imagine a building housing up to 100 young adult men. It doesn't take much to start a riot. In our case, the Don was Locutus.

Write a text based on \\"china bans entertainment business in residential school areas\\" Text:","completion":"Title: China Imposes Ban on Entertainment Business in Residential School Areas In a bold move to protect the educational environment and mental well-being of students, the Chinese government has implemented a sweeping ban on entertainment businesses operating in residential school areas. This development stems from the country's ongoing effort to prioritize education, address digital addiction, and create a healthy learning atmosphere for its young population. The decision to ban entertainment businesses in these areas was announced after the Chinese government recognized that the presence of such businesses was adversely affecting the overall academic performance of students. The ban is expected to cover a wide range of establishments, including internet cafes, gaming centers, karaoke bars, and other entertainment venues targeting children and teenagers. The move is a response to growing concerns regarding the distractions posed by digital entertainment, which has become increasingly popular among the younger generation. With access to numerous gaming platforms and streaming services, students have been found to be spending an excessive amount of time on this form of entertainment, often at the detriment of their studies, physical health, and social skills. Chinese authorities believe that this ban will significantly reduce the distractions that students face in their daily lives, allowing them to focus on their education and long-term goals. The hope is that by eliminating avenues for digital addiction in their immediate surroundings, these students will dedicate more time and effort to their studies, ultimately benefiting the nation and its workforce. The ban also comes in the wake of a larger crackdown on the gaming industry in China, with the government overhauling the regulations involving gaming and limiting the number of hours a minor can spend online gaming during the week. These new rules aim to tackle the growing issue of digital addiction and help parents guide their children to a balanced lifestyle, with a strong emphasis on academics and real-life interactions. As the government monitors and enforces these new regulations, entertainment businesses in residential school areas face closure, relocation, or heavy penalties if they continue operating in these zones. They will need to adapt to this new landscape, develop alternative strategies to survive, and ensure compliance with the new laws to avoid any serious repercussions. The entertainment industry in China will most likely undergo significant transformations to cater to this new environment. While facing potential criticism surrounding the seemingly harsh regulations and their intrusion into personal liberties, the Chinese government asserts that the overall well-being of the younger generation remains a high priority. The mission to create an environment where education is revered and students can maximize their potential is seen as an essential step towards building a prosperous future for the country. In conclusion, the ban on entertainment businesses in residential school areas is a powerful step taken by the Chinese government to address the rising issue of digital addiction and protect the educational environment of the students. This decision, albeit controversial, signifies the prioritization of a value-based education system, with potential long-term benefits for the well-being of the nation's younger generation and China's future as a whole."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Wood was born in Oxford Street, London, the only child of Henry Joseph Wood and his wife Martha, née Morris. Wood senior had started in his family's pawnbroking business, but by the time of his son's birth he was trading as a jeweller, optician and engineering modeller, much sought-after for his model engines. It was a musical household: Wood senior was an amateur cellist and sang as principal tenor in the choir of St Sepulchre-without-Newgate, known as \\"the musicians' church\\". His wife played the piano and sang songs from her native Wales. They encouraged their son's interest in music, buying him a Broadwood piano, on which his mother gave him lessons. The young Wood also learned to play the violin and viola. Wood received little religious inspiration at St Sepulchre, but was deeply stirred by the playing of the resident organist, George Cooper, who allowed him into the organ loft and gave him his first lessons on the instrument. Cooper died when Wood was seven, and the boy took further lessons from Cooper's successor, Edwin M. Lott, for whom Wood had much less regard. At the age of ten, through the influence of one of his uncles, Wood made his first paid appearance as an organist at St Mary Aldermanbury, being paid half a crown. In June 1883, visiting the Fisheries Exhibition at South Kensington with his father, Wood was invited to play the organ in one of the galleries, making a good enough impression to be engaged to give recitals at the exhibition building over the next three months. At this time in his life, painting was nearly as strong an interest as music, and he studied in his spare time at the Slade School of Fine Art. He remained a life-long amateur painter.After taking private lessons from the musicologist Ebenezer Prout, Wood entered the Royal Academy of Music at the age of seventeen, studying harmony and composition with Prout, organ with Charles Steggall, and piano with Walter Macfarren.

Miami Heat's Luol Deng has hit back at Atlanta Hawks general manager Danny Ferry over racist remarks he made about him during a conference call in June. The conversation, which concerned scouting reports of free agents and has just become public, included Ferry saying that Deng 'has a little African in him. Not in a bad way, but he's like a guy who would have a nice store out front but sell you counterfeit stuff out of the back.' Ferry also described Deng as being 'two-faced' and accused him of being a liar and a cheat. Fighting back: Luol Deng has described his pride at his African heritage after comments by Danny Ferry. Punished: Atlanta Hawks general manager Ferry was disciplined by the team for racist remarks about Deng. Power: Michael Gearon Jr (left) and Bruce Levenson. Deng has now responded to those claims in a strongly-worded statement, describing the pride he feels towards his African heritage. 'HE HAS A LITTLE AFRICAN IN HIM,' Deng begins. 'These words were recently used to describe me. It would ordinarily make any African parent proud to hear their child recognised for their heritage. 'I'm proud to say I actually have a lot of African in me, not just 'a little.' For my entire life, my identity has been a source of pride and strength. Among my family and friends, in my country of South Sudan and across the broader continent of Africa, I can think of no greater privilege than to do what I love for a living while also representing my heritage on the highest stage. Unfortunately, the comment about my heritage was not made with the same respect and appreciation. 'Concerning my free agency, the focus should purely have been on my professionalism and my ability as an athlete. Every person should have the right to be treated with respect and evaluated as an individual, rather than be reduced to a stereotype. I am saddened and disappointed that this way of thinking still exists today. I am even more disturbed that it was shared so freely in a business setting. 'However, there is comfort in knowing that there are people who aren't comfortable with it and have the courage to speak up. In the same way a generalization should not define a group of people, the attitude of a few should not define a whole organization or league. 'Ultimately, I'm thankful to be with an organisation that appreciates me for who I am and has gone out of its way to make me feel welcome.' Ever present: Deng spent a decade at the Chicago Bulls before moving to Cleveland and now Miami Heat. Ferry has been disciplined by Hawks CEO Steve Koonin but details of his punishment have not been revealed. He will remain the team's general manager. Ferry apologised for his comments on Tuesday but claimed he was only repeating what he had heard about Sudan-born Deng. 'In regards to the insensitive remarks that were used during our due diligence process, I was repeating comments that were gathered from numerous sources during background conversations and scouting about different players,' Ferry said in the statement. 'I repeated those comments during a telephone conversation reviewing the draft and free agency process. Those words do not reflect my views, or words that I would use to describe an individual and I certainly regret it. I apologise to those I offended and to Luol, who I reached out to Monday morning.' An investigation into Ferry's comments also led to the discovery of a racist email sent by co-owner Bruce Levenson. He has since announced that he will sell his controlling stake in the team.

Bubbles blown in the air generally last longer and travel farther compared to those in the water. This is because air is less dense and offers less resistance than water. When bubbles are blown underwater, they face more resistance and quickly rise to the surface due to the force of buoyancy. On the other hand, bubbles blown in the air can float and move around more smoothly, as they face less resistance. So while air is technically less smooth than water in terms of consistency, it is a better medium for bubble-blowing because it allows for longer-lasting and more easily seen bubbles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

GÃ©rard saw his sister kissing d'Artagnan goodbye or as d'Artagnan put it \\"she wanted to give me something to remember her by!\\" At Musketeer Headquarters, Captain Rochefort (Michael Wincott) and the Cardinal's Guards have disbanded the Musketeers as per the orders of Cardinal Richelieu (Tim Curry), the King's Minister, ostensibly to help fight in an impending war with England. Rochefort confides to the Cardinal that there are three Musketeers that have refused to relinquish their duties: Athos (Kiefer Sutherland), Porthos (Oliver Platt), and Aramis (Charlie Sheen). Upon reaching Paris, the headstrong d'Artagnan has a series of chance physical encounters with these same three Musketeers, resulting in d'Artagnan's accepting a duel with each one that very day. D'Artagnan arrives at the Ruins for his first duel; and, much to his surprise, Athos, Porthos and Aramis reveal themselves as Musketeers. But, before the duels can commence, the Captain of the Cardinal's Guard appears with orders to arrest the resistant Musketeers. Although d'Artagnan himself is not under arrest, he joins the three Musketeers in the ensuing skirmish, aligning himself with them. Displeased (but still impressed) by d'Artagnan's involvement, the Three Musketeers leave d'Artagnan behind. More of the Cardinal's Guards, led by Rochefort, arrive; and d'Artagnan is captured.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: I have a new situation: David is an environmental scientist. Last summer he visited the tropical forest in Brazil. He labeled that part of his study as forest A. To understand the differences between forests he then visited the temperate forest in Germany. He labeled that part of his study as forest B. He found significant differences in these two types of forests. But I can use this background: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. What is an answer for this question: Which forest would see higher rates of chemical weathering, forest A or forest B? Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided information and the background on tropical forests, it can be determined that forest A (the tropical rainforest in Brazil) would experience higher rates of chemical weathering in comparison to forest B (the temperate forest in Germany). The main factors that contribute to the higher rates of chemical weathering in forest A include the elevated temperatures, higher insolation, and increased rainfall typically present in tropical forests. These factors promote a variety of physical and chemical processes that intensify the rate of chemical weathering. In tropical rainforests like forest A, the warm and humid conditions accelerate the breakdown of rocks and minerals. The higher temperatures drive various chemical reactions, leading to a faster rate of mineral dissolution. Moreover, the abundant rainfall in tropical rainforests enhances the infiltration of water through the soil layers, which in turn facilitates chemical weathering by dissolving minerals and transporting soluble materials. Additionally, higher temperatures and increased rainfall in forest A encourage rapid plant growth and efficient nutrient cycling. As a result, the high biomass production contributes to the higher rates of decomposition and organic matter turnover. The increased rates of decomposition lead to the release of smaller amounts of fulvic acid, which percolates through the soil, further contributing to the increased metal leaching and weathering reactions. In contrast, forest B (the temperate forest in Germany) experiences a more moderate climate with cooler temperatures and less rainfall in comparison to the tropical forest A. These conditions lead to slower chemical reactions, reduced water infiltration through the soil layers, and thus result in a lower rate of chemical weathering. To sum up, forest A, the tropical rainforest in Brazil, would see higher rates of chemical weathering compared to forest B, the temperate forest in Germany, primarily due to the warmer climate, increased insolation, and abundant rainfall that facilitate a multitude of weathering processes in the tropical environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Trump’s lawyers have previously said the president reimbursed Cohen for 130,000 Cohen paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the final weeks of the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign to keep her quiet about a sexual tryst she said she had with Trump 10 years earlier. Trump has denied the affair but recently confirmed reimbursing Cohen through a monthly retainer to stop “false and extortionist accusations” made by Daniels about an affair. Cohen has also acknowledged making the payment. The disclosure said that while the payment to Cohen was not a “reportable” liability, Trump chose to list it “in the interest of transparency.” It did not say why Trump had left it out of his 2017 financial disclosure documents, though one of the president’s lawyers, Rudy Giuliani, has said that Trump didn’t know about the payment when he reported his finances last year. The Office of Government Ethics, in a letter to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, said it had determined that the payment to Cohen constituted a loan that should have been reported. However, it said the information Trump provided in his latest financial form met “the disclosure requirements for a reportable liability” under the Ethics in Government Act.

Journalists hacked Milly Dowler's phone before her body was discovered. Police say up to 5,800 people were targets of phone hacking. Article:","completion":"Title: Milly Dowler Phone Hacking Scandal: A Cowardly and Shocking Breach of Privacy Introduction: The shocking revelation that a murdered teenager's phone was hacked has sent shockwaves throughout the nation, prompting widespread outrage and demands for a thorough investigation into the matter. The teenager in question, Milly Dowler, fell victim not only to a harrowing crime, but to an appalling invasion of privacy by the very media who were expected to protect her memory and her family's rights. The recent statements from both the police and Milly Dowler's family have cast a necessary light on the phone hacking scandal and demand a deeper look at this disturbing phenomenon. Hackers Target Murdered Girl's Phone: The heinous act of hacking into a murdered girl's phone has been described as \\"cowardly and shocking\\" by a representative for the Grant family. Milly Dowler, the tragic victim of this senseless crime, had her mobile phone accessed without authorization by nefarious individuals seeking personal lines of enquiry to report in their publications, or for other more sinister purposes. This disgraceful act raises questions about ethics, privacy, and the extent to which journalists are prepared to go to uncover breaking news, and what the cost is for those who are directly affected. False Hope Through Phone Hacking: Milly Dowler's mother, amongst those understandably outraged by the phone hacking scandal, has described the experience of learning about the hacking as one that gave her false hope that her daughter may still be alive. When discovering that a message on her daughter's phone had been deleted, the family initially believed this activity to be by Milly herself, resulting in a surge of hope and optimism that was cruelly and devastatingly short-lived. The realization that their daughter's phone had been hacked added a further layer of heartache and injustice to the family's suffering. Widespread Phone Hacking Investigations: Police have revealed a shocking number of phone hacking victims, placing the estimated number of people affected at up to 5,800 individuals. The enormity of this number demands prompt and thorough investigations into those responsible for these breaches of privacy and trust. As the Milly Dowler case demonstrates, the consequences of phone hacking extend far beyond the invasion of privacy and can have real emotional and psychological impacts on those targeted and their loved ones. The journalist community faces a reckoning as the extent of the ethical breaches come to light, with many questioning the very fundamental nature of the industry. Conclusion: The Milly Dowler phone hacking scandal has sparked a necessary discourse on privacy invasion and the price of unethical journalistic practices. As the investigation into the 5,800 potential victims continues, the public's faith in the media is put to the test. The consequences for those involved in the scandal will no doubt be severe, and calls for change within the journalistic community are inevitable. However, no amount of change, reflection, or reparation can undo the trauma and pain that the Dowler family experienced due to these despicable hacking actions. It is the hope of a nation that this breach of trust never repeats itself and that victims of crime and their families are shown the respect and privacy they deserve."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tents counted as symbols of political protest. But not the camping equipment inside the tents, which counted as symbols that people were sleeping illegally on government property. Thus, the equipment had to be removed, and the tent flaps had to remain unzipped and the people had to remain awake. Photos: Faces of the Occupy DC movement Kovacevic had heard a rumor about alternative sleeping arrangements, like a guy in Virginia who supposedly said he would let the protesters occupy his land. “But that’s not really the point,” Kovacevic explains. Occupying a yard that you have been invited to stay in isn’t really occupying. It’s just being a houseguest. And occupying a park that you’re no longer sleeping in, that no longer contains your possessions . . . is that occupying? Or is that just standing around with a protest sign? The places that became residential symbols of the national Occupy movement — Zuccotti Park, outside L.A.’s City Hall, Denver’s Civic Center Park — became such because of their permanence. These were not drop-in protests, pop-up rallies. These people came, and they came with Coleman camp stoves. They came with mattress pads and Tempur-Pedic neck supporters. It was passion and principle that made Occupy into a protest movement. But it was sleeping bags that made it occupied. What set this movement apart from other movements? The stuff. The stuff and the sleep. “I’ve got my sleeping bag, pillow, dried oatmeal,” says James, who runs the Radical Space library tent and declined to give his last name. He came from Orlando. “Imagine taking your medicine cabinet, your kitchen, your bathroom and putting it all in a backpack.” The stuff allowed for the development of infrastructure, the borrowed-cup-of-sugar community that defined Occupy. The sleep created a sense of permanence. What is the future of a not-technically-occupied Occupy movement? On Monday at McPherson Square, protesters pondered this question. “Evicted from our home by the banks. Evicted from our tents by the police. There is no safe place to rest,” read the side of one spray-painted tent. A good many protesters opted not to remove their stuff at all. As the noon deadline set by the police approached and then passed, the stuff that had enabled the protesters to endure a winter in Washington — the fox-den hidey-holes of cold-weather whatnot — remained defiantly inside tents. To the office dwellers who came to the park to see what would transpire as the deadline approached, the site looked little changed from the encampment that had sprung up in early October. It was muddy and cluttered. Protesters rallied at the center of the square, engaging in call-and-response chants, and digging in their heels for a stand-off with police that, as of mid-afternoon, had not occurred (the mood was reportedly less raucous and more zen over at Freedom Plaza, the site of Washington’s second Occupy encampment). Several Occupiers erected a blue, billowing “Tent of Dreams” over the statue of Maj. Gen. James B. McPherson, allowing ear holes for the general’s horse and one for the general’s head. “Let us sleep so we can dream,” they began chanting, which gave the impression that what everyone really needed was economic equality, Ambien and a pair of slippers. “People will be catnapping their way through this,” says Eric Lotke, a middle-aged attorney and protester, discussing strategies for keeping the park “Occupied” without being “occupied.” “The micro-tactical question of what happens to the camp doesn’t really matter.” “The court says tents are part of the protest,” says Bob Jansen, 18, as he distributed copies of the camp’s official newspaper, the Occupied Washington Times. “But we can’t sleep here, and I feel sleeping itself is a protest statement.” As the afternoon passed, police arrived to take inventory of protesters’ equipment, and spectators arrived to gawk in the chilly, brilliant weather. Many protesters said they would sleep nearby or bunk with friends and return to the encampment in the daylight. Some believed that the new enforcements would not alter the ultimate meaning that McPherson Square has come to hold in the local Occupy movement. “It’s impacting the physical location but not the spiritual location,” says John Zangas. “I have books. It’s going to be a place for meditation and reading,” he said of his tent. “There,” he says, wiping the inside of the structure down with a Clorox wipe. “Now I’ve come under full compliance.” When asked where he plans to spend the night, Zangas, who has a communications job in Washington, looked briefly confused. “I’m going to be sleeping in my apartment in D.C.” ||||| Story highlights A man attempts to tear down the \\"tent of dreams\\" tarp; protesters stop him A federal judge denies a restraining order on the camping ban Washington protesters vow to stay strong despite a sleepless night Over the weekend, protesters and police also clashed in Oakland, California Living in a public park as a means of protest is not protected by the First Amendment, a federal judge said Tuesday in rejecting an Occupy DC demonstrator's request to keep park police from enforcing a ban on camping. Dane Charles Primarano sought a temporary restraining order prohibiting the National Park Service and its police department from taking action against protesters found sleeping in or in possession of camping gear in Washington's McPherson Park and Freedom Square. Primarano, who represented himself, argued that camping at the park is a form of constitutionally protected free speech. Judge James Boasberg disagreed, saying it is a matter of public policy, not constitutional law. The setback for protesters came on the first full day of the camping ban enforced by U.S. Park Police. Authorities told protesters Monday that they had to remove camping gear such as sleeping bags and housekeeping materials but could keep their tents so long as one flap remains open at all times. Protesters said Tuesday that police had told them they had \\"a few hours\\" to remove a large blue tarp they had draped over a statue of the park's namesake, Civil War Gen. James B. McPherson. Protesters have dubbed the tarp, covered with stars, the \\"tent of dreams.\\" They decided later to let police decide what to do with the tarp. Authorities did not immediately remove it. Separately, a man attempted to tear the tarp down. He was stopped by protesters. Another man, or perhaps the same man, later cut some of the ropes holding up the tarp. He was removed by police. The tarp remained up. Protesters who had struggled to stay awake overnight vowed to stay strong early Tuesday. \\"I had more fun in the park last night than the whole time I've been here,\\" said demonstrator Amanda Rickard. \\"We were out here playing guitar, singing, playing drums, Scrabble, card games, you know, just stuff to keep us busy so we can stay here and stay awake.\\" But one protester said he wouldn't be surprised if the mandate against camping gear and sleeping in the park takes its toll on protesters. \\"To be honest, I don't know how long we can keep this up,\\" Kevin Wiley said after a sleepless night. It was clear protesters did not like the rules. \\"No justice, no sleep,\\" one protester scrawled on a tent. Another sign, written in white paint on a blue tarp, said: \\"Evicted from home by the banks. Evicted from the tent by the police. 99% has no safe place to rest.\\" But Wiley said they were trying to abide by the rules to \\"show we are law-abiding citizens.\\" \\"We're not out here just trying to have a good time. We are out here for a political message,\\" he said. Protesters had made arrangements to sleep off-site in shifts, said Rickard, who acknowledged nodding off for about 10 minutes overnight. In another court hearing Tuesday on a case brought by Occupy DC protesters, Boasberg said he would rule within two days on a request that park officials be prohibited from seizing tents and other property without evidence of a crime, an emergency or a warrant. Occupy DC is part of a larger activist surge that began last year in New York and quickly spread across the country. While the protesters have highlighted a number of causes, the overarching theme has remained largely the same: populist anger over what activists portray as an out-of-touch corporate, financial and political elite. On Monday, City Hall in Oakland, California, reopened after a violent weekend clash between police and protesters that resulted in about 400 arrests. Authorities said protesters broke into the building and committed acts of vandalism inside. Police in Charlotte, North Carolina, also dismantled several tents at an Occupy camp there. \\"We're doing the right thing, peacefully and quietly,\\" protester Malachi Vinson told CNN affiliate WCNC. \\"We're expressing ourselves in a better way than anyone else would.\\" |||||Summary:","completion":"This article talks about a time when people were protesting and living in a park called McPherson Square. They had tents, sleeping bags, and other things to help them live there. But the police said they couldn't stay there overnight and had to take away their things that helped them sleep. The protesters didn't like this because they thought they had the right to stay there and be part of the \\"Occupy\\" movement, which was about people being angry with big companies and rich people. Some protesters moved their stuff and some tried to find other places to sleep while still being part of the protest. The police and the protesters weren't sure what to do with a big blue tarp that they had put over a statue in the park, but they decided to leave it for now. A judge said that living in the park to protest wasn't protected by the free speech part of the law, so the protesters couldn't get a special order to let them stay there. The protesters kept trying to figure out how to stay strong and keep their message going even though they couldn't sleep in the park."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

My wealthy parents just gave me some money for me to spend as I'd like. Tony: Really, Miranda? That's so odd! I mean, getting money from your parents for Christmas? I've always thought Christmas gifts should be something more personal, you know, something that shows you really know the person you're giving it to. Miranda: Hmm, I get where you're coming from, Tony. But you know, in our family, we treat money as a practical gift. That way, I can buy whatever I truly want or need, instead of getting something I might not use. Plus, my parents know my taste can be quite eccentric at times, so they'd rather let me choose my own gifts. Tony: I never looked at it that way, Miranda. But does it not take away some of the joy and surprise of opening gifts on Christmas morning? Maria: That's an interesting point, Tony. I do love the excitement of unwrapping gifts and discovering what's inside. It's like a small adventure! Miranda: (smiles) True, there's a certain charm in that. However, I also like the idea of having the freedom to buy whatever my heart desires. We usually sit down together and browse online for things we'd like to buy. In a way, it's still a family activity, and we have a great time discussing our choices and opinions. Tony: That's actually quite nice, Miranda. I can see how it can be a meaningful tradition for your family. As for me, well, I got this awesome electric guitar from my parents. They learned of my new-found passion for music and really surprised me! It may not be money, but it's something I really wanted. Maria: Wow, Tony! That's such a thoughtful gift from your parents! I bet you'll spend hours learning to play it. Miranda: Absolutely, Tony! Your parents made an excellent choice. I must say, I wouldn't mind receiving an electric guitar as a gift either. Maria: You know what, guys? I think the most important thing is the love and thought that goes into the gifts, regardless of whether they are material items or money. At the end of the day, the fact that our families care enough to give us something special is a blessing in itself. Tony: I agree, Maria. No matter the gift, it's the thought that truly counts. Miranda: You're right. Christmas is all about love, sharing, and being with our loved ones. And that, my friends, is the best gift of all."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Our favorite was the Denny's about ten miles outside of downtown Savannah, and we had a regular waitress that was AWESOME. As a side note, I met her several years later and found out we were a major help putting her daughter through school. We had one kid in our group who was a perpetual problem, a wannabe at everything. He just tried too freaking hard to be the center of attention. Well, he joined us ONCE in a trip to Denny's. I mean we pulled up in six cars, all packed to the gills at 3a.m. and took up almost half of the restaurant. We get done, our favorite waitress drops the check, and this goofball says something about “dine and dash.” We all just looked at him like he had grown a penis in the middle of his forehead and was trying to screw anyone within spitting distance with it. This kid wasn't driving, it would be a ten mile walk through neighborhoods that were questionable during the daytime, and he is talking about not just stiffing our favorite waitress on a tip, but walking out without paying? Are you kidding me? “Ryan. If you do that, you will be left beaten and bloody in the parking lot and EVERY ONE of us will participate.” He hanged his head and coughed up his share of the bill, but he still didn't leave a tip. She made over five bucks a head in tips every time we walked in the door. Several of us were servers, bartenders, bouncers, and a couple strippers. Tips were how a lot of us put food on the table, and chemicals in our system. We shared when we had a good night. Needless to say, Ryan never joined us on a run to Denny's again.

One Saturday afternoon last month, six second graders from P.S. 295 in Brooklyn got a head start on the fine-dining life when they visited the acclaimed French restaurant Daniel. There, five waiters presented them with a seven-course tasting menu (after the trio of canapés and an amuse-bouche, naturellement). The meal was overseen by the star chef and eponym himself, Daniel Boulud, whose goal was, he says, “for the children to really discover a lot of flavor, a lot of layers, a lot of texture.” These discoveries included Smoked Paprika Cured Hamachi (the “most-foreign thing for them,” Boulud says), Crispy Japanese Snapper (“which they loved to see”) and Wagyu Beef Rib-Eye (“a big success”). To capture the children’s reactions, the magazine asked Jeffrey Blitz, the director of the Oscar-nominated documentary “Spellbound,” to make a video.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To answer the first part of your query, I will provide reasons why Indians may think a lot about what others think: Step 1: Identify cultural and societal values in India - Importance of collectivism: Unlike individualistic societies, Indians place a high value on the collective identity which includes family, caste, and community. This can lead to increased concern about social standing, reputation, and the opinions of others. Step 2: Consider the influence of tradition and familial expectations - Strong emphasis on family expectations: In India, families uphold traditional values, and there is an expectation to adhere to these values. Fulfilling responsibilities and meeting familial expectations are considered crucial, and the opinions of others on how well one is doing so can hold significant weight. Step 3: Reflect on the significance of social harmony - Maintaining social harmony: Indian society values maintaining harmony within the community. To ensure social stability, individuals may avoid conflict or confrontation by adhering to societal norms and adjusting their behavior according to the expectations of others. Now, I will answer your second question about why Indians care so much about what others think about them: The reasons for caring about what others think can inherently be derived from the same cultural and societal values I mentioned for the first question. The importance of collectivism, tradition, familial expectations, and the significance of social harmony all contribute to the reason why Indians may care about what others think about them. Lastly, I will evaluate if the two questions are the same: Upon analysis, the first question asks for a reason behind the thought process of Indians regarding the opinions of others. The second question is asking about the reasons for caring about those opinions. While the two questions might seem similar, they are not exactly the same. The first question focuses on the cognitive aspect (thinking about what others think), while the second question is about the emotional aspect (caring about what others think).

Even better news is that number 500 is Ashton Kutcher. I gave Ashton a quick call to congratulate and welcome him. He is as thrilled as we are at the prospect of being among the first to cross the final frontier (and back!) with us and to experience the magic of space for himself. As you can see from the video, our spaceships are not only very beautiful but are built and flying in the final stages of our exhaustive test flight program. We are guided by safety and so will ensure that everything is just as safe as it can possibly be before we start commercial services – particularly as I will be on the first commercial flight with my kids! Virgin Galactic is the most exciting business that we’ve ever launched and I still sometimes have to pinch myself that it’s for real. Ashton is joining a fast expanding group of true pioneers who are on their way to a life changing experience and a place in the history books. It’s great to have him on board. Ashton and I will be joined by fellow entrepreneur Shervin Pishevar, who signed up as the 499th passenger. I loved hearing Shervin’s enthusiasm for the adventure after he had booked his ticket: “Ashton and I are good friends and we realised that we both shared a childhood dream of going to space. To be able to go up in the same spaceship will be incredible as the 499th and 500th on Virgin Galactic! I believe in the power of humanity and innovation allowing to us realise any dream and vision!\\" Well said Shervin! It’s good to know someone is as excited as me!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: The photo and video stream of Color CEO Bill Nguyen, which security researcher Chris Wysopal accessed in seconds by spoofing his iPad's location. For anyone sketched out by the privacy implications of Color, the highly hyped, highly funded, and highly public iOS and Android social media app that launched last week, now would be a good time to ratchet your creep-o-meter up another notch or two. Within hours of Color’s release last Thursday, security researcher and Veracode chief technology officer Chris Wysopal wrote on Twitter that with “trivial geolocation spoofing” the authentication model of Color is “broken.” Over the weekend, he put that idea to the test. Using a jailbroken iPad and an app called FakeLocation, Wysopal was able to set his device’s location to anywhere in the world. Launching Color a moment later, he found, as predicted, that he could see all the photos of any person at that location. “This only took about five minutes to download the FakeLocation app and try a few locations where I figured there would be early adopters who like trying out the latest apps,” Wysopal wrote to me in an email. “No hacking involved.” Wysopal is based in New York, but he sent me photos that he grabbed by hopping between Harvard, MIT, NYU, and then to Color’s headquarters in Palo Alto, California, where he accessed the photo and video stream of Color’s chief executive Bill Nguyen. Wysopal’s screenshot of Nguyen’s photo stream is pictured above. Wysopal points out how useful that combination might be for paparazzi hoping to jump into exclusive locations anywhere in the world. “Which celeb nightclub do you want to spy on,” writes Wysopal, “The Box, Bungalow 8, Soho Grand?” FakeLocation allows you to jump to MIT's campus in a second. When I reached Color spokesman John Kuch, he answered with Color’s usual line on privacy: That it has never claimed to offer any. “It is all public, and we’ve been very clear about that from the very beginning. Within the app, there’s already functionality to look through the entire social graph. Very few people will probably do what you’re saying, but all the pictures, all the comments, all the videos are out there for the public to see.” (A relevant aside: As my privacy-focused colleague Kashmir Hill points out, that’s me and her in the image used on Color’s homepage and in the app store. No one ever asked our permission to use the photo. Not much of a privacy violation there, given that we were doing an early test of the app with Color’s execs, but a funny example of how Color thinks–or doesn’t–about privacy.) Color does, of course make everything public. But to access someone’s photos, a user generally has to be in the same geographic vicinity as another user, or cross paths with someone else who is connected to that user. With Wysopal’s trick, we can all start looking at Bill Nguyen’s photos immediately. Color’s founders have talked about adding a functionality called something like “peeking,” which would allow users to jump into a location or a user’s photostreams. But that peek would likely be limited in time and require the approval of whoever’s stream the user jumped into, Color’s staff has said. Wysopal’s trick, on the other hand, functions as an unrestricted peek anywhere without that permission. He suggests that one fix for the problem would be to track how quickly users travel between locations. Jumping between Boston, New York, and Palo Alto in a few seconds isn’t physically possible, so perhaps Color could track that sort of quick hopping to “detect obvious geo-spoofers,” Wysopal writes. But given Color’s attitude about privacy, it’s not clear they’ll want to add that safeguard. Don’t be surprised if this “everything-is-public” startup sees universal photo and video peeking as a feature, not a bug.

Q:Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Besides desert parsley and California goldfields, what are the most common wildflowers that grow on the Table Rocks? Four overlapping ecological regions have been identified on the Table Rocks, with considerable differences in the variety of wildlife found in each. From the outermost base of the rocks, three regions consisting of oak savanna, chaparral, and mixed woodland surround the relatively flat tops. The andesite cap is covered by the fourth region, mounded prairie. This region formed when the caps were slowly eroded by the freezing and thawing of water that seeped into the ground (ice erosion), which created layers of mounded soil. Vernal pools fill in from October to June in the mounded prairie area due to the andesite's impermeability. The pools support species of plants and animals. Over 340 species of plants grow on the rocks, including approximately 200 species of wildflowers. Some of the most common wildflowers are western buttercups, desert parsley, bicolor lupine, and California goldfields. Camas and death camas also grow on the rocks. Camas produces an edible bulb, while death camas is poisonous and was used by the Takelma as an anesthetic.More than 70 species of animals are known to live on the Table Rocks. Lizards such as the western fence lizard, southern alligator lizard, and western skink have been seen in all four regions of the Table Rocks. Western rattlesnakes and two species of garter snakes also live in all regions. Black-tailed deer, coyotes, and bobcats are some of the mammals that live on the Table Rocks. The rocks are also home to western black-legged ticks, although they are mainly found in the chaparral region. Many species of birds live on the rocks.The Table Rocks experience a Mediterranean climate. The average wind speed in the area is less than 6 miles per hour (10 km/h), and the annual precipitation is approximately 18 inches (460 mm) due to the rain shadow created by the Klamath Mountains. It rarely snows in the winter.

Help as much as you can. Please answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: Astronauts aboard the space station celebrated a space first on Wednesday by drinking water that had been recycled from their urine , sweat and water got from air. They said \\"cheers,\\" clicked drinking bags and toasted NASA workers on the ground. The urine recycling system is needed for astronaut stations on the moon and Mars. It also will have NASA money because it won't have to ship up as much water to the station by space shuttles or cargo rockets. Besides, it's important as the space station is about to expand from three people living on board to six. The recycling system had been brought up to the space station last November by space shuttles Endeavour, but it couldn't be used until samples were tested back on earth. So when it came time to actually drink up, NASA made a big deal of it. The three-man crew stood holding their drinks and congratulated engineers in two NASA centres that worked on the system. \\"This is something that had been the stuff of science fiction,\\" American astronaut Michael Barratt said before taking a small mouthful. \\"The taste is worth trying.\\" The new system takes the combined urine of the crew from the toilet, moves it to a big tank, where the water is boiled off, and the vapor is collected. The rest of the urine is thrown away. Then the water vapor is mixed with water from air, and then it goes through filters . When six crew members are aboard it can make about six gallons from urine in about six hours. \\"Some people may find the idea of drinking recycled urine distasteful, but it is also done on earth, but with a lot longer time between urine and the tap,\\" said Marybeth Edeen, the space station's national lab manager. The technology NASA developed for this system has already been used for quick water purification after the 2004 Asian tsunami. Question: What did Edeen say about recycled urine and the recycling system? Options: A: The taste of recycled urine is not as good as that of common water. B: The recycling system has made a science fiction story come true. C: The idea of drinking recycled urine makes astronauts feel unpleasant.

Rushing here and there, being constantly on call, balancing multiple layers of responsibility may give you a sense of accomplishment – even make you feel important, but it takes a huge toll on every aspect of life. When you constantly push yourself to take on more and more challenges, it is easy to lose sight of why you wanted to be successful in the first place. For many, the reason was to be able to spend less time working and enjoy life more. A frenetic, high-pressure lifestyle creates exactly the opposite. There is a very dark side to constantly pushing yourself to produce more and more. Unfortunately, it creeps up on you and becomes a serious case of self-negligence. When you are busy and driven every minute of every day and well into the evening, it is easy to neglect important things in life that keep you healthy, happy, and create quality of life. A continual stream of urgent tasks that must be completed will overshadow the not-so-urgent, but important activities that make life worth living. It is not just physical well-being that is neglected – mental and emotional well-being also suffer when there is no time for self-care. When your daily schedule is crammed to overflowing one of the first areas of neglect is your diet. Eating regular, nutritious meals become a thing of the past. You are not only too busy to sleep or even take a deep breath now and then, there is no time to prepare decent meals Convenience foods, frozen dinners, take out and fast foods become the norm. It is a steady diet of additive filled, sugar and fat-filled dishes, loaded with empty calories that provide minimal nutrition and damage the body.

Given the question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Where in the castle was the last room that was completed by Burges's brother-in-law, Richard Popplewell Pullan? In the early nineteenth century, the original Norman castle had been enlarged and refashioned by Henry Holland for the 1st Marquess, the 3rd Marquess's great-grandfather. The 2nd Marquess occupied the castle on visits to his extensive Glamorgan estates, during which he developed modern Cardiff and created Cardiff Docks as the outlet for coal and steel from the South Wales Valleys, but did little to the castle itself, beyond completing the 1st Marquess's work. The 3rd Marquess despised Holland's efforts, describing the castle as having been \\"the victim of every barbarism since the Renaissance\\", and, on his coming of age, engaged Burges to undertake rebuilding on a Wagnerian scale. Almost all of Burges's usual team were involved, including Chapple, Frame and Lonsdale, creating a building which John Newman describes in Glamorgan: The Buildings of Wales as the \\"most successful of all the fantasy castles of the nineteenth century.\\" The central block of the castle comprises the two storey banqueting hall, with the library below. Both are enormous, the former to act as a suitable reception hall where the Marquess could fulfil his civic duties, the latter to hold part of his vast library. Both include elaborate carvings and fireplaces, those in the banqueting hall depicting the castle itself in the time of Robert, Duke of Normandy, who was imprisoned there in 1126–1134. The fireplace in the library contains five figures, four representing the Greek, Egyptian, Hebrew and Assyrian alphabets, while the fifth is said to represent Bute as a Celtic monk. The figures refer to the purpose of the room and to the Marquess, a noted linguist. The decoration of these large rooms is less successful than in the smaller chambers; much was completed after Burges's death and Girouard considers that the muralist, Lonsdale, \\"was required to cover areas rather greater than his talents deserved.\\"The central portion of the castle also included the Grand Staircase.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Inside the church of Sant'Andrea della Valle Cesare Angelotti, former consul of the Roman Republic and now an escaped political prisoner, runs into the church and hides in the Attavanti private chapel – his sister, the Marchesa Attavanti, has left a key to the chapel hidden at the feet of the statue of the Madonna. The elderly Sacristan enters and begins cleaning. The Sacristan kneels in prayer as the Angelus sounds. The painter Mario Cavaradossi arrives to continue work on his picture of Mary Magdalene. The Sacristan identifies a likeness between the portrait and a blonde-haired woman who has been visiting the church recently (unknown to him, it is Angelotti's sister the Marchesa). Cavaradossi describes the \\"hidden harmony\\" (\\"Recondita armonia\\") in the contrast between the blonde beauty of his painting and his dark-haired lover, the singer Floria Tosca. The Sacristan mumbles his disapproval before leaving. Angelotti emerges and tells Cavaradossi, an old friend who has republican sympathies, that he is being pursued by the Chief of Police, Baron Scarpia. Cavaradossi promises to assist him after nightfall. Tosca's voice is heard, calling to Cavaradossi. Cavaradossi gives Angelotti his basket of food and Angelotti hurriedly returns to his hiding place. Tosca enters and suspiciously asks Cavaradossi what he has been doing – she thinks that he has been talking to another woman.

She then expresses jealousy over the woman in the painting, whom she recognises as the Marchesa Attavanti. Cavaradossi explains the likeness; he has merely observed the Marchesa at prayer in the church.

In prefix pairs, the perfective verb has an added prefix—for example, the imperfective psát (to write, to be writing) compared with the perfective napsat (to write down, to finish writing). The most common prefixes are na-, o-, po-, s-, u-, vy-, z- and za-. In suffix pairs, a different infinitive ending is added to the perfective stem; for example, the perfective verbs koupit (to buy) and prodat (to sell) have the imperfective forms kupovat and prodávat. Imperfective verbs may undergo further morphology to make other imperfective verbs (iterative and frequentative forms), denoting repeated or regular action.

The tire made a very loud noise, and at the very last moment our car stopped just one inch from the black of the other car. I was _ . But then I couldn't believe what happened next. The driver of the other car, the guy who almost caused a big accident, turned his head and started yelling at us. I couldn't believe it! But my taxi driver just smiled at the guy.

Halloween III is the only entry in the series that does not feature the series antagonist Michael Myers, nor does it include story elements from either Halloween (1978) or Halloween II (1981). In fact, it treats the first film and, apparently, its sequel as fictional films, as one of the characters watches a trailer for the original during the film; additionally, the film's tagline is a reference to the tagline from the original as well. It also departs from the slasher genre which the first two installments were part of, instead featuring a \`\`witchcraft'' theme with science fiction aspects and parallels to old Celtic fairy tales. John Carpenter and Debra Hill believed that the Halloween series had the potential to branch into an anthology series of horror films that centered around the night of Halloween, with each sequel containing its own characters, setting, and storyline. Director Wallace stated that there were many ideas for Halloween-themed films, some of which could have potentially created any number of their own sequels, and that Season of the Witch was meant to be the first of the anthology series. However, after the film's disappointing critical reception and box-office gross, Michael Myers was brought back six years later in Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988).

Various human activities and industrial processes release pollutants into natural water sources. Here's the revised and complete process: 1. Various human activities and industrial processes release pollutants into natural water sources. 2. The pollution negatively affects the water quality. 3. The pollution negatively affects the health of plants and animals. 4. The plants and animals have shorter, less healthy lives. 5. The plants and animals do not reproduce very well. 6. The number of plants and animals decreases over time. 7. The quality of water gets worse and worse as there are no plants or animals to clean it. 8. Eventually, there is nothing living in the water, and it becomes unusable. This process illustrates the dire consequences of water pollution on the environment and the ecosystem. It starts with human activities and industrial processes introducing harmful substances, such as chemicals, heavy metals, and waste, into the water. These pollutants have negative impacts on the water quality, making it less suitable for the survival and well-being of aquatic plants and animals. As a result of the pollution, plants and animals suffer from various health issues, leading to shorter and less healthy lives. This, in turn, means they will not reproduce as efficiently, causing a decline in their numbers over time. With fewer living organisms present, the water quality worsens further, as plants and animals play a crucial role in maintaining ecological balance and filtering water naturally. In the final stage of this process, the water becomes so polluted and lacking in diversity and life, that it reaches a point where it is no longer usable or suitable for any living organisms. Ecosystems that once thrived in the area now cease to exist, which may have a ripple effect on other systems and species connected to these water sources. Ultimately, this process underscores the importance of paying attention to, and addressing, the factors contributing to water pollution, in order to preserve the ecological balance and protect the health and well-being of plants, animals, and humans who rely on water resources for survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: What word became a derogatory term by 1915? Answer the above question based on the context below: By the time Etty exhibited Musidora, the theme was becoming something of a cliche, such that by 1850 it was described by The Literary Gazette as \\"a favourite subject for a dip of the brush\\". As interest in studies of Musidora waned, its role as a pretext for nude paintings by English artists was replaced by Lady Godiva, who had become a topic of increased interest owing to Alfred, Lord Tennyson's poem Godiva. After the death of William Wordsworth in 1850, James Thomson ceased to be a major influence on writers. From the 1870s his popularity with readers waned, and by the end of the 20th century his works other than Rule, Britannia! were little known.When Etty died in 1849, despite having worked and exhibited until his death, he was still regarded by many as a pornographer. Charles Robert Leslie observed shortly after Etty's death that \\"[Etty] himself, thinking and meaning no evil, was not aware of the manner in which his works were regarded by grosser minds\\". Interest in him declined as new movements came to characterise painting in Britain, and by the end of the 19th century the value of his paintings had fallen. It is likely that the composition and style of John Everett Millais's controversial The Knight Errant was influenced by Musidora, but other than Millais, and Etty's admirer and imitator William Edward Frost, few other artists were directly influenced by Etty's work. In 1882 Vanity Fair commented on Musidora that \\"I know only too well how the rough and his female companion behave in front of pictures such as Etty's bather. I have seen the gangs of workmen strolling round, and I know that their artistic interest in studies of the nude is emphatically embarrassing.\\" By the early 20th century Victorian styles of art and literature fell dramatically out of fashion in Britain, and by 1915 the word \\"Victorian\\" had become a derogatory term. Frederick Mentone's The Human Form in Art (1944) was one of the few 20th-century academic works to favourably view Musidora. A:","completion":"Based on the provided context, the word that became a derogatory term by 1915 is \\"Victorian.\\" This can be inferred from the statement, \\"by 1915 the word 'Victorian' had become a derogatory term.\\" This shift in perception was likely due to changing tastes in art and literature, as well as societal attitudes towards what was considered appropriate or outdated."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The situation in Parana has quickly become a cause for concern among the international community, as thousands of people remain displaced due to the severe floods. Local officials and public workers in Curitiba have been working tirelessly to manage the crisis, ensuring that those affected receive necessary support while keeping the city's activities running smoothly for visiting fans and teams, such as Iran and Nigeria. While the Arena da Baixada has not yet been directly affected by the flooding, the situation remains precarious as the stadium prepares to host important matches. The city of Curitiba and the Brazilian government have prioritized the safety and well-being of both the residents and the visiting teams, demonstrating their commitment to hosting a successful event. Aside from causing havoc in cities across the state of Parana, the heavy rains have also led to a unique phenomenon - the Iguazu Falls, a popular tourist attraction near the border of Brazil and Argentina, is experiencing an unprecedented increase in water flow. The remarkable sight has drawn tourists and journalists alike, including Lucy Crossley, who has been diligently following the developments in the region. As the World Cup matches continue to unfold in the host state of Parana, teams from countries such as Spain are also closely monitoring the situation. Although their matches are not scheduled to be held in the flood-affected areas, the Spanish team has expressed their solidarity with those impacted by the floods, acknowledging the collective effort needed to overcome such challenges. In conclusion, the fierce floods in the southern Brazilian state of Parana have caused widespread devastation and despair, with individuals like Lucy Crossley continuing to document the situation. While the authorities are doing their best to alleviate the ongoing crisis and ensure that the World Cup games in the area remain unaffected, it is crucial for the international community to stand together in support of the people of Parana, the city of Curitiba, and the beleaguered Brazilian government as they tackle this daunting challenge head-on."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: WHITE HOUSE — A day after U.S. President Donald Trump reversed a policy of separating migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border, the House of Representatives is set to vote Thursday on a pair of immigration bills that address the separations as well as other issues that have divided the country’s major political parties. The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

While it is true that vitamins have diverse functions, this information does not provide the specific answer the question is looking for. To provide a clearer response, the answer should include information about the two main classes of vitamins: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K, which can be stored in the body's fat tissues and are absorbed along with dietary fat. Water-soluble vitamins, on the other hand, include vitamin C and the B complex vitamins (B1, B2, B3, B5, B6, B7, B9, and B12), which are not stored in the body and must be replenished regularly through the diet. Therefore, the correct answer should be: \\"There are two main classes of vitamins: fat-soluble vitamins and water-soluble vitamins. Fat-soluble vitamins include vitamins A, D, E, and K, while water-soluble vitamins include vitamin C and the B complex vitamins.\\" This response directly answers the question and provides the necessary information for the user to understand the different classes of vitamins."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: What did Demetrius do before invading Thessaly? Context: After Cassander's death in 298 BCE, however, Demetrius, who still maintained a sizable loyal army and fleet, invaded Macedon, seized the Macedonian throne (294) and conquered Thessaly and most of central Greece (293-291). He was defeated in 288 BC when Lysimachus of Thrace and Pyrrhus of Epirus invaded Macedon on two fronts, and quickly carved up the kingdom for themselves. Demetrius fled to central Greece with his mercenaries and began to build support there and in the northern Peloponnese. He once again laid siege to Athens after they turned on him, but then struck a treaty with the Athenians and Ptolemy, which allowed him to cross over to Asia minor and wage war on Lysimachus' holdings in Ionia, leaving his son Antigonus Gonatas in Greece. After initial successes, he was forced to surrender to Seleucus in 285 and later died in captivity. Lysimachus, who had seized Macedon and Thessaly for himself, was forced into war when Seleucus invaded his territories in Asia minor and was defeated and killed in 281 BCE at the Battle of Corupedium, near Sardis. Seleucus then attempted to conquer Lysimachus' European territories in Thrace and Macedon, but he was assassinated by Ptolemy Ceraunus (\\"the thunderbolt\\"), who had taken refuge at the Seleucid court and then had himself acclaimed as king of Macedon. Ptolemy was killed when Macedon was invaded by Gauls in 279, his head stuck on a spear and the country fell into anarchy. Antigonus II Gonatas invaded Thrace in the summer of 277 and defeated a large force of 18,000 Gauls. He was quickly hailed as king of Macedon and went on to rule for 35 years.","completion":"Before invading Thessaly, Demetrius invaded Macedon and seized the Macedonian throne."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Questions: The key to living life and not just existing is what? Options: - acquiring knowledge - happiness - purpose - existing - joy A:","completion":"The key to living life and not just existing is purpose. It's beyond the limitations of acquiring knowledge, happiness, joy, or simply existing. It's about making full use of the knowledge and emotional capabilities we possess, and applying them in the most meaningful way, which is through our purpose. Firstly, let's explore what it means to exist versus what it means to truly live life. Existing can be seen as just going through the motions of life without much thought or consideration. You're merely reacting to life and allowing it to happen to you, rather than making active choices. It's like floating aimlessly in a vast ocean without a specific destination. On the other hand, living life implies being actively engaged in your existence. It entails passion, livelihood, fulfilment, and growth. Living life is not merely about existing but operating in a dynamic, meaningful, conscious, and intentional manner. While acquiring knowledge is a fundamental part of human life and growth, it isn't enough to facilitate an experience of living. Knowledge-led living can still churn out a monotonous life if there's no motivation or objective for its application. It's not the acquisition of knowledge that defines life; it's what you do with that knowledge. Similarly, happiness and joy are essential components of a rich, fulfilling life, but they aren't decisive factors either. Just as sadness and pain are part of life, so too are joy and happiness. But to live a life defined solely by the pursuit of happiness ignores the range of human experiences and emotions that contribute to a full, well-rounded life. Furthermore, simply choosing \\"existing\\" as the key to living life wouldn't differ from the state of simply being, which is contrary to the question's purpose. On the contrary, a purpose-driven life goes beyond just existing or experiencing feelings or gaining knowledge. Purpose provides a direction, a cause to fight for, a reason to get out of the bed each morning with determination and enthusiasm. It offers a broader perspective where happiness, joy, and knowledge have their roles to play, but they aren't the final destination. Purpose invokes a sense of belonging and helps bridge the gap between your inner self and the external world. It helps to make sense of our lives, provides a context for our experiences, and gives us a clear sense of direction. When we live a purposeful life, we become proactive. We strive to make changes in our lives and the world around us rather than simply reacting to life as it happens. This is why purpose is seen as the key to truly living life as opposed to simply existing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Ninety-five percent of bird species are socially monogamous. These species pair for at least the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is especially important for species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids. Female birds have sperm storage mechanisms that allow sperm from males to remain viable long after copulation, a hundred days in some species. Sperm from multiple males may compete through this mechanism. For females, possible benefits of extra-pair copulation include getting better genes for her offspring and insuring against the possibility of infertility in her mate. Males of species that engage in extra-pair copulations will closely guard their mates to ensure the parentage of the offspring that they raise.\\"?

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Manziel was born in Tyler, Texas, on December 6, 1992, to Michelle (nee Liberato) and Paul Manziel. He has a younger sister named Meri. Manziel's great-great-grandfather Joseph immigrated to the United States in 1883 from the Mount Lebanon region of Syria in what is now Lebanon. He is of Italian descent on his maternal side. Texas A&M faced uncertainty at the quarterback position when Ryan Tannehill left for the National Football League after the 2011 season. Manziel performed well during spring ball and fall practices and won the starting job over Jameill Showers and Matt Joeckel before the season began. His first game was supposed to be against Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, Louisiana on Thursday, August 30, 2012, but the game was postponed until October 13 due to Hurricane Isaac hitting the Louisiana coast two days prior to game time. Consequently, Manziel's college football debut was played as a redshirt freshman against the Florida Gators before a home crowd at Kyle Field. Although Manziel began the season in relative obscurity, his play against Arkansas in which he broke Archie Manning's 43-year-old total offense record gained him some attention. Manziel produced 557 yards of total offense, breaking Manning's record of 540. Two games later, Manziel surpassed his own total offense record against #24 Louisiana Tech by achieving 576 yards of total offense, becoming the first player in SEC history to have two 500+ total offense games in one season. After Texas A&M's blowout of Auburn in the eighth game of the season, in which Manziel accounted for 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns through only the first half plus one series in the second, Manziel began showing up in national Heisman Watch lists. Manziel was launched into the national scene after he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over #1 Alabama in Tuscaloosa. In that game, Manziel accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. In the following days, Manziel became the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy in most national watch lists and polls due to his performance during the game combined with other Heisman frontrunners faltering. On November 24, during the game against the Missouri Tigers before a home crowd, Manziel left the game with an apparent knee injury late in the first quarter. He returned to the field for the next series of downs wearing a knee brace and finished the game with 439 yards of total offense, including 3 passing and 2 rushing touchdowns. During the game, he broke the single season record for offensive production in the SEC with 4,600 yards, surpassing Cam Newton and Tim Tebow, notable recent Heisman Trophy winners. He also became the first freshman and only the fifth player in NCAA history to pass for 3000 and rush for 1,000 yards in a season, reaching that mark two games earlier than any other player. He won the SEC Freshman of the Year Award and College Football Performance National Freshman of the Year Award. Manziel won the Davey O'Brien Award on December 6 and the Heisman Trophy on December 8, making him the first freshman ever to win either award. Answer this question using a quote from the following article: which team did he play against the best?","completion":"It is difficult to pinpoint the single best team Johnny Manziel played against, as he had several outstanding performances throughout his college football career. However, one could argue that Manziel's performance against #1 Alabama in 2012 stands out as a significant achievement. In that game, he led Texas A&M to a 29-24 victory over Alabama in Tuscaloosa and accounted for 345 of A&M's 418 yards of offense, including two passing touchdowns. This performance launched Manziel into the national spotlight and made him the frontrunner for the Heisman Trophy, which he eventually won. As Alabama was ranked #1 at the time and had a strong football program, it can be considered one of the best teams Manziel played against."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Concurrently, David is escorted from his apartment by an Israeli government agent for a debriefing. David recognises Stefan waiting in another vehicle and unable to face their lie, he commits suicide by stepping in front of an oncoming truck. In 1965, a young Mossad agent Rachel Singer on her first field assignment arrives in East Berlin to meet with more experienced agents David Peretz and Stefan Gold.

Prior to the November 2012 election, 238 of 242 House Republicans and 41 out of 47 Senate Republicans had signed ATR's \\"Taxpayer Protection Pledge\\", in which the pledger promises to \\"oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rate for individuals and business; and to oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\\" The November 6, 2012 elections resulted in a decline in the number of Taxpayer Protection Pledge signatories in both the upper and lower houses of the 113th Congress: from 41 to 39 in the Senate, and from 238 to \\"fewer than ... 218\\" in the House of Representatives. According to journalist Alex Seitz-Wald, losses in the election by Norquist supporters and the \\"fiscal cliff\\" have emboldened and made more vocal critics of Norquist. In November 2011, Senate Majority leader Harry Reid (D-NV) blamed Norquist's influence for the Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction's lack of progress, claiming that Congressional Republicans \\"are being led like puppets by Grover Norquist. They're giving speeches that we should compromise on our deficit, but never do they compromise on Grover Norquist. He is their leader.\\" Since Norquist's pledge binds signatories to opposing deficit reduction agreements that include any element of increased tax revenue, some Republican deficit hawks now retired from office have stated that Norquist has become an obstacle to deficit reduction.

It also marks the subsequent departure of lead guitarist Justin Shekoski. Can we draw the following conclusion?

This album marked the end of a three-and-a-half-year hiatus for the group, with the return of original lead vocalist Anthony Green. Furthermore, this album also witnessed the departure of lead guitarist Justin Shekoski. To draw the conclusion that Anthony Green left the group during 2012, we need to consider the three-and-a-half-year hiatus mentioned. It can be inferred that the hiatus started in 2012, as 2016 (the year of the album's release) minus 3.5 years approximately equals 2012. However, we cannot directly conclude that Anthony Green left the group in 2012 solely based on this information. To provide more context, Anthony Green initially departed from Saosin in 2004 and later rejoined the band in 2014. The hiatus mentioned in the original information likely refers to Saosin's period of inactivity between albums, not necessarily Anthony Green's absence from the band. While Anthony returned to the band in 2014, it would be incorrect to conclude that he left the group in 2012 based on the provided details. In conclusion, although the three-and-a-half-year hiatus corresponds to the timeline between 2012 and the release of Along the Shadow in 2016, we cannot directly conclude that Anthony Green left the group in 2012, as he had actually left the band in 2004 and later rejoined in 2014."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article using the following points: Michael Evans on organization to forge friendships in Northern Ireland. He put Protestant and Catholic high school students on one team. Even after graduating from school, the former teammates are still friends. The friends communicate via Internet because it's too dangerous to visit. Article:","completion":"Title: Michael Evans' Initiative Transforms High School Rivalries into Lifelong Friendships in Northern Ireland Introduction: In a region where sectarianism has often been the cause of tension and violence, Michael Evans, a visionary educator, has created a groundbreaking organization that aims to forge friendships between Protestant and Catholic high school students in Northern Ireland. His innovative approach of uniting students on one team, regardless of their religious backgrounds, has sparked meaningful connections that persist beyond high school. These bonds of friendship endure despite the challenges the friends face in their everyday lives, as they bridge the sectarian divide through online communication when physical meetings are too dangerous. Step 1: Establishing the organization and its goals Michael Evans, a passionate advocate for social change in Northern Ireland, founded the organization with a vision of creating opportunities for young people from different backgrounds to forge lasting friendships. He recognized that in order to overcome the deep-rooted divisions that have haunted the region for generations, transformative action needed to take place at the grassroots level. By bringing together students from different religious backgrounds and providing them with a shared platform to form meaningful relationships, Evans hoped to foster a sense of unity and understanding that would radiate beyond the immediate circle of participants. Step 2: Uniting students through a shared experience In a bold move, Evans put Catholic and Protestant high school students on one team, enabling them to work closely and develop a bond through their common interests and shared goals. This approach was a stark departure from the usual separation of these groups, which often led to animosity and mistrust. By promoting collaboration and cooperation between members of each religious group, Evans' organization facilitated the gradual breakdown of barriers that had previously kept young people from forming meaningful friendships across religious lines. Step 3: Fostering communication beyond high school As the former teammates graduated from high school, many of them went on to pursue different paths in life. Despite the geographical distance and the challenges they faced in their respective communities, the bonds they had formed during their time on the team remained strong. Thanks to the Internet, these friends have been able to maintain regular communication, providing them with a continued sense of support and camaraderie. Even when it is too dangerous to visit one another due to the ongoing tensions in Northern Ireland, they can rely on virtual channels to keep their friendships alive. Conclusion: Michael Evans' innovative approach to fostering friendships between Protestant and Catholic high school students in Northern Ireland is a testament to the transformative power of unity and collaboration. By breaking down the barriers that have historically separated these groups, his organization has demonstrated that true bonds of friendship can transcend divisive lines and persist in the face of adversity. As the former teammates continue to forge a path of understanding and mutual respect, they serve as trailblazers, embodying a hopeful future for a more inclusive and peaceful Northern Ireland."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Professor Anthony Hilton from Ashton University, UK, tested the rule with his students.They found that food dropped for five seconds is less likely to contain bacteria than if it sits there for longer. For the study, Hilton and his students tested a lot of foods----bread, pasta, cookies and candy--to see how much bacteria they had when they made contact with the floor.They allowed the food to lie on the different types of flooring--carpet , laminate and tile -- for three seconds to 30 seconds. Not surprisingly, the longer the food was on the floor, the more bacteria it had.And the type of floor where the dropped food landed had an effect.Bacteria are least likely to transfer from carpet, while they are most likely to transfer laminate or tiled surface after more than five seconds. The study also found that the wetter the food, the more likely it was to pick up bacteria.Although most people are happy to follow the 5-second rule, eating food dropped on the floor still carries an infection risk.\\"It very much depends on which bacteria are on the floor at the time.\\" Hilton told Forbes.

In the movie, Leleti Khumalo plays the character of Fedens, a Tutsi woman who becomes a refugee at the Hôtel des Mille Collines, which was managed by Rusesabagina. Set in Kigali, Rwanda's capital city, \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" effectively portrays the ethnic tensions, human rights abuses, and the violence that erupted between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, eventually leading to the brutal genocide that claimed the lives of an estimated 800,000 to 1 million Rwandans within just a few months. Terry George, an Irish filmmaker known for his socially and politically charged films, constructed \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" as an intense and somber drama that sensitively and accurately brings to light the harrowing events of the 1994 Rwandan Genocide, highlighting the bravery and resourcefulness of Paul Rusesabagina. The cast features notable actors such as Don Cheadle (as Paul Rusesabagina), Sophie Okonedo (as Tatiana Rusesabagina), and Nick Nolte (as Colonel Oliver, a character inspired by UN peacekeeper leader Roméo Dallaire). Upon its release, \\"Hotel Rwanda\\" received widespread critical acclaim for its compelling storytelling, powerful performances, and unflinching examination of the tragedy that unfolded in Rwanda. As a result, the film earned several recognitions, including Academy Award nominations for Best Actor (Don Cheadle) and Best Supporting Actress (Sophie Okonedo), as well as three Golden Globe nominations. In conclusion, Leleti Khumalo is known for her role in the 2004 British-Italian-South African historical drama film \\"Hotel Rwanda,\\" which was directed by Terry George and focused on the true events that took place during the Rwandan Genocide. Khumalo's portrayal of Fedens not only contributed to the film's emotional impact, but also served as an opportunity to showcase her acting talents on an international stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Based on the premise \\"yeah right so i'll probably have to sell the prize i get\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I'll probably have to sell the prize I get in the monthly draw\\" is true?","completion":"To evaluate whether or not the hypothesis \\"I'll probably have to sell the prize I get in the monthly draw\\" is true based on the premise \\"yeah right so i'll probably have to sell the prize I get,\\" we first need to understand the context, information given, and the assumptions made in the statement. 1. Context: Understanding the context is crucial in determining the veracity of the hypothesis. In this case, the context refers to the circumstances or reasons surrounding the idea of having to sell the prize. These might include financial struggles, the prize's irrelevance to the person, or personal preferences driving the decision. However, the premise does not provide enough context to determine the reasons behind selling the prize. 2. Information given: The premise \\"yeah right so I'll probably have to sell the prize I get\\" implies that the individual thinks they are likely to sell the prize they receive. However, we do not have any specific information about the prizes offered in the draw, the probability of winning, or why they anticipate having to sell the prize. Therefore, the given information is insufficient to determine the hypothesis's truth conclusively. 3. Assumptions made: When analyzing the premise, we can identify an assumption that the individual has a need or motivation to sell the prize. However, this assumption is not verified, as we do not know the specifics surrounding this need or motivation. Moreover, there might be other unstated assumptions at play (e.g., their belief about the prizes' suitability or their likelihood of winning). Considering the lack of context, limited information given, and unverified assumptions, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I'll probably have to sell the prize I get in the monthly draw\\" is true based solely on the premise provided. The premise itself suggests a probability of having to sell the prize, but it does not offer definitive evidence to support the hypothesis.

Children who are not taught these lessons pay the consequences for a life time. Some parents don't teach children about money because they think they shouldn't talk about money with children, don't have the time, or think they don't have enough money. Parents should take the time to teach children about money regardless of their income and should start when children are young. Most people have strong feelings and opinions about money, based on childhood experiences and the values and beliefs of their families. Most often, these experiences, values, and beliefs are different for each parent. It is important for the healthy development of children that parents talk about these feelings and opinions and establish a consistent approach to teaching children about money. Here are some guidelines parents can keep in mind as they begin the financial socialization of their children: Advise rather than order how the child's money should be used. Allow children to learn by mistakes and by successes. Be consistent while taking children's differences into account. Include all family members in money management discussions, decision making, and activities suitable for their age. Explan to children what they can and cannot do and the consequences of going above the limits. As children get older increasingly include them in discussions of limits and consequences. Expect all family members to perform unpaid, routine household work based on their abilities. Express your desire to have things you can't afford.

Answer the question...where does the flat iron cut of meat come from??","completion":"The flat iron cut of meat is a relatively recent discovery in the culinary world. It comes from the chuck section of a cow. To be more specific, it is carved from the shoulder area, which is often referred to as the shoulder top blade in butchery terminology. This piece of meat is nestled just above the shoulder blade, making it a part of the primal cut known as the beef chuck. The beef chuck is a subprimal cut that includes the first through the fifth ribs and the shoulder blade. Now, despite originating from the hardworking shoulder area, the flat iron steak is known to be impressively tender. The reason for this is due to its location in the cow. Despite being in the shoulder, it resides in a spot that does not bear much weight nor does it get heavily exercised. It is this position on the cow that helps to preserve the flat iron steak's tenderness. However, it is worth mentioning that this tender piece of meat remained largely ignored for a long time because it is traversed by an extremely tough piece of connective tissue. This connective tissue is so tough it rendered this cut nearly inedible. Its culinary potential was only realized when researchers at the University of Nebraska and the University of Florida developed a new method of butchery to remove this piece of connective tissue in the 2000s. The researchers discovered that if the shoulder cut was split along the connective tissue, they could remove it and create two pieces of steak. The distinct shape of the flat iron steak is what gave it its name. Once the connective tissue is removed, the remaining piece of meat is a uniform, rectangular shape that closely resembles an antique flat iron. Since then, its popularity has increased rapidly. Butchers and chefs widely appreciate its flavorsome and tender characteristics, and the affordability compared to other premium cuts makes the flat iron cut a favorite among consumers as well. In conclusion, the flat iron cut of meat comes from the shoulder or chuck area of a cow. It has gained popularity in recent years due to its tenderness and rich flavor, which come as a result of its specific location within the cow and the specialized method of butchery developed to remove the challenging connective tissue running through it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The NFL Draft consists of multiple rounds, each with a certain number of picks allotted to the various teams in the league. The draft order is determined by the previous year's performance, with a few caveats, such as compensatory picks and trades of picks between teams. In each round, teams select a player to add to their roster, with the draft ultimately serving as a crucial element for player recruitment, team growth, and success in the league. As the first round is considered highly valuable due to the presence of the most sought-after players, being chosen in this round is an indication of a player's skill set and their potential to make a significant impact on their team.

Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is then seen running away from home. He and his friends ride down the Mississippi River on a raft, but hit a sharp rock, which throws Tom into the water. His friends find him washed up on the shore, and Tom finds it was Huck Finn (Brad Renfro) who carried him to safety. Huck learns of an unusual way to remove warts - by taking a dead cat to the graveyard at night. There they witness Injun Joe and Muff Potter (Mike McShane), the town drunk, digging up the grave of Vic \\"One-Eyed\\" Murrell for Doctor Robinson. A treasure map is discovered and when Doc tries to betray the two men, Injun Joe murders him with Muff's knife. The next morning, Muff is charged for the murder. Unfortunately, Tom and Huck had signed an oath saying that if either of them came forward about it, they would drop dead and rot. The boys embark on a search for Injun Joe's treasure map, so they can declare Muff innocent and still keep their oath. The only problem is, the map is in Injun Joe's pocket. After Injun Joe finds the last treasure, he burns the map and discovers that Tom was a witness to the crime. He finds Tom and threatens he will kill him if he ever tells anyone about the murder. However, at the time, the entire community believed that he was dead, and the friendship between Tom and Huck starts to decline because of the fact that their evidence (the map) to prove Muff innocent, while preserving their oath, is destroyed. At Muff Potter's trial, Tom decides that his friendship with Muff is more important than his oath with Huck and tells the truth. The court finds Muff innocent of all charges and goes after Injun Joe. As a result, Injun Joe decides to hold up his end of the bargain by killing Tom. When Injun Joe returns to the tavern, he kills his accomplice Emmett (Lanny Flaherty) for cheating him.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - Electronic music is music that employs electronic musical instruments and electronic music technology in its production, an electronic musician being a musician who composes and/or performs such music. In general, a distinction can be made between sound produced using electromechanical means and that produced using electronic technology. Examples of electromechanical sound producing devices include the telharmonium, Hammond organ, and the electric guitar. Purely electronic sound production can be achieved using devices such as the theremin, sound synthesizer, and computer. - A disc jockey (abbreviated DJ, D.J. or deejay) is a person who mixes recorded music as it is playing. Originally, the \\"disc\\" in \\"disc jockey\\" referred to gramophone records, but now \\"DJ\\" is used as an all-encompassing term to describe someone who mixes recorded music from any sources, including cassettes, CDs, or digital audio files on a CDJ or laptop. DJs typically perform for a live or broadcast audience, but DJs also create mixes that are recorded for later sale and distribution. - Klinik, (sometimes called The Klinik), is an industrial music band from Belgium, originally formed around 1982 by electro-synthpop practitioner Marc Verhaeghen, who is the only constant member. - Dive is a Belgian electronic dance music project formed in 1990 by Dirk Ivens ( Absolute Body Control , Klinik , Blok 57 , Sonar ) . Dive 's \`\` audio trademark '' is the experimental sound of abused drum machines , pulsating through crackling distortion on almost every song . - Live PA (meaning Live Public Address, or Live Personal Appearance) is the act of performing live electronic music in settings typically associated with DJing, such as nightclubs, raves, and more recently dance music festivals. - Industrial music is a genre of experimental/electronic music that draws on transgressive or provocative sounds and themes. The term was coined in the mid-1970s with the founding of Industrial Records by Genesis P-Orridge of Throbbing Gristle and Monte Cazazza; on Throbbing Gristle's debut album \\"The Second Annual Report\\", they coined the slogan \\"industrial music for industrial people\\". In general, the style is harsh and challenging. AllMusic defines industrial as the \\"most abrasive and aggressive fusion of rock and electronic music\\"; \\"initially a blend of avant-garde electronics experiments (tape music, musique concrète, white noise, synthesizers, sequencers, etc.) and punk provocation\\". - A nightclub (also known as a discothèque, disco, dance club or club) is an entertainment venue and bar which serves alcoholic beverages that usually operates late into the night. A nightclub is generally distinguished from regular bars, pubs or taverns by the inclusion of a stage for live music, one or more dance floor areas and a DJ booth, where a DJ plays recorded music and where coloured lights illuminate the dance area. Another distinction is that whereas many pubs and sports bars aim at a mass market, nightclubs typically aim at a niche market of music and dancing enthusiasts and clubgoers. The upmarket nature of nightclubs can be seen in the inclusion of VIP areas in some nightclubs, for celebrities and their guests. Nightclubs are much more likely than pubs or sports bars to use bouncers to screen prospective clubgoers for entry. Some nightclub bouncers do not admit people with ripped jeans or other informal clothing as part of a dress code. The busiest nights for a nightclub are Friday and Saturday night. Most clubs or club nights cater to certain music genres. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - Electronic dance music (also known as EDM, dance music, club music, or simply dance) is a broad range of percussive electronic music genres made largely for nightclubs, raves, and festivals. EDM is generally produced for playback by disc jockeys (DJs) who create seamless selections of tracks, called a mix, by segueing from one recording to another. EDM producers also perform their music live in a concert or festival setting in what is sometimes called a live PA. In the United Kingdom and in continental Europe, EDM is more commonly called 'dance music' or simply 'dance'. - Dirk Ivens is a Belgian musician and performer in the industrial music genre. - Belgium , officially the Kingdom of Belgium, is a sovereign state in Western Europe bordered by France, the Netherlands, Germany, Luxembourg, and the North Sea. It is a small, densely populated country which covers an area of and has a population of about 11 million people. Straddling the cultural boundary between Germanic and Latin Europe, Belgium is home to two main linguistic groups: the Dutch-speaking, mostly Flemish community, which constitutes about 59% of the population, and the French-speaking, mostly Walloon population, which comprises 41% of all Belgians. Additionally, there is a small group of German-speakers who live in the East Cantons located around the High Fens area, and bordering Germany. - Dance music is music composed specifically to facilitate or accompany dancing. It can be either a whole musical piece or part of a larger musical arrangement. In terms of performance, the major categories are live dance music and recorded dance music. While there exist attestations of the combination of dance and music in ancient times (for example Ancient Greek vases sometimes show dancers accompanied by musicians), the earliest Western dance music that we can still reproduce with a degree of certainty are the surviving medieval dances. In the Baroque period, the major dance styles were noble court dances (see Baroque dance). In the classical music era, the minuet was frequently used as a third movement, although in this context it would not accompany any dancing. The waltz also arose later in the classical era. Both remained part of the romantic music period, which also saw the rise of various other nationalistic dance forms like the barcarolle, mazurka, ecossaise, ballade and polonaise. - A rave (from the verb: \\"to rave\\") is a large dance party featuring performances by DJs and occasionally live performers playing electronic music, particularly electronic dance music (EDM). The music is amplified with a large, powerful sound reinforcement system, typically with large subwoofers to produce a deep bass sound. The music is accompanied by laser light shows, projected images, visual effects and fog machines. The word \\"rave\\" was first used in the late 1980s to describe the subculture that grew out of the acid house movement.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What artist's painting got funding for its restoration after it was feared it would soon be beyond repair?, using the article: Etty had used experimental techniques to make The Sirens and Ulysses, using a strong glue as a paint stabiliser which caused the paint to dry hard and brittle, and to flake off once dry, a problem made worse by the painting's large size causing it to flex whenever it was moved. From the moment it was complete it began to deteriorate. After it was exhibited at the 1857 Art Treasures Exhibition it was considered in too poor a condition for public display, and it was placed in long-term storage in the archives of the Royal Manchester Institution and its successor, the Manchester Art Gallery. In the mid 20th century there were a number of unsuccessful attempts to repair The Sirens and Ulysses, but an attempt to clean the painting unintentionally damaged the paint further.In 2003, Manchester Art Gallery staff determined that if conservation work were not undertaken, the painting would soon be beyond repair. The Esmée Fairbairn Foundation and AXA Art Insurance provided funding for the restoration. A replacement canvas to which the painting had been attached in the 1930s was removed. Following this, a mixture of isinglass adhesive and chalk was used to restore the surface of the painting, and the paint added during the earlier attempted restoration was removed. A new double layer of canvas was added to the back of the painting, and the three layers were glued together.In 2006 the repaired painting was moved back from the conservation studios to the Manchester Art Gallery. The Gallery Nine section of the MAG was converted into a temporary studio, open to the public to watch the final retouching work until it was completed in 2010, and The Sirens and Ulysses currently hangs in Gallery Three., what would be the answer ?

The report, World's Top Rivers at Risk, released ahead of World Water Day (22 March), lists the top ten rivers that are fast dying as a result of climate change, pollution and dams. \\"All the rivers in the report symbolize the current freshwater crisis, which we have been signalling for years,\\" says WWF Global Freshwater Programme Director Jamie Pittock. \\"Poor planning and inadequate protection of natural areas mean we can no longer assume that water will flow forever. Like the climate change crisis, which now has the attention of business and government, we want leaders to take notice of the emergency facing freshwater now not later.\\" Five of the ten rivers listed in the report are in Asia alone.

But after three long years, NASA's successor is almost ready to make an entrance. Orion, the agency's newest manned spaceship, is being prepared for its first mission in December. In future missions, it will journey into deep space -- to Mars and beyond -- farther than humans have ever gone before. Orion comes loaded with superlatives. It boasts the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles. It will be launched into space on the most powerful rocket NASA has ever made. No astronauts will be aboard the December flight, which will test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions. Final work on the spacecraft is under way at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Orion came one step closer to completion this month with the stacking of the crew module atop the service module. \\"Now that we're getting so close to launch, the spacecraft completion work is visible every day,\\" Orion Program Manager Mark Geyer said in a statement. A 3,600-mile journey When complete, the Orion capsule will resemble a fencing foil, with a tall spire shooting up from a rounded base. At the top will sit a launch abort system, with downward-facing thrusters that would save the crew from a jarring crash in the event of a rocket malfunction. The bottom portion, the service module, will perform various functions such as in-space propulsion and cargo storage. Nestled between the two will be the crew module, capable of supporting human life from launch until recovery. Attached to the service module will be a United Launch Alliance Delta IV Heavy rocket. For the first time since the space shuttle's debut launch in 1981, the crew compartment will ride on the tip of the rocket rather than hanging onto its side, evoking the configuration of the famous Apollo or Gemini missions. Question: \\"What will the Orion allow NASA to do and why?\\" Answer: \\"Test the spacecraft's systems for future manned missions because it is the largest heat shield ever built and a computer 400 times faster than the ones on the space shuttles\\" Based on the paragraph, choose if the answer is correct: Options are: 1). no. 2). yes.","completion":"2). yes."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Back in the mid 1990s when I worked in Southern California, I was returning from lunch one day with a coworker when we noticed two pickup trucks driving erratically. This was on Valley View Blvd in Cerritos which is a large roadway divided (by a large, planted median strip) with 3 lanes on either side. One truck seemed to be chasing the other when suddenly the lead truck made a quick U-turn and was followed by the second truck. But the second truck came to stop just after making the turn. This was when the driver of that truck got out, walked to the front of his vehicle, raised his arm holding a semi-automatic handgun, paused, and then fired a single shot. At this point, I was parallel with the shooter’s truck and only about 50–60 feet from where he was standing. I remember my coworker exclaiming, “Oh sh*t! Did he just shoot at the something?!” I floored my accelerator and sped off to my workplace which was about a 1/2 mile down Valley View Blvd. I parked and my coworker and I got into the building as quickly as we could. While he started telling our other coworkers about what we had just witnessed, I ran to my desk, called 911, and reported the shooting. The dispatcher kept me on the line after my initial report and then transferred me to a detective in order to take down my information. As it turns out, my information and the fact that I called 911 immediately resulted in the arrest of the shooter. I was later asked to testify in court which resulted in the shooters conviction. I lived in Southern California for 10 years and now I drive a commercial truck several days a week so I have PLENTY of other “road rage stories”, but this is still the craziest one.

Passage: In week six, the Bears traveled to M&T Bank Stadium to play the 3-2 Baltimore Ravens, whom the Bears led 3-2 in five all-time meetings. The series had been a see-saw in victors, with the winning team alternating each time; the Bears won the most recent game in 2013 23-20, but the Ravens won the latest game in Baltimore (a 31-7 rout in 2009). For the Bears offense, the unit hoped to provide more support for Mitchell Trubisky in his first NFL away game. \\"The kid's going to be special and we've got to do our jobs around him; keep getting in the right spot, make plays and catch the football, and making sure we're keeping him out of first-and-17s,\\" offensive coordinator Dowell Loggains stated. \\"We have a lot of faith and confidence in Mitchell.\\" To do this, USA Today's Lorin Cox wrote the offensive line needed to stop Ravens nose tackle Michael Pierce, whose 13 stops in 2017 tied for fifth among defensive linemen. On defense, the Bears entered the game with the sixth-ranked defense (allowing 305 yards per game) that also ranked ninth in average yards allowed per play (5.07). With Danny Trevathan returning from suspension, the defense faced a Ravens offense that ranked sixth in rushing with 130.4 yards per game. On the other hand, Baltimore's offensive line - particularly the guards - had been struggling due to injuries, and Cox wrote the defense should take advantage of the openings. While the Bears had yet to record an interception in 2017, Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco had thrown 33 in his last 31 games, including one in ten consecutive games; Cox added, \\"It's up to this defense to actually finish the turnover.\\" The first five drives of the game ended with punts. The Bears opted for a run-based attack for much of the game; on their first scoring drive in the second quarter, all but one play was a run, with the series ending on Connor Barth's 24-yard field goal. On the Ravens' next drive, Maxx Williams was stripped by Christian Jones and Trevathan recovered the loose ball. Although the Bears were unable to capitalize on the takeaway, the defense recorded another turnover on the next drive when Bryce Callahan intercepted Flacco's pass intended for Breshad Perriman. On a halfback option, Tarik Cohen eventually threw a 21-yard touchdown pass to Zach Miller to put the Bears up 10-0. Justin Tucker kicked a 27-yard field goal to put the Ravens on the scoreboard with three seconds remaining in the first half. During the third quarter, Trubisky led a 66-yard drive that ended with a 27-yard touchdown pass to Dion Sims. During the ensuing kickoff, Joshua Bellamy appeared to trip Ravens kick returner Bobby Rainey, but Rainey instead got back up and ran 96 yards for a touchdown. Upon review, the referees determined Bellamy's hand did not touch Rainey. Subsequently, the Bears committed two turnovers: Cohen fumbled at the Bears' 39-yard line - which set up Tucker's 31-yard field goal to narrow the gap to four points - and Trubisky was strip-sacked by Lardarius Webb with C. J. Mosley recovering. The Ravens reached the Bears' 30-yard line, where Flacco was intercepted by Adrian Amos, who returned his first career interception 90 yards for the touchdown to put the Bears up by 11 points with 5:08 left in the game. However, Tucker kicked a 50-yard field goal with 2:53 remaining, while Michael Campanaro scored on a 77-yard punt return touchdown and Flacco completed the two-point conversion to Nick Boyle to tie the game at 24 apiece and enter overtime. Neither team was able to score on their first drive; on Chicago's second series, the offense was pinned at its own seven-yard line. Jordan Howard recorded a 53-yard run on the first play of the possession, which was later followed by Trubisky's 18-yard pass to Kendall Wright on third down to draw the Bears closer. Barth kicked a 40-yard field goal to win the game. It was the Bears' first road victory since 2015 against the Buccaneers, breaking a ten-game losing streak. The Bears' rushing attack resulted in a career high 167 rushing yards on 36 carries for Howard, while Cohen had 14 carries for 32 yards. Trubisky threw just 16 passes, completing eight for 113 yards and a touchdown. John Fox explained the Ravens were the reason for the run-based strategy, having used the same philosophy with the 2012 Denver Broncos; in that team's game against Baltimore, the Broncos ran 44 times against just 21 passing plays despite the presence of Peyton Manning.","completion":"Task: Create questions from the given passage that involve complex reasoning, including numerical reasoning.

Answer the following question: Given the fact that: The closer the charged objects are, the stronger the electrostatic force. Answer the question: When two batteries are placed further apart, John can tell that the electrostatic force is more or less? Answer:","completion":"When two batteries are placed further apart, John can tell that the electrostatic force between them is less. To understand why, we must first comprehend what electrostatic force is. Electrostatic force is a type of physical force that electric charges exert on each other. It's explained by Coulomb's Law, which states that the force between two charges is directly proportional to the product of their charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. Batteries, in particular, operate on electrical charge. The negative terminal has an abundance of electrons, which are negatively charged, and the positive terminal lacks electrons, giving it a positive charge. When two batteries are placed close to each other, the positive terminal of one battery will naturally attract the negatively charged electrons from the negative terminal of the other battery. This is the basic principle behind electrostatic force. Now, when the distance between these batteries is increased, the electrostatic force between them decreases. This is because the force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two batteries. So essentially if the distance is doubled, the force will decrease to one fourth of its original value. Therefore, considering this, if John were to place two batteries further apart, he would notice that the electrostatic force between them decreases or in other words, it becomes less. This would make it harder for electricity to flow because there would be more resistance against the electrons trying to move between the batteries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For example, the effectiveness of marketing campaigns, the availability of local cigarette brands, consumer preferences, cultural differences, and pricing.

Please answer the following question: In recent weeks, the investigation into possible collusion between President Donald Trump’s presidential campaign and Russia has intensified, raising the prospect that the probe could become an issue in advance of the November midterm congressional elections. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort made another appearance in federal court in Washington Wednesday, where he pleaded not guilty to the latest round of charges brought by special counsel Robert Mueller. Last week, Rick Gates, Manafort’s former deputy, pleaded guilty to lying to prosecutors and is now cooperating with the investigation. In mid-February, 13 Russians were indicted in connection with election meddling, which deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein described as an effort to “promote discord in the United States and undermine public confidence in democracy. We must not allow them to succeed.” Congressional inquiries also continue. Hope Hicks, the White House communications director and a longtime Trump aide, was the latest figure to testify before a congressional committee on the Russia probe. Hicks declined to answer some questions before a closed session of the House Intelligence Committee, frustrating several Democrats. “This is not executive privilege. This is executive stonewalling,” said ranking committee Democrat Rep. Adam Schiff. But there was more pushback from the White House this week. President Trump fired off a series of tweets dismissing the probe as a “WITCH HUNT.” “They have had this phony cloud over this administration, over our government,” Trump told reporters at the White House last month. “And it has hurt our government, it does hurt our government. It is a Democrat hoax.” Democrats reject that view, including Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Intelligence Committee. “I continue to believe that this is the most important thing that I will work on in my whole public career, and getting the whole truth out is extraordinarily important,” he said.

Q:Information: - A city is a large and permanent human settlement. Although there is no agreement on how a city is distinguished from a town in general English language meanings, many cities have a particular administrative, legal, or historical status based on local law. - Guatemala is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. The capital is Guatemala City, which also serves as the national capital. - South America is a continent located in the western hemisphere, mostly in the southern hemisphere, with a relatively small portion in the northern hemisphere. It is also considered a subcontinent of the Americas, which is the model used in nations that speak Romance languages. The reference to South America instead of other regions (like Latin America or the Southern Cone) has increased in the last decades due to changing geopolitical dynamics (in particular, the rise of Brazil). - El Salvador, officially the Republic of El Salvador (literally \\"Republic of The Savior\\"), is the smallest and the most densely populated country in Central America. El Salvador's capital and largest city is San Salvador. , the country had a population of approximately 6.38 million, consisting largely of Mestizos of European and Indigenous American descent. - Honduras, officially the Republic of Honduras, is a republic in Central America. It has at times been referred to as Spanish Honduras to differentiate it from British Honduras, which became modern-day Belize. Honduras is bordered to the west by Guatemala, to the southwest by El Salvador, to the southeast by Nicaragua, to the south by the Pacific Ocean at the Gulf of Fonseca, and to the north by the Gulf of Honduras, a large inlet of the Caribbean Sea. - The Darién Gap is a break in the Pan-American Highway consisting of a large swath of undeveloped swampland and forest within Panama's Darién Province in Central America and the northern portion of Colombia's Chocó Department in South America. The gap begins in Yaviza, Panama and ends in Turbo, Colombia, stretching between 100 km and 160 km (60100 miles) long. Roadbuilding through this area is expensive, and the environmental cost is high. Political consensus in favor of road construction has not emerged. Consequently there is no road connection through the Darién Gap connecting North America with South America and it is the missing link of the Pan-American Highway. - A road is a thoroughfare, route, or way on land between two places that has been paved or otherwise improved to allow travel by foot or some form of conveyance, including a motor vehicle, cart, bicycle, or horse. - The Pan-American Highway is a network of roads measuring about in total length. Except for a rainforest break of approximately , called the Darién Gap, the road links almost all of the mainland countries of the Americas in a connected highway system. According to \\"Guinness World Records\\", the Pan-American Highway is the world's longest \\"motorable road\\". However, because of the Darién Gap, it is not possible to cross between South America and Central America. - A town is a human settlement larger than a village but smaller than a city. The size definition for what constitutes a \\"town\\" varies considerably in different parts of the world. - Huehuetenango is one of the 22 departments of Guatemala. It is situated in the western highlands and shares borders with Mexico in the north and west; with El Quiché in the east, with Totonicapán, Quetzaltenango, and San Marcos to the south.

The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums.

Available options: [+] World; [+] Sports; [+] Business; [+] Science/Tech;","completion":"[+] World The latest accusations made by Palestinian officials against the United States over its acceptance of some Israeli expansion of West Bank settlements have the potential to impact prospects for peace in the Middle East. This issue falls under the category of world affairs, primarily as it involves multiple nations and their relations, as well as global peace efforts. The ongoing conflict between Israel and Palestine has had a significant effect on the Middle East, with multiple attempts from different countries and international organizations to negotiate or impose a viable peace solution. The United States has long been involved in the efforts to resolve the conflict, often acting as a mediator between Israel and the Palestinians. However, its policy on the Israeli settlements in the West Bank has shifted across various administrations. This latest move by the United States to seemingly accept some form of Israeli expansion in the West Bank contravenes the international consensus on this matter. Israeli settlements in the occupied West Bank are considered illegal under international law, as they violate the Fourth Geneva Convention, which prohibits an occupying power from transferring its civilian population into the territory it occupies. The expansion of these settlements has been viewed as a hindrance to peace, as it continues to encroach upon Palestinian lands and diminishes the prospects of creating a contiguous and viable Palestinian state. Palestinian officials have argued that acceptance of Israeli settlement expansion by the United States sends the wrong message to Israel, as it emboldens further incursions and devalues the Palestinian claims to a future state. This stance from the United States may lead to increased tensions within the region, further complicating an already complex situation and undermining international efforts towards peace. Furthermore, this issue has ramifications beyond the immediate actors involved. Regional stability and the security of the wider Middle East are jeopardized by a lack of progress in resolving the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Countries such as Iran and Turkey have interests and influence within the region, and tensions between Israel and the Palestinians can exacerbate existing issues or create new geopolitical challenges. As such, the recent accusations made by Palestinian officials regarding the United States’ position on Israeli settlements should be considered an important development in world affairs. Acceptance of Israeli settlement expansion by the United States has implications not only for the Israeli-Palestinian conflict but also for regional stability, international peace efforts, and the overall geopolitical landscape of the Middle East."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mike's company is developing an app called \\"Omni Jet\\" which will increase business while the company raises much-needed financial capital with a stock offering. However, it requires U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission approval.

Given a task, you explain in simple steps what the task is asking, any guidelines that it provides. You solve the task and show how you used the guidelines to solve the task. You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task. In this task you are expected to provide an SQL statement from an english description of what that SQL statement does. The description may include multiple steps but you should only ouput one SQL statement that accomplishes every step. An SQL query works by selecting data from a table where certain conditions apply. A table contains columns where every row in that table must have a value for each column. Every table has a primary key that uniquely identifies each row, usually an id. To choose which columns are returned you specify that after the \\"SELECT\\" statement. Next, you use a \\"FROM\\" statement to specify what tables you want to select the data from. When you specify a table you can rename it with the \\"AS\\" statement. You can reference that table by whatever name follows the \\"AS\\" statement. If you want to select data from multiple tables you need to use the \\"JOIN\\" statement. This will join the tables together by pairing a row in one table with every row in the other table (Cartesian Product). To limit the number of rows returned you should use the \\"ON\\" statement. This will only return rows where the condition specified after the statement is true, this is usually an equals operator with primary keys. You can also use the \\"WHERE\\" statement to specify that only rows with column values statisfying a certain condition, should be returned. The \\"GROUP BY\\" statement will group rows together that have equal column values for whatever columns follows the statement. The \\"HAVING\\" statement will return groups that statisfy whatever condition follows the statement. Any column(s) being returned from grouped rows must either be an aggregate function, (AVG, MAX, COUNT, SUM, ...) of a column, or the column(s) that the data was grouped by. To sort the returned data you can use the \\"ORDER BY\\" command which will order the data by whatever aggregate function or column follows the statement. The \\"DESC\\" statement will sort in descending order and the \\"ASC\\" statement will sort in ascending order. Finally, you can use the \\"LIMIT\\" statement to return a certain number of rows. When \\"*\\" is used in an SQL statement every column is returned. For example, SELECT * FROM table WHERE attribute = 1, will select every column from rows with the attribute column equal to 1.

Write an article based on this \\"Surround yourself with mature people. Learn new things every day. Accept constructive criticism. Take responsibility for your actions. Improve your communication skills.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: The Path to Personal Growth: How Maturity, Learning, and Accountability Lead to a Better You Introduction Personal growth and self-improvement are lifelong journeys that encompass emotional, intellectual, and social development. One of the critical elements to achieve this is to surround yourself with mature individuals who share the same growth mindset and possess qualities that foster learning, acceptance, responsibility, and effective communication. In this article, we will look at how each aspect contributes to your journey and aids in developing a stronger sense of self and emotional well-being. 1. Surround Yourself with Mature People The company you keep has a significant impact on your thinking, habits, and overall outlook on life. Mature people approach situations with wisdom, understanding, and a genuine desire for personal growth. They possess emotional intelligence and are always striving for self-improvement. By surrounding yourself with a mature and supportive group, you will reap the benefits of their positive influence. They can provide valuable insights, challenge your assumptions, and encourage you to strive for improvement. Their guidance and support can be invaluable assets in helping you navigate the ups and downs of life while staying focused on your objectives. 2. Learn New Things Every Day Curiosity and the act of continuous learning are essential ingredients for growth. Embrace lifelong learning to develop a richer understanding of the world around you, enhance your skills, and cultivate a mindset of growth and adaptability. Learning can be achieved through various avenues, including reading, attending courses and workshops, engaging in new hobbies, having thought-provoking conversations with others, and even through travel and exposure to different cultures and ideas. The more you learn, the more you realize how much you don't know, which fuels your desire for further knowledge and growth. 3. Accept Constructive Criticism Feedback and constructive criticism are vital for personal growth. While it can be uncomfortable to hear critiques of one's actions and ideas, embracing them with an open mind allows for a deeper understanding of your strengths and weaknesses. Mature individuals view criticism as an opportunity to learn, improve, and ultimately become better versions of themselves. When facing criticism, actively listen and hold back the urge to defend immediately. Give yourself time to reflect on the feedback and assess whether it adds value to your growth. If it does, incorporate it into your self-improvement plan and use it to fuel your progress. 4. Take Responsibility for Your Actions Personal growth and accountability go hand in hand. When you take responsibility for your actions, you acknowledge the role you play in shaping your life's outcomes, both positive and negative. This understanding empowers you to make necessary changes, to apologize when necessary, and to learn from your mistakes. Taking responsibility also means recognizing and understanding your emotions and how they contribute to your reactions. When you acknowledge the role emotions play in your life, you can develop better coping mechanisms and management strategies. 5. Improve Your Communication Skills Effective communication is a skill that, when mastered, can lead to better relationships, higher levels of understanding, and more efficient problem-solving. Improving this skill is an investment in both your professional and personal life. To enhance your communication skills, focus on aspects such as active listening, empathy, assertiveness, and body language. Engaging in activities such as public speaking, writing, and even improvisational acting can also contribute to this crucial skill. Conclusion In our pursuit of self-improvement, we should aim to surround ourselves with mature individuals, continually expand our knowledge and skills, welcome constructive criticism, take responsibility for our actions, and polish our communication skills. By incorporating these elements into our personal growth journey, we will inevitably emerge as better, more well-rounded individuals ready to thrive in all aspects of life."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Movie title: Population 436 Movie plot: Steve Kady (Jeremy Sisto), a US Census Bureau researcher is sent to the remote and seemingly idyllic village of Rockwell Falls to interview residents concerning the population. On the way to Rockwell Falls his car hits a pothole and bursts two tires. He is eventually picked up by Bobby Caine (Fred Durst), the Sheriff's Deputy, who drives him into Rockwell Falls and helps him find a place to stay.During his stay, Kady notices a number of increasingly strange things about the town. People make vague allusions to 'the fever', and several residents treat him as though he were not just a visitor, but had moved to Rockwell Falls permanently. His research reveals that the town's population has remained at exactly 436 for over 100 years. People who try to leave Rockwell Falls seem to meet with bizarre and deadly accidents, which the residents believe to be the work of God. Kady also begins to have eerie dreams, about a truck, a cross and a doll.Kady becomes romantically involved with Courtney Lovett (Charlotte Sullivan), a local woman and the daughter of his host, much to the chagrin of Caine, who is also in love with her. He also befriends Amanda (Reva Timbers), a young girl whose father was killed trying to escape the town, and who is being held at Dr Greaver (David Fox)'s clinic, on the pretext of treating her for schizophrenia. Courtney and Amanda both express a desire to leave the town, but are afraid of the consequences of trying.After stumbling upon some books on Biblical numerology, Kady realises that the townspeople attach a mystical importance to the number 436 and are willing to go to extreme lengths to keep the population at exactly that number, including executing surplus residents. Anyone who expresses a desire to leave is treated for the 'fever' by Dr Greaver, the town doctor, with electroshock therapy or in extreme cases, frontal lobotomy. It gradually becomes apparent to Kady that the residents of Rockwell Falls have no intention of allowing him to leave.After witnessing the execution of a seemingly...

This week the Supreme Court heard two historic cases on marriage. Even though I was a lawyer in the litigation and in the courthouse both days, I can't predict which way the court will come down. But the outcomes range from nothing at all to fundamentally restructuring the foundational unit of western civilization. Hollingsworth v. Perry is about whether state laws defining marriage as one man and one woman violate the 14th Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. United States v. Windsor asks whether Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act, which defines marriage for federal law and programs as between one man and one woman, is unconstitutional. DOMA passed in 1996 with 78% of the U.S. House and 85% of the Senate and was signed by President Bill Clinton. When her partner died in 2009,","completion":"Edith Windsor was faced with a hefty estate tax bill because, under DOMA, her marriage to a woman was not recognized by the federal government. If her spouse had been a man, she would have qualified for the marital tax deduction and avoided the exorbitant tax. Windsor sued the federal government, arguing that the unequal treatment of her marriage for tax purposes violated the 14th Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. Both Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor were monumental cases in the fight for marriage equality in the United States, but it was ultimately another case, 2015's Obergefell v. Hodges, that established the right to same-sex marriage nationwide. However, the outcomes of these cases significantly influenced the broader conversation on same-sex marriage rights and laid the groundwork for the landmark decision in Obergefell. As for DOMA, it was largely ruled unconstitutional in the Windsor case, allowing married same-sex couples to receive federal benefits. In conclusion, while it was impossible to predict the outcome of Hollingsworth v. Perry and United States v. Windsor at the time, these cases played a critical role in the advancement of marriage equality in the United States. Their outcomes ranged from leaving existing laws unchanged to necessitating significant shifts in the legal framework surrounding marriage, ultimately contributing to the recognition and protection of same-sex marriages under the law."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nonetheless, fresh turmeric can often be found at farmers' markets, larger grocery stores, health food stores, and asian markets.","completion":"Step 1: Gather ingredients and supplies - Choose your turmeric, as stated in the given information. - Purchase or gather additional ingredients, such as black pepper, ginger, honey, lemon, and cinnamon (depending on personal preference for taste). - Gather any necessary supplies, such as a kettle or saucepan, teapot, mugs, spoon, or strainer. Step 2: Prepare the ingredients - For fresh turmeric, peel the skin and grate the desired amount. - For ground turmeric, measure out the desired amount. - Prepare any additional ingredients, such as slicing the ginger or lemon. - Justification: Preparing ingredients beforehand will make the process easier and smoother. Step 3: Boil water - Fill a kettle or saucepan with the desired amount of water (depending on the number of servings) and bring it to a boil. - Justification: Boiling water is necessary for the tea-making process, as it helps to extract the flavors and benefits of the ingredients. Step 4: Add turmeric and other ingredients to the boiling water and simmer - Lower the heat to a simmer and add the turmeric, as well as any additional ingredients you would like in the tea (e.g., black pepper, ginger, etc.). - Allow the mixture to simmer for about 10 minutes. - Justification: Simmering the mixture will enhance the flavors and help the ingredients blend together. Additionally, this step helps to extract the beneficial properties of turmeric. Step 5: Strain and serve - If using fresh ingredients, carefully strain the tea mixture into a teapot or directly into serving mugs. - If using ground turmeric, simply pour the tea mixture into the serving mugs. - Justification: Straining the tea will ensure a smooth and pleasant drinking experience by removing any solids from the mixture. Step 6: Add sweeteners and garnishes (optional) - Add honey, lemon, or cinnamon to taste.

Now there is no forest left, though there are still some small areas covered with trees. We call these woods. Elephants, tigers and many other animals were living in the thick forest. When people came to live in Hong Kong, the animals began to die out. Early farmers grew rice and kept pigs and chickens in the valleys. They cut down the trees and burnt them. They needed fire to keep themselves warm in winter, to cook their food and to keep away the dangerous animals. Elephants quickly disappeared because there was not enough food for them. Many other animals soon died in the same way. You might think that there are no longer any animals in Hong Kong except in 2005. But there are still about 36 different animals living there.

Options: - ditch - terrarium - thick forest - kew gardens - feild The answer is \\"kew gardens\\" because A:","completion":"Kew Gardens, also known as the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, is an excellent hiding place for a snake in the United Kingdom. The sprawling landscape, extensive horticultural collections, and varied microhabitats within the gardens make it a perfect environment for snakes to thrive, hide, and find plenty of food options. While there are potential hiding spots in ditches, terrariums, thick forests, and fields, Kew Gardens offers a more ideal environment for a snake due to the following reasons: 1. Biodiversity: Kew Gardens is home to a variety of flora and fauna, creating a thriving ecosystem with a rich biodiversity. This abundance of plant life provides a multitude of places for a snake to hide without being easily detected. Moreover, the diverse presence of insects, amphibians, and small mammals makes it a prime location for finding food. 2. Microhabitats: The garden is divided into various sections, such as the arboretum, glasshouses, woodlands, wetlands, and grasslands. These different habitats provide appropriate environments for different snake species, catering to their individual needs and preferences. 3. Shelter: Kew Gardens features numerous natural and manmade hiding spots for snakes. The landscapes include rock gardens, fallen tree branches, dense foliage, and carefully managed woodland areas with heaps of dead leaves and other organic debris, giving snakes ample opportunities for shelter and camouflage. 4. Climate Control: The glasshouses in Kew Gardens maintain controlled climates tailored to the needs of particular plants and animals. These structures can offer suitable temperatures and humidity levels to accommodate snakes that would prefer warmer or more tropical environments, allowing them to find a comfortable hiding place, which is not possible in an open field or a typical dense forest in the United Kingdom. 5. Conservation Efforts: Kew Gardens is an internationally renowned center for the study and conservation of plants and fungi, as well as the wildlife that interacts with them. By residing in such an environment, a snake can potentially benefit from these ongoing research and conservation measures, resulting in minimal human disturbance and a more sustainable habitat for the snake. In conclusion, Kew Gardens provides an exceptional hiding place for a snake within the United Kingdom due to its extensive biodiversity, multiple microhabitats, ample sources of shelter, controlled climates, and ongoing conservation efforts. While the other options may offer suitable hiding places in certain situations, Kew Gardens offers a more comprehensive and diverse environment that caters to the needs of various snake species."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Exercise releases endorphins, which are natural pain relievers. Endorphins also help counteract the prostaglandins in your body that cause contractions and pain. Because of this, physical activity may help relieve cramps. Try different kinds of aerobic exercise, such as walking, running, cycling, swimming, kayaking, hiking, or a class at the gym. Stretching helps relax your muscles and alleviate cramps. Sit on the floor with your legs stretched far apart. Stretch forward to catch your toes or ankle. Breathe in while keeping your back straight. After a few breaths, lean forward towards the floor. You can try other simple stretches as well to stretch out your back or abdomen, depending on which areas hurt the most. Some women experience relief from menstrual cramping with orgasm. The reason behind this is not well understood, but may have something to do with endorphins released during sexual arousal. Much like with exercise, the endorphins released during orgasm can help relieve the menstrual cramps and inflammation. Similar to aerobic exercise and stretching, yoga helps relax the body and reduce aches and pains in the lower back, legs, and abdomen. When you begin to feel menstrual cramps, you can try various yoga poses to help you with your pain. Before you start, get in some comfortable clothes and put on soothing music. You can do the head-to-knee forward bend. Sit on the floor and extend your legs in front of you. Pull one of your legs in and bend it 90 degrees so that the sole of your foot rests against the inside of your thigh. Inhale and grab your shin, ankle, or foot. Stretch the torso over your leg towards the foot. Exhale and bend down from the groin. Lengthen and stretch your back instead of rounding it. Breathe as you hold the pose, extending through the heel and pressing your sitting bones towards the floor. Hold for 1-3 minutes, then switch sides. You can also try the noose pose. Get into a full squat with your feet together. Lower down until your buttocks are towards your heels. Inhale, then move your knees to the left as you turn your torso to the right. As you exhale, wrap the left arm back behind you and around your knees and legs. Inhale and reach the right arm around to clasp your hands. Exhale as you gaze over the right shoulder. Hold for 30-60 seconds as you breathe. Switch sides. You can also attempt camel pose. Get on your knees, hip-width apart. Make sure your shins and feet are pressed firmly into the floor. Rest your palms on the top of your buttocks with the fingers pointing down. Inhale. Lift your chest and move your shoulders down towards the ribs. Exhale, then push your hips forward as you arch back. To stabilize yourself, rest your hands on your heels. Lift the chest. Breathe steadily for 30-60 seconds.","completion":"Exercise, stretching, and yoga can help relieve menstrual symptoms like cramping by releasing endorphins, natural pain relievers, and relaxing muscles."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: The port was the point of departure for the Pilgrim Fathers aboard Mayflower in 1620. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Choices: a). yes; b). no;","completion":"a) Yes; The famous ship that left Southampton's port carrying the Pilgrim Fathers is the Mayflower. The Mayflower was an English ship that transported a group of English families known today as the Pilgrim Fathers or Pilgrims from England to the New World in 1620. The Pilgrims were religious dissenters seeking to establish a new life in the New World, free of religious persecution from the English monarchy and the Church of England. The Pilgrims initially planned their voyage on two ships: the Mayflower and the Speedwell. However, the Speedwell faced numerous issues and was deemed unseaworthy, causing all passengers to be consolidated onto the Mayflower. The journey took around 66 days, and the 102 passengers, accompanied by 30 crew members, faced a challenging and treacherous voyage across the Atlantic Ocean. They finally reached the shores of present-day Massachusetts, North America, where they founded Plymouth Colony. The Mayflower Compact, which was signed by 41 of the male passengers, became a valuable and historical document. It served as a basis for the colony's early self-governance, creating a foundation for later democratic principles and the establishment of the United States of America. The story of the Pilgrims' journey on the Mayflower has become a significant and celebrated event in American history. Annually, the United States celebrates Thanksgiving Day in commemoration of the Pilgrims' harvest feast held in the autumn of 1621, attended by Native Americans, who provided significant help and support to the settlers, especially in the form of agricultural knowledge. The Pilgrims' journey has subsequently become a symbol of human resilience, courage, and determination in the face of considerable adversity. Moreover, the voyage of the Mayflower from Southampton's port ultimately transformed North America and laid the foundations for future European settlement and the eventual birth of the United States of America."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Contemporary biographers have turned Lewis Carroll (pictured in later life) into a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls. Lewis Carroll has been cast by many modern biographers as a social misfit with an unhealthy interest in little girls that led him to take hundreds of nude photographs of them. But a leading authority on the author has now claimed this is a ‘myth’ created by spurious and sloppy research. Edward Wakeling has criticised biographers who have given the author of two of literature’s greatest children’s classics - Alice’s Adventures in Wonderland and its sequel, Through the Looking-Glass - a disturbing modern reputation. Previously-unpublished letters and reminiscences of those who knew him are among thousands of documents which Mr Wakeling has collected over four decades. They offer evidence that Carroll was in fact a sociable man who enjoyed adult company as much as children’s, he said, adding: ‘It’s both. You can’t just say it’s one and not the other.’ From an opus of some 3,000 photographs, Mr Wakeling has calculated that nude photographs of children represent ‘no more than 1 per cent of Carroll’s output’. While Katie Roiphe wrote a novel portraying Carroll as holding sexual feelings towards his muse, biographer Morton N Cohen observed that it would be ‘naïve’ to suggest that Carroll’s interest in children was ‘strictly artistic’. But Mr Wakeling points to unpublished material, including reminiscences of Mabel Amy Burton, who was eight when she met Carroll in 1877. She recalled: ‘As a small child I much disliked strangers, but the personality of this gentleman attracted me and I chatted away with him quite freely.’ Young girl: Alice Liddell (pictured) was photographed many times by Carroll. Pictured above in 1858, she was the daughter of family friend Henry George Liddell and the inspiration for Alice in Wonderland. On news of his death, she wrote of the ‘irreparable loss in the hearts of many who had been his child-friends’. Mr Wakeling says: ‘It is about time we cleared up, once and for all, the pervading false myth about [Carroll’s] unhealthy relationship with children. He was a lover of children but he was not an abuser of children.’ He added: ‘There must be 30 or 40 biographies since his nephew wrote the first one in 1898. ‘People who decide to write about Carroll realise that they’re not going to get their book published unless they can find a new angle. ‘Quite a few of them have scratched their head and come up with something outrageous and controversial like Lewis Carroll was Jack the Ripper, that he didn’t write Alice - Queen Victoria did - that he was having a sexual affair with Alice’s mother, and a lot more nonsense…. ‘Then there are biographers who really don’t do their homework. They read a few other biographies, regurgitate them, add a few bits of speculation - and that’s it.’ Also pictured by Carroll: Gertrude Chataway, photographed (above) in 1876, was one of the author's closest friends. The girl inspired his nonsense poem The Hunting of the Snark. Then, he suggests, like Chinese whispers, untrue facts get shared and embellished. He argues that, if biographers went back to the primary sources, they would discover a very different picture of Lewis Carroll, the pseudonym of Charles Lutwidge Dodgson. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll (above) needed to explore children, a leading authority says. Mr Wakeling is a former chairman of the Lewis Carroll Society, who regularly advises auctioneers and exhibitions worldwide. His books include Carroll’s ten-volume Diaries, which he edited in 2007 following their release by the family. He also owns one of the finest Carrollian collections, including a database of 6,000 letters, of which some 4,000 are unpublished: ‘So there’s a great wealth of material I can draw on.’ He publishes his research later this month in a new book titled Lewis Carroll: The Man and His Circle. Numerous ‘myths’ that he challenges include those relating to Carroll’s photography, of which perhaps the most prevalent – ‘frequently used by writers, biographers and journalists’ – is the supposed large body of studies of nude children: ‘This is not borne out by the facts.’ He argues that picturing nude children and focussing his camera on girls was common practice among Victorian photographers and that, when Carroll visited family friends, boys were more likely to be away at school. Vilifying a man who believed in girls’ education is therefore unjustified. Anyway, there are as well many photographs of boys and adults. As a writer of children’s books, Carroll needed to explore children, Mr Wakeling pointed out: ‘His relationship with children is not an all-encompassing part of his life, which many of the biographers tried to suggest. ‘He was a teacher. He actually enjoyed the intellectual banter that he could have with children. Children in Victorian times found that very refreshing because it was very uncommon for someone to treat them as equals. Children were seen and not heard.’ Photographed: Carroll also took portraits of poet Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1857 (left) and Prince Leopold, the eighth child of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert in 1875 (right) For Carroll, Mr Wakeling added, ‘they were seen and heard’. Reviewing reminiscences by Carroll’s child-friends, Mr Wakeling could not find ‘a bad word spoken against him’. Those friends included Edith Litton, who described Carroll as ‘one of my most delightful friends’ with a ‘sweet smile’. She was seven when he read her the story of Hans Andersen’s Ugly Duckling: ‘Being very sensitive about my ugly little self, it greatly interested me.’ He told her that ‘it was better to be good, truthful’. Mr Wakeling ridicules Carroll’s portrayal as an eccentric misfit: ‘The vast majority of the biographers say he was a shy, reclusive man. Nonsense. He was a socialite. ‘He mixed with the great and the good of Victorian society - all the Pre-Raphaelites, Arthur Sullivan [the composer], famous politicians. ‘He was a friend of the Prime Minister, Lord Salisbury, whose parties he was often invited to. This man is not a recluse and he isn’t shy.’ His evidence includes an unpublished letter from Lady Georgina Salisbury, telling Carroll: ‘The children are very anxious you should come to their party… and, if you could come on the 31st and stay over the 3rd January, we should be delighted to see you.’ His circle of friends included Sir James Paget, surgeon to Queen Victoria and the Prince of Wales. In response to Carroll’s concern for a friend who was dying from cancer, Paget wrote: ‘I will gladly see the poor lady.’ ‘Everything's got a moral, if only you can find it,’ thought Carroll, and in Mr Wakeling’s book it is clear: to defend him from his modern character assassins. The book is published ahead of next year’s celebrations marking the 150th anniversary of the publication of Alice, and include a major BBC documentary, books and exhibitions worldwide. But no doubt those with suspicious minds will be back.

Article: HIGH (Human Growth Hormone) could be the favorite drug at the next athletic world championships, and we might never know it. It is a natural substance produced by the human body, and it helps children's bones and muscles to grow. Scientists are allowed to make the drug and it is also legal to take HGH in most countries. HGH is considered a wonder drug for children. It helps many children with growth problems every year. However, some athletes are now taking the drug. HGH helps add muscle in adults and recent research by the World Anti-Doping Agency shows that HGH may improve the sportsman's time by 5% when he takes part in short, fast races. Some athletes say that HGH surely makes them stronger. It also helps them to recover more quickly from injuries. Although it is _ by most professional sports, HGH is almost impossible to test for. The drug is completely natural and it will only show in tests for around 24 hours after taking it. Testing is usually done only during competitions, but athletes use HGH during training, so it is very difficult to know who has used the drug. This makes it very attractive for some athletes. Scientists are developing a new test which will find the drug in the body for up to two weeks. But it isn't going to be easy. Everybody has different levels of natural HGH in their body. For this reason, scientists are warning athletes of the possible problems with the drug. Research shows that HGH increase the risk of cancer. But is this enough to stop athletes from taking it? Scientists don't think so. Some athletes will do all they can to win, and worry about their health later. Question: Besides making them stronger, why is taking HGH attractive for some athletes?

Follow these safety tips to keep skating safe and fun. Step 1: Gear up! Even before you put on your skates, put on all your safety gear . Step 2: Buckle up! Strap on your skates. Make sure they fit well and are snugly around your ankles. This helps your ankles stay strong and straight. Step 3: Fall down! You probably do not usually try to fall. But it is good to practice falling on skates. Fall forward onto your knee pads. Put out your hands and let your wrist guards hit the ground. See? Are you surprised that it doesn't hurt? Practice falling until it is easy to fall forward and get up again. If you are not afraid to fall, you will try new things. Knowing how to fall will help you be a better skater and find your balance. When you can stay balanced, you won't fall as much. Step 4: Stop! Make sure you can stop on your skates. The quickest and safest is probably the brake stop. The brake is usually on the back of the right skate. The brake stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Let your right skate roll a little forward. Bend your knees as if you are sitting down. Then press your right heel down hard. This will make your brake pad drag on the ground until you stop. The T stop: Roll forward with your skates pointing the same way. Then turn your right foot out so the toes are pointing to your right. Drag your right skate. Let the wheels drag on the ground until you come to a stop. Another way to stop is to run or jump onto the grass. Step 5: Roll around! Find a flat, smooth place to practice. Do not skate in streets. Parks and playgrounds are good places to practice. Look for \\"No skating\\" signs to make sure you can skate there. Question: In the step right after \\"Buckle up!\\" you should practice how to _ .

Ellsworth-vuoret Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"The phrase \\"Ellsworth-vuoret\\" is Finnish and translates to \\"Ellsworth Mountains\\" in English. The Ellsworth Mountains are a mountain range in Antarctica, named after American explorer, aviator, and polar adventurer Lincoln Ellsworth. The Ellsworth Mountains are the highest range in Antarctica, extending about 350 kilometers (220 miles) inland and reaching an elevation of 4,898 meters (16,076 feet) at Mount Vinson, which is the highest peak on the continent. The mountains are significant not only for their size but also for their geological features, which provide valuable information for scientific research. The range is separated into two main parts: the Sentinel Range in the north and the Heritage Range in the south. The Sentinel Range is more massive and contains some of the highest peaks in Antarctica, while the Heritage Range is lower and more accessible. Both ranges are characterized by a diverse array of majestic peaks, glaciers, icefalls, and valleys. The remote and harsh environment of the Ellsworth Mountains makes them difficult to access and explore. Over the years, various scientific missions have attempted to study and map out the range, with the purpose of understanding the geology, climate, and history of the region. Since the mountains are located within the boundaries of the Antarctic Treaty, they are protected and managed under this international agreement. The treaty aims to preserve the Antarctic environment and its unique ecosystems, promote scientific cooperation, and ensure the peaceful and non-military use of the continent. In summary, the Ellsworth Mountains, known as \\"Ellsworth-vuoret\\" in Finnish, are an important and impressive mountain range in Antarctica. They offer significant opportunities for scientific research, geological exploration, and understanding the history and evolution of our planet. At the same time, the Ellsworth Mountains serve as a symbol of international cooperation and environmental conservation through their inclusion in the Antarctic Treaty system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the last name of the person who was inspired to write a song by the growing tension among the Beatles Paul McCartney said he came up with the title \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of his first visits to his property High Park Farm, near Campbeltown in Scotland, which he purchased in June 1966. The phrase was inspired by the sight of a road \\"stretching up into the hills\\" in the remote Highlands surroundings of lochs and distant mountains. He wrote the song at his farm in 1968, inspired by the growing tension among the Beatles. Based on other comments McCartney has made, author Howard Sounes writes, the lyrics can be seen as McCartney expressing his anguish at the direction of his personal life, as well as a nostalgic look back at the Beatles' history. McCartney recalled: \\"I just sat down at my piano in Scotland, started playing and came up with that song, imagining it was going to be done by someone like Ray Charles. I have always found inspiration in the calm beauty of Scotland and again it proved the place where I found inspiration.\\"Once back in London, McCartney recorded a demo version of \\"The Long and Winding Road\\" during one of the recording sessions for The Beatles. Later, he offered the song to Tom Jones on the condition that the singer release it as his next single. In Jones' recollection, he was forced to turn it down since his record company were about to issue \\"Without Love\\" as a single.The song takes the form of a piano-based ballad, with conventional chord changes. McCartney described the chords as \\"slightly jazzy\\" and in keeping with Charles' style. The song's home key is E-flat major but it also uses the relative C minor. Lyrically, it is a sad and melancholic song, with an evocation of an as-yet unrequited, though apparently inevitable, love. In an interview in 1994, McCartney described the lyric more obliquely: \\"It's rather a sad song.

Question: Background: The benefits provided by no-tillage to predators may lead to larger predator populations, which is a good way to control pests (biological control), but also can facilitate predation of the crop itself. In corn crops, for instance, predation by caterpillars can be higher in no-till than in conventional tillage fields.In places with rigorous winter, untilled soil can take longer to warm and dry in spring, which may delay planting to less ideal dates. Another factor to be considered is that organic residue from the prior year's crops lying on the surface of untilled fields can provide a favorable environment to pathogens, helping to increase the risk of transmitting diseases to the future crop. And because no-till farming provides good environment for pathogens, insects and weeds, it can lead farmers to a more intensive use of chemicals for pest control. Other disadvantages of no-till include underground rot, low soil temperatures and high moisture.Based on the balance of these factors, and because each farm has different problems, agroecologists will not attest that only no-till or complete tillage is the right way of farming. Yet, these are not the only possible choices regarding soil preparation, since there are intermediate practices such as strip-till, mulch-till and ridge-till, all of them – just as no-till – categorized as conservation tillage. Agroecologists, then, will evaluate the need of different practices for the contexts in which each farm is inserted. Paragraph: Kat and Joe were into vegetable gardening. Joe started the no-till gardening method, while Kat applied conventional gardening methods. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which gardener didn't increase predator population? Answer:","completion":"Kat did not increase predator population, as she applied conventional gardening methods."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Given the following passage \\"Like the reptiles, birds are primarily uricotelic, that is, their kidneys extract nitrogenous waste from their bloodstream and excrete it as uric acid instead of urea or ammonia through the ureters into the intestine. Birds do not have a urinary bladder or external urethral opening and (with exception of the ostrich) uric acid is excreted along with feces as a semisolid waste. However, birds such as hummingbirds can be facultatively ammonotelic, excreting most of the nitrogenous wastes as ammonia. They also excrete creatine, rather than creatinine like mammals. This material, as well as the output of the intestines, emerges from the bird's cloaca. The cloaca is a multi-purpose opening: waste is expelled through it, most birds mate by joining cloaca, and females lay eggs from it. In addition, many species of birds regurgitate pellets. Males within Palaeognathae (with the exception of the kiwis), the Anseriformes (with the exception of screamers), and in rudimentary forms in Galliformes (but fully developed in Cracidae) possess a penis, which is never present in Neoaves. The length is thought to be related to sperm competition. When not copulating, it is hidden within the proctodeum compartment within the cloaca, just inside the vent. The digestive system of birds is unique, with a crop for storage and a gizzard that contains swallowed stones for grinding food to compensate for the lack of teeth. Most birds are highly adapted for rapid digestion to aid with flight. Some migratory birds have adapted to use protein from many parts of their bodies, including protein from the intestines, as additional energy during migration.\\", answer the following question.

Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not directly explain how sedimentary rocks form. Sedimentary rocks form through a step-by-step process: 1. Weathering and erosion: Rocks on Earth's surface are exposed to weathering, which breaks them down into smaller particles called sediments. Erosion then transports these sediments to new locations. 2. Deposition: The sediments are eventually deposited through processes like settling in calm water, accumulation on floodplains, or as windblown deposits. 3. Lithification: Over time, the layers of deposited sediment accumulate and become compressed under the weight of overlying layers. The pressure from this buildup, combined with chemical reactions from groundwater and minerals, causes the sediments to bind together and harden into solid rock. 4. Compaction and cementation: The final stages of sedimentary rock formation involve further compaction of the sediments and cementation, where minerals like silica or calcite fill in the spaces between sediment particles, \\"gluing\\" them together. These processes result in the formation of sedimentary rocks, which constitute a significant portion of Earth's crust and can provide valuable information about Earth's history and the environments in which they were formed."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Firstly, the reviewer uses highly positive adjectives to describe both the film and the performance of the actress Barbara Stanwyck. The words such as \\"appealing,\\" \\"great,\\" \\"wonderful,\\" \\"amazing,\\" \\"sexy,\\" and \\"excellent,\\" all indicate a high level of satisfaction. The reviewer also expresses love for happy endings, showing approval for the narrative direction, despite mentioning that it may have been \\"tacked on.\\" Secondly, there is distinctive admiration for Barbara Stanwyck’s character. The reviewer points out that she knows what she wants and admirably goes after it. This character intrigue indicates the reviewer's appreciation for character development in the film and believable acting.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Two competing countries used different energy sources to produce their electricity. Turkey used mostly fossil fuels, while Greece used nuclear power. Which country used more coal? Hint: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution that harms the health of living things. The air pollution also causes acid rain and contributes to global warming. In addition, fossil fuels are nonrenewable resources, so if we keep using them, they will eventually run out. The main advantage of nuclear energy is that it doesn’t release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with the burning of fossil fuels. On the other other hand, radioactive elements are nonrenewable like fossil fuels and could eventually be used up. The answer to this question is:","completion":"Turkey used more coal in producing their electricity as they primarily relied on fossil fuels, while Greece utilized nuclear power. Fossil fuels, such as coal, oil, and natural gas, generate electricity upon combustion, releasing greenhouse gases and other pollutants into the environment. Coal, in particular, is a significant source of carbon dioxide emissions, which contribute to global warming and air pollution. As mentioned in the hint, these environmental effects are detrimental to living organisms and ecosystem health. On the other hand, Greece chose a different method for electricity production: nuclear power. Nuclear energy comes from the splitting of uranium atoms in a process called nuclear fission. This process releases energy in the form of heat, which then generates steam that spins turbines and creates electricity. Nuclear power does not emit greenhouse gases or any direct air pollution associated with the burning of fossil fuels. Although nuclear energy presents its own set of challenges, including the handling and disposal of radioactive waste, its environmental impacts are dramatically less concerning than those caused by the combustion of coal. In conclusion, Turkey, which relied on fossil fuels to generate electricity, consequently used more coal than Greece that opted for nuclear power as their primary energy source. Although both fossil fuels and radioactive elements are nonrenewable resources, the environmental consequences associated with coal usage make it a less sustainable choice for electricity generation in the long run."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: what is the meaning of quaid e azam?","completion":"Quaid-e-Azam is a title in Urdu that is given to an individual who holds great importance and is highly regarded in a society or nation. The term \\"Quaid-e-Azam\\" can be translated to \\"Great Leader\\" or \\"Supreme Leader\\" in English. This title is most famously associated with Muhammad Ali Jinnah, the founding father of Pakistan. Muhammad Ali Jinnah was born in Karachi on December 25, 1876, and received his early education from the Sindh-Madrasa-tul-Islam in Karachi, and later the Christian Missionary Society High School. He then proceeded to England to pursue higher education from the Lincoln's Inn. Throughout his life, he practiced law, was a renowned political leader, and played a crucial role in the creation of Pakistan. Therefore, due to his immense contribution, he was given the title of \\"Quaid-e-Azam.\\" Jinnah first entered politics in 1906 when he joined the Indian National Congress. However, during his time in Congress, Jinnah grew disenchanted with the Hindu-majority organization, primarily due to its lack of consideration for Indian Muslims' rights and representation. Consequently, Jinnah joined the All India Muslim League in 1913, where he actively began working to protect Muslims' rights and the demand for separate electorates for both Hindus and Muslims. By the 1940s, it had become increasingly clear that Hindus and Muslims could not coexist harmoniously in a unified India. Jinnah was a strong advocate for the creation of a separate Muslim-majority nation and gave the idea of \\"two-nation theory.\\" This theory asserted that Muslims and Hindus were two separate nations and could not be assimilated into a single country. According to Jinnah, only a separate country would allow Muslims to reside and practice their religion and customs without any hindrance. Quaid-e-Azam's tireless efforts and astute leadership eventually led to the successful creation of the new Muslim-majority country of Pakistan on August 14, 1947. Under his guidance, Pakistan managed to secure independence from British rule, free from political subjugation, cultural domination, economic exploitation, and social injustice that Indian Muslims had previously experienced. In summary, the meaning of \\"Quaid-e-Azam\\" is primarily associated with Muhammad Ali Jinnah. It denotes a title of utmost respect and admiration for the great leader who played a pivotal role in securing a safe homeland for India's Muslim population. Jinnah's unwavering determination and his charismatic leadership forged a nation, and his legacy lives on as the guiding spirit of Pakistan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

After gathering your research, you created a comprehensive itinerary covering the must-visit destinations in each country on your route. The first leg of your European adventure began with a flight to Paris, France, where you were mesmerized by the Eiffel Tower, Louvre Museum, and Notre-Dame Cathedral. Wandering the charming cobbled streets of Montmartre and enjoying French cuisine in quaint bistros added to the charm of your time in the City of Light. From Paris, you continued east to Berlin, Germany, where you immersed yourselves in the city's rich history, visiting sites such as the Brandenburg Gate, the Berlin Wall, and the Holocaust Memorial. As you moved through Europe, you developed a deeper appreciation for the unique customs, art, and architecture that defined each city. While in Rome, Italy, you marveled at the Colosseum, the Forum, and the awe-inspiring Vatican City, falling in love with the renowned Italian cuisine in the process. In Barcelona, Spain, you embraced the vibrant lifestyle and admired the architectural wonders, including the iconic Sagrada Família and Park Güell, both of which were designed by the legendary Antoni Gaudí. As you journeyed from city to city, you meticulously documented your experiences, making sure to take countless photos and videos to remember your trip by. You also collected various souvenirs and memorabilia, such as postcards, ticket stubs, and local crafts, to serve as tangible reminders of your adventures. Throughout this European excursion, your bonds with CJ and Greg grew stronger, as the time you spent together fortifying lifelong memories became cherished moments. Despite hardships like sore feet, fatigue, and occasional disagreements, your joint enthusiasm, commitment to the trip, and strong camaraderie helped to make the journey unforgettable. Your arrival in Amsterdam marked the continuation of your unforgettable European adventure. And as mentioned, you were excited for your next stop, Geneva, Switzerland. With its picturesque landscape, delicious Swiss chocolate, and majestic snow-capped mountains, you could hardly wait to continue exploring the alluring beauty of Europe. As you forged ahead on your travels, you eagerly anticipated the new experiences and memories that awaited you in the land of Alpine splendor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The co-ordination of the action sequences are laughable and make the film have some funny slap stick moments. Robert Ginty and Fred Williamson have a memorable scene together near the end, where Williamson says to Ginty, \\"you sure do get around buddy boy!\\". I did enjoy this film only for Ginty and Williamson, but not for the storyline that must have been written on the back of a napkin in four lines and the rest ad-libbed most likely. A film with over 30 parts only has a credit list for 10 or so. It seems odd that no one else has a credit in the film, maybe they had some insight into how the finished product would look.

Teacher:In this task, you are given two strings A, B. Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: OGHuXKJodoDxBTmcIkPnJDHQu, SjCyoDxBTmcIkPOYl Student:","completion":"To solve this problem, I used the definition of the longest common substring. A common substring is a sequence of characters that appear in the same order in both strings. The longest common substring is the one with the most characters. To find the longest common substring, I first divided the problem into smaller subproblems, comparing individual characters in both strings. I created a matrix of size (length of A + 1) x (length of B + 1), initializing all elements to 0. This matrix will store the length of common substrings ending at each character in A (rows) and B (columns). Now, I looped through the strings A and B, represented by i and j respectively. If the characters A[i] and B[j] match, then I updated the value at matrix[i+1][j+1] by adding 1 to the value at matrix[i][j]. This means that the common substring extends by 1 character. As I progress through the matrix, I keep track of the maximum length of common substring found so far, and its ending position in string A. After finishing the iteration, I know the maximum length of the longest common substring and its ending position, so I can extract it from string A. Using this method, the longest common substring of strings OGHuXKJodoDxBTmcIkPnJDHQu and SjCyoDxBTmcIkPOYl is DxBTmcIkP (with length 9)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons recorded by the medieval scribe Geoffrey of Monmouth included a character considered a villain, obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father? Answer:","completion":"The Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons, as recorded by medieval scribe Geoffrey of Monmouth, is \\"King Lear.\\" This renowned tragic play was written by William Shakespeare between 1605 and 1606, and it revolves around the story of an aging King of Britain, King Lear, who decides to divide his kingdom among his three daughters based on their expressions of love for him. The character in question, considered a villain and obsessed with power and overthrowing her elderly father, is Regan. Regan is the second daughter of King Lear, and alongside her sister Goneril, she demonstrates her evil and cunning nature throughout the play. Initially, Regan flatters her father with eloquent declarations of her love and devotion to gain a larger portion of his kingdom. However, her actions soon reveal her true intentions and insincerity. As the story unfolds, Regan's hunger for power becomes more apparent. She plots against her father, treating him with extreme cruelty and disregard after Lear has divided his kingdom. Regan aims to usurp him completely by forcing him to give up his retinue, humiliating him, and ultimately leaving him vulnerable and powerless. This underhanded behavior is often paired with her older sister, Goneril, forming a formidable alliance driven by their shared ambition for power. Regan's ruthlessness extends not only to her father but also to others around her, including her own husband, the Duke of Cornwall, and her suitor, Edmund—the illegitimate son of the Earl of Gloucester. Throughout the play, she vies for Edmund's affections with her sister Goneril, which eventually leads to their mutual demise. In the plot's climax, Regan is poisoned by her sister Goneril, who is driven by jealousy in their competition for Edmund's affection. The revelation of their treachery against their father and one another ultimately contributes to the tragic outcome of the play. In conclusion, \\"King Lear\\" is the Shakespearean play named after a King of the Britons recorded by Geoffrey of Monmouth. Regan, one of King Lear's daughters, is the character considered a villain in the play. She is driven by a relentless pursuit of power, resulting in the cruel and merciless treatment of her aging father and others around her. Regan's villainous nature serves to heighten the drama and tragedy in this classic work by Shakespeare."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Select from: [-] negative. [-] positive.Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? as the filmmakers look down on their working-class subjects from their lofty perch , that finally makes sex with strangers , which opens today in the new york metropolitan area , so distasteful","completion":"The given phrase can be considered negative for several reasons. Here is a detailed analysis of the negative aspects present in the phrase: 1. \\"look down on\\": The phrase ‘look down on’ conveys a sense of superiority, as if the filmmakers are judging their working-class subjects in a condescending manner. This negative viewpoint fosters the idea that the filmmakers have a feeling of being above their subjects, which can make this phrase appear derogatory and unsympathetic. 2. \\"from their lofty perch\\": The use of the words \\"lofty perch\\" denotes a sense of detachment and distance between the filmmakers and their working-class subjects, which can further contribute to the negative perception of their relationship. This sense of separation can be interpreted as both physical (as in a higher position) and metaphorical (suggesting a difference in status or understanding). 3. \\"finally makes sex with strangers... so distasteful\\": The phrase \\"so distasteful\\" evokes a strong negative response. By stating that the film is \\"distasteful\\" it suggests that there is an unpleasant or morally disturbing aspect to it, which is not a positive qualification for any piece of art. 4. \\"opens today in the New York metropolitan area\\": Although this statement in isolation is neutral, it gains a negative connotation when paired with the previous negative comments about the film. Considering the overall negativity in the phrase, readers may interpret this as a negative event happening in the New York metropolitan area, as the film, labeled \\"distasteful,\\" will be accessible to the public there. In conclusion, the given phrase is considerably negative due to its portrayal of a condescending view by the filmmakers, the sense of detachment and superiority, and the strong distaste it evokes towards the subject matter. These negative aspects all contribute to creating an overall unfavorable impression of the film and its creators."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

High altitude is sometimes defined to begin at 2,400 meters (8,000 ft) above sea level.[5][6][7] At high altitude, atmospheric pressure is lower than that at sea level. This is due to two competing physical effects: gravity, which causes the air to be as close as possible to the ground; and the heat content of the air, which causes the molecules to bounce off each other and expand.[8] There were Two villages Berg village situated at 3000 ft, at the base of the mountain, and Steep village, situated at 8500 feet.

This move comes as a response to increasing scrutiny and pressure from various sources, including ongoing probes into the administration's activities as well as numerous civil lawsuits. Executive privilege is a legal doctrine which allows the president and other high-level executive branch officials to withhold information from Congress, the courts, and the public in order to protect the confidentiality of their communications and to ensure the proper functioning of the executive branch.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Photo: Freebase/Public domain Known for: Acting in the late 1920s and early 1930s, known as \\"Hot Toddy.\\" Thelma Todd was an actress in the late 1920s and early 1930s. She owned a café that she ran on the Roosevelt Highway (now called the Pacific Coast Highway), where she lived in the above apartment with her boyfriend at the time, Roland West. She was found dead inside a garage, behind the steering wheel of her car. At the time, some believed that she had committed suicide or accidentally killed herself while warming up her car when she got locked out of the house. Todd had no signs of struggle on her, though she did have a broken nose. Her blood alcohol level was too high to have allowed her to climb the steps to the garage, and her sandals were too clean if she had, in fact, climbed the stairs herself. A rumor spread that West confessed on his deathbed that he had unknowingly locked Todd in the garage. Todd's body was cremated, lending some to believe it was done to cover up her death by the corrupt District Attorney's office. Others suggest that it could have been her ex-husband or gang leader Charles \\"Lucky\\" Luciano who might have killed her, as she had had confrontations with both of them shortly before she died. ||||| Most knew her as Alicia Silverstone's chirpy, scene-stealing sidekick in \\"Clueless,\\" but Brittany Murphy stood at the brink of a promising Hollywood career that included a plum role in the Eminem film \\"8 Mile\\" and a public romance with her \\"Just Married\\" co-star Ashton Kutcher. But things spun out of control for Murphy, who was appearing increasingly more frail in her later years. On Dec. 20, 2009, the Los Angeles Fire Department arrived at Murphy's home to find the 32-year-old actress unconscious. Murphy was pronounced dead on arrival at the Cedars-Sinai Medicinal Center after going into cardiac arrest. Though the primary cause of death was declared as pneumonia, many speculated that over-the-counter and prescription medications were to blame. Husband Simon Monjack died just five months later, also from pneumonia. There have been many conspiracy theories surrounding the two deaths, including mold and murder by government spies. The murder theory links to a wider terrorism conspiracy touted by Homeland Security whistleblower Julia Davis. In November 2013, a new lab report done at the request of the actress' father suggested that the actress may have been poisoned, however the Los Angeles County coroner has announced there are no plans to reopen the investigation into her death. Thirty years following her death, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department reopened the Natalie Wood case on Nov. 17, 2011, claiming officials received credible new information. The original investigation concluded that Wood, 43, accidentally drowned while yachting off the coast of California with husband Robert Wagner and their guest Christopher Walken. But the boat's captain Dennis Davern claims he heard the Oscar-nominated actress fighting on the deck with Wagner. Shortly thereafter, no one could locate Wood. Davern claims Wagner impeded their search for Wood by refusing to turn on lights or call for help. Wood's body was found the morning of Nov. 29, 1981 on Santa Catalina island, about a mile from the yacht. Anna Nicole Smith, the rags-to-riches Playboy Playmate, was 26 years old when she married 89-year-old wheelchair-bound oil tycoon J. Howard Marshall. For years, she was a tabloid sensation and a realty TV star. After Marshall's death, a lengthy court battle over Marshall's inheritance proved more lurid, draining and outlandish than any Hollywood script, eventually reaching the Supreme Court in September 2010 -- not that Smith would live to see its outcome. On Sept. 7, 2006, while on vacation in the Bahamas, Smith gave birth to her daughter Dannielynn. Three days later, Smith's 20-year-old son Daniel Smith died in the same hospital, allegedly from a prescription drug overdose. Soon after, a distraught Smith married long-time friend and lawyer (and listed father on daughter Dannielynn's birth certificate) Howard K. Stern. Five months later, Smith was found dead in a Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Florido from a lethal \\"combined drug intoxication.\\" Kurt Cobain was found dead in his Seattle home on April 5, 1994, and though officially ruled a suicide there are those who believe he was murdered. Conspiracy theorists say he was murdered claiming that too much heroin in his system be able to function and turn a shotgun on himself, and point to the fact that there were no \\"legible\\" fingerprints on the gun, believing it may have been wiped clean. Immortalized by friend P. Diddy's 2009 biopic, \\"Notorious,\\" Biggie Smalls, née Christopher George Latore Wallace, dominated a rapidly growing hip-hop scene in the early '90s and blew through the roof with hits like \\"Juicy\\" and \\"Big Poppa.\\" He also found himself at the center of an increasingly tense bi-coastal rivalry that pitted Tupac Shakur on the West Coast against Wallace, Sean Combs (later P. Diddy) and Uptown Records' founder Andrew Harrel on the East Coast. Wallace was shot in the chest four times early in the morning on March 9,1997, when a black Chevrolet Impala SS pulled up to Wallace's car in Los Angeles and its driver shot through the window. Wallace was pronounced dead a short while later at the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center; many consider his death an act of revenge for the mysterious killing of Shakur in 1996 . Wallace's murder case remains unsolved. Silent film star Roscoe \\"Fatty\\" Arbuckle became one of the most famous men in America throughout the 1910s, starring in 37 films with everyone from Charlie Chaplin to Harold Lloyd and Buster Keaton. (He is credited with discovering Lloyd and Bob Hope, while also mentoring Chaplin.) In 1921, Arbuckle signed a then-record deal with Paramount worth 1 million. To celebrate, he threw a party over Labor Day at the St. Francis Hotel in San Francisco. An actress named Virgina Rappe became ill at the party; she died four days later, and Arbuckle was accused of raping and accidentally killing her. Following three trials, Arbuckle was finally cleared of Rappe's death, but by then the damage had been done: his films were banned for short period of time, and he couldn't get work even after the ban lifted. Arbuckle returned in 1932 and later signed a contract with Warner Bros. to appear in feature-length comedies. \\"This is the best day of my life,\\" he was quoted as saying. Arbuckle died that night in his sleep after suffering a heart attack; he was 46. As for Rappe, she died from a ruptured bladder, which may have been caused from a botched abortion she had days before the Labor Day party. On July 20, 1973, martial arts star Bruce Lee, 32, died as the result of an apparent allergic reaction to Equagesic, a painkiller. According to the coroner's report, Lee died \\"by misadventure.\\" He did suffer from seizures -- one happening just a month before his death -- but popular urban legends persist that Lee was murdered by triads, a curse on his family and/or the delayed reaction from Dim Mak strike (called the \\"Touch of Death\\"). While no one will dispute that bombshell Jayne Mansfield's death on June 29, 1967 was from anything other than a car accident, she's still the subject of a particularly gory urban legend. It's long been rumored that the actress was decapitated, but that wasn't the case according to the police report. It seems that a widely-circulated photo of the accident scene with the actress' wig lying outside the car may have misled some into believing otherwise. Known as \\"The Father of the Western,\\" Thomas Ince was a famed silent film actor, producer, writer and director in the 1910s and early 1920s. On Nov. 15, 1924, on the yacht of William Randolph Hearst, Ince fell ill and was returned to shore. He succumbed to heart failure, on Nov. 19, but in the newspaper that evening it was reported that Ince was shot on Hearst's yacht. So, what possibly happened? In one version of events, Hearst allegedly walked in on Marion Davies -- whom he was in love with -- and Charlie Chaplin in a compromising position. During the ensuing struggle, Ince arrived and was accidentally shot. Another theory posits that Hearst shot Ince thinking he was Chaplin. The Peter Bogdanovich-directed film 'The Cat's Meow' with Kirsten Dunst focused on Ince's mysterious death. Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that Ince died on Nov. 15. He died on Nov. 19. On Aug. 5, 1962, 36-year-old Marilyn Monroe was found dead in her home, after overdosing on barbiturates. The coroner's report listed Monroe's death as probable suicide, but many -- including the first LAPD officer to the scene -- believe she was murdered. But skeptics say there was no trace of drugs in Monroe's stomach, meaning she didn't swallow the drugs. They also say she was covered in bruises, including a major one on her hip. The toxicologist on the case wanted to examine her to understand how the drugs got into her system, but the initial examination destroyed organs. Another suspicious sign was revealed that Monroe had enough chemicals in her system to kill 10 people, but intravenous injection was ruled out by examiners. At the time of her death, Monroe was allegedly involved in a relationship with John F. Kennedy, and perhaps his brother, Robert. FBI files released in 2006 showed that Monroe was considered a security risk after cavorting with known communists during a vacation in Mexico. In 1951, George Reeves became Superman on television. It was the biggest role of his career, and the one that sank it as well: Reeves could never escape the shadow of playing Superman -- he was reportedly cut out of 'From Here to Eternity' after test audiences shouted, \\"There's Superman!\\" at the screen -- and, on June 16, 1959, killed himself because of depression over his career. Or maybe he didn't. While the official cause of death is suicide -- Reeves was found laying naked on his bed, face up, with a gun between his feet on the floor -- many believe he was the victim of an accidental shooting or murder. It was rumored that George's former girlfriend, Toni Mannix, ordered a hit on him after he broke up with her. Mannix died from Alzheimer's disease in 1983, but in 1999, Los Angeles publicist Edward Lozzi said that Mannix confessed to him that she told a priest she was responsible for Reeves's murder. In 2006, a film about Reeves life and death called 'Hollywoodland' was released. Ben Affleck played the doomed Superman Between 1926 and 1935, Thelma Todd appeared in over 120 films, including the Marx Brothers' 'Horse Feathers' and 'Monkey Business.' On Dec. 16, 1935, Todd was found dead in the garage of actress Jewel Carmen, the former wife of Todd's lover and business partner. The cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. Police found that Todd had spent the night before her death at a popular Hollywood restaurant, where she had an argument with her ex-husband; she then retreated to Carmen's home, which was a block away from a restaurant that she owned. Whether foul play was involved in the death remains up for debate. Some believe Todd was targeted for extortion, while others wonder if she was locked inside the garage by a murderer. Blood was found on her head and dress, leading some to believe she was knocked unconscious before being exposed to the gas. Complicating matters? Todd's ex-husband was murdered two years later. On June 13, 1994, Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman were found murdered at Brown Simpson's home. Evidence at the scene pointed to Nicole's ex-husband, O.J. Simpson, as the prime suspect in their murders. On June 17, 1994, Simpson, a Hall of Fame football player and actor, was set to turn himself in, but he tried to escape with friend Al Cowlings in the infamous \\"Ford Bronco Chase.\\" Simpson was eventually caught and at his trial, pleaded not guilty to killing his ex-wife and Goldman. Simpson was found not guilty of the murders on Oct. 3, 1995, but later he was found liable for the wrongful death of Ron Goldman in a civil case which forced Simpson to pay the family 33.5 million in damages. He's currently serving 33 years in prison for kidnapping and armed robbery after breaking into a Las Vegas hotel room to steal memorabilia. Simpson is eligible for parole in 2017, when he'll likely continue to search for the real killers of Nicole and Ron. Elizabeth Short, an aspiring actor, became known as Black Dahlia in 1947 after she was found murdered, her body naked and severed in two, in a vacant lot in Hollywood, California. The 'Hogan's Hero' star was murdered on June 29, 1978, allegedly bludgeoned to death with what might have been a camera tripod. Crane had a voracious sexual appetite and often filmed his escapades with the help of a man named John Henry Carpenter, who police suspected in Crane's death. No charges were filed against Carpenter until 1990, but Carpenter was acquitted because of a lack of evidence. The murder remains unsolved, but authorities believe Carpenter was the killer. He died in 1998. Rapper and actor Tupac Shakur was killed on Sept. 9, 1996 in Las Vegas after attending the Mike Tyson vs. Bruce Seldon boxing match. Video surveillance from the MGM Grand showed Shakur and his entourage fighting with an alleged Crips gang member. Later, as a passenger en route to a Vegas club, Shakur was killed by a shooter in a car that pulled alongside him. No one has been charged in Shakur's death, but theories contend it had to do possibly with the fight earlier that night or a long-simmering feud with East Coast rapper Notorious B.I.G. On July 18, 1966, Bobby Fuller, who sang \\"I Fought The Law,\\" was found dead in a car parked outside his Hollywood home. An autopsy report stated that Fuller's face, chest, and side were covered in hemorrhages likely caused by gasoline vapors and heat. The coroner checked \\"accident\\" and \\"suicide\\" as causes of death. Those checks, however, were accompanied by question marks, leading some to believe that Fuller was actually murdered. B-movie actress Lana Clarkson was killed by Phil Spector in the music producer's California mansion on Feb. 3, 2003. They had met in the House of Blues earlier that night and Clarkson was killed by a gunshot to the face. Spector denied the murder charges, claiming her death was accidental and that she had \\"kissed the gun.\\" A judge declared a mistrial when a jury couldn't reach a verdict, but another jury found Spector guilty of second-degree murder in 2009. He was sentenced to 19 years in prison. On June 4, 2009, David Carradine was found dead in a hotel room in central Bangkok, Thailand, where he was shooting his latest film \\"Stretch.\\" Speculation pointed to death by suicide, given that police found Carradine naked and hanging by a rope in the room's closet. However, two autopsies later claimed that the death was not a suicide, leading many to accept the theory that Carradine died from accidental suffocation during autoerotic asphyxiation, a pleasure that his ex-wives claimed he enjoyed. Grace Kelly was an American movie star who married Monaco's Prince Rainier III in 1956, raising her profile as she became a royal. She died in 1982 while driving with her daughter in France, apparently suffering a stroke while in the driver seat on a mountainous road. Her daughter survived, but suffered serious injuries. On March 31, 1993, Brandon Lee died after being shot by actor Michael Massee on the set of his latest film, \\"The Crow.\\" The fatal wound, which struck Lee's abdomen, was fired from a gun that was hastily rigged with improperly constructed dummy rounds and used without approval from the film's hired weapons coordinator, who had been dismissed early that night. The death was ruled accidental and no charges were filed. English musician Kirsty MacColl, well-known for writing hits in the 1980s like \\"They Don't Know\\" for Tracy Ullman, died at age 41 in a Mexican boating accident on Dec. 18, 2000. While diving at a reef near Cozumel, a speedboat zipped through waters towards her sons. In an effort to save them, MacColl was hit by the boat and nearly cut in half by the propeller. The boat that killed her was owned by Mexican supermarket mogul Guillermo González Nova, who was on board with family and a crew member José Cen Yam. Cen Yam claimed he piloted the boat, leading to a conviction and small fine. But MacColl's boyfriend said Nove was at the helm and critics believe Cen Yam took the fall for the wealthy patriarch. Actor Jon-Erik Hexum's cause of death is no mystery, but it's certainly one of the most peculiar in Hollywood history. The actor died on Oct. 18, 1984 when he accidentally took his own life on set of the NBC show \\"Cover Up.\\" While on break the actor was playing around with a prop gun that had been loaded with blanks and he jokingly put the barrel to his head and then fired. The actor apparently didn't realize that blanks use paper or plastic wadding to seal gunpowder into the cartridge, and can be dangerous when fired at close range. Hexum's injuries ultimately left him brain-dead. Eighties teen heartthrob Corey Haim passed away unexpectedly at the age of 39 in the spring of 2010. The actor -- whose Hollywood career as a youngster included roles in films like \\"Lost Boys\\" and \\"License to Drive\\" -- had publicly struggled with prescription drug abuse and made news when he claimed he had been sexually abused at age 14 by an acquaintance of his then-best friend Corey Feldman. Haim got attention again in 2008 when he ran an advertisement in VARIETY stating he was ready to work and was serious about a comeback. But Haim became destitute and increasingly troubled. In March 2010, his mother called the police in a frantic message that leaked online: \\"Oh my God. I think my son is dead\\" before administering CPR. Haim's death was later said to be due to pneumonia and a lethal cocktail of prescription drugs. In 1984, the comedy world lost one of it's finest entertainers -- or at least they think they did. Known for his elaborate stunts and ability to toy with an audience's emotions, Andy Kaufman and his death were surrounded by mystery as the 35-year-old star passed away from an undisclosed illness. Kaufman claimed that if he were to fake his own death, he would return 20 years later, which would have been in 2004. The presence of multiple anti-anxiety medications and the general anesthetic Propofol in Jackson's system prompted a murder investigation into the pop icon's June 25, 2009 death. While some say that Jackson was heavily addicted to the pain medicines, a court convicted Jackson's personal physician, Conrad Murray, of involuntary manslaughter on Nov. 7, 2011, for administering the lethal dose. On April 4, 1958, underworld bodyguard Johnny Stompanato was stabbed to death outside the Beverly Hills home of his girlfriend actress Lana Turner. While Cheryl Craine, Turner's then teenage daughter, claimed that she stabbed \\"Handsome Harry\\" while defending her mother, skeptics have argued that it was in fact Turner who killed Stompanato, only to place the blame on her daughter who she knew would face minimal consequences. Heath Ledger, 28, passed away on a chilly January afternoon in 2008, having just completed filming the role of a lifetime -- his brilliant turn as The Joker in Christopher Nolan's \\"The Dark Knight\\" -- vaulting his career to new heights. Just two years after his Oscar-nominated performance in \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" Ledger's body was found naked and not breathing by his masseuse. His death was deemed accidental by the Chief Medical Examiner of New York. They wrote in a statement: \\"We have concluded that the manner of his death is accident, resulting from the abuse of prescription medications.\\" On May 4, 2001, after enjoying an Italian dinner at Vitello's Restaurant with her celebrity husband, Robert Blake, Bonnie Lee Bakley was shot in the head while seated in a car around the corner from the eatery. Blake, the star of TV's \\"Baretta\\" in the 1970s, claimed that when the shots were fired he was retrieving his own gun from the restaurant, which he carried for protection. The gun he admitted carrying didn't match the bullet that killed Bakley, but critics contended he hired a hit man to blast her. Blake was acquitted of his wife's murder in 2005, but was later found responsible in a civil case for causing her death. His defense team suggested many people wanted to Bakley dead, including Marlon Brando's son. Bakley was on probation for fraud when she married Blake. On Nov. 22, 1997, Australian musician and actor Michael Hutchence was discovered dead in Room 524 of Double Bay, Sydney's Ritz-Carlton hotel. A coroner who found alcohol and drugs later determined the incident to be death by suicide, but years later, Hutchence's partner at the time of his death, Paula Yates, came out claiming his death was possibly an accidental suffocation brought on by autoerotic asphyxiation. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Thelma Todd was a popular actress in the late 1920s and early 1930s.

Step 2: Look for specific requirements or restrictions I would carefully check for any specific requirements, restrictions, or exceptions that may apply to students transferring between state and CBSE boards, particularly during the 11th and 12th grades. Step 3: Compare the two questions I would analyze the wording and context of the two questions to determine if they mean the same thing or not. Step 4: Provide the answers Once I have all the necessary information, I would provide the user with answers to their questions. Answers: 1. Transferring from state board to CBSE board in 11th and 12th grade largely depends on the CBSE board's policies and the specific requirements for students transferring from a state board. Generally, students may transfer to CBSE board in 11th grade after completing 10th in a state board, provided they fulfill certain criteria like passing the 10th standard exams and submitting the required documents within a specific period. 2. Changing the board from 11th state to 12th CBSE is typically not recommended, as it could create difficulty for students to adapt to the change in curricula and examination patterns between two different boards within a short period. However, it may be possible to do so if there are exceptional circumstances and the proper documentation is provided. 3. The two questions do not have the exact same meaning. The first question asks whether the student can transfer to the CBSE board for both 11th and 12th grades after completing 10th grade in the state board. The second question asks if the student can switch to the CBSE board for only 12th grade after studying 11th grade in the state board. Although related, the specific time frame in which the transfer occurs makes the questions differ in meaning. Option for the third question: b. yes"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jason Granger, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Police in the city of Perris responded at around 11:20 a.m. to reports of an air emergency at the popular skydiving site of Perris Valley airport. They arrived to find Granger, an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers, suffering serious injuries after a parachuting accident. Tragic: Jason Granger, pictured with his family, from Yuma, Arizona, was killed just before noon on Friday after he made a hard landing, according to the coroner's report. Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. Perris Valley Skydiving general manager Dan Brodsky-Chenfeld told the Press Enterprise the man was coming in for a landing when he made a turn at low altitude. Such turns increase a jumper's speed and are prohibited below 300 feet at that drop zone for that reason, Brodsky-Chenfeld said. He said he didn't know Granger's elevation when he turned, but it was very low. Injuries: Granger, pictured left and right, was an Army skydiver who trained other jumpers. Sad: Paramedics rushed the man to Menifee Valley Medical Center, where he was pronounced dead at 12:17 p.m. 'We're not sure why he made that turn,' Brodsky-Chenfeld told the newspaper. He added that the cause of the crash had nothing to do with equipment failure, weather conditions or collisions. The man was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said. Brodsky-Chenfeld said he had brought a family member to Perris Valley on Friday but in the fatal fall hew as jumping alone. Army man: Granger, pictured with his sons, was jumping by himself, not with the military, and was not training any other jumpers at the time, he said. Dangerous: There have been at least 15 deaths at the Perris Valley Airport skydiving facility, pictured, in the past 13 years. The man's identity and further details on the accident were released Saturday. There have been at least 15 deaths at the Perris Valley Airport skydiving facility in the past 13 years, according to the Press-Enterprise. Though after a rash of major accidents in 2011 and 2012, it has been a mostly quiet year for skydiving injuries at the national mecca for the sport about 75 miles southeast of Los Angeles. A U.S. Marine died in an accident near the same airport in February. A 62-year-old skydiver died in Lake Elsinore in May. He was part of a group of skydivers who were attempting a multiple-person maneuver when he became entangled in a parachute and was unable to free himself.

The youngest Guantanamo prisoner, Khadr, who was a 15-year-old fighting in Afghanistan when captured in 2002, was sent to finish his sentence in his native Canada on September 29, 2012, Canadian media reported. A courtroom sketch shows defendant Omar Khadr, a native of Toronto, Canada, listening to testimony during his sentencing hearing at the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, in this sketch from October 26, 2010. In this photo of a sketch by courtroom artist Janet Hamlin, Canadian defendant Omar Khadr attends a hearing in the courthouse for the U.S. military war crimes commission at the Camp Justice compound on Guantanamo Bay U.S. Naval Base in Cuba, April 28, 2010. WINNIPEG, Manitoba (Reuters) - The youngest prisoner and last Westerner held in the Guantanamo military base, Omar Khadr, was sent to finish his sentence in his native Canada on Saturday, the Canadian government said. Canadian Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said that Khadr, who was a 15-year-old fighting in Afghanistan when captured in 2002, had been flown from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, to a military base in Trenton, Ontario and transferred to the province's Millhaven maximum-security prison. Khadr's case has been controversial both in Canada and abroad given his age when he was captured, the nature of his detention and hearing, and the reluctance of Canadian officials to accept his return. \\"I am satisfied the Correctional Service of Canada can administer Omar Khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of Canadians is protected during incarceration,\\" Toews said in Winnipeg, Manitoba. A U.S. war crimes tribunal in 2010 sentenced Khadr, now 26, to 40 years in prison, although he was expected to serve just a few more years under a deal that included his admission he was an al Qaeda conspirator who murdered a U.S. soldier. Khadr pleaded guilty in 2010 to charges that included murdering American Army medic Christopher Speer with a grenade in a 2002 firefight, conspiring with al Qaeda to commit terrorist acts, making roadside bombs to target U.S. troops in Afghanistan, spying on American military convoys and providing material support for terrorism. Khadr was the first person since World War Two to be prosecuted in a war crimes tribunal for acts committed as a juvenile. He was the youngest prisoner still at Guantanamo, but younger boys were previously held there. Canadian-born Khadr was taken to Afghanistan by his father, a senior al Qaeda member who apprenticed the boy to a group of bomb makers who opened fire when U.S. troops came to their compound. Khadr was captured in the firefight, during which he was blinded in one eye and shot twice in the back. HAPPY TO BE HOME \\"He's finding it hard to believe that this has finally happened,\\" said John Norris, one of Khadr's lawyers, according to a Canadian Press report. \\"His spirits are good. He is very, very happy to be home.\\" In a written statement, Toews said Canada received Khadr's application for transfer from the United States on April 13, 2012. He said U.S. officials assured Canada it would receive a videotape copy of an interview with Khadr, but it, along with other videotapes of interviews and unedited reports, was not sent until this month. Former Canadian ambassador Gar Pardy, however, said Canada's Conservative government, which cultivates an image of being tough on crime, dragged out the transfer. \\"I think the government was mainly very mean-spirited in how it handled the case,\\" Pardy said to CTV News. The Canadian Supreme Court ruled in 2010 that Canada breached Khadr's rights by sending intelligence agents to interrogate him in Guantanamo Bay in 2003 and 2004 and sharing the results with the United States. Khadr's continuing detention meant his rights were still being infringed, the judges ruled. The top court also said that Canada was not obliged to repatriate him, however. Toews said he remains concerned that Khadr \\"idealizes\\" his father and denies Ahmed Khadr's association with al Qaeda. The Canadian public safety minister said he is also troubled by how \\"radicalized\\" Khadr has become from his time in Afghanistan, Pakistan and Guantanamo Bay. The U.S. Department of Defense confirmed that it transferred Khadr to Canada, leaving 166 detainees at Guantanamo. In the 2008 presidential election campaign, President Barack Obama promised to close the Guantanamo prison during his term, but that pledge has gone unfulfilled amid security concerns among Americans and opposition from Congress, which enacted laws making it more difficult to transfer prisoners from Guantanamo. The transfer represents progress, but the Guantanamo prison should close immediately, said Suzanne Nossel, Amnesty International USA's executive director. Canadian authorities should also investigate Khadr's allegations of torture while in the prison, she said. \\"Canada now has the chance to right some of these wrongs.\\" Khadr's sentence will expire on October 30, 2018. (Additional reporting by Jeffrey Hodgson in Toronto and Jane Sutton in Miami; Editing by Bill Trott and Sandra Maler) ||||| OTTAWA - After a slew of court challenges demanding his homecoming and a decade in Guantanamo Bay, convicted terrorist Omar Khadr is back in Canada. Khadr landed at CFB Trenton military base Saturday morning after being transported from Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, aboard a U.S. government plane and was then brought to Millhaven maximum-security prison in Bath, Ont. In a hastily organized news conference in Winnipeg, Public Safety Minister Vic Toews said Khadr is now in the hands of Canada's correctional services, which he is satisfied it can “administer Omar Khadr's sentence in a manner which recognizes the serious nature of the crimes that he has committed and ensure the safety of Canadians is protected during incarceration.” The 26-year-old Toronto-native struck a plea deal in 2010 that saw him sentenced to eight years in prison for five war crimes, including killing U.S. special forces medic Christopher Speer 10 years ago in an Afghan firefight. He was captured in 2002 when he was 15. Despite green-lighting the repatriation, Toews expressed several concerns about the case to the media Saturday. These included that Khadr has \\"had very little contact with Canadian society and therefore will require substantial management in order to ensure safe reintegration\\" and that he has \\"participated in terrorist training, military operations, and meetings involving al-Qaida leadership.\\" Brydie Bethell, one of Khadr's Canadian lawyers, said her client is relieved to be back on Canadian soil, and described him as being “in a state of disbelief and really pinching himself wondering when he's going to wake up from this dream.” “This is someone the correctional authorities will think is a miracle. He's the kind of prisoner they hope everyone would be,” she added. His advocates — many who maintain he was a child soldier at the time of his capture — were cheering his return Saturday. They included Amnesty International Canada and the federal New Democrats and Liberals — though the Grits didn't push for his repatriation when they were in power before 2006. Ottawa could be on the hook for multi-million dollar payout after the Supreme Court ruled in 2010 Khadr's charter rights were violated during his time in U.S. custody. A Canadian citizen and the last Western detainee held at Guantanamo Bay, Khadr had been petitioning the Canadian government for his return since as early as 2005. As per a diplomatic agreement signed between the U.S. and Canada in 2010 regarding Khadr's repatriation, his personal transfer application landed on Toews' desk in March 2011 and the minister received the formal U.S. application in April. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Omar Khadr, who was the youngest prisoner at Guantanamo military base, has been sent to Canada to finish his time in jail. He was only 15 years old when he was captured while fighting in Afghanistan in 2002. Many people had different opinions about his case because he was so young when he was caught, and also because of how he was treated in jail.

Term limits, Sanders said, are something Trump \\"supports here in the United States, but that's a decision that would be up to China.\\" The Chinese Communist Party proposed removing the presidential two-term limit from China's constitution, state media reported Sunday. The move would be a further consolidation of power for Xi, who is already seen as one of China's most powerful leaders in decades. On Monday, U.S. President Donald Trump praised Xi, saying he has a \\"very good relationship\\" and \\"great respect\\" for the Chinese leader. \\"I think that President Xi is unique. He's helping us with North Korea,\\" Trump said during a White House meeting with U.S. governors. Trump has not specifically addressed the issue of China removing term limits. To some, Sanders' comments are the latest evidence of a break in the long-standing U.S. tradition of encouraging democracy in China, and reflect an unwillingness to criticize undemocratic regimes. \\"In effect, she is saying that the U.S. is OK with Xi Jinping simply asserting that he will remain in power indefinitely,\\" said Sophie Richardson, China director at Human Rights Watch. \\"Does she realize China isn't a democracy?\\" During the presidential campaign, Trump regularly slammed China and its trade policies. But since becoming president, Trump has toned down the criticism. Instead, Trump has prioritized working with China to address North Korea's nuclear and ballistic missile programs. However, several reports suggest the White House could soon announce trade decisions, such as tariffs on Chinese imports, that could strain the U.S.-China relationship.

Given a command in a limited form of natural language, provide the correct sequence of actions that executes the command to thus navigate an agent in its environment. A command can be broken down into many different actions. Actions are uppercase and are individual steps that serve as the building blocks for a command. For commands, 'left' and 'right' are used to denote the direction of an action. The word 'opposite' turns the agent backward in the specified direction. The word 'around' makes the agent execute an action while turning around in the specified direction. The word 'and' means to execute the next scope of the command following the previous scope of the command. The word 'after' signifies to execute the previous scope of the command following the next scope of the command. The words 'twice' and 'thrice' trigger repetition of a command that they scope over two times or three times, respectively.

Options: - forest - library - woods - black lagoon - zoo Explain why a human would choose \\"zoo\\" to answer the question above: A:","completion":"First, I would analyze the question, which is asking about places where many different creatures can be easily seen by people, even in a city setting. The next step is to carefully review each of the options presented: - forest - library - woods - black lagoon - zoo Among the choices given, the forest and the woods are habitats where one would expect to see many different creatures, but these are natural environments and are not typically located within a city where the creatures would be easily visible to people. The black lagoon might evoke thoughts of aquatic creatures, but again, such habitats don't usually exist in city settings. When it comes to the library, while it's a common city establishment, it's not a place designed to house or display creatures. Finally, examining the \\"zoo\\" option, it becomes clear why this would be the correct answer. Zoos exist in many cities, making it feasible for people to see a variety of creatures there. The main purpose of a zoo is to house and display a myriad of animals to the public for educational and conservational purposes.

The period of adolescence is most closely associated with the teenage years, though its physical, psychological and cultural expressions may begin earlier and end later.

Physical growth, as distinct from puberty (particularly in males), and cognitive development generally seen in adolescence, can also extend into the early twenties.

Movie title: Kissing Jessica Stein Context: Twenty-eight-year-old Jessica Stein, a copyeditor living and working in New York City, is plagued by failed blind dates with men, and decides to answer a newspaper's personal advertisement containing a quote from Rilke that she had read and admired earlier. The advertisement has been placed by Helen Cooper, a thirtysomething bisexual art gallerist who is seeking a lesbian relationship to replace her unsatisfying and meaningless sex with men. Given some of the men Jessica is shown to be test-dating at the start of the film, it's no surprise she'd want to fan out her prospects a little. As nervous as Jessica is about dating Helen, she realizes after a surprise kiss that a different experience can be good. Through the early part of their relationship, Jessica finds in Helen everything she'd dreamed of finding in a man. They are compatible, they like many of the same things, and they are caring for one another. Even when Helen gets sickâwhich she says earlier in the film never happens to herâJessica is there to care for her. The only predicament for the relationship is Jessica's nervousness concerning same-sex intimacy. Over the early weeks of their relationship, she and Helen slowly work on building up her confidence in this area by gradually extended make-out sessions. Eventually, they graduate to full intimacy, which is initiated by Jessica during an over night stay at her parents' home in Scarsdale. In spite of Jessica's happiness with Helen, she keeps the relationship secret. Jessica's secrecy means that she has to endure scenes that would not happen had she been open about the two of them. One example occurs during a dinner to celebrate her brother's engagement. Her mother had invited an IBM executive in hopes of setting him up with Jessica. Helen and Jessica later get into a quarrel about Jessica's refusal to inform her family of their relationship, resulting in an apparent breakup. It isn't until later, as her brother's wedding approaches, that her mother figures out that they are dating. Her mother...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The New York Times The reason for this disappointing outcome, in his view, is that natural selection has been far more efficient than many researchers expected at screening out disease-causing variants. The common disease/common variant idea is largely wrong. What has happened is that a multitude of rare variants lie at the root of most common diseases, being rigorously pruned away as soon as any starts to become widespread. It takes large, expensive trials with hundreds of patients in different countries to find even common variants behind a disease. Rare variants lie beyond present reach. “It’s an astounding thing,” Dr. Goldstein said, “that we have cracked open the human genome and can look at the entire complement of common genetic variants, and what do we find? Almost nothing. That is absolutely beyond belief.” If rare variants account for most of the genetic burden of disease, then the idea of decoding everyone’s genome to see to what diseases they are vulnerable to will not work, at least not in the form envisaged. “I don’t believe we should do more and more genomewide association studies for common diseases,” Dr. Goldstein said. Instead, he suggested, the “missing heritability” might be tracked by thoroughly studying the genome of specific patients. Researchers hunting for disease genes strongly disagree. They say genomewide association studies with larger numbers of patients will bring more disease-promoting variants to light. Dr. Kari Stefansson, chief executive of the Icelandic gene-hunting company Decode Genetics, says it does not matter whether disease-causing variants are common or rare as long as they yield insights into the biochemical pathways by which disease develops, and which will provide targets for drugs. The HapMap project was started amid much skepticism but has proved a technical success, even if it has brought to light fewer common disease variants than hoped. “There is no doubt it has succeeded far beyond what some skeptics proposed,” said Dr. David Altshuler, an architect of the HapMap at the Harvard Medical School. He defends the common disease/common variant hypothesis, saying it meant only that some, not all, of the genetic burden of a disease would be conveyed by common variants. And the genomewide association study, currently the gold standard of gene discovery, is in his view only one step along the road. Dr. Goldstein does not shy away from unpopular positions or research. In a new book, “Jacob’s Legacy” (Yale University Press), he recounts how he delved into the genetic history of Jews. Given the abuses of the past, geneticists approach with caution research in the genetics of racial or ethnic groups. But genetics can provide powerful insights into history. Because some Jewish communities, for instance, have for centuries married only within their religion, they have developed certain distinctive genetic profiles. One is a genetic signature on the Y chromosome of the hereditary Jewish priests known as cohens. Dr. Goldstein, as he describes in his book, found a set of DNA variations in the signature that allowed him to estimate when that signature first appeared — about 3,000 years ago. The date fit nicely with the presumed date of King Solomon’s reign and supported the claim that cohens were indeed descended from a high priest of around that time, even if that priest may not have been Aaron, as tradition holds. He gleaned an even deeper insight into Jewish origins from analysis of mitochondrial DNA taken from Jewish communities around the world. In 2000, a team led by Dr. Michael Hammer of the University of Arizona found that men from Jewish communities all carry a certain lineage of Y chromosomes, one that is shared by many Near Eastern peoples. That established the origin of the founding fathers of Jewish communities, but where did the founding mothers come from? Two years later, a team led by Dr. Goldstein provided the surprising answer: the mitochondrial DNA of many Jewish communities looks as if it was derived, a long time ago, from the population of the host community. Jewish communities may therefore have been founded by Jewish men, arriving perhaps as traders, who took local wives, converted them to Judaism, and thereafter married only within the religion. Dr. Goldstein had never been bar mitzvahed and had taken little interest in his Jewish heritage until as a graduate student at Stanford during the Persian Gulf war he was moved by the plight of Israeli civilians being bombarded by Saddam Hussein’s Scud missiles. After gaining his Ph.D. in 1994, he moved to England, to Oxford University and University College, London He later took an appointment at Duke, where he has focused on pharmacogenetics, the interaction between drugs and the genome. He has laid aside, at least for the moment, further research into Jewish genetic history. Another pursuit that interests him, one of high promise for reconstructing human evolutionary history, is that of discovering which genes bear the mark of recent natural selection. When a new version of a gene becomes more common, it leaves a pattern of changes that geneticists can detect with various statistical tests. Many of these selected genes reflect new diets or defenses against disease or adaptations to new climates. But they tend to differ from one race to another because each human population, after the dispersal from Africa some 50,000 years ago, has had to adapt to different circumstances. This newish finding has raised fears that other, more significant differences might emerge among races, spurring a resurrection of racist doctrines. “There is a part of the scientific community which is trying to make this work off limits, and that I think is hugely counterproductive,” Dr. Goldstein said. He says he thinks that no significant genetic differences will be found between races because of his belief in the efficiency of natural selection. Just as selection turns out to have pruned away most disease-causing variants, it has also maximized human cognitive capacities because these are so critical to survival. “My best guess is that human intelligence was always a helpful thing in most places and times and we have all been under strong selection to be as bright as we can be,” he said. This is more than just a guess, however. As part of a project on schizophrenia, Dr. Goldstein has done a genomewide association study on 2,000 volunteers of all races who were put through cognitive tests. “We have looked at the effect of common variation on cognition, and there is nothing,” Dr. Goldstein said, meaning that he can find no common genetic variants that affect intelligence. His view is that intelligence was developed early in human evolutionary history and was then standardized. At Duke, he revels in the greater freedom to pursue his own interests. “In England, there’s a much greater tendency to be wary of something too ambitious,” he said. “The feeling in the American scientific community is one of confidence — let’s get the job done.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page F3 of the New York edition with the headline: A Dissenting Voice as the Genome Is Sifted to Fight Disease.

Experts thought that common diseases would be connected to common genetic variants, but recent discoveries show that rare genetic variants are more likely to be connected to common diseases. This means it is more difficult and expensive to find the genetic causes for these diseases. Some researchers believe that studying the genes of specific patients may help find these rare genetic variants. Additionally, Dr. Goldstein explores the genetic history of Jewish communities and how genetics can provide insight into human history and natural selection."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In 1995 the National Lottery granted money for a £4.6m sports complex, to add to Eton's existing facilities of two swimming pools, 30 cricket squares, 24 football, rugby and hockey pitches and a gym. The College paid £200,000 and contributed 4.5 hectares of land in return for exclusive use of the facilities during the daytime only. The UK Sports Council defended the deal on the grounds that the whole community would benefit, while the bursar claimed that Windsor, Slough and Eton Athletic Club was \\"deprived\\" because local people (who were not pupils at the College) did not have a world-class running track and facilities to train with.

Use the following highlights to write an article: TV chef signs letter claiming use of athletes in commercials sends wrong message to children. Beckham promotes Pepsi and Lineker appears in Walkers crisps commercials. Others who have signed letter include Dr Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.","completion":"Title: Celebrity Endorsements of Unhealthy Foods: An Urgent Call for Change Introduction: High-profile athletes and public figures, such as David Beckham and Gary Lineker, have come under increasing scrutiny for their endorsements of unhealthy food and beverage products, as a recent letter by TV chef Jamie Oliver, among others, highlights the negative impact that such marketing tactics have on children and their overall health. In an open letter, health experts, chefs, and public figures alike have voiced their concerns over the implications of the commercial use of athletes in promoting unwholesome products for children. The Problem with Athlete Endorsements: The letter criticizing the use of renowned athletes, including David Beckham promoting Pepsi and Gary Lineker appearing in Walkers crisps commercials, expresses a strong disapproval of such practices, believing that it sends the wrong message to children. The concern is rooted in the fact that children tend to look up to these celebrity athletes, who are seen as role models. If their idols endorse unhealthy food choices, children are more likely to accept, and even demand, these products - consequently leading to poor eating habits and potential health issues at a young age. Supporters of the Open Letter: Dr. Hilary Cass, the president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health (RCPCH), has also put her name to the letter. As an expert in the field of child health, Dr. Cass's endorsement of the letter reflects the increasing impetus to reconsider the ethical implications of using celebrity endorsements that could adversely impact young minds. Other notable figures who have supported this call for change include Michelin-star chef, Tom Kerridge, and child health expert, Dr. Sarah Jarvis. The Need for Responsible Marketing: The involvement of celebrities endorsing products that may directly or indirectly harm children's health highlights a significant problem - dishonest advertising. This unethical approach may not only result in the misinterpretation of a product's health benefits but also validates the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages among the younger demographics. By calling out these marketing tactics, the open letter seeks to raise awareness and push for a change that emphasizes responsible marketing moving forward. Possible Solutions: To address the negative consequences of these unethical marketing practices, the open letter suggests various approaches that can be adopted: 1. Cease partnerships with athletes and celebrities: Brands and companies must reconsider teaming up with athletes and other public figures who appeal to children, mitigating the risk of promoting unhealthy products with a familiar, lovable face. 2. Encourage healthy role models: Instead of endorsing unhealthy products, athletes must set a positive example by promoting healthier alternatives. In turn, this would create healthier behaviors among children who look up to these role models. 3. Implement stricter advertisement regulations: Governments and regulatory bodies can establish robust guidelines and restrictions to ensure that environments where children are exposed (such as schools, television networks, and online platforms) are more tightly regulated in terms of promotional content. Conclusion: The recent open letter criticizing the use of athletes in commercials for unhealthy food products brings to light a critical issue - the need for conscientious marketing practices that prioritize children's health and well-being. By ceasing partnerships with athletes endorsing unhealthy products, promoting effective role models, and implementing stricter advertisement regulations, society can work towards providing a healthier and safer environment for the overall growth and development of children. As responsible global citizens, it is imperative for each one of us to advocate and support such positive initiatives that will lead to a more sustainable future."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: -gaseous iron. -martian iron. -carbon. -elemental iron. Given those answer options, answer the question: Q: Hydrogen gas is generated by the reaction of nitric acid and what else? A: A:","completion":"To answer the question, let's analyze the given answer options step-by-step: 1. Gaseous iron: Iron in the gaseous form would not typically react with nitric acid to produce hydrogen gas. The reaction of nitric acid with iron would produce iron nitrate and hydrogen gas, but gaseous iron is not a common reactant in this case. 2. Martian iron: Martian iron generally refers to the iron found on Mars. There is no specific property of \\"Martian iron\\" that would make it react differently with nitric acid compared to elemental iron. Therefore, considering it as a separate option from elemental iron does not make sense. 3. Carbon: Carbon does not typically react with nitric acid to produce hydrogen gas. In fact, nitric acid is an oxidizing agent, and it could potentially oxidize carbon, leading to carbon dioxide and water, but not to hydrogen gas. 4. Elemental iron: Elemental iron (Fe) reacts with nitric acid (HNO₃) to produce hydrogen gas (H₂) and iron nitrate (Fe(NO₃)₃). The reaction can be represented by the following balanced chemical equation: Fe (s) + 6 HNO₃ (aq) → 3 H₂ (g) + Fe(NO₃)₃ (aq) Hence the answer is elemental iron.

As anyone who has experienced occasional — or even chronic — constipation can tell you, it can really put a damper on quality of life and well-being. Constipation can also cause more substantial problems, such as: * Severe abdominal pain, which can lead to emergency room visits * Hemorrhoids, which can bleed or be painful * Increased irritability, agitation, or even aggression, in people with Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia * Stress and/or pain that can contribute to delirium (a state of new or worse confusion that often happens when older adults are hospitalized) * Fecal incontinence, which can be caused or worsened by having a hard lump of stool lodged in the lower bowel * Avoidance of needed pain medication, due to fear of constipation Fortunately, it’s usually possible to help older adults effectively manage and prevent constipation. This helps maintain well-being and quality of life, and can also improve difficult behaviors related to dementia. The trouble is that constipation is often either overlooked or sub-optimally managed by busy healthcare providers who aren’t trained in geriatrics. They are often focused on more “serious” health issues. Also, since many laxatives are available over-the-counter, some providers may assume that people will treat themselves if necessary. Personally, I don’t like this hands-off approach to constipation. Although several useful laxatives are indeed available over-the-counter (OTC), I’ve found that the average person doesn’t know enough to correctly choose among them. Also, although in geriatrics we often do end up recommending or prescribing laxatives, it’s vital to start by figuring out what is likely to be causing — or worsening — an older person’s constipation. For instance, many medications can make constipation worse, so we usually make an attempt to identify and perhaps deprescribe those. In short, if you’re an older adult, or if you’re helping an older... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question.

Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren’t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don’t like needles. Or maybe they aren’t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer “stronger” versions, designed for older adults? I’m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it’s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC’s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I’m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I’m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you’ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I’ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns.

The conversation soon turned to complaining about the stress in work and life. Offering his guests coffee, the professor went to the kitchen and returned with a large pot of coffee and many cups-china , plastic and glass, some plain looking, some expensive and some lovely. The professor told them to help themselves to the coffee. When all the students had a cup of coffee in hand, the professor said, \\"Can you notice all the nice looking expensive cups were taken, leaving behind the plain and cheap ones? While it is normal for you to want only the best for yourselves, that is the source of your problems and stress.\\" \\"What all of you really wanted was coffee, not the cup, but you went for the best cups and were eyeing each other's cups.\\" \\"Now think about this: life is the coffee, and the jobs, money and position in society are the cups.

The old professor provided his former students with a variety of cups that differed in price, material, and appearance to make a point about life and priorities. There were china, plastic, and glass cups, as well as cups that were plain-looking, expensive, and beautiful. By observing their choices and reactions, the professor effectively demonstrated that people often focus on external things, such as status, jobs, and material possessions, rather than what truly matters, which, in this analogy, is represented by the coffee.

Context: Six weeks after arriving in the United States, Hassan Abduraheem takes a seat in the back pew of Tar Wallet Baptist Church. Tucked into the woods along a country road in rural Virginia, the church holds about 50 worshippers. On this cold November Sunday, Abduraheem and his family of eight noticeably increase the congregation's size. They do their best to follow the unfamiliar English of the old Baptist hymns, which are very familiar to their new neighbors. And they share the hymns from their former home — Sudan. Standing in a single line in front of the altar, the family fills the church with Arabic song. \\"Unbelievable,\\" Abduraheem says repeatedly, as he describes his journey from a crowded prison cell in Sudan to a fixed-up house on the farm of his new pastor. \\"Unbelievable\\" seems like the only word that could describe the turn his life took, thanks to a Facebook post and a U.S. congressman. Abduraheem's work as a former pastor is not outlawed in his native Sudan, but Christians are a minority in a diverse country that has suffered through multiple civil wars. According to the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, there has been \\"an escalation in the Sudanese government's persecution of Christians,” since the 2011 secession of South Sudan. Abduraheem says his work was spreading the gospel; the Sudanese government accused him of espionage, and he was detained along with two other pastors in December 2015. \\"The first day when they took us to the prison, they beat us,” he says softly. Abduraheem was shifted from prison to prison. For five months, he wore the same clothes he was wearing when he was arrested. His eyes became damaged from the harsh prison light. Yet, despite constant interrogations, just two meals of beans a day and a tiny cell with barely enough room to sleep, he says the worst part of prison was not knowing.

AZURIX and ENRON are Corporate Sponsors for Houston Ballet's Miller Theatre performances, helping to present these free performances of Copp?lia to the people of Houston. Houston Ballet has a limited number of tickets for the seated area each night for employees of AZURIX and ENRON. These tickets are available on a first-come, first-served basis by calling William at 713-535-3235 no later than 5 PM today .

Other, free, general public tickets for the seated area (max 4 per person) are available at the Miller Theatre 11:30 a.m. - 1:00 p.m. on the day of performance; for more information call 713-284-8351 for the Miller Theatre ticket information line. Tickets are not required for the lawn area. About Coppelia Copp?lia was first performed on May 25, 1870 at the Th?atre Imp?rial de L'Op?ra, featuring choreography by Arthur Saint-L?on and music by L?o Delibes. The work maintains a special place in the history of dance, serving as a kind of bridge from the glory of the French Romantic ballet in the early nineteenth century to the masterpieces of the Russian Imperial Theater at the turn of the century. Writing in The International Dictionary of Ballet, critic Karen Dacko analyzes the unique characteristics of the piece as follows: \\"Copp?lia owes its longevity to its inspired, very danceable score. But the ballet is also remarkable for its perennial appeal and for its historical significance as Romanticism's grand finale and classical ballet's prologue.\\" Copp?lia first entered Houston Ballet' repertoire in October 1974, in a staging by Frederic Franklin (who also performed the role of Dr. Copp?lius), and featuring scenery by Peter Farmer. In November 1979, former Royal Ballet ballerina Anne Heaton re-staged the work for the company. When Houston Ballet premiered its new production of the work in March 1992 featuring breathtaking d?cor by Desmond Heeley, Carl Cunningham of The Houston Post wrote, \\"It would be hard to imagine anything to cap the joyous, gentle, and glorious looking new production of Copp?lia the splendidly prepared company of dancers and musicians put forth Thursday evening on Wortham Center's Brown Theater stage.\\" (The Houston Post, March 21, 1992) Heeley's designs for Copp?lia never fail to enchant, most notably in the second-act depiction of Dr. Copp?lius's workshop. The sampling of dolls on display pay homage to the era when automatons, or mechanical toys, were the rage in Europe -- and to Heeley's inexhaustible creativity. Among the eye-popping toys featured in the workshop are a huge astrologer with a pointed hat and a robe covered in shooting stars and moons; a strongman with a handlebar mustache and barbells; Puss n Boots; an acrobat hanging from a trapeze holding the man in the moon; and a small ballerina dancing on the back of a goat. In the first act, the vibrant reds, golds, and oranges of the costumes worn by the peasants in the village conjure up a wonderfully picturesque vision of nineteenth century Bavaria.","completion":"\\"Experience the Magic of Coppélia: Free Houston Ballet Performances at Miller Outdoor Theatre on May 11-13, Sponsored by AZURIX and ENRON!\\""},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Radar is also showing a large dry area on the east side of the eye , which one local meteorologist speculates could mean the eye is disintegrating ( it seems to be growing more diffuse , not more compact , as it comes ashore ) . You can see in the picture that the eye is starting to look like an apostrophe rather than a period . Question: What type of event is the narrator describing ?","completion":"The narrator is describing a tropical cyclone or hurricane, specifically Hurricane Ike, which was a powerful storm that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in September 2008. The storm's impact can be inferred from the mention of wind speeds, radar imagery, and the eye of the storm. The discussion of the disintegration or diffusion of the storm's eye suggests that the storm is undergoing a transformation, possibly indicating that it is weakening as it approaches land. The mention of differences between national and local news sources highlights the variability in reporting about the storm's strength and the specific conditions in the affected areas, such as Galveston Island. Tropical cyclones, or hurricanes, as they are known in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific, are massive low-pressure systems that form over warm ocean waters and bring strong winds, heavy rain, and coastal flooding to impacted regions. Hurricane Ike was a particularly destructive storm, classified as a Category 2 hurricane at its peak intensity, which caused massive devastation in the Caribbean and along the Gulf Coast of the United States, particularly in Texas and Louisiana. The mention of an \\"apostrophe\\" instead of a \\"period\\" to describe the storm's eye indicates that the storm's structure is becoming less concentric and organized. This is a crucial observation that meteorologists use when analyzing the development and potential intensity of a tropical cyclone. A well-defined eye is usually a sign of a stronger, more intense storm, while a disorganized or less distinct eye could indicate a storm that is weakening or encountering unfavorable conditions for further development. In conclusion, the narrator is describing the conditions and observations of Hurricane Ike, a powerful tropical cyclone that affected the Gulf Coast of the United States in September 2008. The focus of the discussion revolves around the wind speeds, radar imagery, and the eye of the storm, providing insight into the complex and impactful nature of such a meteorological event."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Possible A: sleep, sit down, sit on chair, have rest, lie on floor Why is \\"sleep\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? A:","completion":"\\"Sleep\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense in response to the question of what one would do if their entire body is experiencing fatigue at the end of the day for several reasons: 1. Physical Recovery: Sleep offers the body a chance to recover and repair itself after a long day's work. During sleep, the body releases growth hormones, repairs tissues, and restores energy levels, which helps alleviate and counteract feelings of fatigue. 2. Mental Restoration: Sleep is essential for cognitive function, including memory consolidation and problem-solving abilities. A good night's sleep helps the brain process and store new information, allowing the mind to be rejuvenated and ready for the next day. 3. Emotional Well-being: Sleep is crucial for maintaining overall emotional well-being. It helps reduce stress, anxiety, and irritability, which are often linked to fatigue. By getting adequate sleep, individuals can better manage their emotions and feel more energized. 4. Duration of Rest: Comparatively, sleep provides a more prolonged period of rest than merely sitting down or taking a short break. An entire night's sleep gives the body ample time to recover and replenish its resources. 5. Biological Need: Sleep is a fundamental biological need for humans. It is a natural response to fatigue, as the body has evolved to require regular periods of rest to function optimally. Sleep maintains a balance in the body's internal systems, including thermoregulation, immune function, and hormone production. In summary, \\"sleep\\" aligns with human common sense as an appropriate response to fatigue at the end of the day because it offers physical, mental, and emotional restoration, and it is a natural and necessary biological process for maintaining overall health and well-being."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Since the last time we spoke here are some of the issues discussed along with some additional recommendations. 1) Finalizing the Master ISDA Agreement with Credit Suisse First Boston (Europe) Limited. I see that the status is under Credit Review. 2) Definitions: a) Interest Payment Date- should state \\"3 business days after the Valuation Date\\" b) Reference Price- amend the phrase \\"..last regular way trade...\\" to state \\"...Official Closing Price...\\" in (i) and (ii)(b)(iii). c) Securities- Omit the reference to \\"Bonds\\". The definition should only read: \\"are the securities specified as such in the Confirmation\\". d) Valuation Date (s)- October 15, 2001, November 15, 2001, ... October 15, 2002 3) Section 5.1 (i)- Omit the reference to Bonds. This section (i) should read: \\"If a Security pays a dividend or makes another distribution, the payment to be made by the Seller shall be equal to the gross amount of the cash dividend or distribution per share (excluding for the avoidance of doubt any tax credits), as the case may be, multiplied by the Dividend Percentage, multiplied by the Contract Quantity\\". We should include a definition for \\"Dividend Payment Date\\" to read, \\"The Equity Payment Date relating to the Valuation Date (s) on which the relevant Dividend Period ends\\". We should also include a definition for \\"Dividend Amount\\". The \\"Dividend Amount\\" definition should read, \\"100% of all ordinary cash dividends where; (i) the ex-dividend date occurs during the period from the day following the Trade Date to and including the final Valuation Date and (ii) the date on which the related ordinary cash dividend would have been received by persons who held the Shares comprising the Basket during such period is during the relevent Dividend Period\\". I believe we should address Section 5.2 \\"Potential Adjustment Event\\". We should recommend replacing the language similar to the Intra-Period Adjustment language we utilitized in the Enron Credit Confirmation.

The new survey by Lord Ashcroft puts the Greens up three points in just a week, ahead of the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip, after their profile was boosted by a row over being excluded from TV debates. The poll and focus group findings will make grim reading for the other parties, with Labour and the Tories both on less than 30 per cent and Ed Miliband likened to a zoo animal 'you're not bothered whether you see or not'. The latest survey for Lord Ashcroft puts the Green party on 11 per cent, up three points in a week. While much attention has been focused on the rise of Ukip in recent months, the Greens have made steady gains. The party boasts that its membership had reached 44,175 in England and Wales, higher than the 41,943 claimed by Ukip last week and almost level with the 44,526 issued by the Liberal Democrats in November. The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously. One in five people saying they will back the Greens voted Lib Dem in 2010, precisely the people Labour needs to woo to win. The Ashcroft survey puts the Tories ahead on 29 per cent and Labour on 28 per cent. Ukip is on 15 per cent, and the Lib Dems on 9 per cent. Lord Ashcroft said: 'One factor could be that the Greens have benefited from their prominence in the arguments over TV debates – in which case it will be interesting to see in the coming weeks whether they can sustain their share.' The Labour party has been warned it has failed to take the threat of the Green party seriously, with former Lib Dems turning Green. As a nation of animal lovers, it is no surprise Britons come to see their politicians as members of the animal kingdom. But a lot depends on whether they are a predator or prey depends. Lord Ashcroft asked a series of focus groups what they thought of the party leaders. He found David Cameron was viewed as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody'. Ukip leader Nigel Farage was branded a peacock or a weasel while Nick Clegg was dismissed as 'a Chihuahua in David Cameron’s handbag'. But Labour's Ed Miliband left most voters blank, telling the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' Today Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics'. She said it was vital for her party to be included in any TV debates to provide balance as voters are moving away from the 'old boys' club' of Westminster. Ms Bennett was speaking at the launch of a poster campaign aimed at the leaders of the main parties, entitled 'What are you afraid of, boys?', to challenge broadcasters to include the Greens in any televised debates between party leaders. Ms Bennett said: 'I have seen a whole slew of surveys last week that showed that the public want the Green Party represented in these debates, and of course we had a petition with 275,000 people saying, 'invite the Greens'. 'The arguments don't stack up - the broadcasters have to invite the Greens.' 'It is very clear that we should be there if this is going to be a balanced debate.' Ms Bennett said it was time to move on from the traditional 'old boys' club of Westminster, and that debates should be inclusive and help promote that. Last week she wrote to Labour leader Ed Miliband, Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg and Ukip Leader Nigel Farage, urging them to back calls for them to be involved in the debates. She revealed Mr Farage had written back to her, 'basically saying 'no'.' 'This is the Green surge,' Ms Bennett said. 'We don't know where it is going, but it is certain that politics in Britain is not going to be the same again, and that is a very good thing. 'Let's get past the debating about the debates and let's actually debate the issues that we so desperately need, given the state of Britain today.' Green party leader Natalie Bennett predicted a 'political earthquake' at the general election and said believes that the public are moving away from 'business-as-usual politics' Asked what sort of animal Labour's Ed Miliband would be, the focus group told the pollster: 'Certainly not a predator… one of those animals that, when you go to the zoo, you’re not bothered whether you see it or not.' David Cameron was viewed by voters as a fox for 'being smart and sleek' while others described the PM as a giraffe, 'looking down on everybody' Ms Bennett said the 'Green surge' pointed to the fact that politics is changing 'very fast', and that the main political parties were afraid of the political ground shifting. She said: 'There is a real potential at this election that we could see politics break wide open.' Polls and studies suggest Britain politics faces being plunged into chaos after the election, with at least three parties would be needed to form a coalition. At the weekend political commentator Iain Dale predict Labour will win 300 seats and the Tories 279, but both would need at least two other parties to secure a majority of the 650 MPs in the Commons. A separate survey showed a third of Scots want to see Britain run by a Labour-SNP coalition which could put Alex Salmond in the Cabinet. Mr Miliband faces the grim prospect of a Labour wipeout north of the border, seriously damaging his hopes of securing an overall majority in the general election in May.","completion":"The Green party is gaining popularity and has reached 11% in a recent opinion poll. This is higher than the Lib Dems and just behind Ukip. People are liking the Green party more because they were left out of TV debates, and this made them more well-known. The Green party now has more members than Ukip and almost as many as the Liberal Democrats. This could be a problem for the Labour party because some people who voted Lib Dem in the past might now vote for the Green party instead. The Green party leader, Natalie Bennett, thinks that there will be big changes in politics during the next general election. She wants the Green party to be included in TV debates so that people can hear different ideas and choose."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Question: What is the name of Coach Gaines' team? Title: Friday Night Lights Movie plot: Bissinger followed the team for the entire 1988 season, which culminated in a loss in the State semi-finals against Carter High School from Dallas, who eventually went on to win the championship game but would have their title stripped for playing an ineligible player. However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.

A close-knit community rallies together in support. In a small town near Houston, Texas, a community faces an unexpected crisis as one of their beloved high school football players, 16-year-old Jason Thompson, suffers a stroke while playing in a game. Thompson, a talented young athlete, talented student, and beloved friend, collapsed in the middle of the football game last Friday, sending shockwaves through the town and placing the spotlight on the rare condition that almost cost him his life. During a regular play, Thompson took a hit to the head which seemingly came as no shock to spectators. Yet, moments later, he would collapse on the field struggling to regain consciousness. With urgent care and quick responses from the coaches, medical staff, and family members, Thompson was rushed to the nearby hospital, where doctors discovered the unimaginable reality - Jason had suffered a stroke. Strokes in teenagers are extremely rare, with research indicating that only about 10 in 100,000 children experience strokes annually. In Jason's case, a blood clot had formed in his brain, causing the devastating incident. Doctors and neurologists quickly took action, performing an emergency surgery known as a thrombectomy to remove the clot and alleviate the pressure on his brain. Jason's family and friends anxiously awaited the results in the waiting room, their hearts heavy with concern. In the days following the surgery, Jason remained in a coma, his condition stable but critical. The community continued to rally around their cherished young football player. The school organized fundraisers and shared updates on Jason's condition through social media, creating a widespread outpour of love and support both online and offline. As word spread about Jason's condition, messages poured in from football players and coaches across the country. Other stroke survivors shared their own experiences and words of encouragement, highlighting the power of community support during this difficult time. While the road to recovery remains long and uncertain, Jason gradually shows signs of progress. A recent MRI scan revealed minimal brain damage, and his mobility and cognitive function have begun to improve. There are promising signs that, with continued care, support, and rehabilitation, Jason may still have the opportunity to make a remarkable recovery. This heart-wrenching incident highlights the importance of recognizing the symptoms of stroke in young people, as early detection and treatment can save lives. Health organizations emphasize the need to educate people on the signs of stroke, even in teenagers and young adults. The acronym FAST (Face drooping, Arm weakness, Speech difficulties, and Time) can help individuals quickly identify stroke symptoms and take action. As the town of Houston and the larger football community comes together for Jason and his family, this tragic event serves as a poignant reminder of the power found within a supportive community. For young players everywhere, keeping an eye out for one another can be a matter of life and death. This story reaches beyond the lines of one football field and teaches the invaluable lessons of empathy, awareness, and unity in the face of adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Ginger should feel solid and should not have any soft spots. Feel around the root with your hands and look for noticeable spots of rot. Peeled ginger will darken around the edges when it starts to go bad. Cut off the ends of the root with a sharp chef’s knife. Cutting a little off of each side will make it easier to hold the ginger rather than working with an irregular shape. Try to only cut off a small portion from the edges so you do not waste any of the usable ginger. Stand the ginger on one of its ends, and use a sharp knife or vegetable peeler to remove the rest of the skin. Slice in a downward motion towards the cutting board. Remember to try and remove as little of the skin as possible. Alternatively, you can use the edge of a spoon to scrape the peel off of fresh ginger. This works especially well on the rounded knobs that may be difficult to reach with a knife. Peeled ginger should be stored in a freezer-safe resealable bag and keeps for 1 week. Frozen ginger is easier to grate since it hardens up. Unpeeled ginger keeps in the freezer for up to 3 months. Allow it time to thaw before peeling it. Peeled ginger can be grated as soon as it’s pulled out from the freezer.

Question 1: What are signs of low blood sugar? Step 1: Identifying the primary context: - The primary context is \\"low blood sugar,\\" which is a medical condition known as hypoglycemia. Step 2: Listing symptoms of low blood sugar: - Some common signs of low blood sugar include shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, irritability, headache, blurred vision, difficulty in thinking, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, and fainting. Step 3: Presenting the answer: - The signs of low blood sugar are shakiness, dizziness, sweating, confusion, irritability, headache, blurred vision, difficulty in thinking, fatigue, rapid heartbeat, and fainting. Justification: Identifying the primary context allows for a clear understanding of low blood sugar and its symptoms. Listing these symptoms accurately answers the question at hand. Question 2: What happens when someone has low blood sugar? Step 1: Explaining the causes of low blood sugar: - Understanding the reason behind low blood sugar is crucial. Some common causes include diabetes medications, skipping meals, consuming less carbohydrates, excessive exercise, or drinking alcohol without eating. Step 2: Describing the body's response: - When blood sugar levels are low, the body cannot function optimally. It may use stored glucose or release stress hormones to raise blood sugar levels naturally. Step 3: Presenting the answer: - When someone has low blood sugar, their body is unable to function properly due to lack of available energy sources. This can lead to symptoms like shakiness, dizziness, and confusion. The body may also try to raise blood sugar levels by breaking down stored glucose or releasing stress hormones.

Her fiance passed away and I fell in love with her while supporting her: Step 1: Assess the situation - Consider whether your feelings for her are genuine or if they may have developed out of the emotional vulnerability experienced during this difficult time. Step 2: Be patient - Give her enough time and space to grieve and process the loss of her fiance before approaching her with your romantic interest. Step 3: Examine your intentions - Ensure that your intentions are pure and you truly care about her well-being, not just in pursuit of a romantic relationship. Step 4: Communicate your feelings - If the appropriate time has passed and you still have feelings for her, communicate your feelings in an empathetic, supportive, and non-pressure way, respecting her decision whatever it may be. 2. I am in love with my Ex-Girlfriend's best friend: Step 1: Reflect on your feelings - Examine if these feelings stem from a genuine connection, or if they are a result of lingering feelings for your ex-girlfriend or the desire for a rebound. Step 2: Consider the implications - Understand that pursuing a relationship with your ex-girlfriend's best friend can strain their friendship and your relationship with your ex-girlfriend. Step 3: Open communication - Talk to your ex-girlfriend about your feelings, if you are on good terms, to gauge her reaction and discuss the potential consequences of pursuing a relationship with her best friend. Step 4: Build a connection - If you have considered the implications and still wish to pursue a relationship, make an effort to genuinely connect with the best friend by showing interest in her hobbies, beliefs, and values. Be kind, considerate, and impress her by being yourself. Step 5: Respect her decision - If she is receptive to your advances, move forward in establishing a relationship, but if not, respect her choice and maintain a cordial relationship.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Given the question: This article: Kill 'Em All features intricate riffing reminiscent of the NWOBHM bands played at high velocity. The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity.... contains an answer for the question: What is the title of the song that contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords?, what is it ?

The Patience Stone The second important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Patience Stone.\\" It teaches us to wait quietly and calmly for things we want, even if it takes a really long time. By being patient, we can stay calm and relaxed, even when things are hard or confusing. 3. The Sharing Stone The third important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Sharing Stone.\\" It teaches us to share what we have with others, even if we do not want to. Sharing makes other people happy, and it also helps us understand that our happiness comes from giving, not just from having. 4. The Gratitude Stone The fourth important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Gratitude Stone.\\" It teaches us to say \\"thank you\\" for the things we have and the kind things that other people do for us. By being thankful, we can remember to feel happy and blessed for everything in our lives. 5. The Imagination Stone The fifth important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Imagination Stone.\\" It teaches us to use our minds to create, dream, and think of new ideas. By using our imaginations, we can make the world a more magical, fun, and interesting place. 6. The Love Stone The last important idea in the Stone Philosophy is the \\"Love Stone.\\" It teaches us to love everyone, even people who are different from us or who we do not understand.

News article: After more than four decades on the airwaves in Atlanta, Neal Boortz this morning announced that he is ending his syndicated talk show on January 21, 2013, replaced by former presidential candidate Herman Cain. Cain will cohost the day the president elect is officially inaugurated and then takes over solo on Tuesday, January 22. “I’m going to miss everything associated with doing a talk show,” Boortz said on air as his producer Belinda Skelton teared up. He said he is not doing this for health reasons. “I am not doing this because I’m fixing to die,” he said. “I have absolutely no health problems period.” Rather, he wants to travel with his wife Donna, something he said is difficult to do as a full-time talk-show host. He even purchased a tour bus to rove the country. “We’re going to call this Neal’s happy ending,” he added later with a glint in his eye. After his first break, post announcement, associate producer Christina Gonzalez popped the champagne. Cain ambled in a few minutes later and grabbed a glass. “Mr. Boortz,” he said. “Your announcement was pure Boortz.” Boortz, 67, has been the longest running talk show host on Atlanta radio. He is now heard locally on 95.5FM and AM750 News/Talk WSB from 8:30 a.m. to 1 p.m. weekdays. On December 5, 2012, he said he’s going to take the month off. After New Year’s, he will work until January 21. “Neal is my brother from another mother,” Cain said on air. “Congratulations on the retirement. Congratulations on 42 years in this business.” Boortz said he will do daily commentaries for Cain and will be a fill in for Cain and Erick Erickson, who is heard on WSB from 6 to 8 p.m. weeknights. Currently, Cain has been the primary fill in for Boortz. Boortz estimated since he started in radio, he has taken 280,000 phone calls. “And 260,000 got cut off,” he said. During a break, Skelton said Boortz intimated to her two years ago that he wanted to retired in early 2013. “It always seemed so far away,” she said. “For the past year, my stomach has been in absolute knots. It was hard for him. He loves what he does.” Program Director Pete Spriggs said he was aware of Boortz’s intentions but they agreed to make this announcement relatively early. “He wanted it off his chest,” Spriggs said. At the same time, Spriggs wanted to have a successor ready to go so he was glad to convince Cain to take over. “I feel great,” Boortz said on air at 11:18 a.m. when fellow syndicated host Clark Howard stopped by. “Last week, I felt really down. Right now, I’m feeling great. I don’t know how I will feel tomorrow. But I have no doubt I made the right decision.” In 1970, on what was then called 680/WRNG-AM in Atlanta, Boortz took over for a morning host who had just committed suicide – a story he loves to tell. He earned a law degree and juggled radio and a private practice from 1977 to 1992. Boortz joined WSB in 1993 when it was just on the AM side. He’s a workaholic who spends four and a half hours on air every day, longer than most hosts, and Tweets several times a day. A self-proclaimed Libertarian, Boortz usually supports Republican policies and candidates but isn’t always in line with them on social issues such as abortion, gay marriage and drug enforcement. He espouses smaller government but has been more hawkish about terrorism after 9/11 than many Libertarians. He portrays himself as an entertainer and castigates people who merely echo what he says and don’t think for themselves. His daily line about himself: “Home of the high priest of the Church of the Painful Truth.” Boortz has written four books. The most impactful was 2005’s “The Fair Tax Book,” which advocates dropping the federal income tax in favor of a national sales tax. In a press conference early Monday afternoon, Boortz said he is working on another book about stories as a radio host and plans to release it as an e-book. He demurred when asked about a future in politics after he retires but didn’t say no. He did acknowledge his wife Donna is highly active in the Mitt Romney campaign. Although Boortz still has a home in Atlanta, he now spends most of his time in Naples, Fla. He grew up in several different places, including Florida, attended Texas A&M and spent several years in various professions before radio such as jewelry and carpet buyer, insurance salesman and a speech writer. He has been lauded by radio groups across the nation over the years, entering the national Radio Hall of Fame in 2009. Cain, a 66-year-old former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, joined WSB in 2008 as an evening talk show host until early 2011, when he decided to run for president. His bid ended in December. Since January, he has provided daily commentaries on Boortz’s show and has continued to sub in for Boortz. Cain’s radio footprint will now be national. Boortz is heard on about 240 radio stations. Talkers magazine, which tracks talk radio, estimates Boortz draws more than six million listeners a week, tied with Laura Ingraham for seventh. “For all practical purposes,” Cain said on the air, “I am done with politics. Essentially, I wanted to continue to express my views and help educate people on what’s going on in this country.” Cain will do his show each day from 9 a.m. to noon. “That is still a significant commitment a day,” he said during a press conference Monday afternoon. “When I subbed in for his four and a half hours, it was exhausting!” Dan Kearney, market manager for Cox Radio Atlanta, said WSB will decide later what it will do with the noon to 1 p.m. slot, as well as 8:30 a.m. to 9 a.m. He also noted that Cain has huge name recognition, even better than Boortz, thanks to his presidential run. Cain said he had other offers, including TV and radio gigs. But this syndication deal was the most enticing. It will allow him to make TV appearances and do speeches across the country. He declined to say how long his deal will last. Want more photos from the day? John Spink of the AJC posted a photo gallery. Join my Facebook fan page and Twitter. Tweet By Rodney Ho, Radio & TV Talk ||||| Allison Shelley/Getty Images. William Temple put on the classic militia outfit, grabbed the Gadsden flag, and headed to Herman Cain’s Sunday night reception. He has 12 different get-ups to re-enact different military eras, but this one—tan sailcloth, black leather gaiters, tricorner hat—goes over the best at Tea Party events. David Weigel David Weigel is a reporter for the Washington Post. Reporters love this. Temple is probably the most-photographed soldier of the Tea Party movement. Alas, it’s Sunday night at a hotel in a particularly anonymous quadrant of the Washington, D.C. suburbs. Barely 150 people have shown up. So Temple grabs appetizers. There are four nearby tables piled high with grape leaves, various cheeses, pita bread tips, and charcuteries. “I’m here to support Mr. Cain in whatever he does,” says Temple. “What the media did to force him out of the race—that was one of the worst things ever done in this country. I emailed [Fox News reporter] Carl Cameron on it, and said it was a high-tech lynching. He emailed back, and said ‘I’m not an investigative reporter.’ This was Fox News! Fox News carried this story with no proof.” Advertisement A waiter walks by, cradling a tray of crabcakes, each approximately the size of a gummy eraser. “Ah, yes!” says Temple, affecting his revolutionary-era accent. (Think of an extra from the John Adams mini-series.) “I’ll have a full regiment.” The waiter moves over to Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation and mastermind of the February 2010 National Tea Party Convention. That event cost up to 549 per ticket. This event is free. Phillips passes on the crab cake anyway, as he scans the crowd for networking opportunities. Look, there are leaders from Tea Party Patriots! Over there—that’s the editor of Tea Party Review magazine! “Herman Cain is becoming the man of the moment, as far as the Tea Party’s concerned,” says Phillips. “What’s his role in the movement now? I’d call him a strategic planner without a portfolio.” You can chortle at the empty chairs and uneaten catering at the Renaissance Hotel, but put it in perspective: The inspiration is a guy who dropped out of the presidential race before any of the primaries. He had to drop out because middle-aged women kept materializing in TV studios and describing grabby encounters with the former National Restaurant Association boss. As he was quitting, he spent more than 300,000 on legal bills. And yet here he is, still beloved by the movement that briefly made him a legit threat to Mitt Romney. Here’s Mark Block, Cain’s chief of staff, still Internet-famous for the campaign video that featured him free-associating about Cain’s “campaign like no other” and smoking a cigarette in front of a brick wall. “How many candidates dropped out of the race?” he asks, rhetorically. “Herman didn’t go away. Here’s a joke among staff that we love. He took ‘three days of vacation’ after the announcement, okay? Two and a half days of that, he was working, setting up Cain Solutions.” Quitting the presidential race worked out brilliantly for Cain. Contrast his life with that of Newt Gingrich, still technically running for president. Cain now heads three organizations, with loosely defined goals—Cain Connections, Cain Solutions, and the Herman Cain Foundation. At this reception, he will announce a video channel called CTV. Its flagship show, confusingly enough will be called Cain TV. A short preview shows the host, a beefy joke writer named Rodney Lee Conover, mocking the life and loves of Sandra Fluke as a cartoon of the birth-control advocate sprawls lazily and lustily on a dorm room bed. It compares awfully well to the no-end-in-sight tragedy that is Newt 2012. When he left Congress, Gingrich started founding think tanks and holding conferences that people actually showed up to—the strategy that Cain is Xeroxing. Those think tanks, now Newt-less, are shutting down. Running for president doesn’t give Gingrich space in the media to share his grand ideas. It gets him headlines about being bit by penguins. The life of the professional has-been is sweeter than the life of the has-been candidate. ||||| Herman Cain is going back on the air. The pizza entrepreneur turned talk-show host turned presidential candidate turned unlikely tax policy advocate is turning back into a talk-show host. Cain is set to replace Neal Boortz on Atlanta's News/Talk WSB. Boortz announced Monday that after 20 years of hosting “The Neal Boortz Show,\\" he's giving up the microphone in January. The libertarian-leaning host has more than 6 million weekly listeners, according to WSB, and is known as the \\"the high priest of the church of the painful truth.\\" Cain is known to many as the high point of weirdness in the 2012 GOP presidential primary season. His bid shot out of nowhere last year, as restless Republican voters seemed to be looking for something different. He was that -- a conservative with a boastful style, a catchy tax plan and his own gospel album. Many conservatives knew that deep voice from back when. Cain hosted a radio show in Atlanta for three years before launching his candidacy. Since dropping his pursuit of the presidency amid sexual-harassment allegations, he has been delivering weekly commentary and chat on Boortz nationally syndicated show. \\"I promise the torch Boortz is handing off to me will blaze as bright, as bold, and as loud as ever,\\" Cain said in a statement. \\"He may be 'The TalkMaster,' but Neal's listeners know I'm the 'The Dean of the University of Common Sense.'\\" Cain is scheduled to take over on Jan. 21, Inauguration Day. kathleen.hennessey@latimes.com ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"After more than four decades on the airwaves in Atlanta, talk show host Neal Boortz announced his retirement from his syndicated radio show.

Their history has been a constant quest for national identity: a conflict between strong regional loyalties and central authority. In about 2000 b.c. Celtic tribes — probably from eastern Europe — came looking for greener pastures in the areas that are now Franche-Comté, Alsace, and Bur­gundy. At the same time, migrants from the Mediterranean countries were trickling into the south. The first recorded settlement was the trading post set up by Phocaean Greeks from Asia Minor at Massalia (Mar­seilles) around 600 b.c. , followed by other ports at Hyères, Antibes, and Nice. But the Greeks developed few contacts with the interior beyond a little commerce in olives and wine with the Celts of Burgundy. When their position was threatened by Ligurian pirates at sea and warlike tribes from inland, the merchants of Marseilles called on Rome for help. From Gaul to France In 125 b.c. , the Romans came in force, conquered the \\"Gallic barbarians,\\" and set up a fortress at Aquae Sextiae (Aix-en-Provence). They took advantage of this new stronghold to create Provincia (now Provence), stretching from the Alps to the Pyrénées, in order to guarantee communications between Italy and Spain. When this province was endangered by fresh attacks from the north, Julius Caesar himself took charge, conquering practically the whole of Gaul by 50 b.c. Caesar drew Gaul's northeastern frontier at the Rhine, taking in present-day Belgium, and warned that the Ger­man­ic tribes across the river — the Franks (after whom France is named), Alamans, and Saxons — would always threaten the security of the frontier. The Romanization of Gaul sent the most energetic warriors to defend the outposts of the empire while their families settled down to work the land or build towns such as Lyon, Orange, Arles, and Nîmes, and the first great highways between them. At the same time, merchants built up a thriving trade with the rest of the Roman Empire. The pattern for the peasantry and bourgeoisie of France was thus established.

The outcome of the votes is uncertain. One measure is more hard-line, while the other represents a compromise between the Republican Party’s conservative and moderate wings. The compromise bill includes a provision requiring children and their parents to be detained together if they cross the border illegally. It would also provide 25 billion in funding for Trump’s much-promised border wall, change the existing visa lottery into a merit-based system and provide a path to citizenship for the young undocumented immigrants who came to the United States as children. Republicans hold a majority in both houses of Congress. Party leaders, including President Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan, have lobbied lawmakers this week in hopes of securing their support for the legislation. “We can enforce our immigration laws without breaking families apart,” Ryan said Wednesday before Trump announced he would sign an executive order to end breaking up families. The president’s policy retreat followed a withering attack by Republican and Democratic officials who characterized the family separations as inhumane. The actions left parents with little or no information about where their children were being taken or when or how they would be reunited. “It’s about keeping families together while at the same time making sure that we have a very powerful, very strong border,” Trump said as he signed the document just before departing the White House for a political rally in the state of Minnesota.

News article: Psychic Wins Libel Lawsuit Against U.K. Tabloid The Daily Mail had called her a \\"charlatan\\" in a 2011 article Perhaps Sally Morgan got a signal from the spiritual realm that she was about to get a lot richer. Or maybe she just figured she had a good enough case to win a lawsuit. Either way, her intuition proved correct: On Thursday, the British medium was awarded 193,000 in damages from the Daily Mail, which had printed a story calling her a “charlatan.” A September 22, 2011 article purported that Morgan was lying when she claimed to be receiving messages from the dead during a performance in Dublin, Ireland. It went on to speculate that she was actually receiving the messages from crew members backstage via a hidden earpiece. The author of the article, Paul Zenon, is a British magician who had previously expressed skepticism about Morgan’s claims of supernatural ability. (MORE: Psychic Claims That Steve Jobs Isn’t Having a Nice Afterlife) Zenon made the allegation after two women called into an Irish radio show claiming they overheard crew members feeding the psychic messages. But it turned out that the crew members were not employed by the psychic and had no contact with her during the show. (They were lighting technicians working at the theater.) Morgan’s lawyer argued that the accusations pushed her into litigation. “It… caused enormous distress to Mrs. Morgan, who decided, given the newspaper’s initial defense of the article, that she had no choice but to commence legal proceedings against the publisher of the Daily Mail,” attorney Graham Atkins told a London court. The Daily Mail apologized and agreed on a settlement and payment of her legal bills. “The Daily Mail withdraws the suggestion that Mrs. Morgan used a secret earpiece at her Dublin show in September 2011 to receive messages from off-stage, thereby cheating her audience, which it accepts is untrue,” attorney Brid Lawson told the court. On her website, Morgan says that she was libeled and accused of trying to con her audiences. “That accusation was totally unfounded and the subsequent fall out has affected me, my family, my career, my health and the good reputation I have built up over many years. It was an unjustified and unfair attack and it has been a very difficult, costly and painful process to get where I am today and to rectify that wrong,” she wrote. It should be noted that the lawsuit was specifically over claims of Morgan using the earpiece and did not specifically address her psychic ability. And while the psychic prevailed in this case, her profession is frequently the target of negative publicity. In 2004, psychic Sylvia Brown told the mother of missing Cleveland teenager Amanda Berry that her daughter was dead. Berry was found alive in May with two other women after being held captive for a decade. After a firestorm of criticism, Browne responded: “I have been more right than wrong … Only God is right all the time.” MORE: Found: Timeline of Ohio Women Missing Since 2002 What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"1.

The Vikings' twelfth game was an interconference duel with the Bills inside their dome and the first home game for interim head coach Leslie Frazier. On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak. In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson.

The suggested changes have raised concerns among Serbian officials who believe that these modifications may have implications for the region's stability and Serbia's national interests. The United Nations Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) was established in 1999 to provide support during the aftermath of the Kosovo conflict. To this day, it continues to assist in maintaining peace and fostering political dialogue between the Serbian government and the partially recognized Kosovan government. The reconfiguration called for by the United Nations Secretary-General aims to adapt to the current political situation in the region and focus on more defined areas of support and engagement. However, Serbian authorities view these proposed changes with skepticism. They argue that the reconfiguration of UNMIK could inadvertently disrupt the delicate balance between Serbia and Kosovo, potentially reigniting old tensions and conflicts. Furthermore, Serbia maintains that any reformation of the mission should be thoroughly discussed and agreed upon by all parties involved, including the Serbian government. Serbia's concerns stem from its long-standing dispute with Kosovo, which declared its independence from Serbia in 2008. Although Kosovo has been recognized by over a hundred UN member states, it has yet to gain full recognition from the international community, including Serbia. The unresolved tensions between the two entities further heighten the potential risk of the proposed reconfiguration. In taking these factors into account, the following steps can be enacted to address Serbia's concerns: 1. Encourage open dialogue between all parties involved, including the governments of Serbia and Kosovo, to ensure mutual understanding and agreement on any proposed changes. 2. Establish an impartial review committee to assess the potential impact of the reconfiguration and provide recommendations that consider the ongoing complex relationship between Serbia and Kosovo. 3. Maintain a comprehensive monitoring system to swiftly identify any emerging tensions or security risks that may arise as a result of the reconfiguration, enabling quick response and conflict prevention. 4. Prioritize transparency and inclusivity in the decision-making process when assessing potential changes to the mission, so that all relevant parties are well-informed and have the opportunity to voice their concerns. By taking these cautious measures, it is possible to address Serbia's concerns while still pursuing the necessary adaptations to modernize the UN's peacekeeping mission in Kosovo. Considering the region's delicate political landscape, it is imperative to balance the pursuit of progress with the preservation of stability and peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him.

Summarize this article: It takes deer take 2-4 weeks to adjust to a new diet, so start feeding them gradually. Slowly introducing new types of food into a deer's diet will help their digestive system learn to process it. Deer typically eat woody vegetation that is found in forests, so feeding them foods that are rich in fats and carbohydrates can be extremely harmful. Begin introducing new foods by combining supplemental foods with deer's natural diet. Start by including a small amount of the new food, and gradually incorporate more and more, ultimately replacing their natural diet. In winter, their natural food supply will decrease significantly (if not completely), so it is recommended to begin this transition before winter hits. These mixes can typically be found at feed mills or pet supply stores. Deer feed mixes are usually a mix of alfalfa, oats, soybeans, molasses and several vitamins and minerals. This type of food is easiest for deer to digest, which is what makes it ideal for supplemental feeding. You must be careful when feeding deer supplemental foods, as they have a sensitive digestive system. If formulated deer food mixtures are unavailable, oats are the next best supplemental food for deer. Oats provide deer with a healthy mixture of fiber and carbohydrates without disrupting their digestive system. A wide variety of fruits and vegetables – including apples, grapes, cherries, pears, carrots, and snap peas – are eaten in nature by deer. Therefore, it is safe to feed deer these fruits. Acorns are another safe food source. A deer's digestive system is complex, and corn happens to be one of the worst types of food for them. Unfortunately, many deer end up extremely sick or dead because animal lovers believe that corn is good for deer. When deer are offered a sudden supply of corn, they aren't able to adjust to the high carbohydrate diet, and they end up dying. In nature, deer eat twigs and other natural forest vegetation. To provide them with more of their natural food source, cut down branches that are out of their reach. This is one of the safest and most natural ways to keep deer fed throughout the year. Summary:","completion":"Deer require 2-4 weeks to adjust to a new diet, and the process should be gradual to help their digestive system adapt.

Q:Generate a question about the following movie plot: In the Indonesian port city of Surabaya, Fred Wilson, a spokesman and promotions specialist for a huge oil conglomerate, Petrox, is preparing a voyage aboard one of the corporation's exploration ships. As the ship sets sail, a stowaway steals on to the boat and hides under the canvas cover of a life boat.The ship makes its way through the stormy south Indian Ocean. Wilson gathers the crew for a meeting to tell them where they're going, saying he couldn't risk telling them anything until they were far out of port. Wilson shows them a pair of photographs of an innocuous fog bank. One picture was taken in the 1940s by a US Navy vessel. The second was taken a few weeks prior to their departure from Surabaya. Wilson also shares another photo, this one taken by a US satellite that went off course and was armed with spectrographic instruments. The readings from the satellite, explained by Wilson's geologist, show that an island may exist behind the fog bank and that it may have petroleum deposits on it. Wilson is very excited, believing that, with the oil and gas shortage causing economic problems for Petrox back in the States, that the island will be a rich source of oil for the company.At that moment the meeting is interrupted by the same man who stowed away in the life boat. The stranger identifies himself as Jeff Prescott, a paleo-primatologist, who had snuck aboard the ship specifically because it was going to the island. He talks about the island's other secret: that a large beast inhabits the island, is the dominate life form there and is worshipped as a god by the local native tribe. Jeff also talks about a strange wedding ritual the natives follow to placate the beast; that a beautiful woman must be \\"wed\\" to it to satisfy it's temper.Wilson believes Jeff is a spy and orders him detained until they can run a check on his credentials.

Context: Father Joseph Carrier, C.S.C. was Director of the Science Museum and the Library and Professor of Chemistry and Physics until 1874. Carrier taught that scientific research and its promise for progress were not antagonistic to the ideals of intellectual and moral culture endorsed by the Church. One of Carrier's students was Father John Augustine Zahm (1851–1921) who was made Professor and Co-Director of the Science Department at age 23 and by 1900 was a nationally prominent scientist and naturalist. Zahm was active in the Catholic Summer School movement, which introduced Catholic laity to contemporary intellectual issues. His book Evolution and Dogma (1896) defended certain aspects of evolutionary theory as true, and argued, moreover, that even the great Church teachers Thomas Aquinas and Augustine taught something like it. The intervention of Irish American Catholics in Rome prevented Zahm's censure by the Vatican. In 1913, Zahm and former President Theodore Roosevelt embarked on a major expedition through the Amazon.","completion":"Father John Augustine Zahm belonged to the Catholic Church.

Movie plot title: A Bug's Life Movie plot: Flik, an individualist and would-be inventor, lives in a colony of ants in the middle of a dried creek. They are led by Princess Atta and her mother, the Queen. The colony is oppressed by a gang of marauding grasshoppers, led by Hopper, that arrive every season demanding food from the ants. One day, when the annual offering is accidentally knocked into a stream by Flik's latest invention, a grain-harvesting device, the grasshoppers demand twice as much food as compensation. The ants trick Flik into accepting his plan to recruit \\"warrior bugs\\" to fight off the grasshoppers. While Flik actually believes in the plan, the other ants see it as an opportunity to get rid of Flik and save themselves trouble. Making his way to the \\"big city\\" (a heap of trash under a trailer), Flik mistakes a group of circus bugs that have recently been dismissed by their money-hungry ringmaster, P.T. Flea, for the warrior bugs he seeks. The bugs, in turn, mistake Flik for a talent agent and accept his offer to travel with him back to Ant Island. After they arrive, the circus bugs and Flik both discover their mutual misunderstandings during a welcome performance by the ants. The circus bugs then attempt to leave, but are forced back by a bird that attacks the group. They save Dot, Atta's younger sister, from the bird as they flee, gaining the ants' respect in the process.

Lanyard denies any involvement claiming that he is in London with his butler, Claudius Jamison to write a book on the jewels and was in New York when they were stolen. Lanyard and Jamison are short of funds and when Ann Kelmscott, the daughter of wealthy gem collector Sir John Kelmscott, invites them to the family estate, they agree. Sir John confides that he is in desperate need of money and asks Lanyard to arrange a confidential loan with part of his jewel collection as collateral. Jamison tells his master that Lily (Queenie Leonard), the maid, told him the butler, Henry Robards, is heartbroken because his former wife, actress Iris Chatham, has run off with Monty Beresford who financed the lavish stage production that launched Iris to stardom. Back at his hotel, Lanyard receives a call from Iris, inviting him to the theater that night where she asks him to stay away from the Kelmscotts. At her apartment, Robards begs her for a reconciliation, but she demands something first. Lanyard decides to accept Kelmscott's offer and arranges to meet Bruce Tang, a gem dealer the next morning. Kelmscott gives Robards a packet of jewels to deliver to Lanyard but he steals the Eyes of the Nile for Iris. David Woolerton, Ann's fiancé, asks him for a ride because he wants to spy on Lanyard. At Tang's shop, Inspector Garvey has followed Lanyard. When Robards' car rolls to a stop, the butler is dead behind the wheel, the jewels still in his possession but the Eyes of the Nile are gone.

Article: Atomic mass, the mass of a given atom or molecule, can be expressed in standard SI mass units - grams, kilograms, etc. However, because atomic masses, when expressed in these terms, are incredibly small, atomic mass is often expressed in unified atomic mass units (usually shortened to \\"u\\" or \\"amu\\") or in Dalton's (Da). The standard for one atomic mass unit is equal to 1/12th of the mass of a standard carbon-12 isotope. Atomic mass units tell the mass of one mole of a given element or molecule in grams. This is a very useful property when it comes to practical calculations, as it allows easy conversion between the mass and moles of a given quantity of atoms or molecules of the same type. Most standard periodic tables list the relative atomic masses (atomic weights) of each element. This is almost always written as a number at the bottom of the element's square on the table, under its one or two letter chemical symbol. This number is usually expressed as a decimal rather than as a whole number. Note that the relative atomic masses listed on the periodic table are average values for the associated element. Chemical elements have different isotopes - chemical forms that differ in mass because of the addition or subtraction of one or more neutrons to the atom's nucleus. Thus, the relative atomic mass listed on the periodic table is suitable as an average value for atoms of a certain element, but not as the mass of a single atom of that element. Relative atomic masses, as listed on the periodic table, are used to calculate molar masses for atoms and molecules. Atomic masses, when expressed in amu, as on the periodic table, are technically unitless. However, by simply multiplying an atomic mass by 1 g/mol, a workable quantity is obtained for an element's molar mass - the mass (in grams) of one mole of an element's atoms. For example, the atomic mass of iron is 55.847 amu, which means one mole of iron atoms would weigh 55.847 grams. As has been noted, the relative atomic masses listed for each element on the periodic table are average values of all of an atom's isotopes. This average value is valuable for many practical calculations - like, for instance, calculating the molar mass of a molecule comprised of several atoms. However, when dealing with individual atoms, this number is sometimes insufficient. Because it's an average of several different types of isotopes, the value on the periodic table isn't the exact value for any single atom's atomic mass. The atomic masses for individual atoms must be calculated by taking into account the exact number of protons and neutrons in a single atom. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary for this is: Atomic mass tells us how heavy an atom or molecule is. It's often measured in units called \\"u,\\" \\"amu,\\" or Dalton's. The numbers on the bottom of the boxes in the periodic table show the average atomic masses of elements. These numbers are helpful for calculating the mass of a whole bunch of atoms or molecules, but not exact for just one atom since there are different types in an element called isotopes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: It's worth preparing for the worst of you are travelling to Bangkok as the Thai capital has the highest number of cases where the British Consulate has stepped in to help out Britons in trouble. In research released by the Foreign Office for 2014, Bangkok emerged as the destination where most Britons found themselves in trouble on holiday, with the need for medical advice and attention the biggest reason. Paris and Malaga followed Bangkok in the list, but both had almost a quarter of cases compared to that of the the Far Eastern city, where there were around 8,000 cases of Britons requiring overseas help. Scroll down for video. A total of 84,000 British citizens required help from the Consulate last year around the world, ranging from medical and illness assistance, to help with arrests and lost property. The report looked at each month of 2014, dissecting what cases were looked at where British government assistance was required. As far as drug arrests were concerned, Spanish party-city Malaga topped the pile on the highest number of Britons requiring assistance with drug-related offences, with around 50 cases recorded. Bangkok was again up there with around 33 cases, followed by the city of love Paris and Mexico recording 33 cases apiece. Bangkok has the highest number of Britons requiring British Consulate help in the world, with most concerning receiving adequate medical treatment. The summer season sees a dramatic increase in the number of drug-related offences - in July alone 150 Britons were arrested around the world adding more work for the foreign office. Poor hygiene in Thailand contributes to Bangkok being ahead of everywhere else when it comes to cases of Britons needing hospital attention. And of course, with the language barrier often leading to confusion, it's little surprise the British Consulate is called upon to mediate and ensure the right treatments are given. Those countries that have a buzzing nightlife and club scene were also unsurprisingly high in the list where hospital treatment was required. Malaga again made the top five, alongside Tenerife, Palma and Alicante. Numbers lower than five in the research were averaged between one and five, and so given as three for reporting purposes. The clubbing scene appears to be linked to drug arrests, with more Britons arrested for these offences in Malaga than anywhere else. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office told MailOnline Travel: 'In light of the risk of unprovoked attacks you should be cautious and take care, especially at night. 'Alcohol and drugs can lead to you being less alert, less in control and less aware of your environment resulting in accidents, injuries, robbery, assaults and lost travel documents. If you drink, know your limit. Drinks served in bars overseas are often stronger than those in the UK. Some British nationals in Thailand have suffered severe psychiatric problems because of drug use, resulting in some suicides. 'Be aware of the possibility of credit card fraud. Don’t lose sight of your card during transactions. There have been incidents of ATM skimming in Thailand. Where possible use an ATM within a bank and always protect your PIN. 'Be careful to observe demarcation lines between shops and stalls, particularly in market areas and at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Taking items from one shop’s area to another may be treated as suspected theft. 'Be on your guard against pickpockets and bag snatchers. Foreigners have had items snatched by thieves on motorbikes when walking along busy streets or travelling in open transport like tuk tuks. If you travel by bus, make sure cash and valuables you have are kept securely. There have been incidents where passengers have had items taken from bags while asleep. 'Gem scams are common. There have been reports of visitors buying gems for inflated prices from seemingly respectable establishments then later finding out the stones are worth a tiny fraction of the purchase price. 'You should report any incidents of crime to the Thai police before leaving the country.'

The period ended in 1573 when the 15th and last shogun of this line, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, was driven out of the capital in Kyoto by Oda Nobunaga. - Historical context. The goal of national unification and a return to the comparative political stability of the earlier Muromachi period was widely shared by the multitude of autonomous \\"daimys\\" during the Sengoku period. Oda Nobunaga was the first for whom this goal seemed attainable. Nobunaga had gained control over most of Honshu (see map below) before his death during the 1582 Honn-ji incident, a coup attempt executed by Nobunaga's vassal, Akechi Mitsuhide. It is not certain whether Nobunaga was killed in the attack or else committed seppuku. The motivations behind Mitsuhide's betrayal was never revealed to anyone who survived the incident, and has been a subject of debate and conjecture ever since the incident. - The is a period in Japanese history marked by social upheaval, political intrigue and near-constant military conflict. Japanese historians named it after the otherwise unrelated Warring States period in China. It came to an end when all political power was unified under the Tokugawa shogunate. - The were powerful Japanese feudal lords who, until their decline in the early Meiji period, ruled most of Japan from their vast, hereditary land holdings.

Use a knife to cut the pan of rice crispy treats before you store them. This will help each piece to freeze evenly and make it easier to pull out individual treats once they’re frozen. If you use a container, fill it up layer by layer with the treats, then seal the top. Freezer bags are a great alternative for when you can’t find the right size of container or don’t want to leave your containers in long-term storage. Simply fill a freezer bag with 1 or 2 layers of treats, press out any extra air, and seal it up tight. If you’re using a container, look for one made of either plastic or glass pyrex to store your squares. Try to find the right size of container that won’t leave too much extra space at the top. Eliminating extra air will help keep the treats fresher for a longer amount of time. This will help prevent the rice crispy treats from sticking and bonding. Measure your container or freezer bag, then cut the wax paper to about the same size. This will make stacking and sealing much easier. To help you keep track of the treats’ freshness, make sure to place a piece of tape on the top of the container and write down today’s date. These labels will help you easily determine whether or not the treats are edible when you find them in your freezer later. Up until 6 weeks, you can keep enjoying these sweet treats. After 6 weeks, the treats will likely lose most of their moisture and turn rock-hard. If you see any containers with a date label from more than 6 weeks ago, just throw away the old rice crispy treats. To eat a frozen rice crispy treat, take it out of the freezer and let it sit at room temperature for 15 minutes before eating or serving. This thawing period will bring back some of the rice crispy treat’s original softness and gooeyness. Summary:","completion":"Properly store rice crispy treats by cutting them before freezing, using a container or freezer bag with minimal air space, and labeling with the date for freshness up to 6 weeks, ensuring enjoyable treats after thawing for 15 minutes at room temperature."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Sentence 2: The speaker thinks the meeting will likely be cancelled. Step 2: Compare the main ideas to see if there is a direct connection or logical relationship. In Sentence 1, the speaker expresses certainty about the outcome of the scheduled meeting, but they do not specify what that outcome will be. In Sentence 2, the speaker speculates that the meeting will be cancelled. While they may seem related to the meeting's outcome, there is no direct information in Sentence 1 to entail the cancellation mentioned in Sentence 2.

Viruses are designed to spread, and it is irresponsible to test viruses on a computer that is not isolated from the internet at large. Ensure that your test environment is contained so that the viruses you are testing cannot spread to computers that you don't want infected. You'll also want to make sure that your computer doesn't have any sensitive information (e.g., credit card numbers, social security identification, payment records, etc.) on it just in case your virus is able to copy the contents of your hard drive. Make sure that the computer or computers you are testing on are not connected to the Internet when you open an infected file. For greater security, test viruses using a virtual machine on a physical computer that is not connected to the internet. Infecting your own computer can jeopardize your data and personal information, and if your computer is connected to the internet or other computers on a network, you run the risk of infecting others. Intentionally infecting someone's computer with a virus is illegal in most countries. If you are trying to test your antivirus software, it is strongly recommended that you use the test file in the previous method. Most routers contain hardware firewalls that can help protect your computer. For maximum vulnerability, you should connect your modem directly to your computer via an Ethernet cable, which will bypass the router's security. . The Firewall service acts as a built-in threat deterrent, so disabling it will allow unauthorized programs to access your computer. In some cases, disabling your computer's Firewall will also allow unauthorized users to gain access to your network. Most antivirus programs do an admirable job of catching the majority of viruses, so you'll want to disable or remove your antivirus software completely before trying to infect the computer. There are a variety of communities online dedicated to testing internet security, and you may be able to find links to known viruses in the community discussions. One of the most popular internet security (NetSec) communities is the NetSec subreddit. You can find a variety of discussions and links to sites containing specific viruses. One of the most popular ways for viruses to be spread is through pirated media and software. Look for \\"cracks\\" or \\"serials\\" for popular programs that require a file to be run. These files often contain viruses that execute when your run the crack program. Torrents are a very popular way to share these files. When browsing torrent sites, look for torrents with low ratings and comments from other users warning about viruses. These are the ones you want. P2P sharing programs are another popular way to spread viruses. Programs like Kazaa and Gnutella are some of the more popular options. Lots of websites, known as \\"warez\\" sites, will offer \\"free\\" downloads for virtually any program. These are almost always infected with viruses and adware, and the program itself rarely works. Many advertisements—especially ones about enhancement-based drugs or services—redirect to shady sites which house viruses. Open your email's Spam or Junk folder, then open an email from an unknown sender and look for a download button or link. Sometimes simply opening a spam email will be enough to contract a virus. For some spam emails, you'll have to click a link in the email to prompt a virus file to download. Screensavers are traditionally some of the most infected files around, especially when downloaded from untrustworthy sources (e.g., torrenting websites). This method will typically only work for Windows computers, as the screensaver (.scr) files will usually only be executable on a Windows computer. when your test is complete.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold.

This was one of those days, a day when we were on a hike, I became my children's hero. This event happened the first summer after we moved to the mountains of Colorado. Wanting to enjoy the beauty of the mountains, my wife and I planned a day hike to the Brown's Creek waterfall. The kids were excited--a day hike, a chance to experience a waterfall, and a day spent with Dad and Mom. Our hike would take us up the Brown's Creek trail and after about 3 miles the waterfall would be on our left. After slowly climbing the first mile, the trail took us through a beautiful grassland and across the creek a couple of times. We decided to turn back before reaching the waterfall, mostly because we were tired and still didn't know how much farther _ was.

A:","completion":"World War 2 was a complex global conflict that resulted from a combination of numerous political, economic, and ideological factors. Although the German attack on Poland, characterized by the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein shelling the Polish garrison at Westerplatte on September 1, 1939, is generally considered the event that marked the beginning of the war, it is not the sole cause. Summarizing the cause of World War 2 by only referencing the German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, Westerplatte, and September 1, 1939, would be an oversimplification. Some key factors that contributed to the outbreak of World War 2 include: 1. Treaty of Versailles: The unfair and harsh terms imposed upon Germany following World War 1, which led to widespread resentment, economic instability, and political turmoil in Germany. The Treaty of Versailles demanded substantial territorial and financial reparations, and forced a reduction in German military capacity, which created fertile ground for the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party. 2. Economic turmoil: The Great Depression that began in 1929 had a major impact worldwide and greatly exacerbated the economic struggles in Germany. This contributed to the growing appeal of extremist politics, including the Nazis, who promised to restore national dignity and economic prosperity. 3. The rise of totalitarian regimes: In the 1930s, aggressive totalitarian regimes emerged in Germany, Italy, and Japan, pursuing imperialist and expansionist policies. Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Emperor Hirohito sought to assert their nations' dominance in the international arena, paving the way for conflict. 4. Appeasement policy: Britain and France, hoping to avoid another catastrophic war, pursued a policy of appeasement towards Germany and Italy, allowing them to annex territories without resistance in the hopes of satisfying their imperial ambitions. This policy emboldened the fascist leaders to make further territorial demands, ultimately leading to war. 5. Failure of the League of Nations: The international body established to prevent war through diplomacy and collective security failed to effectively address German and Italian aggression, leading to a loss of credibility and destabilizing the international order. In conclusion, while \\"German battleship Schleswig-Holstein, Westerplatte, September 1, 1939\\" marks the start of World War 2, the causes of the conflict are multifaceted and cannot be summarized by this single event. The war's origins lie in a complex web of political, economic, and ideological factors that led to an environment ripe for global conflict."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Give me a possible correct answer to the question \\"what language did the miwok indians speak?\\" The answer to this question is:","completion":"The Miwok Indians, an indigenous people native to present-day California, spoke a variety of languages that belong to the Utian linguistic family. These languages, collectively referred to as the Miwokan languages, can be further divided into four primary branches: Eastern Miwok, Coast Miwok, Lake Miwok, and Central Miwok. Eastern Miwok, also known as Sierra Miwok, was spoken in the Sierra Nevada mountain range. This branch consists of three distinct dialects: Northern Sierra Miwok, spoken in the northern foothills and high upland valleys; Central Sierra Miwok, spoken in the central foothills and South Fork of the American River region; and Southern Sierra Miwok, mainly spoken in the Yosemite Valley and its surroundings. Coast Miwok encompasses two dialects, spoken by the Coast Miwok peoples who inhabited the lands west of the San Francisco Bay, from present-day Point Reyes to the Golden Gate and around Sonoma County's Petaluma Creek. The two dialects are Bodega Miwok, spoken in the Bodega Bay area, and Marin Miwok, spoken around present-day San Rafael and the Point Reyes Peninsula. Lake Miwok, spoken by the Clear Lake Miwok or Eastern Pomo tribes, was mainly used in the Clear Lake Basin region of California. It encompasses a single dialect but features several local varieties with minor differences. Central Miwok, also known as the Valley and Sierra Miwok, consists of three distinct dialect groups: Northern, Southern, and Central Valley Miwok. The Northern dialect group includes the languages spoken in the Cosumnes River area and the present-day Sacramento region. The Southern dialect group covers the languages spoken along the Merced, Chowchilla, and Fresno rivers. The Central Valley Miwok dialects were spoken throughout the San Joaquin Valley and the foothills between the Stanislaus and San Joaquin rivers. It is important to note that the Miwokan languages were passed down orally. Consequently, there is limited written documentation available. As a result of colonization and cultural assimilation, the use of these languages has significantly diminished, with only a small number of native speakers remaining today. However, efforts are underway to preserve and revitalize the Miwokan languages through linguistic research, educational programs, and cultural initiatives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And for that, we apologize. After a 4-hour car ride to Edinburgh, over an hour driving around the city (thanks to construction) to find our hotel and another hour walking exploring and searching for a place to eat, we settled on take-out from Mediterranean Gate to bring back to the hotel. So, needless to say, we were all (4 adults & a toddler) hungry & a bit cranky. We didn't mean to be so chaotic and take forever to order, but they had 5 different menus around the store and none of us could figure out what sounded best. In the end, my sister & I ordered a falafel wrap with baba ganoush, which apparently they were out of. Hmph. (Fine for me, as I was going to get it without anyway.) They gave my sister aubergine (eggplant) on hers - and guacamole. An interesting condiment in a Mediterranean place! The chips (aka fries) were frozen - I saw the guy take them out of a bag and put them in the frier) - and needed more ketchup. While HUMUNGOUS, the wraps themselves were not flavorful enough - even with hummous, tahini & hot sauce! We ended up all adding hummous that we had in the hotel to our wraps. A huge thank you to the man sitting at the table - he helped us move our stroller out of the way and even helped us order! We have no idea if he worked there or was friends with the employees, but he was a huge help. And a huge sorry to the guy who walked in and tried to place an order in the middle of our chaos.

Answer: Answer:","completion":"Upon analyzing the given product review - \\"Marta's Opinion,\\" it appears that the reviewer has shared predominantly negative feedback about the book they purchased. We can observe the following key aspects in their review: 1. The title of the book seemed promising and contributed to the reviewer's decision to buy it, which is a positive aspect. However, this point is outweighed by negative comments. 2. The reviewer's main concern was that the book's content didn't provide as much wisdom as they expected. This dissatisfaction reflects negatively on the book's ability to cater to the reader's expectations. 3. The reviewer highlights the difficulty they experienced in understanding the importance of certain stories shared within the book. According to the reviewer, the significance of these stories was clear for the authors or participants, but not for the readers, which eventually left them feeling bored and questioning the need for including those stories. Though the reviewer was initially attracted to the book based on its title, the eventual disappointment with the content and difficulty in grasping the intended meaning behind specific stories convey a predominantly negative sentiment.

They want more fences to stop people falling in. Police say that students need to take more responsibility for themselves when they go out drinking. The warning comes after three student deaths in the River Wear in the past year and a half. Sope Peters drowned in October 2013, Luke Pearce in May 2014, and Euan Coulthard died in January of this year. Toby Dickinson, a 19-year-old first year student, is unhappy with the way the measures are being brought in. \\"I think what's going on here is victim blaming, you died and it's your fault because you drank,\\" he said. Plans include breathalysing people at clubs if bouncers think they've had too much to drink. An area where drunk people can be taken to sober up before being sent on their way home is also being suggested. They will be looked after in these areas by volunteers. Newsbeat saw a number of people being helped by \\"street angels\\" after being kicked out of the clubs and bars. A lot of the students we spoke to said tackling drunks was the wrong approach and ignores the real problem. \\"There are no lights by the river and the fences don't cover the whole path,\\" says Lauren Maine, a third-year student. \\"The path does go to some colleges on the hill so if you were heading that way you would have to get to a bit where there isn't any fence.\\" She is not alone in being angry with the plans. A lot of the students Newsbeat spoke to were unhappy, felt they were being targeted and that local residents weren't facing the same treatment. The local police say that they aren't singling out students and point out that locals aren't dying in the river. They say in the past 15 months four students went into the water after drinking too much and three of those died. Chief Superintendent Ivan Wood is working with the council and university to try to stop more accidents happening. \\"There have been three tragic accidents in the past 14 months, all involving students, all on a Wednesday night, all having consumed alcohol,\\" he said. \\"What we're saying is take responsibility for your own actions.\\" The fear of another death in the city is very high at the moment. When Newsbeat was speaking to students outside the main club there was a moment of panic when a friend of one of the above group went missing after drinking too much. He turned up after a few frantic phone calls and there was a collective sigh of relief. One of those trying to track down the missing student was Ivan Jones, 21, who said: \\"It highlights a point, after these things happen then everyone is worried and you'd expect that.\\" The council, police and university have told students to \\"look after your friends and stick together walking home\\". This is a message that Jackie Roberts wants people to take on. Her daughter Megan died in another university city, York, which is also dominated by a river running through it. Megan fell into the River Ouse after a night out drinking with friends. Jackie told Newsbeat that she has relived what could have happened to her in the water over and over in her head and doesn't want anyone else to go through what she has. \\"I'm never going to preach to anyone and say don't go out and have a drink and don't have fun, but just realise there is this huge danger if you're not careful,\\" she said. She also agreed with the students Newsbeat has spoken to who say more needs to be done to physically stop people falling in. Some changes are being made and since meeting with Newsbeat, Jackie has been in touch to say that York Council will receive a gate in March to install over the steps where Megan died. \\"Good news in that it helps prevent the same tragedy in that area and it is also a mark of respect to Megan,\\" said Jackie.

Some possible solutions include having people who have had too much to drink be checked by volunteers, and having a place where drunk people can go to recover before they go home. The students don't think these ideas will solve the real problem, which they believe is a lack of lights and fences near the river.

Walkers: The term \\"walkers\\" refers to people who are engaged in the act of walking, typically for recreation, exercise, or as a hobby. In this context, it appears to be the primary subject of the sentence, as it indicates who is performing the action of resting. 2. Resting: The verb \\"resting\\" is the second crucial element, as it depicts the action or activity the walkers are involved in. People often pause or rest during a walk or hike, especially if they are undertaking a physically demanding route like a mountain trail. Resting provides an opportunity for the walkers to regain their strength and appreciate the scenery. 3. Mountain: Lastly, the word \\"mountain\\" helps to establish the setting or environment where the walkers are resting. Mountains are often associated with challenging hikes, beautiful vistas, tranquility, and a sense of achievement for those who manage to reach their peaks.

A more detailed and relevant answer would be: The Mexican painter Diego Rivera is known for creating numerous murals throughout various cities, including Mexico City. He was a prominent figure in the Mexican muralism art movement, which was a significant part of the cultural renaissance following the Mexican Revolution. Rivera sought to create public art that portrayed the struggles, history, and hopes of the Mexican people. Diego Rivera's murals can be found in numerous institutions, public buildings, and even on exterior walls of various cities. Some of his most famous works include the murals at the National Palace in Mexico City, which depict Mexico's rich history from the pre-Columbian era through the Spanish conquest, colonial times, and the struggle for independence. Another notable work is Man at the Crossroads, a mural commissioned for the Rockefeller Center in New York City, which was eventually destroyed due to its controversial content. Rivera was a member of the Mexican Communist Party and often incorporated political themes into his murals. His artwork sought to promote social change and address socio-political issues of his time, making it accessible and meaningful to the general public. Diego Rivera was married to famed Mexican artist Frida Kahlo, and they lived together in Coyoacán, a neighborhood in Mexico City. Several of their homes, studios, and art collections are open to the public and serve as a testament to their contributions to the world of art. Their most well-known residence, La Casa Azul (the Blue House), now functions as the Frida Kahlo Museum, which holds many of their personal belongings, including Kahlo's artwork and Rivera's collection of pre-Columbian artifacts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please briefly summarize this news article: General Election 2010: What the manifestos mean for our pay packets By Paul Farrow Published: 6:46PM BST 17 Apr 2010 What the manifestos mean for your pay packet Photo: MacWilliam The manifestos have been published and the first television debate has been aired. As each day passes, voters are getting a clearer picture of what life would be like under a Labour, Conservative or Liberal Democrat government. \\"It is the typical pre-election period, when the parties are bidding for your votes,\\" said Mike Warburton of Grant Thornton, the accountancy firm. \\"They have made their manifesto pledges and you can look at the potential implications.\\" The major talking point so far has been National Insurance. Labour has made its intention to raise NI well known and the Conservatives have latched on to this rise and retaliated with the seemingly full support of the business community. Last week, Labour also said it would not raise the basic, higher and new top rates of tax in the next parliament. On the other hand, the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats have made no such pledges. So, based on the manifestos, who are the winners and who are the losers when it comes to the amount of money left in your pay packet? We asked Grant Thornton to tap some figures into its newly created general election tax spreadsheet to find out. Here is what it revealed. Let's start with a Conservative victory. Should David Cameron move into Number 10, a single person earning less than £35,000 a year will be better off to the tune of £150 a year. This takes into account the Tories' decision to reverse Labour's planned NI increases. And then, of course, you have the controversial marriage tax. Married couples and those in civil partnerships will be a further £150 to the good, making a total of £300. But not everyone is a winner. Workers earning around £45,000 to £55,000 would be worse off under Mr Cameron. Those earning £45,000 a year would be worse off by £294 and £546 if they earn £50,000 and £213 worse off if they earn £55,000. If the Lib Dems come to power, most people will have more money in their pocket, thanks to their proposal to raise the personal tax allowance to £10,000. This will lift many on low incomes out of the tax system altogether – indeed, everyone earning up to £113,000 will be a winner. Single people on less than £150,000 would be £705 better off with Nick Clegg as prime minister. So would most married couples, although those on earnings of £35,000 to £54,000 would be better off only to the tune of £160 and those on £55,000 would have £493 more in their pay packet. Couples earning up to £35,000 and those on more than £60,000 would be £705 better off. As we mentioned earlier, these figures do not take into account any changes to income tax rates. Labour has pledged not to increase income tax rates. But remember, pledges are not promises, as Gordon Brown has proved: he broke the Labour pledge to freeze tax rates with the new 50pc supertax on high earners. George Bull, head of tax at Baker Tilly, said: \\"It is difficult to know whether to laugh or cry when noting that Labour have repeated their 2005 pledge that they will not raise the basic, higher and new top rates of tax in the next parliament.\\" The Tories and the Lib Dems have made no such pledges on freezing taxes in their manifestos, although in a statement the Conservatives said they could not \\"imagine any circumstances in which we would raise income tax rates\\". A 1p increase in the basic rate of income tax raises about £4.5 billion a year and so it is an option to help reduce the deficit for any incoming government. Should an unforeseen event trigger a change of heart from the Tories, or if the Lib Dems decided to raise the basic rate by 1p, many of the gains made from NI policy and the marriage tax would disappear. Take someone earning £25,000. Under a Tory government, an increase in the basic rate of tax by 1p would mean that a single person would be £35 worse off, those on £40,000 would be £185 worse off and everyone earning more than £50,000 would be £375 out of pocket. It would be even worse for a couple with one income earner, despite the marriage tax. Those on £45,000 would be worse off by £668, those on £50,000 would be £920 out of pocket and those on £55,000 would be £587 worse off. Those earning £60,000 or more would be £375 worse off. The only winners, based on a basic-rate tax rise of 1p under the Tories, would be those on incomes of less than £25,000 a year. Depending on whether they are single or married, they could be up to £275 a year to the good. The vast majority of people would still be in the black under the Lib Dems even if there were a 1p income tax increase – between £306 and £799 better off. The only people to suffer would be those earning £150,000 plus, who would be around £1,000 worse off under the Lib Dems should income tax rise by 1p. None of the above calculations take into account the other tax in the frame – VAT. Whoever wins, a VAT rise to around 20pc is highly likely. Mr Warburton said: \\"The three major parties have each produced manifestos which say that they understand the importance of tackling the truly appalling state of our public finances. \\"Despite this, they are all happy to tell us the good news in their tax policies, but they say little about the tax rises and public spending cuts that are now inevitable after the election is out of the way, whoever wins.\\" Such is the size of Britain's deficit that payback can come only from three places, despite plans to cut public spending. These are raising basic-rate tax, increasing VAT and imposing NI increases. This is because these are the taxes most people pay and which therefore generate the bulk of the tax receipts by the government. Last year, these three \\"taxes\\" accounted for two thirds of all receipts by central government. Fuel duty, corporation tax and council tax make up the bulk of the difference but on their own they would not be able to raise the amount required to reduce the deficit significantly, experts say. \\"My guess is that we would see an increase in both the rate of VAT and NI if Labour won this election,\\" said Mr Warburton. \\"It is unlikely that a Conservative government would seek to raise further taxes using NI.

This article focuses on how these plans would affect people's pay packets or the amount of money they take home from their jobs. The main discussion is about National Insurance, a type of tax. The Labour party said they want to raise National Insurance, and the Conservatives have a different plan. The article then looks at how people's pay packets would change under different parties like the Conservatives, Labour, and Liberal Democrats. It says that different people would have more or less money depending on which party won the election. The article also reminds us that sometimes politicians make promises during elections that they don't always keep, like with taxes. So the changes to people's pay packets might not be exactly like they say in their manifestos. Finally, the article says that no matter who wins the election, taxes might still go up to help reduce the money the government owes (called the deficit)."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: This is a correct answer to the following question about Don Blankenship.

Summarize this article: * Tuberculosis has come back \\"with a vengeance\\" in Europe * More than 80,000 cases in WHO's European region each year * Drug-resistant strains can take years to treat, many patients die By Kate Kelland LONDON, Sept 14 (Reuters) - Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant forms of tuberculosis (TB) are spreading at an alarming rate in Europe and will kill thousands unless health authorities halt the pandemic, the World Health Organisation(WHO) said on Wednesday. Launching a new regional plan to find, diagnose and treat cases of the airborne infectious disease more effectively, the WHO's European director warned that complacency had allowed a resurgence of TB and failure to tackle it now would mean huge human and economic costs in the future. \\"TB is an old disease that never went away, and now it is evolving with a vengeance,\\" said Zsuzsanna Jakab, the WHO's Regional Director for Europe. \\"The numbers are scary,\\" Lucica Ditiu, executive secretary of the Stop TB Partnership told a news conference in London. \\"This is a very dramatic situation.\\" TB is currently a worldwide pandemic that kills around 1.7 million people a year. The infection is caused by the bacterium Mycobacterium tuberculosis and destroys patients' lung tissue, causing them to cough up the bacteria, which then spreads through the air and can be inhaled by others. Cases of multidrug-resistant (MDR-TB) and extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB) -- where the infections are resistant to first-line and then second-line antibiotic treatments -- are spreading fast, with about 440,000 new patients every year around the world. According to the WHO and Stop TB, 15 of the 27 countries with the highest burden of MDR-TB are in the WHO's European region, which includes 53 countries in Europe and Central Asia. More than 80,000 MDR-TB cases occur in the region each year -- almost a fifth of the world's total. The WHO said precise figures for XDR-TB are not available because most countries lack the facilities to diagnose it, but officially reported cases of XDR-TB increased six-fold between 2008 and 2009. Rates are highest in eastern Europe and Central Asia, but many countries in western Europe have increasing rates of TB and drug-resistant TB, Ditiu said. Britain's capital, London, has the highest TB rate of any capital city in western Europe with around 3,500 cases a year, 2 percent of which are MDR-TB. Treating even normal TB is a long and unpleasant process, with patients needing to take a combination of powerful antibiotics for 6 months. Many patients fail to correctly complete the course of medicines, a factor which has fueled a rise in drug-resistant forms of the disease. Treatment regimes for MDR-TB and XDR-TB can stretch into two or more years, costing up to 16,000 in drugs alone and up to 200,000 to 300,000 per patient if isolation hospital costs, medical care and other resources are taken into account. Experts say around 7 percent of patients with straightforward TB die, and that death rate rises to around 50 percent of patients with drug-resistant forms. The WHO's action plan for tackling tuberculosis emphasises the need for doctors and patients to be more aware of the disease and its symptoms, to diagnose and treat cases promptly with the right drugs, and follow patients up over many months or years to ensure they take their medications. If that doesn't happen \\"not only are these people quietly and painfully dying, they are also spreading the disease,\\" Ditiu said. The WHO said that if the plan is fully implemented -- at an estimated cost of 5 billion -- 127,000 people will be successfully treated for drug-resistant TB and 120,000 deaths will be averted by 2015. The cost would also be recouped, since 250 000 MDR-TB and 13,000 XDR-TB cases will be prevented, saving 7 billion in averted treatment costs, the WHO said. It added that prevention of premature deaths among TB patients would add to economic productivity in the region and generate an extra 5 billion. (Reporting by Kate Kelland) ||||| The UK has been using opportunistic X-rays to detect undiagnosed cases of TB A plan has been drawn up to try to tackle cases of drug-resistant tuberculosis in 53 European countries. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has described the problem as \\"alarming\\". Eastern Europe has the highest level of infection, while in Western Europe, London has the highest TB rate of any capital city. The WHO estimates there are 81,000 cases of drug-resistant TB a year in Europe, although many countries are failing to diagnose it. The plan aims to increase diagnosis and access to treatment. Experts believe it has the potential to save several billion pounds and 120,000 lives by 2015. European problem Russia, Ukraine and Azerbaijan are among the countries with the highest burden of illness. We cannot be complacent - the cost of each case can be several hundred thousand pounds. Dr Ibrahim Abubakar, Health Protection Agency TB cases in the UK are concentrated in large cities. There are 3,500 cases in London each year. In 2009, there were 58 cases of drug-resistant TB in the UK. Resistance can arise if patients fail to complete their course of medication. The Health Protection Agency's TB expert, Dr Ibrahim Abubakar, said: \\"Although the overall numbers are small, the trend has been for an increase in the past decade. \\"We cannot be complacent. The cost of managing each case can stretch to several hundred thousand pounds. \\"So it's significant - and while that person is infectious, other people can get TB. \\"The larger numbers in Eastern Europe represent a failure to take action.\\" He urged GPs and casualty departments to be vigilant for possible cases. Six weeks later came the depressing news that none of the three antibiotics were effective Anna Watterson, Drug-resistant TB survivor TB is an airborne infection which still proves fatal in about 7% of cases. Almost half of patients with the multi-drug resistant form of the disease die. The WHO has praised the UK's \\"Find and Treat\\" service, which uses a mobile X-ray van to screen homeless people and drug addicts for TB. Dr Ogtay Gozalov, from the WHO's Europe office, said: \\"It's not just the vulnerable populations like migrants and prisoners - all of us could be exposed. \\"If member states don't take action now, there could be a dramatic situation in the future.\\" Cocktail of drugs Barrister Anna Watterson spoke of how she became ill with drug-resistant TB when she was a law student living in north-west London. She made a full recovery but missed a year of studying and spent four months in hospital. She said: \\"I had a cough I couldn't shake off. I lost weight and had night sweats. \\"I visited my GP a few times but TB wasn't suspected because of my background and age - I was in my mid-20s. \\"Once I'd been admitted to hospital, I started the standard three-drug regime. \\"But six weeks later came the depressing news that none of the three antibiotics were effective. I had the impression the doctors were scraping the barrel. \\"The next cocktail of drugs left me feeling unwell. I had bruises from injecting them, and one of the side-effects was sensitivity to the sun. \\"As a pale-skinned redhead, this meant having to wear gloves when I went outside in the summer.\\" |||||","completion":"Tuberculosis (TB), including multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant forms, is spreading at an alarming rate in Europe, with over 80,000 cases reported each year in the World Health Organization's (WHO) European region.

The man complains to Fletcher that he had been cheated by Barrett claiming he had been sold a deed to non-existent property. Fletcher finally shoots the farmer, killing the man in front of his young son. His son then picks up his father's shotgun, uses it to kill Fletcher, and rides out of town with Fletcher's horse and a distinctive silver-trimmed saddle. The boy is next seen several years later and has since become a hardened bounty hunter calling himself Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma). He meets an elderly drifter, Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), who accompanies him to the frontier town of Cerriotts. Snake is a colorful character who claims that the story of the \\"silver saddle\\" and the boy who avenged his father's death is well known and that he wishes to join Blood in his travels. On the way, Snake often scavenges the remains of those killed in gunfights by Roy Blood. Their arrival in Cerriotts is noticed by several townspeople, in particular, a local cowboy known as Turner (Gianni De Luigi). Blood visits the town whorehouse where he meets with an old girlfriend, Shiba (Licinia Lentini), who is also its madam. She tells Blood that she is being extorted by a man called Shep who collects the money on behalf of a Mexican bandit named Garrincha (Aldo Sambrell). Shiba enlists Blood's help in taking care of Garrincha and his gang. Indeed, Blood confronts and kills Shep and several of Garrincha's men in a gunfight. Afterwards, Turner appears to offer Blood 2,000 to kill a man called Barrett. Blood is hesitant to take the murder contract, but accepts the offer upon recognizing the name of the land baron who had swindled his father years before.

Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Answer:","completion":"To determine which sound is less likely to have damaged Jonathan's ears, we need to compare the intensity (decibel level) of both the fireworks and the jet flyover. Step 1: Determine the decibel levels of the fireworks and the jet flyover. - Since the jet flyover has an even higher intensity than the fireworks, we only need to establish one point of reference, i.e., the fireworks' decibel level. Step 2: Compare the decibel levels to the reference values mentioned in the hint. - According to the hint, high-decibel sounds are dangerous and can cause hearing loss. Step 3: Assess the potential damage of each sound. - If the fireworks demonstrate a high intensity but are still considered safe, the lesser damage should come from them, as the jet flyover's intensity is even higher. Unfortunately, without the mentioned Figure, we do not have specific decibel levels to compare. However, with the information given, the sound that is less likely to have damaged Jonathan's ears is the fireworks display because the jet flyover has an even higher intensity than the high-intensity fireworks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Every night, he would go onto the roof outside his window to see the wonders of the sky. \\"What excited me most was whether there were planets in other solar systems where life might exist,\\" he says. \\"I decided to try to find planets orbiting other stars like our Sun.\\" And he did. \\"My fellow researcher, Paul Butler, and I found our first planet in 1995,\\" Dr. Marcy says. \\"We worked for ten years without finding anything! _ and our patience paid off.\\" Since then, the two scientists have discovered 65 of the more than 100 planets found orbiting other stars. Dr. Marcy and Dr. Butler also spotted the first \\"family\\" of three planets. In June 2002 they announced another discovery: a Jupiter-like planet orbiting star 55Cancri. At first, the two researchers found only planets that orbit close to stars. Recently, the scientists found planets farther out. The planet orbiting 55Cancri is a major breakthrough: it is the first sighting of a large gas planet about same distance from the star as Jupiter is from the Sun. Why is this important ? Scientists think that life on Earth may exist because of two special features in our solar system. The first is Jupiter. \\"Because it's so big, Jupiter pulls comets and asteroids , or they all come and hit the Earth.\\" Dr. Marcy explains. \\"Without Jupiter , life on Earth would likely have been destroyed.\\" A second feature is that Earth is a rocky planet where liquid water, which is necessary for life , can exist. Unlike gas planets, rocky planets like Earth have surfaces where water can gather in pools and seas, which may support life.

Answer the following question: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: Tigers are the largest wild cats in the world. They usually go out to hunt for food when it is dark. When a tiger sees an animal, it moves quickly and then jumps on the animals to kill it. Sometimes it can take the tiger several days to finish eating its food. When the tiger is full, it will cover the dead animal with leaves. Later, when the tiger is hungry again, it comes back to eat some more. Tigers are different from others in the cat family: they like water and often jump into rivers to swim. Some tigers live in very cold places in North Korea, Russia and China. Other tigers live in warmer places--in India and parts of Southeast Asia. But now all tigers are in danger. Some people kill tigers to use their skins for clothes, and their bodies for medicine.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I have a new situation: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. But I can use this background: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. What is an answer for this question: Which lake will have less dead zones?","completion":"Based on the information provided and the background context on how dead zones are formed, it is likely that Lake Costanza will have fewer dead zones as compared to Lake Montopeke. The main reason behind this assumption is the difference in the amount of rain that each farm receives. The farm next to Lake Montopeke gets regular rain, which means that there is more water available for dissolving and carrying away the fertilizer used on the farm. This runoff carries the dissolved fertilizer, particularly nitrogen, into the adjacent Lake Montopeke. As mentioned in the background context, the introduction of nitrogen into the body of water causes excessive algae growth. When these algae die, decomposers break down their dead tissue and use up the oxygen in the water, resulting in the creation of dead zones. Therefore, it can be inferred that the more nitrogen-rich runoff present in the water, the more dead zones are formed. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza hardly receives any rain. This means that there is less water available to dissolve and carry away the fertilizer from the farm into the lake. As a result, less nitrogen is introduced into Lake Costanza, leading to a lower possibility for excessive algae growth, decomposer action, and the subsequent creation of dead zones. It's important to note that though Lake Costanza seems to have a lesser probability of experiencing dead zones compared to Lake Montopeke due to the lower amount of rain it receives, both lakes could still be at risk from other factors, such as pollution or changes in water temperature. Preventive measures should be taken to minimize the chances of dead zones occurring in either lake, such as the use of more environmentally-friendly farming techniques and proper monitoring of water bodies. In conclusion, Lake Costanza is likely to have fewer dead zones than Lake Montopeke due to the difference in rain patterns and the resulting dissolution and runoff of fertilizers. However, efforts should be made to minimize the impact of agricultural practices on both lakes to ensure a healthy and sustainable ecosystem for the communities they support."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Process: - Food enters the body - Food begins to be processed by the digestive system - The pancreas releases enzymes to aid digestion - Digested food affects the amount of sugar in the blood - The pancreas releases one hormone to lower the blood sugar (glucose) level - The pancreas releases another hormone to raisethe blood sugar (glucose) level. Question: suppose less big waves in the ocean happens, how will it affect less food to be processed. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"To answer the question, I will first analyze the connection between ocean waves and food processing: 1. There is no direct correlation between the size of ocean waves and the food entering our bodies, as food processing in the human body is primarily involved with the ingestion, digestion, and absorption of nutrients from the food we consume. 2. However, it is important to consider that ocean waves can have a more indirect impact on food supply chains and human food consumption. This is because big ocean waves could affect marine life and access to certain types of food (e.g., fish or seafood). 3. If there are fewer big waves in the ocean, the disruption to marine life and fishing could be reduced, potentially leading to more availability of marine-based food sources. 4. However, it's important to note that other factors (such as weather patterns, pollution, and overfishing) could still impact the availability of food sources from the ocean, and waves are not the only determining factor. Given that the connection between ocean waves and food processing in the human body is indirect and affected by various other factors, the answer would be: C: no effect Less big waves in the ocean would not directly impact how much food gets processed within the body since this mostly depends on an individual's food intake and their body's ability to process it. However, it may have an indirect effect on food availability (particularly seafood) but is not the sole determining factor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

His extraordinary story has now been backed up by a range of compelling evidence, both in France and in Germany, which is published in the latest edition of Paris's Le Point magazine. Hitler is said to have had an affair with Mr Loret's mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, 16, as he took a break from the trenches in June 1917. Although he was fighting the French near Seboncourt, in the northern Picardy region, Hitler made his way to Fournes-in-Weppe, a small town west of Lille, for regular leave. There he met Miss Lobjoie, who later told their son: \\"One day I was cutting hay with other women, when we saw a German soldier on the other side of the street. \\"He had a sketch pad and seemed to be drawing. All the women found this interesting, and were curious to know what he was drawing. \\"I was designated to approach him.\\" The pair started a brief relationship, which resulted in the birth of Jean-Marie, who was born in March 1918 after being conceived during a 'tipsy' evening in June 1917. Miss Lobjoie later told Jean-Marie: \\"When your father was around, which was very rarely, he liked to take me for walks in the countryside. \\"But these walks usually ended badly. In fact, your father, inspired by nature, launched into speeches which I did not really understand. \\"He did not speak French, but solely ranted in German, talking to an imaginary audience. Even if I spoke German I would not be able to follow him, as the histories of Prussia, Austria and Bavaria where not familiar to me at all, far from it. \\"My reaction used to anger your father so much that I did not show any reaction.\\" Jean-Marie was, like thousands of other French children with German soldier fathers, badly treated by his peers at school. He was referred to as 'the son of the Boche', and often had fights as he tried to defend his father, who had by now disappeared over the border back to Germany. Miss Lobjoie, meanwhile, refused to discuss Jean-Marie's father, and ended up giving her only son away for adoption in the 1930s to a family called Loret. His real father would not recognise Jean-Marie, but continued to stay in contact with Miss Lobjoie. Incredibly, Mr Loret went on to fight the Germans in 1939, defending the Maginot Line before it was bypassed during the Nazi invasion which resulted in France being occupied from 1940 until 1944. Mr Loret even joined the French Resistance, and was given the codename 'Clement'. Just before her death in the early 1950s, Miss Lobjoie finally told Jean-Marie that his father was arguably the most infamous dictator in human history. Mr Loret said: \\"In order not to get depressed, I worked non-stop, never took a holiday, and had no hobbies. For twenty years I didn't even go to the cinema.\\" Mr Loret began investigating his past in great detail, employing scientists to prove that he has the same blood type as Hitler, and that they even have similar handwriting. Photographs of the two also reveal an astonishing resemblance. Other elements which corroborate the story are official Wehrmacht, or German Army, papers which show that officers brought envelopes of cash to Miss Lobjoie during the Second World War. When Miss Lobjoie died, Mr Loret also found paintings in her attic which were signed by Hitler, who was an accomplished artist. In Germany, meanwhile, a picture of a woman painted by Hitler looked exactly like Miss Lobjoie. Francois Gibault, Mr Loret's Paris lawyer, said: \\"He first came to see me in 1979, but was a bit lost and did not know whether he wanted to be publicly recognised as Hitler's son, or to erase all that completely. \\"He had the feelings of many illegitimate children: the desire to find a past, however heavy, but also the fear of returning to the old routine. \\"I talked with him a lot, playing the role of psychologist rather than lawyer.\\" Mr Gibault said that Mr Loret's own children might now be in a position to claim royalties from Mein Kampf ('My Struggle'), Hitler's famous book which has sold millions of copies around the world. Mr Loret wrote a book called 'Your Father's Name Was Hitler' in 1981, and it is now set to be re-published with all the new evidence. Hitler, who was born in an Austrian village, frequently spoke of his love for France, and especially for Paris. In December 1940, he paid an emotional visit to the capital city, where he was pictured saluting Napoleon's tomb in front of his bemused generals. More intriguingly still, Hitler transferred from Vienna part of the remains of Napoleon II, Napoleon Bonaparte's son with Marie Louise of Austria. Hitler often enthused about the greatness of Napoleon, saying that he wanted to have as big an impact on history as the Frenchman. Although he never officially had any sons or daughters of his own, Hitler often spoke of his love of children and animals. He married his mistress, Eva Braun, as the Red Army shelled his bunker in Berlin, in 1945, and committed suicide shortly afterwards. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"The story of Jean-Marie Loret, who claimed to be Adolf Hitler's illegitimate son, has been supported by a range of evidence presented in Paris's Le Point magazine. According to the narrative, Hitler had a brief affiliation with Loret's mother, Charlotte Lobjoie, in 1917 while he was on leave during his service near the French town of Seboncourt. This association led to Loret's birth in March 1918. Due to the stigma attached to his suspected parentage, Loret was mistreated by his peers at school and was eventually given up for adoption by his mother. Despite the hardships, Loret went on to serve in the French Resistance against Nazi forces during World War II. Before her death in the 1950s, Lobjoie admitted to Loret that his father was the infamous dictator. To confirm his lineage, Loret employed scientists, compared blood types and handwriting, and examined physical similarities in photographs. Additional details, such as payments from the German Army to Lobjoie and paintings signed by Hitler found after Lobjoie's death, further strengthened Loret's claim. According to Francois Gibault, Loret's attorney, there's a possibility that Loret's children might be eligible to claim royalties from Hitler's book, 'Mein Kampf'. Loret, who passed away in 1985, documented his extraordinary story in his 1981 book 'Your Father's Name Was Hitler,' which will be re-published with the new supporting evidence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Context: Facebook has a long track record and sordid history of abusing their users’ trust and privacy, including the most recent and egregious cases currently making headlines with Cambridge Analytica as well as election meddling in the US and Britain. As if that wasn’t enough, it then came to light that they have also been tracking and storing users’ phone call and text message data, including “who contacted whom, what time, and how long the conversation was.” This is nothing new, as we can see from this 2012 “study” in which they deliberately manipulated news feeds to influence users’ emotional state. And again with their settlement with the FCC back in 2011 (that they likely violated with their recent offenses) over deceiving consumers by telling them their information was private, but then repeatedly sharing it and making it public. And then there’s The Ugly Memo, in which a FB exec justifies growth at any cost in the name of connecting people, even if that results literally in people dying: We talk about the good and the bad of our work often. I want to talk about the ugly. We connect people. That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people. The ugly truth is that we believe in connecting people so deeply that anything that allows us to connect more people more often is *de facto* good.

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7–8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ”Why do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?” She insisted. “The Emergency Room is no place for a child ma’am. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,” I explained. “Like what?” She argued. “Well, there are people in pain moaning,” I answered. “And drunks cursing at the staff. It’s a tough place.” “He’s fine,” she insisted. “I think I know how to parent. I don’t need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.” I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa’s lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! “Mom, Santa Claus is Dead!” He cried. “I’m not going to get anything for Christmas.” “Why would someone open the curtain?” The mother demanded. “I warned you,” I said. “That’s why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.” She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: After her little boy \\"lost it\\" the mother probably: Options: - Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy. - Thinks the real Santa is dead and Christmas is forever gone. - Doubts her parenting abilities. - not enough information","completion":"After her little boy \\"lost it\\" the mother probably: - Better understands the hospitals 12 and older visitation policy."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

If, during your practice run, you find that your time has elapsed before you could get through your whole presentation, you’ll know that your presentation has too many slides. Head back to the drawing board to edit it accordingly. If your presentation ended well before the time limit you’ve been given, try to extend the amount of time you spend on each slide, or add extra slides to expand on the info introduced in the presentation. Solicit advice from family and friends during your practice presentation.

Summarize the following: If locking lips seems like too much of a commitment, try kissing a girl by giving her a quick peck. Turn your head away from her lips and purse your lips together so that your teeth aren’t showing. Lean into her cheek and give her a quick kiss to show some affection. Always get consent first, even for a simple peck on the cheek. While kissing her, if you’re confident that you can lift her off of the ground, wrap your arms around her waist and lift her up while keeping your lips against her. This is a classic romantic gesture and will show her that you’re really attracted to her and enjoying the kiss. If she resists in any way, don’t try to keep lifting her up. Some girls don’t like being lifted off of the floor. Once you’ve gotten used to kissing one another, you can start to make out. While kissing, run the very tip of your tongue over her lower lip a few times. If she opens her mouth a bit more, then she may be interested. Introduce your tongue slowly and once your tongues are touching, move your tongue slowly around her mouth. Don’t overdo it with the French kissing if you have a lot of saliva built up in your mouth. Take breaks! It can be hard to breathe if you’re mouths are locked in a French kiss for more than 10-20 seconds.","completion":"To show affection with a kiss, opt for a quick peck on the cheek, ensuring consent.

January 2, 1920 - April 6, 1992) was an American writer and professor of biochemistry at Boston University. He was known for his works of science fiction and popular science. Asimov was a prolific writer who wrote or edited more than 500 books and an estimated 90,000 letters and postcards. His books have been published in 9 of the 10 major categories of the Dewey Decimal Classification. Asimov was born on an unknown day between October 4, 1919 and January 2, 1920, inclusive. Asimov himself celebrated it on January 2. Asimov's parents were Anna Rachel (nee Berman) and Judah Asimov, a family of Jewish millers. He was named Isaac after his mother's father, Isaac Berman. When he was born, his family lived in Petrovichi near Klimovichi, which was then Gomel Governorate in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (now Smolensk Oblast, Russia). Asimov wrote of his father, \\"My father, for all his education as an Orthodox Jew, was not Orthodox in his heart\\", noting that \\"he didn't recite the myriad prayers prescribed for every action, and he never made any attempt to teach them to me\\". In 1921, Asimov and 16 other children in Petrovichi caught double pneumonia. Only Asimov survived. He later had two younger siblings: a sister, Marcia (born Manya, June 17, 1922 - April 2, 2011), and a brother, Stanley (July 25, 1929 - August 16, 1995), who was vice-president of New York Newsday. His family emigrated to the United States when he was three years old. Since his parents always spoke Yiddish and English with him, he never learned Russian, but he remained fluent in Yiddish as well as English. Growing up in Brooklyn, New York, Asimov taught himself to read at the age of five, and his mother got him into first grade a year early by claiming he was born on September 7, 1919. In third grade he learned about the \\"error\\" and insisted on an official correction of the date to January 2. After becoming established in the U.S., his parents owned a succession of candy stores, in which everyone in the family was expected to work. The candy stores sold newspapers and magazines, a fact that Asimov credited as a major influence in his lifelong love of the written word, as it presented him with an unending supply of new reading material as a child that he could not have otherwise afforded. He became a naturalized U.S. citizen in 1928 at the age of eight. Where was he born?","completion":"Isaac Asimov was born in a place called Petrovichi, which was near Klimovichi in the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic.

Her boyfriend, Johnny Cammareri (Danny Aiello) proposes to her before leaving for Sicily to attend to his dying mother; she accepts, but is insistent that they carefully follow tradition as she believes her first marriage was cursed by her failure to do so, resulting in her husband's death when he was hit by a bus. They plan to marry one month later, and Johnny asks Loretta to invite his estranged younger brother Ronny (Nicolas Cage) to the wedding. Loretta returns home and informs her parents of the engagement. Cosmo dislikes Johnny and is reluctant to commit to paying for the \\"real\\" wedding Loretta insists on, while Rose is pleased that Loretta likes Johnny but does not love him; she believes that one can easily be driven crazy by a partner whom one loves. The next day, Loretta goes to see Ronny at his bakery after he refuses to speak to her on the phone. He reveals that he has a wooden prosthetic hand, and he explains that he blames Johnny for the loss of his hand and his own fiancÃ©e; Ronny became distracted while talking to Johnny as he cut bread for him, his hand was mangled in the slicer, and his fiancÃ©e left him. Loretta insists that they discuss the matter upstairs in his apartment, where she cooks for him and then tells him that she believes he is a \\"wolf\\" who cut off his own hand to escape the trap of a bad relationship. Ronny reacts furiously and passionately, kissing Loretta (who responds to his kiss) and then sweeping her up in his arms and carrying her to his bed where they make love.

Laugh: While laughter is undoubtedly a part of many interactions between friends, it may not necessarily happen before they go out to play. Additionally, laughing is more of a response to a specific situation or comment, and is not a preparatory action before playing. 2. Sit: Sitting is a passive activity, and it is not an action that typically occurs directly before engaging in play. Friends may sit together while hanging out or taking a break from playtime, but it is not a specific action to undertake before starting to play. 3. Being entertained: Although friends may entertain each other in various ways, being entertained is not a specific action that children undertake before playing. It is more likely that the entertainment would occur during their playtime or as a part of their activities while playing. 4. Math: Math is an academic subject and, while children might engage in math-related games or learning activities with their friends, it is not a general prerequisite for going to play. Math activities would typically take place either during school time or during dedicated study sessions. 5. Meet: Meeting up with friends is the most logical choice among the options provided, as children need to gather together before they can engage in any play activities. This often involves deciding on a meeting location, greeting each other, and then proceeding to participate in their desired form of play. In conclusion, \\"meet\\" is the most accurate and appropriate choice for describing what a kid might do with his friend before going to play.

The protagonist is at the center of the story, makes the key decisions, and experiences the consequences of those decisions. The protagonist affects the main characters' circumstances as well, as they are often the primary actor propelling the story forward. If a story contains a subplot, or is a narrative made up of several stories, then the character who is interpreted as the protagonist of each subplot or individual story. The word \\"protagonist\\" is used notably in stories and forms of literature and culture that contain stories, which would include dramas, novels, operas and films. In those forms the protagonist may simply be the leading actor, or the principal character in the story. More formally, the protagonist, while still defined as a leading character, may also be defined as the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the antagonist. The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflict that test the protagonist, thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of their character. The earliest known examples of protagonist are dated back to Ancient Greece. At first dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus.

Paragraph- Sent 1: Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Sent 2: Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. Sent 3: While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Sent 4: Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband.

Graduel Christopher Darin Carter (born November 25, 1965) is a former American football player in the National Football League. He was a wide receiver for the Philadelphia Eagles (1987-89), the Minnesota Vikings (1990-2001) and the Miami Dolphins (2002). After starting for the Ohio State University Buckeyes, Carter was drafted by the Eagles in the fourth round of the 1987 NFL supplemental draft. While in Philadelphia, head coach Buddy Ryan helped to coin one of ESPN's Chris Berman's famous quotes about Carter: \\"All he does is catch touchdowns.\\" Carter was heavily recruited out of high school for both basketball and football. He accepted the offer from Ohio State head coach Earle Bruce. Carter became a consensus All-America selection after his junior season, Ohio State's first All American at wide receiver. Carter had intended to play both football and basketball at Ohio State, but decided to focus on football after making an immediate impact his freshman year. That year, he set a Rose Bowl record with nine receptions for 172 yards. Carter was known for great hands, running precise routes, and for acrobatic leaps. He had remarkable body control and footwork when making catches near the sidelines. At the Citrus Bowl at the end of the 1985 season, Carter caught a ball that quarterback Jim Karsatos was intending to throw away. Karsatos has claimed that catch by Carter was the greatest in the history of college football: \\"When I finally saw it on film, he was tiptoeing the sidelines and he jumped up and caught the ball left-handed by the point of the football at least a yard out of bounds. Then he somehow levitated back in bounds to get both his feet in bounds. I swear to this day he actually levitated to get back in bounds. When I saw it on film, it just blew me away.\\" Prior to Carter's senior season, he secretly signed with notorious sports agent Norby Walters. When the contract was discovered, Carter was ruled ineligible. The absence of Carter in the 1987 offense contributed to a disappointing 6-4-1 season and the firing of Coach Bruce. Missing this season also cost him a chance at evening his personal record against Michigan; Carter finished 1-2, his lone taste of victory in the series being his freshman year. Despite losing his senior year, Carter left Ohio State holding the school record for receptions (168). In 2000, he was selected as a member of the Ohio State Football All-Century Team. In 2003, he was inducted into the Ohio State Varsity O Hall of Fame.

Would \\"His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders.\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"No, the statement \\"His achievements have received greater recognition in modern times, though his contributions were not initially as celebrated as those of other Founders\\" does not specifically address what John Adams was doing to help France. Instead, it focuses on the general recognition of Adams' achievements in comparison to other Founding Fathers. To provide a more direct answer, we need to examine John Adams' interactions with France during his political career. John Adams (1735-1826), the second president of the United States and one of the Founding Fathers, played a significant role in the development of early relations between the United States and France. During the Revolutionary War, France was an important ally of the United States, and the two countries enjoyed a close diplomatic relationship. Here are a few ways in which John Adams helped France: 1. Diplomatic missions: John Adams was appointed as one of the commissioners who were sent to France in 1778 to negotiate a treaty of alliance and amity. Adams, along with Benjamin Franklin and Arthur Lee, worked to secure French support for the American Revolution, leading to the Treaty of Alliance and the Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the two nations. 2. Financial assistance: During his time in France, Adams also played a role in securing financial assistance from the French government to support the American war effort. This funding was critical in sustaining the Continental Army and ensuring its ability to continue fighting against the British. 3. Peace negotiations: In 1782, John Adams was one of the American representatives sent to negotiate peace with Great Britain. France played an essential role in these negotiations, acting as the United States' primary ally and lending its support to the cause of American independence. Adams, along with John Jay and Benjamin Franklin, helped secure the Treaty of Paris, which formally ended the war and recognized American independence. 4. Ambassador to France: After the Revolutionary War, Adams served as the first United States ambassador to France from 1785 to 1789. He worked to maintain good relations with France and promote American interests. While John Adams did help France in various ways during his political career, it is also important to recognize that his primary focus was on American interests and fostering a strong and independent United States. His efforts to secure French support and maintain good relations between the two nations were ultimately motivated by his commitment to the success and prosperity of the newly formed United States."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I was victimised by a gang of bent police men, who arrested me and set me up to get charged with something that I did not do which I believe was connected to other criminals who live in my area, who I believe were connected to a gang of DJ’s who were involved stealing intellectual and copyright works from me (likely their party organisers and drug dealer buddies). I was sent to court and found guilty based on no evidence by a magistrate court judge who was later struck off for corruption after defrauding an old lady of over a million pounds! I was not put in prison for this minor offense but did receive a minor criminal record. This criminal records the same DJ’s and bent ex-police have used to ruin my reputation and career. One of the bent policemen, who incidentally had already been thrown out of the police force for car insurance fraud, even turned up at the uni I went to and spread vicious slander to ruin me there, and in the area that I lived at the time. I was then victimised by the people at the famous college that I went to and all my intellectual and copyright works stolen. Which I note, generated millions for others.

Given the below context: The Brownlow family, a dynasty of lawyers, began accumulating land in the Belton area from approximately 1598. In 1609 they acquired the reversion of the manor of Belton itself from the Pakenham family, who finally sold the manor house to Sir John Brownlow I in 1619. The old house was situated near the church in the garden of the present house and remained largely unoccupied, since the family preferred their other houses elsewhere. John Brownlow had married an heiress but was childless. He became attached to two of his more distant blood relations: a great-nephew, also called John Brownlow, and a great-niece, Alice Sherard. The two cousins married each other in 1676 when both were aged 16; three years later, the couple inherited the Brownlow estates from their great-uncle together with an income of £9,000 per annum (about £1.35 million in present-day terms) and £20,000 in cash (equivalent to about £3.01 million now). They immediately bought a town house in the newly fashionable Southampton Square in Bloomsbury, and decided to build a new country house at Belton.Work on the new house began in 1685. The architect thought to have been responsible for the initial design is William Winde, although the house has also been attributed to Sir Christopher Wren, while others believe the design to be so similar to Roger Pratt's Clarendon House, London, that it could have been the work of any talented draughtsman. The assumption popular today, that Winde was the architect, is based on the stylistic similarity between Belton and Coombe Abbey, which was remodelled by Winde between 1682 and 1685. Further evidence is a letter dated 1690, in which Winde recommends a plasterer who worked at Belton to another of his patrons. Guess a valid title for it!

Uncle Jesse is the grand marshal of the reunion and at the same time, is facing a lawsuit filed by Mama Josephine Maxx for access across Duke property to the Hazzard swamp where she intends to build a theme park. However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County. Driving from Washington, D.C., the Congressman representing Hazzard County in Washington, Cooter Davenport, arrives first and goes back to the Duke farm with Jesse, where Jesse is barbecuing ribs for everyone. Shortly thereafter, a car pulls up. Jesse recognizes it as Bo due to the sound of the motor. Bo has gotten a ride from a friend as he, having returned to the professional racing circuit and has come back for the reunion, has wrecked his car (again, according to Jesse).

BATHROOM 25% of men have never cleaned the toilet -- but those in Wales are the worst. Nearly four in 10 Welsh men said they never cleaned anywhere in the house. Hate cleaning the shower head? You're not alone -- a quarter of a million Brits say the same. 20% of Scots regard window-cleaning as their most hated job. KITCHEN 36% of people in the south-east say cleaning the cooker is their hated task. 68% of those in the north-east spend more than six hours a week cleaning their homes -- especially the kitchen -- in sharp contrast to the 49% of Welsh and West Country folk, who put their hands up to cleaning for under an hour. BEDROOM 18% believe cleaning starts here: that's the percentage of women who clean wearing their dressing gowns. 51% of women in the north-west may be staying in bed and giving their husband a cuddle --as a thank-you for helping them clean.

Normal grown-ups wear fancy suits and ties when they go to work. But Tony Pulis was not like them. He loved to wear his comfy tracksuit and a cool navy baseball cap when he was coaching his team.

Up to c. 1210, continental Arthurian romance was expressed primarily through poetry; after this date the tales began to be told in prose. The most significant of these 13th-century prose romances was the Vulgate Cycle (also known as the Lancelot-Grail Cycle), a series of five Middle French prose works written in the first half of that century. These works were the Estoire del Saint Grail, the Estoire de Merlin, the Lancelot propre (or Prose Lancelot, which made up half the entire Vulgate Cycle on its own), the Queste del Saint Graal and the Mort Artu, which combine to form the first coherent version of the entire Arthurian legend. The cycle continued the trend towards reducing the role played by Arthur in his own legend, partly through the introduction of the character of Galahad and an expansion of the role of Merlin. It also made Mordred the result of an incestuous relationship between Arthur and his sister Morgause and established the role of Camelot, first mentioned in passing in Chrétien's Lancelot, as Arthur's primary court. This series of texts was quickly followed by the Post-Vulgate Cycle (c. 1230–40), of which the Suite du Merlin is a part, which greatly reduced the importance of Lancelot's affair with Guinevere but continued to sideline Arthur, and to focus more on the Grail quest. As such, Arthur became even more of a relatively minor character in these French prose romances; in the Vulgate itself he only figures significantly in the Estoire de Merlin and the Mort Artu. During this period, Arthur was made one of the Nine Worthies, a group of three pagan, three Jewish and three Christian exemplars of chivalry. The Worthies were first listed in Jacques de Longuyon's Voeux du Paon in 1312, and subsequently became a common subject in literature and art.

Conduct research on the economic history of the United States, including data on when the country's economy overtook other major global economies. 2. Look for reliable sources that provide clear and accurate information on this topic. Step 1: Conducting research on the economic history of the United States I look into significant historical events and factors that contributed to the growth of the US economy. Since the beginning of the 20th century, the United States has been an economic powerhouse, with rapid industrialization and major advancements in technology. Key events and periods that contributed to this growth are the World Wars, the Great Depression, and the Post-WWII era. Step 2: Finding reliable sources for the information In conducting my research, I come across several reliable sources, such as data from the World Bank, and academic articles and books discussing the history of the United States' economic growth. After conducting my research and checking my sources, it is clear that the United States became the world's largest economy during the late 19th century or early 20th century. Some sources attribute the title to the US as early as the 1870s, while others mention the early 1900s, particularly around 1916 during World War I. Considering these findings, I will provide a combined answer: The United States became the world's largest economy sometime between the late 19th century and the early 20th century, with some sources pointing to the 1870s and others to the early 1900s, around 1916 during World War I.

Write an article based on this summary: Music festivals fail to reflect the diversity of the UK music scene, with headline slots being dominated by a small band of male rock acts over the decades, a study suggests. Article:","completion":"Title: Are UK Music Festivals Truly Representing the Diverse Music Scene? Introduction The United Kingdom has long been applauded for its rich and diverse music scene, producing some of the world's greatest artists and bands. However, a recent study has brought to light a glaring issue with the nation's music festivals: they fail to reflect the true diversity of the UK's music scene. The study suggests that headline slots at these events have been dominated by a select few male rock acts over the years. The Lack of Diversity in Headline Acts Music festivals across the UK have become a staple of the British summer, with thousands of people flocking to see a variety of artists and bands perform in large outdoor settings. Despite the vast array of musical genres and styles prevalent in the UK, it seems that the majority of music festivals continue to be headlined by a small group of predominantly male rock acts. This persistent focus on a specific genre raises the question of why other music styles are not given greater representation. Male Domination in the Music Industry The male-dominated music industry may be a contributing factor to the lack of diversity in UK music festivals. Historically, the music business has been overwhelmingly male, with women and marginalized groups struggling to gain equal representation and opportunities. This could be reflected in the music festival scene, with the artists and bands that dominate these lineups benefiting from longstanding biases in the industry. Potential Bias in Booking Decisions Booking agents and festival organizers have a significant role to play in this issue. These professionals are responsible for deciding which acts will perform at their events, and their choices directly impact the diversity that festival-goers experience. The study's findings imply that biases may exist in the booking process, favouring acts that have traditionally been at the forefront of the music scene. This established dynamic perpetuates a narrow view of the UK's music landscape, robbing festival attendees of the chance to enjoy a wider range of musical styles and performers. The Effects on Emerging Talent The issue does not only have an impact on festival-goers; it also affects emerging artists and musicians hoping to make their mark on the industry. Music festivals are an excellent platform for new talent, offering an opportunity for up-and-coming acts to expose their work to a wide audience. By failing to reflect the full spectrum of the UK's music scene, these festivals may inadvertently stifle the careers of budding musicians whose work falls outside of the prevailing male rock act mold. Conclusion It is necessary for those involved in the UK's music festival scene – from organizers and booking agents to artists and fans – to confront and challenge the longstanding lack of diversity in the festivals' lineups. By expanding the variety of acts included in these events, UK music festivals will better represent the nation's rich and eclectic music scene, while providing a more inclusive and fair platform for emerging talent to flourish."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The term is typically used to describe a space that has either been built or equipped for the purpose. - Acting is an activity in which a story is told by means of its enactment by an actor or actress who adopts a characterin theatre, television, film, radio, or any other medium that makes use of the mimetic mode. - California is the most populous state in the United States and the third most extensive by area. Located on the western (Pacific Ocean) coast of the U.S., California is bordered by the other U.S. states of Oregon, Nevada, and Arizona and shares an international border with the Mexican state of Baja California. The state capital is Sacramento. Los Angeles is California's most populous city, and the country's second largest after New York City. The state also has the nation's most populous county, Los Angeles County, and its largest county by area, San Bernardino County. - Music is an art form and cultural activity whose medium is sound and silence, which exist in time. The common elements of music are pitch (which governs melody and harmony), rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness), and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the \\"color\\" of a musical sound). Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. The word derives from Greek (\\"mousike\\"; \\"art of the Muses\\"). In its most general form, the activities describing music as an art form include the production of works of music (songs, tunes, symphonies, and so on), the criticism of music, the study of the history of music, and the aesthetic examination of music. Ancient Greek and Indian philosophers defined music as tones ordered horizontally as melodies and vertically as harmonies. Common sayings such as \\"the harmony of the spheres\\" and \\"it is music to my ears\\" point to the notion that music is often ordered and pleasant to listen to. However, 20th-century composer John Cage thought that any sound can be music, saying, for example, \\"There is no noise, only sound.\\" - Photography is the science, art, application and practice of creating durable images by recording light or other electromagnetic radiation, either electronically by means of an image sensor, or chemically by means of a light-sensitive material such as photographic film. - The Isle of Wight Festival is a music festival which takes place annually on the Isle of Wight in England. It was originally a counterculture event held from 1968 to 1970. - Filmmaking (or in an academic context, film production) is the process of making a film. Filmmaking involves a number of discrete stages including an initial story, idea, or commission, through screenwriting, casting, shooting, sound recording and reproduction, editing, and screening the finished product before an audience that may result in a film release and exhibition. Filmmaking takes place in many places around the world in a range of economic, social, and political contexts, and using a variety of technologies and cinematic techniques. Typically, it involves a large number of people, and can take from a few months to several years to complete. - A ceramic is an inorganic, nonmetallic solid material comprising metal, nonmetal or metalloid atoms primarily held in ionic and covalent bonds. This article gives an overview of ceramic materials from the point of view of materials science. - Pottery is the craft of making ceramic material into pots or potterywares using mud. Major types of potterywares include earthenware, stoneware and porcelain. The place where such wares are made by a \\"potter\\" is called a \\"pottery\\" (plural \\"potteries\\"). The technical definition of \\"pottery\\" used by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) is \\"all fired ceramic wares that contain clay when formed, except technical, structural, and refractory products.\\" - Scrapbooking is a method, an art for preserving, presenting, arranging personal and family history in the form of a book, box, card. Typical memorabilia include photographs, printed media, and artwork. Scrapbook albums are often decorated and frequently contain extensive journaling. Scrapbooking is a hobby commonly practiced in many parts of the world. - Long John Silver is the seventh studio album by Jefferson Airplane , and their last album of all new material until 1989 . It was recorded and released in 1972 as Grunt FTR - 1007 , and peaked at No. 20 in America . - Industrial design is a process of design applied to products that are to be manufactured through techniques of mass production. Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication. This distinguishes industrial design from craft-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation. - A rock festival, often considered synonymous with pop festival, is a large-scale rock music concert, featuring multiple acts performing an often diverse range of popular music including rock, pop, folk, electronic, and related genres. - Jefferson Airplane was a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock. Formed in 1965, the group defined the San Francisco Sound and was the first from the Bay Area to achieve international commercial success. They were headliners at the three most famous American rock festivals of the 1960sMonterey (1967), Woodstock (1969) and Altamont (1969)and the first Isle of Wight Festival (1968) in England. Their 1967 break-out album \\"Surrealistic Pillow\\" ranks on the short list of most significant recordings of the \\"Summer of Love\\". Two songs from that album, \\"Somebody to Love\\" and \\"White Rabbit\\", are among \\"Rolling Stone's\\" \\"500 Greatest Songs of All Time.\\" - Architecture (Latin \\"architectura\\", from the Greek \\"arkhitekton\\" \\"architect\\", from - \\"chief\\" and \\"builder\\") is both the process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings and other physical structures. Architectural works, in the material form of buildings, are often perceived as cultural symbols and as works of art. Historical civilizations are often identified with their surviving architectural achievements. - Radio is the technology of using radio waves to carry information, such as sound, by systematically modulating properties of electromagnetic energy waves transmitted through space, such as their amplitude, frequency, phase, or pulse width. When radio waves strike an electrical conductor, the oscillating fields induce an alternating current in the conductor. The information in the waves can be extracted and transformed back into its original form. - The San Francisco Sound refers to rock music performed live and recorded by San Francisco-based rock groups of the mid-1960s to early 1970s. It was associated with the counterculture community in San Francisco during these years. San Francisco is a westward-looking port city, a city that at the time was 'big enough' but not manic like New York City or spread out like Los Angeles. Hence, it could support a 'scene'. According to journalist Ed Vulliamy, \\"A core of Haight Ashbury bands played with each other, for each other, for free and at Chet Helms's Avalon Ballroom and Bill Graham's Fillmore.\\" - Animation is the process of making the illusion of motion and the illusion of change by means of the rapid display of a sequence of images that minimally differ from each other. The illusionas in motion pictures in generalis thought to rely on the phi phenomenon. Animators are artists who specialize in the creation of animation. Animation can be recorded with either analogue media, a flip book, motion picture film, video tape, digital media, including formats with animated GIF, Flash animation, and digital video. To display animation, a digital camera, computer, or projector are used along with new technologies that are produced. - Sculpture is the branch of the visual arts that operates in three dimensions. It is one of the plastic arts. Durable sculptural processes originally used carving (the removal of material) and modelling (the addition of material, as clay), in stone, metal, ceramics, wood and other materials but, since Modernism, there has been an almost complete freedom of materials and process. A wide variety of materials may be worked by removal such as carving, assembled by welding or modelling, or molded, or cast. - ) is the art of paper folding, which is often associated with Japanese culture. In modern usage, the word \\"origami\\" is used as an inclusive term for all folding practices, regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat sheet square of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts, glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word \\"\\" to refer to designs which use cuts, although cutting is more characteristic of Chinese papercrafts. - Woodworking is the activity or skill of making items from wood, and includes cabinet making (Cabinetry and Furniture), wood carving, joinery, carpentry, and woodturning. - An artist is a person engaged in one or more of any of a broad spectrum of activities related to creating art, practicing the arts or demonstrating an art. The common usage in both everyday speech and academic discourse is a practitioner in the visual arts only. The term is often used in the entertainment business, especially in a business context, for musicians and other performers (less often for actors). \\"Artiste\\" (the French for artist) is a variant used in English only in this context. Use of the term to describe writers, for example, is valid, but less common, and mostly restricted to contexts like criticism. - A studio is an artist's or worker's workroom, or the catchall term for an artist and their employees who work within that studio. This can be for the purpose of acting, architecture, painting, pottery (ceramics), sculpture, origami, woodworking, scrapbooking, photography, graphic design, filmmaking, animation, industrial design, radio or television production broadcasting or the making of music. The term is also used for the workroom of dancers, often specified to dance studio. - The Summer of Love was a social phenomenon that occurred during the summer of 1967, when as many as 100,000 people, mostly young people sporting hippie fashions of dress and behavior, converged in San Francisco's neighborhood Haight-Ashbury. Although hippies also gathered in many other places in the U.S., Canada and Europe, San Francisco was at that time the most publicized location for hippie fashions. - Broadcasting is the distribution of audio and/or video content or other messages to a dispersed audience via any electronic mass communications medium, but typically one using the electromagnetic spectrum (radio waves), in a one-to-many model. Broadcasting began with AM radio, which came into popular use around 1920 with the spread of vacuum tube radio transmitters and receivers. Before this, all forms of electronic communication (early radio, telephone, and telegraph) were one-to-one, with the message intended for a single recipient. The term \\"broadcasting\\", borrowed from the agricultural method of sowing seeds in a field by casting them broadly about, was coined by either KDKA manager Frank Conrad or RCA historian George Clark around 1920 to distinguish this new activity of \\"one-to-many\\" communication; a single radio station transmitting to multiple listeners. - Graphic design is the process of visual communication and problem-solving through the use of typography, photography and illustration. The field is considered a subset of visual communication and communication design, but sometimes the term \\"graphic design\\" is used synonymously. Graphic designers create and combine symbols, images and text to form visual representations of ideas and messages. They use typography, visual arts and page layout techniques to create visual compositions. Common uses of graphic design include corporate design (logos and branding), editorial design (magazines, newspapers and books), wayfinding or environmental design, advertising, web design, communication design, product packaging and signage. - Surrealistic Pillow is the second album by American rock band Jefferson Airplane, released on February 1, 1967, by RCA Victor (LSP-3766 [stereo] and LPM-3766 [mono]). It is the first album by the band with vocalist Grace Slick and drummer Spencer Dryden. The album peaked at number three on the \\"Billboard\\" album chart and has been certified a gold album by the RIAA. - Psychedelic rock is a style of rock music that is inspired or influenced by psychedelic culture and attempts to replicate and enhance the mind-altering experiences of psychedelic drugs, most notably LSD. It may use novelty recording techniques, electronic instruments or effects, and sometimes draws on sources such as the ragas and drones of Indian music. What is the relationship between 'long john silver ' and 'psychedelic rock'? Answer:","completion":"Long John Silver is the seventh studio album by Jefferson Airplane, a rock band based in San Francisco, California, who pioneered psychedelic rock.

Movie title: The Wrestler Context: Over the credits, we see numerous magazines and newspaper articles from the 80's, all of which feature Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a major professional wrestling star. We then flash forward twenty years, where Randy \\"The Ram\\" is getting ready for a match in a small, local auditorium on the underground circuit. He interacts with the other wrestlers backstage, most of whom are much younger than he is (Randy is acknowledged to be in his 50's). Ironically, though they are foes inside the ring, outside the wrestlers are all friendly, discussing with each other how they want to perform the \\"act\\" that night, and after the show go drinking together. Randy preps for the match and it's obvious his age has caught up with him; his joints are cracking as he stretches and becomes short-winded easily. After he stretches he puts a small piece of a razor blade in his wrist bandages, in which later he uses to cut himself on the forehead to draw blood, making the match more dramatic for the fans. Afterward, Randy is given a meager payday, as the promoter claims the audience was smaller than expected. Randy's manager then poses a 20th anniversary rematch with his most notable opponent, the Ayatollah, which sold out Madison Square garden in the 80's. Randy agrees, hoping this kind of high-profile match could help him get back to the top.Randy goes home to find he has been locked out of his trailer for not paying his rent. He takes pain medication with a beer and falls asleep in the back of his van. The next day he goes to work to load boxes at a supermarket where he asks his boss if he could have more hours. His boss is very rude to him and makes a snide comment about the cost of tights going up being the reason he needs more hours. Randy laughs it off and continues to ask his boss for more hours but \\"not on the weekends\\".

Question: \\"What kind of birds resemble humans more?\\" Context: \\"Many birds show plumage patterns in ultraviolet that are invisible to the human eye; some birds whose sexes appear similar to the naked eye are distinguished by the presence of ultraviolet reflective patches on their feathers. Male blue tits have an ultraviolet reflective crown patch which is displayed in courtship by posturing and raising of their nape feathers. Ultraviolet light is also used in foraging—kestrels have been shown to search for prey by detecting the UV reflective urine trail marks left on the ground by rodents. The eyelids of a bird are not used in blinking. Instead the eye is lubricated by the nictitating membrane, a third eyelid that moves horizontally. The nictitating membrane also covers the eye and acts as a contact lens in many aquatic birds. The bird retina has a fan shaped blood supply system called the pecten. Most birds cannot move their eyes, although there are exceptions, such as the great cormorant. Birds with eyes on the sides of their heads have a wide visual field, while birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision and can estimate the depth of field. The avian ear lacks external pinnae but is covered by feathers, although in some birds, such as the Asio, Bubo and Otus owls, these feathers form tufts which resemble ears. The inner ear has a cochlea, but it is not spiral as in mammals.\\" Answer:","completion":"Based on the given context, the birds that resemble humans more are the ones with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls. Step 1: Identify the key information in the context related to bird characteristics that can be compared to humans. In the given context, some key features mentioned are ultraviolet vision, eyelids, nictitating membrane, eye position, and ear structure. Step 2: Determine the features relevant to human resemblance. Humans do not have ultraviolet vision, do not possess a nictitating membrane, and have a different ear structure. Hence, these features cannot be used for comparison. However, eye position can be compared to humans, as both humans and some birds have forward-facing eyes. Step 3: Identify the bird group that shares a similar eye position with humans. The context mentions that birds with eyes on the front of their heads, such as owls, have binocular vision, similar to humans. Step 4: Conclude which bird type resembles humans more. Considering the eye position similarity, owls seem to resemble humans more as compared to other birds. Hence, the answer is that birds with forward-facing eyes, such as owls, resemble humans more due to their shared binocular vision and ability to estimate the depth of field."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the full name of the person who was classified legally as a Frenchman? Little is known for certain of Josquin's early life. Much is inferential and speculative, though numerous clues have emerged from his works and the writings of contemporary composers, theorists, and writers of the next several generations. Josquin was born in the area controlled by the Dukes of Burgundy, and was possibly born either in Hainaut (modern-day Belgium), or immediately across the border in modern-day France, since several times in his life he was classified legally as a Frenchman (for instance, when he made his will). Josquin was long mistaken for a man with a similar name, Josquin de Kessalia, born around the year 1440, who sang in Milan from 1459 to 1474, dying in 1498. More recent scholarship has shown that Josquin des Prez was born around 1450 or a few years later, and did not go to Italy until the early 1480s.Around 1466, perhaps on the death of his father, Josquin was named by his uncle and aunt, Gille Lebloitte dit Desprez and Jacque Banestonne, as their heir. Their will gives Josquin's actual surname as Lebloitte. According to Matthews and Merkley, \\"des Prez\\" was an alternative name.According to an account by Claude Hémeré, a friend and librarian of Cardinal Richelieu whose evidence dates as late as 1633, and who used the records of the collegiate church of Saint-Quentin, Josquin became a choirboy with his friend and colleague the Franco Flemish composer Jean Mouton at Saint-Quentin's royal church, probably around 1460. Doubt has been cast on the accuracy of Hémeré's account, however. Josquin may have studied counterpoint under Ockeghem, whom he greatly admired throughout his life: this is suggested both by the testimony of Gioseffo Zarlino and Lodovico Zacconi, writing later in the 16th century, and by Josquin's eloquent lament on the death of Ockeghem in 1497, Nymphes des bois/Requiem aeternam, based on the poem by Jean Molinet. All records from Saint-Quentin were destroyed in 1669; however the collegiate chapel there was a center of music-making for the entire area, and in addition was...

No; The product review is not positive. The title, \\"A snoozer,\\" already implies a negative connotation, meaning that the book was boring and not engaging. The reviewer mentions multiple issues with the book, such as too many storylines that did not mesh well, a suicide that was not relevant to the plot and did not evoke any concern from the characters, and several other similar examples of disconnected or purposeless elements in the book. Additionally, the reviewer expresses their disappointment with the ending, which they describe as uneventful and inconclusive. There is a sense of dissatisfaction with the fact that nothing is resolved or wrapped up in the story, leading to the book just abruptly ending.

On Wednesday afternoon, countless unsuspecting email users—including reporters from BuzzFeed, Hearst, New York Magazine, Vice, as well as your friends here at Gizmodo Media—received some seemingly legit invites to view a Google Docs file. The email doesn’t look quite right, but anyone who clicks through arrives at a login screen that looks almost indistinguishable from the same screen you’d see if someone actually invited you to a Google Doc. It’s the one with a list of your Google Accounts, and it even matches Google’s recent redesign. Advertisement What’s even scarier than that, the page has a very real-looking Google.com URL and clicking on a link to Google Docs appears to confirm the page’s authenticity. It gets worse. That page invites to choose which account you’d like to use to view the Google Doc, and then you’re taken to a page that invites you to grant access to your Google Account. Here’s what the whole attack looks like: Advertisement If you get an email that looks like the one above, delete it immediately. There’s a good chance that it will appear to have been sent by someone with a legit-looking email address. One Gizmodo reader even shared an email that had come from a .gov email address. This kind of thing is easy to spoof, however. There are a couple telltale signs that this email is bullshit. It’s addressed to “hhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com,” and the email itself doesn’t look quite like the ones that Google sends. That, and the fact that countless members of the media are reporting on Twitter that the email is a phishing scam. (The EFF told Joe Bernstein from BuzzFeed, where some of the earliest emails were spotted, that the attack was not intended to deliver malware but rather hijack credentials, another term for phishing.) It’s still unclear who’s behind this attack, and we might never know. If we learn anything new, we’ll update this post. We’ve reached out to Google for more information on the attack and will update this post if we hear back. Advertisement In the meantime, be safe out there. And maybe don’t click on any Google Doc links for the rest of the week. Update 4:35pm - Gmail has addressed the attack on Twitter: Advertisement Update 5:25pm - Google sent us the following statement by way of a PR agency: We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again. We encourage users to report phishing emails in Gmail. Update 10:40pm - Google sent us another statement, this time not from a PR agency but attributable directly to a Google spokesperson: We realize people are concerned about their Google accounts, and we’re now able to give a fuller explanation after further investigation. We have taken action to protect users against an email spam campaign impersonating Google Docs, which affected fewer than 0.1% of Gmail users. We protected users from this attack through a combination of automatic and manual actions, including removing the fake pages and applications, and pushing updates through Safe Browsing, Gmail, and other anti-abuse systems. We were able to stop the campaign within approximately one hour. While contact information was accessed and used by the campaign, our investigations show that no other data was exposed. There’s no further action users need to take regarding this event; users who want to review third party apps connected to their account can visit Google Security Checkup. ||||| A phishing email and a website masquerading as a legitimate Google service targeted thousands of people Wednesday, hoping they would supply personal information and spread the scam to others. The scheme appears to take advantage of technology that the search engine giant makes available to any website allowing people to log in to them with their Google username and password. The websites can get access to information people store with Google, including their contacts. In Wednesday’s scam, a sham website was labeled “Google Docs,” confusing people who believed they were on the real document-writing and -sharing platform. Instead, the fake Google Docs uses the newly gained list of contacts to send spam. To read this article in Spanish, click here Recipients may think a contact is sharing a Google-stored document. But clicking the link opens up the fake Google Docs website, further spreading the ploy. One way to know whether you have received a fraudulent Google Docs link: the “to” field in the phishing e-mail shows the address hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh@mailinator.com. It’s unclear whether the scam is harvesting any information from duped consumers or why Google approved a business bearing its name to use the technology. Google responded only with a statement that said: “We have taken action to protect users against an email impersonating Google Docs, and have disabled offending accounts. We’ve removed the fake pages, pushed updates through Safe Browsing, and our abuse team is working to prevent this kind of spoofing from happening again.” People caught in the scheme can remove the scammers’ access to their Google accounts in their account settings.

Write a title: A family tug-of-war over whether to reveal Yasser Arafat #39;s cause of death bubbled over in public yesterday, with a brother of the late leader insisting the Palestinian people are entitled to know.","completion":"Title: Torn Between Truth and Legacy: The Struggle Within Yasser Arafat's Family Over Unveiling the Hidden Cause of His Death Introduction: The quest for answers behind the mysterious death of iconic Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat has been an ongoing debate ever since his sudden demise in 2004. Surrounded by an enigma, Arafat's cause of death has puzzled the world and raised numerous conspiracy theories over the years. Amidst all the chaos, the latest development involving a family tug-of-war has emerged, as Arafat's brother calls for disclosing the truth to the Palestinian people. As the tension within the family bubbles over in public, the dilemma between revealing the truth and preserving a legacy becomes more persistent. Background: Yasser Arafat, born in 1929, was a significant symbol for the Palestinian people, as he fought for their right to self-determination for several decades. As the leader of Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and later the President of the Palestinian Authority, Arafat became a cornerstone of Palestinian politics. However, his sudden death at the age of 75 raised many questions, as no clear cause of death was given. Rumors and Speculations: Several conspiracy theories have circulated since Arafat's death, with one suggesting his mysterious illness had been due to poisoning, possibly carried out by Israel. In 2012, an investigation conducted by Al Jazeera discovered traces of Polonium-210, a highly toxic radioactive substance, on Arafat's personal belongings. This finding further fueled the rumors of foul play. The Family's Involvement: Despite numerous calls for further investigation into Arafat's death, the family was initially hesitant to authorize an exhumation of his remains to reveal the cause of death definitively. Suha Arafat, his widow, played a significant role in this decision, as she wanted to protect the image of her husband and avoid any political exploitation of his death. She believed that Arafat's legacy was more important than finding a definitive cause of his death. The Public Tug-of-War: In recent developments, Yasser Arafat's brother, Fathi Arafat, has insisted that the Palestinian people are entitled to know the truth behind their leader's death. The family disagreement became public as other family members, such as Nasser al-Qidwa, Arafat's nephew, sided with Fathi, highlighting the importance of shedding light on the cause of death even if it tarnishes Arafat's image. Conclusion: The ongoing struggle within Yasser Arafat's family over revealing his cause of death reflects a deeper conflict between the need for transparency and the desire to protect their loved one's legacy. With emotions running high and the Palestinian people eager for the truth, it remains to be seen whether the family eventually decides to reveal the mysterious cause of their beloved leader's death. Until then, the debate surrounding Arafat's demise continues, leaving not only his family but also the world in an unresolved tug-of-war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As a general rule, start with a 10 to 12 ft (3.0 to 3.7 m) long truck if you’re moving 1 room’s worth of stuff and add 2 to 3 ft (0.61 to 0.91 m) for each additional room you plan on packing. For small loads, you may be able to rent a pickup truck or cargo van instead of a full moving truck. If you need to haul a large object like a car or tractor, make sure your truck comes with a trailer hitch. Your search results will show you a number of different rental stores located near your house. Most of your options will be national franchises like U-Haul, Penske, and Enterprise, though some areas may have small mom-and-pop rental shops as well. Chain stores have more locations than independent businesses, so go with them if you plan on traveling far away. Before committing to a specific rental company, look at how much each store charges for the type of truck you want. Some stores offer rental estimates through their official website, though others may require you to call their customer hotline for current pricing information. When comparing prices, keep in mind that some companies charge an additional fee for each mile you drive. Make sure you look at each company’s website to see if there are any promotional discounts available, and don’t forget to search online for third-party coupons from groups like AAA. Depending on the company you’re renting from, you may need to reserve your truck in advance. You can typically do this in person, through the store’s official website, or by calling the store’s customer hotline. To reserve your truck, you’ll have to know the dates you need it for, where you want to pick it up from, and where you want to return it to. In some cases, making your reservation early can lock you into lower rental rates.","completion":"When renting a truck for moving purposes, the primary focus should be on the size of the truck.

Tess and Finn follow the clues to an ancient church and discover a diary describing the location of the treasure. Bigg Bunny and his associates, who have been following Tess and Finn, take Tess hostage and assume (incorrectly) that Finn was killed. Bigg Bunny forces Tess to aid him in the search for the treasure in a blowhole, the location revealed in the diary. Tess finds the treasure in a cave beneath the blowhole. Meanwhile, Finn and the Honeycutts enlist the help of Moe in taking the treasure out of Bigg Bunny's hands.

On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - A tributary or affluent is a stream or river that flows into a larger stream or main stem (or parent) river or a lake. A tributary does not flow directly into a sea or ocean. Tributaries and the main stem river drain the surrounding drainage basin of its surface water and groundwater, leading the water out into an ocean. - Malawi (or ; or [maláwi]), officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. It is bordered by Zambia to the northwest, Tanzania to the northeast, and Mozambique on the east, south and west. The country is separated from Tanzania and Mozambique by Lake Malawi. Malawi is over with an estimated population of 16,777,547 (July 2013 est.). Its capital is Lilongwe, which is also Malawi's largest city; the second largest is Blantyre, the third is Mzuzu and the fourth largest is its old capital Zomba. The name Malawi comes from the Maravi, an old name of the Nyanja people that inhabit the area. The country is also nicknamed \\"The Warm Heart of Africa\\". - Tanzania , officially the United Republic of Tanzania, is a country in Eastern Africa within the African Great Lakes region. Parts of the country are in Southern Africa. It is bordered by Kenya and Uganda to the north; Rwanda, Burundi, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo to the west; Zambia, Malawi, and Mozambique to the south; and by the Indian Ocean to the east. Mount Kilimanjaro, Africa's highest mountain, is in northeastern Tanzania. - The Dwangwa River in Malawi is a tributary river for Lake Nyasa . It flows for approximately 100 miles ( 160 km ) . The river 's source is in the Kasungu National Park , in Malawi 's central plateau . It flows north - easterly from this plateau through an ancient valley . The river 's mouth flows out of a more recently cut gorge , into the Lake . It also flows through the Bana Swamp The Dwangwa River is used both for irrigation and the generation of hydroelectric power . It is a fishing river , with prawns found in the river . - Mozambique (or ), officially the Republic of Mozambique (or \\"\\") is a country in Southeast Africa bordered by the Indian Ocean to the east, Tanzania to the north, Malawi and Zambia to the northwest, Zimbabwe to the west, and Swaziland and South Africa to the southwest. It is separated from Madagascar by the Mozambique Channel to the east. The capital and largest city is Maputo (known as \\"Lourenço Marques\\" before independence). - Lake Malawi, also known as Lake Nyasa in Tanzania and Lago Niassa in Mozambique, is an African Great Lake and the southernmost lake in the East African Rift system, located between Malawi, Mozambique and Tanzania. It is the ninth largest lake in the world and the third largest and second deepest lake in Africa. It is home to more species of fish than any other lake, including about 1000 species of cichlids. The Mozambique portion of the lake was officially declared a reserve by the Government of Mozambique on June 10, 2011,while in Malawi a portion of the lake is included in Lake Malawi National Park. Lake Malawi is a meromictic lake, meaning that its water layers do not mix. The permanent stratification of Lake Malawi's water and the oxic-anoxic boundary (relating to oxygen in the water) are maintained by moderately small chemical and thermal gradients. - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River. - \\"Main Stem\\" is 1942 instrumental by Duke Ellington and His Famous Orchestra.

These beautiful plants can thrive in your garden with proper care and attention. In this article, we will discuss some essential care tips to help you maintain healthy and vibrant gardenias, including watering, mulching, feeding, misting, pruning, and protecting them from pests and cold snaps. Step 1: Watering To ensure your gardenias receive adequate hydration, it's important to water them with an inch of water once a week. This will provide the necessary moisture for their root system, promoting healthy growth and preventing the soil from drying out too much. Keep in mind that over-watering or under-watering can cause problems, so be consistent in providing the right amount of water weekly. Step 2: Mulching Applying a 2-inch (5.1 cm) layer of organic mulch around the base of your gardenias serves several purposes. Mulch helps retain moisture in the soil, regulates temperature, and suppresses weeds that might compete with your gardenias for water and nutrients. Moreover, as the mulch breaks down, it provides additional organic matter and nutrients to the soil, enhancing the overall health of your gardenias. Step 3: Feeding Gardenias require nutrient-rich soil with a slightly acidic pH. To achieve this, feed your gardenias with acid fertilizer twice per year. This will replenish the essential nutrients they need to grow and bloom, while also maintaining the acidity level of the soil. Be sure to follow the manufacturer's instructions on the fertilizer package. Step 4: Misting Misting your gardenias daily with a spray bottle helps maintain the humidity levels they prefer. This is especially important in dry or arid environments where the air lacks sufficient moisture. Regular misting can also help prevent common issues such as leaf drop or bud drop by providing the necessary moisture to the plant. Step 5: Pruning Pruning your gardenias helps maintain a tidy appearance, encourages new growth, and allows for better air circulation. Remove any dead or damaged branches, and shape the plant as desired. Be mindful not to overprune your gardenias, as this can negatively impact their growth and overall health. Step 6: Monitoring and Managing Pests Monitor your gardenias for common pests such as whiteflies and mealybugs. If you notice infestations, try using insecticidal soap or horticultural oil to eliminate these pests without harming the plant. Always follow the product's label instructions and avoid spraying during extreme heat or direct sunlight. Step 7: Protecting from Cold Snaps Gardenias can be sensitive to cold temperatures, especially during winter. To protect them from frost or freezing temperatures, cover your gardenias with a blanket or a cardboard box during cold snaps. This will provide insulation and help maintain a stable temperature for your gardenias, preventing potential freezing damage. Conclusion: With proper care and attention, your gardenias can thrive and provide you with their striking beauty and alluring fragrance for years to come. By following these essential care tips, you can ensure that your gardenias remain healthy, vibrant, and a gorgeous addition to your garden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

An international panel","completion":"Title: The Time Paradox Candidate Genre: Sci-Fi/Action/Thriller Plot Summary: In the not-too-distant future, an international panel of experts known as the Global Time Commission (GTC) is formed to regulate the use of a groundbreaking time-travel machine that has the potential to alter the course of history. The panel is responsible for selecting candidates to perform time-travel missions that may solve critical global problems, including climate change, resource depletion and war. Their latest mission, codenamed Operation Proteus, is designed to prevent a catastrophic event that could lead to the complete collapse of human civilization. Main Characters: 1. Dr. Charles Thompson - Renowned physicist and inventor of the time-travel machine. 2. Agent Sarah Meyers - Skilled MI6 operative and candidate chosen by the GTC to travel back in time for Operation Proteus. 3. Chairman Ming Wu - Head of the GTC, responsible for ensuring the missions run smoothly and ethically. 4. Dr. Maria Rodriguez - A highly empathetic and critical ethics expert on the GTC, who ensures the panel makes moral decisions. 5. Sebastien Devereaux - An egotistical rival scientist hell-bent on sabotaging the work of Dr. Thompson. Plot: Dr. Charles Thompson discovers the secret to time travel and creates a machine capable of sending people back in time. The world is awestruck, but the potential for misuse is enormous. To prevent chaos, the United Nations forms the Global Time Commission (GTC), an international panel comprising scientists, military strategists, and ethicists who are responsible for choosing candidates to travel in the machine. With an urgent mission to prevent an imminent global catastrophe, the GTC selects Agent Sarah Meyers as their time-travel candidate. Agent Meyers has a distinguished background involving high-risk situations and extreme decision-making. She is brought to the GTC headquarters, where she undergoes training and learns about her target – an individual whose critical action in the past would unleash a devastating sequence of events in the present if not prevented. As Sarah prepares for the mission, she forms a close bond with Dr. Maria Rodriguez, a member of the GTC who helps her understand the moral and intellectual challenges posed by altering history. Meanwhile, Dr. Thompson faces pressure from the ambitious and ruthless scientist, Sebastien Devereaux, who aims to undermine the project and seize control of the time-travel technology for his own nefarious purposes. This sets off a tense conflict within the GTC and raises the stakes for the mission. The mission Day arrives, and Sarah is sent back in time. With limited time and resources, she has to navigate the complexities of the past and identify the crucial decision made by the target individual. As she moves closer to locating the target, Sarah discovers shocking information that casts new light on the GTC's motives, and she begins to question whether the mission is as noble as it seems. Back in the present, Dr. Thompson and Dr. Rodriguez suspect foul play as they uncover Devereaux's plan to manipulate the mission and rewrite history for personal gain. They race against time to inform Sarah and help her undermine Devereaux's scheme. This parallel action between the past and the present culminates in a thrilling climax, as Sarah faces the final decision to complete or to abort the mission, which may not only have the power to change global history but also challenge the core values of humanity itself. With twists and turns that keep audiences on the edge of their seats, 'The Time Paradox Candidate' is an enthralling exploration of the ethical and philosophical challenges raised by the prospect of time travel, power, and human responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fred McFeely Rogers (March 20, 1928 - February 27, 2003) was an American television personality, musician, puppeteer, writer, producer, and Presbyterian minister. Rogers was famous for creating, hosting and composing the theme music for the educational preschool television series Mister Rogers' Neighborhood (1968-2001), which featured his kind-hearted grandfatherly personality, and direct connection to his audiences. Originally trained and ordained as a minister, Rogers was displeased with the way television addressed children at the time, and made an effort to change this when he began to write for and perform on local Pittsburgh-area shows dedicated to youth. Rogers developed his own show on WQED in 1968, and it was distributed nationwide by Eastern Educational Television Network. Rogers was born in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, 40 miles (65 km) southeast of Pittsburgh, to James and Nancy Rogers; he had one sister, Elaine. Early in life, he spent much of his free time with his maternal grandfather, Fred McFeely, who had an interest in music. He would often sing along as his mother would play the piano, and he himself began playing at five. He obtained a pilot's license while still in high school. Rogers graduated from Latrobe High School (1946). He studied at Dartmouth College (1946-48), then transferred to Rollins College in Winter Park, Florida, where he earned a B.A. in Music Composition in 1951. Rogers was also a trained general aviation pilot. At Rollins, he met Sara Joanne Byrd (born c. 1928), an Oakland, Florida, native; they married on June 9, 1952. They had two sons, James (b. 1959) and John (b. 1961). In 1963, Rogers graduated from Pittsburgh Theological Seminary and was ordained a minister in the United Presbyterian Church in the U.S.A. Rogers had an apartment in New York City and a summer home on Nantucket island in Massachusetts. Rogers was red-green color blind, swam every morning, and neither smoked nor drank. He was a vegetarian on ethical grounds, stating \\"I don't want to eat anything that has a mother.\\" Despite recurring rumors, he never served in the military. His office at WQED Pittsburgh famously did not have a desk, only a sofa and armchairs, because Rogers thought a desk was \\"too much of a barrier\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: what did he do instead of serving in the military?","completion":"Instead of serving in the military, Fred Rogers studied at Dartmouth College, transferred to Rollins College, and earned a B.A. in Music Composition.

But the threat wasn’t over, a sixth fatality was discovered, and public safety officials remained cautious about allowing the 38,000 evacuees to return home. Fire fighting conditions improved in and around Redding, as winds stayed calm throughout the day. “We are very encouraged with the fire status in the city today,” said Cal Fire incident manager Bret Gouvea in an afternoon press briefing. “We’ve had no movement on the fire over the last day inside the city limits.” Even so, the death toll from the fire grew. Shasta County Sheriff Tom Bosenko said a sixth person had been found dead Sunday. He wouldn’t say where the person died but added that the victim had received an evacuation notice but didn’t leave. In addition, seven people in Redding remain missing, he said. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. SIGN ME UP! The deadly blaze, which had chewed through 95,000 acres, began surging into Trinity County, where the tiny community of Lewiston, with a population of about 1,100, was evacuated late Saturday. Gouvea said firefighters were struggling to contain the fire around a 100-mile perimeter, but added: “We’re feeling a lot more optimistic today as we’re starting to make up some ground instead of being on the defensive.” Containment grew from 5 percent to 17 percent late Sunday. Still, Gouvea said that wind and weather patterns remain unpredictable and “the fire does continue to grow on us in some remote areas.” Late Sunday more evacuations were ordered, stretching from the Buckhorn Summit Road area west of Whiskeytown Lake well into eastern Trinity County. Just two days earlier, public safety officials were urging residents to be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice. On Sunday, their plea to the thousands who fled was markedly different: Be patient about going home. “We care about you, and we are moving as fast as we can to get you back into your homes,” said Mike Hebrard, the Shasta County fire chief. “We understand how that feels, a lot of us are evacuated as well. We are clearing areas and making it safe as fast as we can.” The Shasta County Sheriff’s Department did lift evacuation orders late Saturday for the Redding Ranchettes area, just south of the Win-River Casino. But officials were adamant about issuing a mass “re-population” order for the bulk of the evacuees. Leonard Moty, a county supervisor who’s among the evacuees, added: “Let the fire personnel make it safe before you go back.” There have been scattered reports of looting, and National Guard troops have been stationed at multiple road blocks around the city. Roger Moore, Redding’s police chief, said the department had beefed up patrol and will arrest people who can’t show a reason for being in an evacuated neighborhood. “If we don’t arrest them for looting, we’ll arrest them for something else,” he said. “We are nipping it in the bud before it happens.” He said someone was arrested late Saturday on an illegal weapons charge.

Orange circles have burned in the past 12 to 24 hours, and yellow circles have burned within the past 48 hours. Yellow areas represent the fire perimeter. Source: National Interagency Fire Center The evacuees, meanwhile, were trying to remain patient. At the Shasta College evacuation center, Otis Bershers, 75, was waiting anxiously for word that he and his wife, Carol, could return to their home in the city of Shasta Lake, north of Redding. They’ve been sleeping on cots on the lawn outside the college since late Thursday, and Otis Bershers is starting to run low on his medication. He has the chronic lung condition known as COPD, and breathing the smoky air isn’t good for him. But he declined an offer to go to the hospital and said he wouldn’t leave his wife or their cat, Smokey, who was tethered to their cots. “God, I hope they lift it on my place,” he said of the evacuation order. “I want to go home. But as long as I got my cat and her, I can’t go wrong.” Stuart and Renee Bailey, sitting in their SUV outside their west Redding subdivision, were anxious to return home as well. Their property escaped the fire, and Stuart Bailey, a contractor, was hoping to stop in to pick up some tools for work. The couple also wanted to see if the home had been looted. Law enforcement personnel turned them away. But the Baileys said they understood the need to be cautious. When another couple got miffed at being denied entry to the neighborhood, the Baileys told them to stay calm. “Cut them some slack,” Stuart Bailey said, referring to the law enforcement officials. “You’ll get in sooner or later.” The re-population process will be slow and will start with the areas that Cal Fire believes are safest from potential return of the fire, officials said. “We don’t want to allow (people) back in, then if conditions change, have to re-evacuate,” Bosenko said. “We can’t open the floodgates. We have to do it in segments.” Utility crews are fixing gas lines and performing other repairs in preparation for re-population. By Sunday afternoon, Redding Electric Utility had restored power to 7,400 customers, leaving 600 without power, said utility director Dan Beans. PG&E crews were fanning out in evacuated neighborhoods to conduct a crucial re-population task: Cutting off gas lines at burnt-out homes that sit next to homes that were untouched by the fire. The fire was creating chaos at times along portions of the power grid in Shasta and Trinity counties. The U.S. Bureau of Reclamation had to evacuate personnel from hydro power plants in both counties, including massive Shasta Dam. “We’ve been working really hard to keep the power on,” said Reclamation spokeswoman Erin Curtis. “It’s a region-wide issue that we’re dealing with across the fire area.” Cal Fire said 884 buildings had been destroyed, including 657 homes. The six people who have died include Melody Bledsoe, 70, and her two great-grandchildren, Emily, 4, and James, 5. The fire has also claimed Redding fire inspector Jeremy Stoke, 37, and private bulldozer operator Don Ray Smith, 81. A GoFundMe account has been established for the Bledsoe family. A little more than 1,100 had been raised by Sunday afternoon. Temperatures in Redding were anticipated to remain uncomfortably high: 104 degrees Monday, 105 on Tuesday, according to the National Weather Service. A community meeting was scheduled for 4 p.m. Monday at the Redding Civic Auditorium. ||||| Burned vehicles sit in front of a wildfire-ravaged home, Sunday, July 29, 2018, in Redding, Calif.

(AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez) (Associated Press) REDDING, Calif. (AP) — The Latest on fires in California (all times local): 11 p.m. Authorities have arrested two people on suspicion of looting homes that had been evacuated due to an explosive wildfire. The Sacramento Bee reports that 25-year-old Jade Ball and 19-year-old Jack Fannin, of Redding, were found with what police said was evidence tying them to several burglaries. The so-called Carr Fire prompted mandatory evacuations for tens of thousands of people in Redding, a city hundreds of miles north of San Francisco. It has destroyed over 650 houses. Authorities say a homeowner who stayed behind flagged down an officer after he noticed evidence that people had been in his house. Officers found a nearby home with evidence of a broken-in door and discovered electronic items stacked by the front door. Police say they do not believe the homeowners placed the items like that before evacuating. ___ 10:45 p.m. Thousands more are fleeing their homes after wildfires surged near a small lake town in Northern California while farther north firefighters made progress in a battle against a deadly blaze. Crews stretched to their limits across the state are fighting flames that have claimed the lives of two firefighters and six civilians. Residents of the waterfront town Lakeport fled Sunday after a major flare-up of two fires that combined across Mendocino and Lake counties destroyed at least four homes. Lakeport, home to about 5,000, is around 120 miles north of San Francisco. To the northeast, a massive fire near Redding slowed for the first time since days of explosive growth. Meanwhile officials said a second firefighter died fighting a huge blaze to the south near Yosemite National Park. |||||Summary:","completion":"There was a big fire in a city called Redding in California, and it caused a lot of trouble for the people living there. The fire has been very dangerous, and at least six people have died because of it. Many people had to leave their homes to be safe, and firefighters are working very hard to try to stop the fire and help everyone. The weather has been very hot which has made it even more difficult to put out the fire. The people who had to leave their homes are waiting to go back, but authorities want to make sure it's safe for them before they return."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Oklo in Gabon, Africa is the only known place in the world where what reaction occurs naturally? What is the answer?","completion":"Oklo, Gabon, Africa is the only known place in the world where natural nuclear fission reactions have been documented to occur naturally. Here's the explanation: The phenomenon was discovered at the Oklo uranium mines in 1972. These natural nuclear reactors are estimated to be about 2 billion years old. Around this period, concentration of U-235, a fissile isotope of uranium, was significantly higher (~3%) which is sufficient to support a chain reaction. The reactors were found to have operated for a few hundred thousand years, producing about 5 kW of heat continuously in that duration. In the reactors, uranium underwent spontaneous fission, releasing energy and creating byproducts similar to those produced in a typical nuclear reactor. This is considered a remarkable natural phenomenon and no other such locations have been discovered elsewhere to this day. This might be a fact relatively unknown or interesting to many people as it's a unique natural occurrence and not a common topic of discussion."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: The drive up to Rick's place in the hills always made me sick.

He claims Danish agency recruited him to work with CIA. PET said it had nothing to do with Anwar al-Awlaki operation.","completion":"Title: A Double Agent's Journey: How Morten Storm turned from Radical Islamism to Becoming a Vital Link for the CIA Introduction The world of espionage and covert operations has long been fascinated with the notion of double agents. These are individuals who often lead dangerous lives, playing both sides of the coin and risking everything for their cause. Morten Storm is one such individual, and his story is nothing short of remarkable. The radical Islamist-turned-double agent claims that he was recruited by the Danish agency PET to work alongside the CIA in an effort to dismantle some of the most insidious networks within the extremist jihadist movement. Despite PET stating that it had no involvement in the Anwar al-Awlaki operation, Storm's tale sheds light on the inner workings of the secret world where terrorism, intelligence, and deception collide. Morten Storm: From Radical Islamism to Double Agent Storm's career within the realm of radical Islamist groups began with his conversion to Islam in the late 1990s. A troubled individual with a violent past, he found solace and a sense of purpose within the teachings of the religion, soon becoming a radicalized figure. He established strong ties with extremist networks and jihadist figures and managed to ascend the ranks within these organizations. His unique set of skills and knowledge would eventually make him a valuable asset to the intelligence community. According to Storm, his life took a sharp turn when he was approached by the Danish intelligence agency PET. Recognizing his potential value as a double agent, they offered him the opportunity to turn against the radical groups he had once supported. With his unmatched access to key figures and knowledge of jihadist operations, Storm was a unique asset that the CIA and other intelligence agencies could use to infiltrate and dismantle these dangerous networks. Storm's Involvement with the Anwar Al-Awlaki Operation In his claims, Storm played a pivotal role in the operation against Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical Yemeni-American cleric who was considered one of the masterminds behind numerous terrorist plots, including the failed Christmas Day bombing in 2009. Awlaki was also known for his links with Al-Qaeda and his influential online sermons, which helped radicalize countless individuals worldwide. Storm's account suggests that he was able to establish contact with Awlaki and even deliver a tracking device inside a flash drive, which eventually led to the location and killing of the high-profile target by a U.S. drone strike in September 2011. This controversial operation, hailed as a major success in the fight against terrorism, has been shrouded in secrecy due to its implications on the use of targeted killings and extrajudicial methods. The PET's Denial of Involvement Despite Storm's claims that PET actively recruited him to work with the CIA and that they played a crucial role in the Anwar al-Awlaki operation, the Danish intelligence agency has officially denied any such involvement. The agency has maintained that it merely passed on information regarding Morten Storm's activities to its international partners, insinuating that any collaboration or recruitment may have been solely between Storm and the CIA. Conclusion Morten Storm's story reveals the intricate web of connections, deceit, and manipulation that forms the backbone of the intelligence world. The alleged collaboration between the PET and the CIA, along with the subsequent denial, raises further questions about the ethical and legal implications of such covert operations and collaborations. As the fight against terrorism continues, the use of double agents like Storm becomes even more valuable in gathering vital information and taking down extremist networks. While the full extent of Storm's contribution to the war on terror may never be fully known, his tale only adds to the mystique surrounding the secret world of espionage and double agents."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What sign of the zodiac would you be if you were born on St. Valentine's Day?","completion":"If you were born on St. Valentine's Day, which is celebrated on February 14th, you would fall under the zodiac sign of Aquarius. Aquarius is the eleventh sign of the zodiac and is an air sign, symbolized by the Water Bearer. Individuals born between January 20th and February 18th are considered to be under this sign. Aquarius is known for being a sign of innovation, intellect, and originality. People born under this sign are often independent thinkers, philosophers, and visionaries who constantly seek new ideas and knowledge. They are drawn to humanitarian causes and are advocates for social change. They are typically perceived as being open-minded and altruistic, with a strong sense of morality and a desire to build a better world. Aquarians are ruled by the planet Uranus, which is associated with invention, rebellion, and progress. This influence makes Aquarians natural innovators and trailblazers, often pushing boundaries and challenging the status quo. They have a deep sense of curiosity and are driven to explore the unknown, further contributing to their often unorthodox and unique perspectives. In terms of personality traits, Aquarians tend to be highly intelligent, inventive, and creative. This sign values personal freedom and detests feeling restricted or confined in any way. They are extroverted and social, often surrounded by a diverse group of friends who are drawn to their unique energy and magnetic personality. They are great communicators and listeners, which helps them understand and empathize with others, no matter their background. On the flip side, Aquarians can sometimes be perceived as somewhat detached or aloof, as they may find it challenging to express their emotions openly. They may appear unemotional, even cold at times, but this is primarily due to their preference for rationality and logic over sentimentality. This rationality can also be a double-edged sword, as it may lead them to be seen as stubborn or inflexible in their opinions and ideas. In love and relationships, Aquarians tend to be very independent and can be hesitant to commit fully to anyone. They value their space and autonomy and are happiest with a partner who understands and respects their need for freedom. However, once they do commit, they can be deeply loyal and dedicated, always striving for growth and understanding within the partnership. In summary, if you were born on St. Valentine's Day, you would be an Aquarius, a sign known for its intelligence, creativity, and humanitarian nature. Your natural strengths lie in your ability to innovate, think critically, and communicate effectively with others. As an Aquarius, you would often be driven by your curiosity and desire to push boundaries, making you a true trailblazer in your own right."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

However, as Bloom learns more about their relationship, he realizes there is a darker side, with possible hidden motives and unexplained tension. While investigating Robert, Bloom finds out that Robert has significant gambling debts, and Allison's family wealth could have been a potential source of funds to bail him out. However, Allison was planning to cut ties with her fiancé before her disappearance, having discovered his misdeeds. Bloom's search leads him to a quirky artist, Tess, who unknowingly holds key evidence to the case. Allison had secretly commissioned a portrait from Tess that inadvertently captured Robert in the background, arguing with a shady loanshark. This leads Bloom to realize that the loanshark could also be involved in Allison's disappearance. As Bloom digs deeper, he starts receiving anonymous threats, warning him to drop the case.

Movie plot title: The Three Musketeers Movie plot: Callow youth D'Artagnan (Walter Abel) sets off from Gascony for Paris, armed with his father's sword, an old horse and a letter of introduction to his godfather, Captain de Treville (Lumsden Hare), commander of the King's Musketeers. Along the way, he attempts to rescue Milady de Winter (Margot Grahame) from highwaymen, but it turns out she came to meet their leader, the Count de Rochefort (Ian Keith). When Rochefort insults D'Artagnan, the latter insists on a duel. Instead, Rochefort has his men knock D'Artagnan out, while he blackmails Lady de Winter into helping him in his plot to seize power. Upon reaching Paris, D'Artagnan is dismayed to learn from de Treville that he must serve two years as a cadet or perform \\"extraordinary deeds of valor\\" before he can become a Musketeer. Then he spots Rochefort on the street. In his haste to confront his enemy, D'Artagnan unintentionally insults three Musketeers: Athos (Paul Lukas), Porthos (Moroni Olsen), and Aramis (Onslow Stevens) in turn, agreeing each time to a duel. When his opponents arrive at the appointed place, they are amused to discover they are all engaged to cross swords with the same man. However, Cardinal Richelieu's Guards try to arrest the Musketeers for dueling. D'Artagnan joins the outnumbered trio and acquits himself well. His three new friends secure him free lodging by threatening landlord Bernajou (Murray Kinnell) with an imaginary law and find him a servant named Planchet (John Qualen). That night, D'Artagnan is pleasantly surprised when Bernajou's ward Constance (Heather Angel) enters the room. It turns out that it is actually her chamber, though she is rarely there, as she spends most of her time at the palace as lady-in-waiting to the Queen. Constance has arranged a rendezvous between Queen Anne (Rosamond Pinchot) and her lover, the English Duke of Buckingham (Ralph Forbes).

What is the name of the person that painted the Pleasure at the Helm? Answer the above question based on the context below: Failing to sell at the Summer Exhibition, The Combat was bought from Etty by fellow artist John Martin for 300 guineas (about £24,000 in 2019 terms), following a promise Martin had made to Etty before the painting was complete. The painting was too large for Martin's house, and in 1831 he sold it on to the Royal Scottish Academy. It was transferred in 1910 to the nearby National Gallery of Scotland where it remains. One of Etty's major works, it was exhibited at numerous major exhibitions including the seminal Art Treasures Exhibition of 1857, before Etty fell out of fashion in the second half of the 19th century. Throughout his life, The Combat continued to be considered one of Etty's most powerful paintings. In 1845, Etty took a smaller 89 by 118 cm (35 by 46 in) copy of The Combat, which had been painted by an unknown Edinburgh artist, and completely reworked it to serve as the basis for an engraving by George Thomas Doo. The engraving was published three years later, and the painting used as its model passed through the hands of several collectors in subsequent years, before entering the collection of the Ringling Museum in 1934. A number of sketches attributed to Etty, under the name of A Study for Mercy Interceding for the Vanquished, are also in circulation.After the success of The Combat, Etty continued with his preferred theme of history paintings containing nudity; of the 15 pictures he exhibited at the Royal Academy during the 1820s (including Cleopatra, Pandora and The Combat) all but one contained a nude figure. He was elected a full Royal Academician in 1828, at that time the most prestigious honour available to an artist. The Combat was the first very large work attempted by Etty, and its success prompted him to produce further works on a similar scale over the rest of his career; he produced nine very large paintings illustrating moral themes throughout his career. As time went by his canvases came to be increasingly dominated by nude women.The 1832 exhibition of Youth on the Prow, and...","completion":"Based on the context provided, the name of the person that painted \\"The Combat\\" is William Etty.

The Indian ocean hosts a large concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer. The Pacific ocean has less phytoplankton and nutrients for marine life. and a hint : Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean hosts one of the largest concentration of phytoplankton blooms in summer, due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing leads to a strong coastal and open ocean upwelling, which introduces nutrients into the upper zones where sufficient light is available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. These phytoplankton blooms support the marine ecosystem, as the base of the marine food web, and eventually the larger fish species. The Indian Ocean accounts for the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch. Its fish are of great and growing importance to the bordering countries for domestic consumption and export. Fishing fleets from Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly for shrimp and tuna.Research indicates that increasing ocean temperatures are taking a toll on the marine ecosystem. A study on the phytoplankton changes in the Indian Ocean indicates a decline of up to 20% in the marine phytoplankton in the Indian Ocean, during the past six decades. The tuna catch rates have also declined abruptly during the past half century, mostly due to increased industrial fisheries, with the ocean warming adding further stress to the fish species.Endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales.An Indian Ocean garbage patch was discovered in 2010 covering at least 5 million square kilometres (1.9 million square miles). Riding the southern Indian Ocean Gyre, this vortex of plastic garbage constantly circulates the ocean from Australia to Africa, down the Mozambique Channel, and back to Australia in a period of six years, except for debris that get indefinitely stuck in the centre of the gyre.The garbage patch in the Indian Ocean will, according to a 2012 study, decrease in size after several decades to vanish completely over centuries.

Please answer this question : Which ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing? A:","completion":"The Indian Ocean experiences more monsoonal wind forcing compared to the Pacific Ocean. Among the tropical oceans, the western Indian Ocean is known for having one of the largest concentrations of phytoplankton blooms in summer, primarily due to the strong monsoon winds. The monsoonal wind forcing in the Indian Ocean leads to significant coastal and open ocean upwelling, introducing nutrients into the upper zones where there is enough light available for photosynthesis and phytoplankton production. As a result, these phytoplankton blooms play a crucial role in supporting the marine ecosystem, serving as the base of the marine food web, and ultimately supporting larger fish species. The monsoonal winds in the Indian Ocean are an essential factor contributing to the second largest share of the most economically valuable tuna catch in the world. This abundant marine life is crucial for the bordering countries, both for domestic consumption and export, and attracts fishing fleets from countries like Russia, Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan, who mostly exploit the Indian Ocean for shrimp and tuna.

Article: Ice sculpting is a difficult process . First , ice must be carefully selected so that it is suitable for sculpting . Its ideal material is pure , clean water with high clarity . It should also have the minimum(=least) number of air bubbles. Perfectly clear ice blocks weighing 140 kg and measuring 100 cmx50 cmx25 cm are available from the Clinebell Company in Colorado . Much larger clear blocks are produced in Europe and Canada or harvested from a frozen river in Sweden . These large ice blocks are used for large ice sculpting events and for building ice hotels. Another difficulty in the process of ice sculpting is time control . The temperature of the environment affects how quickly the piece must be completed to avoid the effects of melting . If the sculpting does not take place in a cold environment , then the sculptor must work quickly to finish his piece . The tools used for sculpting also affect when the task can be finished . Some sculptures can be completed in as little as ten minutes if power tools are used . Ice sculptors also use sharp chisels that are specifically designed for cutting ice . The best ice chisels are made in Japan , a country that , along with China , has a long tradition of magnificent ice sculptures . Ice sculptures are used as decorations in some cuisines , especially in Asia . When holding a dinner party , some large restaurants or hotels will use an ice sculpture to decorate the table . For example , in a wedding banquet it is common to see a pair of ice-sculpted swans that represent the union of the new couple . Question: What kind of ice is ideal for sculpting ?

Movie title: Aladdin Context: The story begins when a young boy named Aladdin is wandering the streets of his city in search of some sort of employment. Aladdin walks up to a seemingly noble man offering to be his servant for one day for the price of three eggs, however, the man rejects the offer even when Aladdin offers to work for the price of two or even just one egg. In another part of the Arabic city, a mysterious traveler by the name of Haseem seeks the advice and guidance of the city's medicine woman, Fatima. She tells him that the man he is looking for, the one who will help him obtain the treasure he seeks, is a humble young boy by the name of Aladdin. Haseem goes in search of the boy and finds him returning home to his mother bringing her cabbages and watches as he alone defeats three boys that had come to bother and humiliate him. Haseem congratulates Aladdin for his victory, telling him that he fights just as good as his father; for he had known him, Haseem said, for he was his brother and therefore, Aladdin's uncle. That night, the stranger Haseem is welcomed at Aladdin's home by his mother and together, the three of them enjoy a big feast given to them by their new relative. Haseem promises that from now on, neither Aladdin nor his mother shall be hungry ever again and both are delighted. The next morning, Aladdin and his uncle walk a long way to a place where Haseem said he and his brother had played when they were young. Haseem spots the right place when he finds three palm trees that grow as one and a camel made of stone. Then, to Aladdin's surprise, Haseem begins to make magic that makes the very earth shake. Aladdin then realizes that Haseem is not who he says to be and that he is not his uncle.

Also, feel for bumps on your goat as you brush, as those could indicate infections or a cut or scratch. Your goat will not likely need clipping unless you plan to show her. Most of the time, brushing will be sufficient for your goat. To bathe the goat, slightly warm up the water so it's not cold. Lather the goat up with a shampoo meant for animals or specifically for goats. Use a washing mitt to help along the process. Rinse off the soap. It makes it easier if your goat has a collar on because it is easier for you to hold on to her. Pygmy goats need vitamin A in their diets to keep up their health. Mostly, they can get this vitamin from green hay or from grazing. However, if you are not supplying either of these, try adding some corn to their diet. Just like in humans, vitamin D helps goats absorb calcium, which maintains bone health. If your goats are outside most of the time, they will absorb vitamin D from the sun. However, if they don't get much sunlight, feed them either sun-cured hay (not heat-cured) or irradiated yeast. If your goats are exclusively pasture-fed (rather than alfalfa- and grain-fed), you should add a mix of iodized salt, limestone (ground), and animal bones (steamed and ground). Essentially, you can put this mixture out in its own bucket and let the goats eat it as needed. Selenium is an essential nutrient, but it is especially important if white muscle disease is prevalent in your area, as selenium protects against this disease. When kids are born, you should provide a supplement of this nutrient by needle. This disease calcifies the muscles, making them whitish, which is where the disease gets its name. Your goat will need to be vaccinated against enterotoxemia and tetanus, at the very least. You can usually buy these at local feed stores and give them yourself. You may also want to ask your vet about rabies shots. You may also want a clostridium CD vaccination. To keep your goat in good health, it's best to schedule a yearly checkup. That way, you can ensure your goat has the proper vaccinations, and you know your goat is in good health. Your goats hooves will grow over time, and if they aren't trimmed, you could end up with goats who can't walk well. To trim them, use gloves, hoof shears, and a hoof knife. Tie or hold the goat.

Q:Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Cyathus stercoreus, commonly known as the dung-loving bird's nest, is a species of fungus in the genus \\"Cyathus\\", family Nidulariaceae. Like other species in the Nidulariaceae, the fruiting bodies of \\"C. stercoreus\\" resemble tiny bird's nests filled with eggs. The fruiting bodies are referred to as splash cups, because they are developed to use the force of falling drops of water to dislodge and disperse their spores. The species has a worldwide distribution, and prefers growing on dung, or soil containing dung; the specific epithet is derived from the Latin word \\"stercorarius\\", meaning \\"of dung\\". - Cyathus is a genus of fungi in the Nidulariaceae , a family collectively known as the bird 's nest fungi . They are given this name since they resemble tiny bird 's nests filled with \`\` eggs '' , structures large enough to have been mistaken in the past for seeds . However , these are now known to be reproductive structures containing spores . The \`\` eggs '' , or peridioles , are firmly attached to the inner surface of this fruit body by an elastic cord of mycelia known as a funiculus . The 45 species are widely distributed throughout the world and some are found in most countries , although a few exist in only one or two locales . Cyathus stercoreus is considered endangered in a number of European countries . Species of Cyathus are also known as splash cups , which refers to the fact that falling raindrops can knock the peridioles out of the open - cup fruit body . The internal and external surfaces of this cup may be ridged longitudinally ( referred to as plicate or striate ) ; this is one example of a taxonomic characteristic that has traditionally served to distinguish between species . Generally considered inedible , Cyathus species are saprobic , since they obtain nutrients from decomposing organic matter . They usually grow on decaying wood or woody debris , on cow and horse dung , or directly on humus - rich soil . The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually , with meiosis , and asexually via spores . Several Cyathus species produce bioactive compounds , some with medicinal properties , and several lignin - degrading enzymes from the genus may be useful in bioremediation and agriculture . Phylogenetic analysis is providing new insights into the evolutionary relationships between the various species in Cyathus , and has cast doubt on the validity of the older classification systems that are based on traditional taxonomic characteristics - Nidula is a genus of fungi in the family Agaricaceae. Their fruit bodies resemble tiny egg-filled birds' nests, from which they derive their common name \\"bird's nest fungi\\". Originally described in 1902, the genus differs from the related genera \\"Cyathus\\" and \\"Crucibulum\\" by the absence of a cord that attaches the eggs to the inside of the fruit body. The life cycle of this genus allows it to reproduce both sexually, with meiosis, and asexually via spores. Species in this genus produce a number of bioactive compounds, including 4-(\\"p\\"-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone, a major component of raspberry flavor and insect attractor used in pesticides. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus.

If the staircase is located exactly in the center of the home take urgent action Please fix the punctuation.","completion":"If the staircase is located exactly in the center of the home, take urgent action. In the event that you find the staircase of your residence situated precisely at the heart of the house, it is crucial to address the matter with urgency. The placement of the staircase is paramount to optimizing home safety, efficiency, and functionality. Furthermore, a centrally located staircase might impact other essential aspects of your dwelling such as access points, storage, and the overall aesthetic appeal. Firstly, a centrally positioned staircase ensures ease of movement between different levels in the house. By having the stairs easily accessible from various zones, you can significantly reduce unnecessary foot traffic in certain areas and facilitate efficient navigation of the space. Moreover, a central staircase benefits from natural light filtering down and brightening the core of your house, creating a more inviting ambiance. Secondly, a staircase in the middle of your home could impede proper energy flow and distribution. In Feng Shui, a traditional Chinese practice, the center of the home is referred to as the \\"heart\\" and should be kept relatively open and free from obstructions. Focusing on harmonious energy flow and distribution contributes to a positive atmosphere and enhances the overall well-being of the occupants. Thirdly, strategic placement of the staircase can aid in creating a functional and aesthetically pleasing home. A central staircase can serve as a focal point, making a strong visual statement or expressing your personal style. Proper design choices such as using high-quality materials, interesting patterns, or unique lighting fixtures, can elevate the ambiance of your home while ensuring that it remains functional and practical. When considering the importance of a centrally positioned staircase, it is advisable to engage the services of a professional architect or interior designer who can assess your current living environment and recommend adjustments or redesigns tailored to your specific needs. Overall, a staircase situated in the center of your house is indeed a matter that requires prompt attention.

As Hurricane Sandy's flood waters rose higher and higher around a stranded New York taxi cab on Monday night its, driver appeared helpless against the 14-foot storm surge that grew to his chin. But offering a final moment of mercy, witnesses watched as 25-year-old Jon Candelaria selflessly left his Upper East Side apartment to reach the man trapped in the churning water and wind. 'He looked like he was praying, preparing to die. He looked like he knew it was his time to go,' Mr Candelaria told DNA Info of the moment he reached the yellow SUV’s window. Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River’s water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle he had spotted from his seventh floor apartment - a public housing complex on East 93rd street and First Avenue. From that window, at the peak of the storm, Mr Candelaria’s mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide. 'That's when my mom flipped out,' Mr Candelaria recalled. Slipping on a jacket over a pair of shorts, Mr Candelaria began his dash outside and into the water while his mother dialed 911. '911 was overloaded. If we had waited for help, he would have died,' he said. Dipping into the water he estimated feeling like 40-degrees, Mr Candelaria said it didn't take long for the water to rise from his ankles to his chest. Wading one step at a time it was then a flash of his two-year-old daughter entered his head - his greatest risk of leaving behind. 'I would do it for anybody,' he later said of his decision. 'It doesn't matter who you are; you're a human being.' Dangerous: Standing at 6-feet-5, the East River's water had swept up to Mr Candelaria's chest as he waded out to the vehicle, pictured. Reaching the door he pulled at its handle but found it stuck, unable to budge against the water. Enlisting the driver's help, whom he said showed only brief panic, he signaled for them to both try on the count of three. Counting off, he said something unusual happened. 'As soon as I hit three, it seemed like everything became calm,' Mr Candelaria said, describing the wind briefly pausing for the first time. Pealing it open, Mr Candeleria was seen by other residents grabbing the driver from his vehicle and tossing him over his shoulder to begin their trek back. ‘Even if he had managed to get out of the car, I don't think he would have made it because he was so short,’ Mr Candeleria said of the man found to be 5-foot-1 in height. Floating: Mr Candelaria's mother had let out a scream when catching sight of the cab as it abruptly lifted and spun 180-degrees around in the tide.

I know that the answer to the question \\"Who died in the 41st year of the 15th century?\\" is in \\"The large external sculptural schemes of Early Gothic churches gave way to more sculpture inside the building, as tombs became more elaborate and other features such as pulpits were sometimes lavishly carved, as in the Pulpit by Giovanni Pisano in Sant'Andrea. Painted or carved wooden relief altarpieces became common, especially as churches created many side-chapels. Early Netherlandish painting by artists such as Jan van Eyck (d. 1441) and Rogier van der Weyden (d. 1464) rivalled that of Italy, as did northern illuminated manuscripts, which in the 15th century began to be collected on a large scale by secular elites, who also commissioned secular books, especially histories. From about 1450 printed books rapidly became popular, though still expensive. There were around 30,000 different editions of incunabula, or works printed before 1500, by which time illuminated manuscripts were commissioned only by royalty and a few others.

Suddenly she compares her hand to the size of the tracks near to those she is following and discovers they are relatively fresh wolf tracks; she is alarmed as a wolf pack begins howling near her. She runs away panicked, falls and hurts her ankle. The ankle heals very slowly, so that she has to stay at home during the winter reading a book about foxes and other animals of the forest. When spring arrives, the girl is looking for fox holes and waits for the fox. The fox has young babies and moves holes because of her observations; therefore the girl decides to observe the fox from a greater distance. She finds the fox again and tries to get the animal accustomed to her. She feeds it with meat. Later she can even touch the fox and is led to the new den. Finally, the fox arrives at her house and she lets it inside, wanting to show it her bedroom. But the fox becomes distressed at not being able to find a way out and escapes by smashing through her brittle plate glass window, causing the glass to shatter. The fox is hurt badly, but survives and the girl learns that she cannot keep wild animals as pets at home as they are unpredictable and may break more things such as fragile glass windows. Years later she tells the whole story to her son, as seen at the end of the film. Some versions (DVD English) leave out this scene and put the gist of its text over the scene before it.

The police department said officers would be posted at the charred ruins of the two houses that were heavily damaged and they would remain there until the buildings are demolished on Tuesday. Charter Oak Avenue was open to traffic and the damaged homes were blocked off with chain-link fencing Monday morning. Sade Brantley, 13, and Madisyn Mitchell, 1, who were in a house at 64 Charter Oak Ave., died when the plane crashed upside down onto it while trying to land at Tweed New Haven Airport, officials said. Their mother, Joann Mitchell, 39, also was home at the time, but escaped. The pilot, Bill Henningsgaard, 54, of Medina, Wash., and his son, Maxwell, 17, also died. They were on a trip to visit East Coast colleges, friends said. East Haven police, citing the state medical examiner's office, said all four victims died of blunt force trauma. Police said Monday that a tea set Maxwell Henningsgaard had purchased for his family was recovered substantially intact from a compartment in the wrecked aircraft. It will be returned to the Henningsgaard family, police said. David Esposito said he was drawn to the crash site by a neighbor, who turned out to be Mitchell, screaming at someone down the street. \\"I thought it was an automobile accident, something that occurred. I ran down there and that's when I saw the plane sticking out of the house,\\" he said. Mitchell screamed that her children were in the house upstairs and Esposito said he ran in to look for them. \\"I went upstairs and, it's kind of funny, I saw a crib and that kind of bothered me. I took it apart, looking for somebody underneath the crib,\\" he said. He pulled out debris scattered all over the floor and searched the closets and under the bed. \\"There was nobody there,\\" he said. A small fire inside the plane grew intense and Esposito said it occurred to him that there could be gas in the house. \\"There was another gentlman behind me. I grabbed him and he grabbed the woman. The fire was pretty intense. It was time to get out,\\" Esposito said.

Former Microsoft Vice President Bill Henningsgaard, of Medina, was killed Friday along with his son when the plane they were flying crashed into two houses in a neighborhood in East Haven, Conn. Two children were believed killed on the ground, according to Connecticut authorities. Henningsgaard’s death was first reported by The Daily Astorian newspaper in the coastal Oregon town where he grew up, followed by a notice posted by Social Venture Partners, a Seattle foundation he formerly served as chairman, on its website. Officials had not yet confirmed the names of the victims as of late Friday. Henningsgaard’s brother, Astoria City Attorney Blair Henningsgaard, said he hadn’t received official confirmation, but told The Seattle Times he suspected his brother and nephew were aboard the plane. The father and his son — identified by Social Venture Partners as Max — were on the East Coast visiting colleges, according to the agency. Connecticut officials said Henningsgaard was set to land at Tweed-New Haven Airport, but missed the approach and attempted a second approach, The Hartford Courant reported. They said there was no distress call from the plane, which the Federal Aviation Administration said was a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, a multi-engine turboprop aircraft. The bodies of the pilot and a child were found in the rubble, but East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo told reporters that the houses struck by the plane were unstable and crews were unable to get inside to do a full search. They were waiting for the National Transportation Safety Board to arrive before continuing the investigation. Connecticut Gov. Dannel Malloy said Friday that two children, ages 1 and 13, were in one house and as many as three people might have been in the plane, The Courant reported. “We presume there is going to be a very bad outcome,” East Haven Fire Chief Douglas Jackson said. Bill Henningsgaard is listed as the registered agent of Ellumax Leasing in Medina, according to the Washington Secretary of State’s Office corporations website. Ellumax is the registered owner of the plane that crashed, FAA records show. Henningsgaard was involved in a previous plane crash. In April 2009, his engine cut out 10 minutes into a flight from Astoria to Seattle with his mother, Edith Henningsgaard-Miller, a former Astoria mayor. The plane crash-landed into the Columbia River. Standing on the wing of the plane as it sunk into the water, they were rescued by the Columbia River Bar Pilots. Henningsgaard wrote about the experience in a column on the Social Venture Partners website, urging people to reach out to children in the community. He worked for about 14 years at Microsoft in various sales and marketing roles, including as vice president of sales for the Western U.S., Australia and New Zealand. After leaving Microsoft, he became heavily involved in local social-service and philanthropy efforts, helping start Eastside Pathways, which works to support the area’s youth from “cradle to career.” He has also served as board member and past board chairman of both Youth Eastside Services and Social Venture Partners, which connects philanthropists and strengthens nonprofits. Will Poole, former senior vice president of Microsoft’s Windows Client Business, said he and Henningsgaard were acquainted at Microsoft, but it was through Social Venture Partners that they and their families became good friends. Henningsgaard, “like many of us, saw that we have the sort of business skills that are applicable to working in the nonprofit world and (that we could) help apply the best of what we learned at a company like Microsoft to help these organizations grow and thrive,” Poole said. “He was an effective and truly engaged philanthropist.” Poole’s wife, Janet Levinger, a founding member and treasurer of Eastside Pathways, said Henningsgaard was “full of energy and really wanted to make a difference in the world. ... He walked his talk and took action.” Jeff Raikes, CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, was Henningsgaard’s boss at Microsoft when Henningsgaard served as vice president of worldwide licensing and pricing. “Bill was a great thinker,” Raikes said. “If you had a tough, strategic challenge to take on, he’d be the sort of person you’d want to partner with.” Raikes watched as Henningsgaard and his wife became more involved in philanthropy over the years, especially with groups providing opportunities for young people locally. “He was a great leader at Microsoft,” Raikes said. “But I think, even more so, a greater leader in our community.” Paul Shoemaker, Social Venture Partners executive connector, called him “an incredibly good, real, honest man, for the community, for his family, for this world.” “The guy has already done so much for the world. And he was going to do so much more,” he said. The post on the Social Ventures Partners website said the family is requesting donations to Eastside Pathways partners on behalf of Henningsgaard and to Camp Kiwanilong, in Warrenton, Ore., on behalf of his son, who spent several summers there. “We know you will join the SVP Board and Staff in extending deepest condolences to Bill’s wife and daughters and Max’s mom and sisters, Susan Sullivan, Eleanor and Lucy,” the post said. “They are in our thoughts and hearts.” Colin Campbell: 206-464-2033 or ccampbell@seattletimes.com.

(AP) — Authorities are making plans to demolish the two East Haven houses struck by an airplane Friday in a crash that claimed four lives. The Connecticut Post reports the demolition will take place this week. The houses were badly damaged when the 10-seat propeller-driven plane crashed on its approach to Tweed New Haven Airport. Thirteen-year-old-old Sade Brantley and 1-year-old Madisyn Mitchell were killed when the plane hit their home, setting it on fire. Also killed were the pilot, 54-year-old former Microsoft executive Bill Henningsgaard, and his 17-year-old son, Maxwell. Officials have said emergency repairs were done after the crash to make the homes safe for the crews that recovered the bodies. On Saturday night, dozens of people turned out for a vigil at Margaret Tucker Park to honor those who died in the crash. Among those in attendance was 39-year-old Joann Mitchell, the mother of the 13-year-old and the 1-year-old. Mitchell, who did not speak at the vigil, was home at the time of the crash, but managed to escape. The Hartford Courant reported that Mitchell posted the following message on her Facebook page: \\"\\"My heart is at a standstill. The feeling of emptiness engulfs me. Mommy will always love you … R.I.P. my sweet angels.\\" East Haven Mayor Joseph Maturo told the crowd at the vigil that the show of support was a great tribute. \\"I think this is a great tribute to a great town,\\" the mayor said, \\"a caring town, a loving town. A town that comes out when things are down and people need you.\\" Gov. Dannel Malloy said in a statement that the vigil was a \\"profound statement of the ties that bind East Haven and our entire state together as one community.\\" \\"When a family suffers an unimaginable tragedy, we come together and pray that they have the strength they need to carry on,\\" Malloy said. \\"Our thoughts and prayers are with all the families tonight who are suffering from grief and loss.\\" ||||| A former Microsoft executive and his teenage son are presumed dead after their small plane crashed into a residential neighborhood a few blocks from an airport while trying to land, setting fire to two houses and killing as many as four other people, the man's brother and authorities said.

(Associated Press) Bill Henningsgaard and his teenage son, Maxwell, were traveling the East Coast to visit colleges, and Connecticut was part of the itinerary, said Blair Henningsgaard, the city attorney in Astoria, Ore. Just before noon Friday, the multi-engine, propeller-driven plane struck two small homes near Tweed New Haven Airport. The aircraft's left wing lodged in one house and its right wing in the other. The family learned it was Bill Henningsgaard's plane through the tail number, his brother said. It wasn't his first crash. Three years ago, Henningsgaard crash-landed his plane on Washington's Columbia River, and he and his 84-year-old mother were rescued by a passing boat as the plane began to sink. Henningsgaard was a member of Seattle-based Social Venture Partners, a foundation that helps build up communities. The foundation extended its condolences to his wife and two daughters. \\"There are hundreds of people that have a story about Bill _ when he went the extra mile, when he knew just the right thing to say, how he would never give up. He was truly all-in for this community, heart, mind and soul,\\" the foundation wrote Friday in a post on its website. Late Friday, officials from a number of agencies were still at the scene trying to determine how many people had been killed. Officials said the total was four to six. The victims of the crash have not been identified. \\"We haven't recovered anybody at this point, and we presume there is going to be a very bad outcome,\\" East Haven fire Chief Douglas Jackson said Friday. National Transportation Safety Board investigator Robert Gretz said at a news conference Friday night there were casualty reports of two or three people in the plane and two or three people in one of the homes, including two children, ages 1 and 13. He said the reports were unconfirmed and that local and state authorities were at the scene looking for victims. Hours after the crash, Malloy said rescuers had spotted two bodies, including one of an adult, but hadn't recovered them. The plane's fuselage had entered one of the houses, and the recovery effort was focusing on the home's basement, he said. Mayor Joseph Maturo Jr. said later that the houses were still unstable and crews had not completed a full search. The 10-seater plane, a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B, flew out of Teterboro Airport in New Jersey and crashed at 11:25 a.m., the Federal Aviation Administration said. Tweed's airport manager, Lori Hoffman-Soares, said the pilot had been in communication with air traffic control and hadn't issued any distress calls. \\"All we know is that it missed the approach and continued on,\\" she said. A neighbor, David Esposito, said he heard a loud noise and then a thump: \\"No engine noise, nothing.\\" \\"A woman was screaming her kids were in there,\\" he said. Esposito, a retired teacher, said he ran into the upstairs of the house, where the woman believed her children were, but couldn't find them after frantically searching a crib and closets. He returned downstairs to search some more, but he dragged the woman out when the flames became too strong. In April 2009, Henningsgaard was flying a small plane from Astoria to Seattle when the engine quit and he tried to glide back to the airport. As he wrote 10 days later on a blog post, the plane crashed into the Columbia River after a harrowing five-minute descent. He and his mother, a former Astoria mayor, climbed out on a wing and were rescued. He spent 14 years at Microsoft in various marketing and sales positions, according to his biography on Social Venture Partners website. He was a longtime board member at Youth Eastside Services, a Bellevue, Wash.-based agency that provides counseling and substance-abuse treatment, and led the organization's 10.7 million fundraising campaign for its new headquarters, which opened in 2008. A vigil for the victims of the crash is planned for Saturday night at Margaret Tucker Park. ___ Associated Press writers Steven DuBois in Portland, Ore., Gene Johnson in Seattle and Mike Melia in Hartford, Conn., contributed to this report. |||||","completion":"A neighborhood near Tweed New Haven Airport is recovering from a plane crash that killed two girls in a home, the pilot, and his teenage son.

For those with even more money there was Polish Cochineal; also known as Kermes vermilio or \\"Blood of Saint John\\", which was made from a related insect, the Margodes polonicus. It made a more vivid red than ordinary Kermes. The finest and most expensive variety of red made from insects was the \\"Kermes\\" of Armenia (Armenian cochineal, also known as Persian kirmiz), made by collecting and crushing Porphyophora hamelii, an insect which lived on the roots and stems of certain grasses. The pigment and dye merchants of Venice imported and sold all of these products and also manufactured their own color, called Venetian red, which was considered the most expensive and finest red in Europe.

Such opinions may vary vastly depending on the experiences, exposure, and knowledge that residents of Pennsylvania have regarding Texans. These opinions could be based on stereotypes, personal interactions, media portrayals, or any other factors that shape their understanding of Texans and Texas as a state. Now, considering the hypothesis \\"what kind of opinions do Texans hold about themselves?\\", we are shifting our attention from the perspective of people from Pennsylvania to that of Texans themselves. This hypothesis aims to analyze the self-concept and self-perception that Texans possess. This encompasses factors such as their cultural identity, beliefs, values, and traditions, as well as how they view their roles within society and their state's reputation and standing in the United States. Comparing the premise and the hypothesis, we can see that they address two different aspects of understanding opinions about Texans. The premise is externally focused while the hypothesis is internally focused. The premise tells us about the perception of Texans from the viewpoint of people from another state, whereas the hypothesis revolves around the self-perception of Texans themselves. Therefore, even if the given premise is true, and people from Pennsylvania have some opinions about Texans, it would not directly provide insights into or entail the hypothesis, i.e., what kind of opinions Texans hold about themselves. To understand the latter, it would be necessary to carry out studies and research addressing the self-perception, values, and beliefs of individuals living in Texas. In conclusion, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis is indirect and weak, and validating the premise does not necessarily validate or provide substantial evidence for the hypothesis as they focus on separate aspects of understanding opinions related to Texans."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Music history will not be rewritten. A jury found Led Zeppelin frontman Robert Plant and guitarist Jimmy Page not guilty of copyright infringement on perhaps their most famous song, \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" A Los Angeles jury deliberated for about five hours before deciding the band did not steal its most famous licks from another band. In a statement issued after the verdict was announced, Led Zeppelin said they were \\"grateful\\" that the jury \\"ruled in our favor, putting to rest questions about the origins of 'Stairway to Heaven' and confirming what we have known for 45 years.\\" The case centered on claims that Led Zeppelin copied key note patterns in the first two minutes of their hit from a song by the 1960s psychedelic band, Spirit. That song, \\"Taurus,\\" is an instrumental ballad released four years prior to \\"Stairway to Heaven.\\" The suit was filed for partial song writing credit and compensation by the estate of a deceased Spirit musician, Randy Craig Wolfe. The plaintiff failed to show that Plant and Page were familiar with \\"Taurus,\\" and that the works were substantially similar. The estate's attorney, Francis Malofiy, tried to introduce evidence that Page and Plant had seen Spirit in concert, owned a recording of \\"Taurus,\\" and testimony on the songs' musical similarities. Led Zeppelin's lawyer, Peter Anderson, brought Page and Plant to the stand to dispute their familiarity with \\"Taurus,\\" questioned the estate's copyright claim, and said the passage in question was a common descending chord sequence in the public domain. Plant took the stand Tuesday and described in detail writing \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" with Page at a countryside retreat in Hampshire, England in 1971. He told the court Page was playing some music by a fire and he offered a couplet to go with it as a lyric. When asked by his attorney if he remembered what that lyric was, Plant recited what has become the well known opening line to the hit song, \\"There's a lady who knows all that glitters is gold and she's buying a stairway to heaven.\\" Under cross-examination, Plant acknowledged that Led Zeppelin played a cover medley that included a different Spirit song in the band's early days, but he didn't recall seeing Spirit in concert, or ever meeting the group. \\"Don't remember now, and didn't remember then,\\" Plant told the court. Related: 'Stairway to Heaven' suit: What you need to know Last week, Page testified that he didn't remember hearing Spirit perform live. He said he first heard \\"Taurus\\" on the internet two years ago, despite owning an album with the song among his more than 4,000 records. \\"Something like that would stick in my mind. It was totally alien to me,\\" Page said. When Page returned to the stand on Tuesday, like Plant he described their songwriting process on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" to flatten the claim some of it had been lifted. Copyright cases have resulted in increasing scrutiny -- and damages -- within the music industry. Condé Nast Portfolio estimated in 2008 that \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" had earned more than 562 million in publishing royalties and record sales since it released. Last year, Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams were ordered to pay the estate of singer Marvin Gaye 7.4 million after a jury found their song \\"Blurred Lines\\" had taken riffs from Gaye's classic \\"Got to Give It Up.\\" CNN's Stephanie Elam and Topher Gauk Roger contributed to this report ||||| Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin cleared of stealing riff for Stairway to Heaven Los Angeles jury finds Robert Plant and Jimmy Page did not steal the most famous passage from the 1971 anthem from the band Spirit Led Zeppelin win copyright case over intro to Stairway to Heaven – video Led Zeppelin has defeated a lawsuit that accused the band of stealing the opening riff in Stairway to Heaven, and cemented its place in rock’s pantheon. A jury in Los Angeles on Thursday cleared Robert Plant and Jimmy Page of pinching arguably the most famous riff of the most famous anthem in rock. The singer and guitarist were in the US district court for the climax of a six-day trial that gripped the music industry and put the band’s history and credibility under a forensic microscope. Plant, 67, and Page, 72, denied lifting Stairway to Heaven’s opening passage, which evokes Renaissance folk music, from an LA-based psychedelic band called Spirit. The estate of Spirit’s guitarist Randy Wolfe, also known as Randy California, had sued for recognition and a share of the proceeds on the grounds the 1971 mega-hit ripped off Taurus, an instrumental composed in 1967. Wearing sharp suits with their hair pulled back in ponytails, Plant and Page left court without speaking publicly, but issued a brief statement later that said they were grateful to the jury and look forward to putting the matter behind them. Francis Malofiy, the estate’s attorney, said he was sad and disappointed by the jury’s decision. “The reality is that we proved access, but they could never hear what they had access to,” Malofiy said. “It’s bizarre.” “This case is about one thing, one six-letter word – credit,” Malofiy had told the jury of four men and four women during the trial. He likened the case to a David and Goliath battle. Peter Anderson, Led Zeppelin’s attorney, said the case was really an attempt to rewrite history – “to take an iconic song … and [say] it’s got a new parent”. Yes, Led Zeppelin took from other people's records – but then they transformed them Read more The trial wrapped on Wednesday and the jury retired to deliberate. When it returned to courtroom 850, a marble and wood-paneled arena in the Edward Roybal federal building, Goliath prevailed. The verdict spared Led Zeppelin the humiliation and type of financial loss which befell Robin Thicke and Pharrell Williams in a separate plagiarism case last year when Marvin Gaye’s family won a 7.4m award for the song Blurred Lines infringing on Gaye’s Got to Give it Up. The music industry, still reeling from the Blurred Lines verdict, will be relieved, said Larry Iser, a lawyer and copyright specialist who was not involved in either case. “Today’s verdict is a vindication of copyright, which only protects an original expression of music.” Led Zeppelin showed that the disputed chord progression was a common building block of classical and popular music dating back centuries, he said. Journalists and Led Zeppelin fans packed the public gallery for a trial which veered from surreal to nostalgic to belligerent as Plant, Page and other witnesses testified about what did and did not happen between 1967 and 1971. This was a bacchanalian rock’n’roll era famed for sex and drugs but Judge Gary Klausner, a stern presence, kept testimony focused on money, memory and music. The case hinged on two questions. Did Led Zeppelin hear Taurus before composing Stairway? And is Stairway substantially similar to the Taurus sheet music submitted in 1968 to the US copyright office? Wolfe, a guitar prodigy who wrote the instrumental for his girlfriend, drowned in 1997 saving his son in Hawaii. Shortly before his death, in a magazine interview quoted in the lawsuit, he made his resentment plain. “If you listen to the two songs, you can make your own judgment … I’d say it was a rip-off. And the guys made millions of bucks on it and never said ‘Thank you,’ never said, ‘Can we pay you some money for it?’ It’s kind of a sore point with me.” The lawsuit alleged Led Zeppelin had a deep-rooted history of lifting composition from uncreditd blues artists and other songwriters. It cited disputes over 16 other Led Zeppelin songs, including Whole Lotta Love and Babe I’m Gonna Leave You. Stairway to Heaven, one of the most played songs on radio, is estimated to have generated more than 500m over the decades. Damages, however, can extend back only three years and into the future. In defending themselves Plant and Page, chipped their own mythology about Stairway being composed at Bron-Yr-Aur, a remote Welsh cottage. Page said he in fact wrote the music at Headley Grange, a recording studio in Hampshire. Plant said he had been toying with a lyrical couplet inspired by Welsh lore and scenery and realised it could combine with Page’s notes. “Do you remember what that couplet was?” asked Anderson. Facebook Twitter Pinterest A courtroom sketch of Plant (left) and Page. Photograph: Reuters Into a hushed courtroom Plant, half-speaking, half-singing, responded: “There’s a lady who’s sure all that glitters is gold, and she’s buying a stairway to heaven.” The singer dismissed any influence from Taurus. “I didn’t remember it then, and I don’t remember it now.” Led Zeppelin’s bass player and keyboardist, John Paul Jones, testified in the band’s defence but was not a defendant. Malofiy, a hard-charging lawyer with a bruising reputation, sought to pierce any reverence for the British rockers by calling them session musicians who played other people’s music, including that of Spirit, with whom they shared concert billing in the late 1960s. Page admitted Led Zeppelin used to play one Spirit song, Fresh Garbage, because back in the day the band would “chip a wink to what’s hot”. But he insisted he had not heard Taurus, part of Spirit’s debut album, even though it was in his collection of 4,329 LPs and 5,882 CDs. He heard it only after his son-in-law told him about internet chatter making comparisons with Stairway, he said. “I don’t do the internet, so he played it for me. When I heard the orchestral part at the beginning, I knew I’d never heard it before.” A witness for Wolfe’s estate testified about seeing Plant attend a Spirit gig and socialise with the US group at Mother’s, a Birmingham club, during its visit to England 1970. The singer shrugged that off. “I really don’t recall any of the bands I saw there or everyone I ever hung out with.” Malofiy accused Plant and Page of having selective memory. Unable to play recordings of Taurus to the jury, the attorney summoned musicologists who said the instrumental’s copyrighted sheet music shared with Stairway a descending A-minor chord progression, notes of the same duration, arpeggios and similar pairs of notes. The courtroom crackled when the attorney asked Page to analyse Taurus. “You want to step through it?” “Not necessarily,” Page replied. Page carried a guitar into court but was not asked to play. He did, however, mime air guitar and a dance move. Musicologists summoned for the defence said the descending chromatic minor line progression shared by both songs had been a common musical device for centuries. One example cited was Chim Chim Cher-ee, from the 1964 Disney musical Mary Poppins. Anderson said Wolfe’s estate was overreaching. “He didn’t create the key of A-minor.” The lawyer urged the jury to not let Michael Skidmore, trustee of the late musician’s estate, usurp history. “Randy California is entitled for credit for what he did, but not what he didn’t do. [The plaintiffs] are asking you to take this iconic song, ‘Stairway to Heaven,’ and say it has a new parent in Mr Skidmore.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Rock band Led Zeppelin has won their lawsuit which accused them of stealing the opening riff in \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" from US psychedelic band Spirit.

Is there any quick method to loose belly fat?","completion":"While these two questions are similar and related, they do not have the exact same meaning. Both questions focus on finding fast solutions for reducing belly fat. However, the emphasis and scope of the inquiry are slightly different between the two. The first question, \\"What are the quick ways for controlling belly fat?\\" is asking for a list of fast methods or practices that can aid in managing or reducing belly fat. This question is broad and open-ended, and it calls for multiple solutions that can help control and maintain belly fat levels effectively. The focus here is on managing and controlling, which may include prevention, reduction, as well as maintenance of healthy belly fat levels. The second question, \\"Is there any quick method to lose belly fat?\\" is more specific in its focus. It's asking if there is one (or potentially several) fast approach that can be employed to shed belly fat quickly. The emphasis here is on losing or reducing existing belly fat, instead of controlling or managing it as in the first question. To provide a detailed answer addressing both questions, here are some quick and effective approaches for controlling and losing belly fat: 1. Improve your diet: Making healthier food choices is a crucial step to controlling belly fat. Cut down on processed foods, added sugars, and unhealthy fats. Instead, opt for lean protein, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats. 2. Incorporate exercise: Engaging in regular physical activity can help you lose and control belly fat. Combine cardiovascular exercise, like jogging, walking, swimming, or cycling, with strength training for a well-rounded workout regime. 3. Try High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT): HIIT can be an effective and quick approach to reducing belly fat. It is characterized by alternating periods of intense exercise followed by short recovery periods. 4. Focus on abdominal exercises: Include exercises like planks, crunches, and leg raises to specifically target the abdominal area and strengthen the core muscles. This can help in both reducing belly fat and preventing excess fat accumulation. 5. Get enough sleep and reduce stress: Poor sleep and high stress levels may contribute to increased abdominal fat. Aim for at least 7 hours of sleep per night and practice stress-reduction techniques such as yoga, meditation, or mindfulness. 6. Limit alcohol consumption: Drinking excessive amounts of alcohol has been linked to an increased risk of belly fat, so reducing your intake can be an essential step in controlling belly fat. 7. Be consistent: While there may not be a specific single quick method to lose belly fat, staying consistent with healthy habits, exercising regularly, and making better food choices will speed up the process and generate long-term, sustainable results. We may see short-term effects with quick fixes, but maintaining a healthy lifestyle is the most effective approach for controlling and losing belly fat over time."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Chinese state-run news agency Xinhua said on Tuesday that Romney risked 'reigniting war' between the Israelis and Palestinians by promising to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv to the disputed holy city of Jerusalem. Meanwhile, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad the trip to the Jewish state amounted to 'kissing the foot' of Israel. Scroll down for video Criticism: Mitt Romney called Jerusalem the capital of","completion":"Israel, angering both China and Iran, leading to an increase in diplomatic tensions. During his visit to Israel, Romney further fueled the controversy by stating that Jerusalem is the true capital of Israel, despite the fact that the international community, including the United States, does not recognize it as such. This declaration served to deepen international conflicts and tensions, with many questioning Romney's diplomatic abilities. In response to the Chinese outrage, the Romney campaign attempted to defend their stance by arguing that the recognition of Jerusalem as Israel's capital is long overdue, and that they firmly believe that a strong relationship with Israel is vital for maintaining peace and stability in the Middle East. However, this did not quell the mounting criticism, as China emphasized its concern that such a move would only serve to destabilize the region further and could seriously hinder any progress towards a two-state solution. As for Iran, President Ahmadinejad's comment that Romney's trip amounted to \\"kissing the foot\\" of Israel was meant to emphasize Iran's opposition to what they perceived as an unjust favoritism towards Israel. Iran, a long-standing enemy of Israel, saw Romney's actions as a direct provocation and a sign that, if elected, he would inevitably side with Israel in any ongoing or future disputes. In the face of these mounting criticisms, the Romney campaign was forced to address the broader implications of their visit to Israel and their staunch support for the country. In doing so, they attempted to appease opponents by stating that the ultimate goal of their Middle East policy would be to secure lasting peace in the region through dialogue and diplomatic negotiations with all relevant parties. However, the mixed reactions to Romney's visit to Israel and the ensuing diplomatic fallout only served to highlight the complex nature of international relations and the delicate balance that must be struck in order to promote peace, stability, and understanding. It also raised questions about whether Romney, as a potential future president, had the ability and the foresight to navigate these complexities and establish a foreign policy that would be both fair and effective. Ultimately, the tumultuous outcome of Mitt Romney's international trip served to underscore the significance of diplomacy and the importance of approaching sensitive issues with tact and discernment. The consequences of his remarks about Israel, and the subsequent backlash from China and Iran, served as a reminder of just how critical it is for world leaders to carefully consider the potential impact of their words and actions on the global stage."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. (CNN) -- Beyond skateboards, Silicon Valley and hippies, California has a trendsetting streak of a different kind. The state has been first to pass major public health initiatives that have spread throughout the country. California was first to require smog checks for clean air, pass anti-tobacco initiatives and bike helmets laws. While these laws were met with skepticism and ridicule, they've often become standard practice in other states. The Golden State was first to ban smoking in workplaces, bars and restaurants in 1998. Now similar rules exist throughout the country. Some advocates tout the state as a forward-thinking vanguard in which its health and safety laws are routinely emulated by other states. \\"There have been progressive legislations in tobacco, environment and obesity prevention,\\" said Mark Horton, a lecturer at the University of California Berkeley School of Public Health. \\"In some respect, the rest of the country looks to California as a laboratory for moving forward with those various types of initiatives.\\" But some critics liken the Golden State to a nanny state. California has 151,002 health and safety laws. \\"It never ends,\\" said Laer Pearce, who works in public affairs in Orange County. \\"Every year, several hundred bills come through and dozens of them tell us how to live our lives.\\" Starting in January, 760 new California laws went into effect -- for example, the importing of shark fins is prohibited, student athletes are required to have medical clearance after suffering a head injury, teens are banned from using tanning booths and the sale of caffeinated beer is forbidden. There's a perception that California has \\"more folks who are health-oriented and more health-minded,\\" said Horton, former director of the California Department of Public Health. It's not just workout fanatics hanging out at Muscle Beach, Sierra Club members hiking mountains or the uber-health-conscious touting organic foods. Californians in general tend to have healthier habits, ranking 10th for physical activity, fourth for healthy blood pressure and fifth for a diet high in fruits and vegetables compared with other states, according to America's Health Rankings.

Write a text based on this summary: ovechkin s teammate semin scores more talks less Text:","completion":"Title: Semin: The Quiet Goal Machine Standing Beside Ovechkin In the shadows of the ever-popular Alexander Ovechkin, Washington Capitals forward Alexander Semin has consistently proven himself as one of the top players in the National Hockey League (NHL). Semin, a Russian speedster and sniper, has been delivering incredible performances, registering impressive scores, and yet has managed to keep a low profile when compared to his teammate Ovechkin. While fans continue to celebrate number eight's flashy plays and exuberant personality, Semin's quiet demeanor and commitment to the team have solidified his position as a potent force on the ice. Both being Russian players drafted in 2002, Ovechkin (first overall) and Semin (13th overall) have inevitably drawn comparisons throughout their careers. Moreover, as leaders of the Capitals' offense for the past decade, the dynamic duo has left opposing teams scrambling to find ways to neutralize their lethal combination of speed and power. Despite their undeniable chemistry and proven results, Semin's contributions often remain overshadowed by the spotlight that follows Ovechkin. Certainly, Ovechkin's larger-than-life presence cannot be ignored, catching the attention of those within and outside the hockey world with his affable persona, tenacious play, and fearless leadership. Yet, Semin, preferring to let his actions speak louder than words, emerges as a player who is often underestimated and overlooked. The quiet and enigmatic forward operates with a level of precision and efficiency, enabling him to score more goals and contribute positively to the team's overall performance. While he may not dominate the headlines or receive the level of recognition reserved for superstars like Ovechkin, Semin remains a highly valued and respected member of the Capitals' roster. Throughout his career, Semin has demonstrated an uncanny ability to find the back of the net, scoring goals at critical moments and helping propel the team to victory. Armed with an impressive skillset, including a powerful and accurate wrist shot, as well as stickhandling and puck control that rival the best in the league, Semin has become a reliable and essential component of the Capitals' offensive machine. Though he often operates as a silent assassin, his effect on the game cannot be understated, as his mere presence on the ice creates opportunities and challenges for the opposition. Despite his reserved nature, this does not imply that Semin is any less passionate about the game or less dedicated to the Capitals' success. Although he may not be the most vocal or visible leader on the ice, his teammates recognize and appreciate his unwavering commitment to the team ethos. In fact, his quiet approach could be regarded as a major asset to the squad. As Ovechkin garners media attention and diverts opponents' focus, Semin tirelessly continues to carry out his role and contributes to the team's objectives. In conclusion, while Alexander Ovechkin may be considered the face of the Washington Capitals, it would be a disservice to underestimate the critical role played by his fellow Russian teammate, Alexander Semin. Quietly working behind the scenes, Semin scores more and talks less, becoming the quintessential silent achiever. Unwavering in his commitment to the team, his humble approach and undeniable skills have earned him the admiration of both his peers and fervent hockey fans alike. As the Capitals continue to strive for glory, the synergy between Ovechkin's charisma and Semin's quiet consistency will undoubtedly remain a crucial aspect of the team's ongoing success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Health officials continued on Monday to investigate the causes behind the mysterious deaths of 64 children in Cambodia after saying they had made an important discovery over the weekend. The Institut Pasteur in Cambodia tested samples taken from 24 patients and found 15 had tested positive for Enterovirus Type 71 -- a common cause of hand, foot and mouth disease that can also cause severe neurological complications, mainly in children. \\"These results now give a good explanation to this outbreak,\\" Dr. Philippe Buchy, head of the institute's virology unit, said in an e-mail over the weekend. \\"We will get more results hopefully by next Tuesday or Wednesday.\\" The World Health Organization also noted that a \\"significant proportion of the samples\\" had tested positive for EV71, but it cautioned that the outbreak had not been fully solved, and more analysis was needed. Outbreaks of the enterovirus \\"occur periodically in the Asia-Pacific region,\\" according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Brunei had its first major outbreak in 2006. China had an outbreak in 2008. Though the detection of EV71 in Cambodia is significant, there may be other factors, said Dr. Beat Richner of Kantha Bopha hospitals. Over the past three months, 66 children -- between 2 and 3 years old -- were admitted to Kantha Bopha facilities. All but two died mysteriously after suffering severe neurological and respiratory complications, Richner said. In their last hours of their life, the children experienced a \\"total destruction of the alveola(e) in the lungs,\\" Richner said. The patients also suffered from encephalitis, which is inflammation of the brain, he said. \\"We have now to see what really is causing the deadly pulmonary complication and see if a toxic factor is playing a role too,\\" he said. Investigators probe mystery disease killing Cambodian children. The positive test for EV71 does not particularly help in the treatment of the illness, as there is no effective antiviral treatment for severe EV71 infections, and no vaccine is available. The way the syndrome is attacking the children is \\"merciless,\\" Dr. Sanjay Gupta, CNN's chief medical correspondent, said from Cambodia. Gupta noted, though, that the disease did not appear to be \\"clustering,\\" or spreading rapidly in particular geographic areas, reducing fears of a possible epidemic. In milder cases, EV71 can cause coldlike symptoms, diarrhea and sores on the hands, feet and mouth, according to the journal Genetic Vaccines and Therapy. But more severe cases can cause fluid to accumulate on the brain, resulting in polio-like paralysis and death. Adults' well-developed immune systems usually can fend off the virus, but children are vulnerable to it, according to the CDC. On Sunday, a World Health Organization (WHO) representative in Cambodia warned the new discovery \\"does not mean we have solved the problem of the undiagnosed cases. A lot more analysis is needed, and further laboratory investigations need to be done.\\" The WHO said that other pathogens had been detected in the investigations, including dengue and Streptococcus suis. It added that samples tested negative for H5N1 and other influenza viruses. Tensions have arisen between the WHO and Kantha Bopha hospitals about the dissemination of information about the outbreak. The international organization has provided a lower death toll than the hospitals, saying Sunday that 52 out of a total number of 59 children affected by the mysterious syndrome had died between April and early July. In his statement Sunday, the hospital official Richner criticized the WHO for previously making statements to the news media \\"without being clear on the facts.\\" \\"WHO was telling whole the world: New mystery killer disease in Cambodia! This was causing unnecessary panic in Cambodia,\\" Richter said. Richner has said the number of cases affected by the mysterious disease is relatively low -- 34 cases in June, compared with the 75,000 sick children at Kantha Bopha's outpatient clinics and 16,000 hospitalized kids. But Pieter van Maaren with the WHO in Cambodia rejected suggestions that his organization caused any kind of panic. He said Richner was the one who stated, in a letter to the government, that the situation in Cambodia was \\"most severe.\\" \\"WHO has not made any statement about the disease, other than what we issued in the joint press release with the Ministry of Health,\\" van Maaren said. The ministry reported the outbreak to WHO through the International Health Regulations, which 194 nations are parties to, van Maaren said. \\"Since this event fitted the criteria of being an event where the underlying agent, disease or mode of transmission is not identified at the time, WHO is obliged to communicate information to other member states,\\" he said. EV71 was first isolated in California in 1969, according to the CDC. Mystery illnesses: A mother's painful quest for answers.

Article: In the US, the most popular way to welcome the new year is with a big party. Some parties are at private homes. But in recent years, it has become more and more common for Americans to go to a hotel or eating-place on the night of December 31st. There, they can eat a big dinner, drink champagne, and dance to orchestra music. Most New Year's parties are usually noisy. People shout and sing. And often, guests blow on small noisemakers when the new year arrives at midnight. This tradition of noise making is believed to start centuries ago. People thought that loud sounds would drive away the bad spirits of the old year. The biggest, noisiest New Year's party in the US takes place in Times Square in New York. Thousands of people gather there. Some of them ring bells and set fireworks. Others blow whistles of car horns . And at twelve o'clock, they begin to cheer as an electric sign in the shape of a red apple lights up on top of a tall building. The Times Square celebration includes another well-known American tradition. Since 1929, the band of musician Guy Lombardo has given a concert on New Year's Eve. Guy Lombardo died in 1977. But, Bill Lombardo, has kept the tradition alive with a band concert at a New York city hotel. When the crowds in Times Square start cheering the arrival of the new year, television cameras show the band playing the song Auld Lang Syne.

Given the question: Given the below context: Jennifer Stanton is a rebellious teen who constantly argues with her parents. She feels that they are overly protective of her and that they are exceedingly strict. Her father William disapproves of her clothes and friends. William's aggressive attitude has a negative impact upon his daughter's relationship with Brad, the captain of the high school football team. When Jennifer tells Brad that she is unable to attend a concert with him because her father refused to give her permission, Brad decides to break up with her. He feels that William is exerting too much control over the relationship. Although Jennifer is shocked, the fact that Brad chooses to display interest in another girl at school makes her feel even more frustrated. After meeting Nick Ryan at a gas station, they soon form a close relationship and begin going out with one another. Nick is infamous in his neighborhood for having spent time in jail on an assault charge. When Jennifer's parents decide to spend a weekend away from the house, Jennifer uses this as an opportunity to get closer to Nick. Her parents decide to return early and she is caught in her parents' bed with Nick. William is unable to contain his fury, threatens Nick and chases him out of the house. She claims she loves Nick and decides to see him secretly. She applies makeup to her own eye to make it appear bruised.

This happened a long, long time ago - way back in 1864. Imagine that! The ship, called a paddle steamer (which is a type of boat that uses wheels with paddles to move in the water), sank beneath the sea, and now, with the help of Google--you know, the search engine we use to find things on the internet--we can see and explore this hidden chapter of the underwater world. How did Google do this, you ask? Well, they used special images or photographs from something known as the Catlin Seaview Survey. Think of it this way - you know when you're playing with your toy boat in the bathtub and it gets turned upside down? What if we could take pictures of your toy boat under the water? That's what the Catlin Seaview Survey does, but instead of your toy boat, they take pictures of real sunken ships like the Mary Celeste. The wreckage of Mary Celeste is very popular among divers. Now, diving is a bit like swimming but it's deeper into the sea. These divers like to visit this ship near to the shores of a beautiful island called Bermuda. It lies around 55 feet under the waves of the sea. You know the height of your dad? Imagine him standing on one another about 10 times. That's how deep it is! Isn't it marvelous to see how technology like Google can recreate the lost world and share it with everyone? We can learn about our history, about the great Mary Celeste, without leaving the comfort of our home! It's like having a magical underwater journey all by yourself.
