Programs that follow a knowledge-based approach typically have a higher probability of successful cost and schedule outcomes. Does it follow that \\"Although the knowledge-based approach is more successful, it requires more effort and funding to implement.\\"?","completion":"To determine whether the statement \\"Although the knowledge-based approach is more successful, it requires more effort and funding to implement.\\" follows from the given information, let me analyze it step-by-step: 1. First, I'll reiterate the given information: \\"Programs that follow a knowledge-based approach typically have a higher probability of successful cost and schedule outcomes.\\" 2. Next, I need to assess if a knowledge-based approach, which leads to better cost and schedule outcomes, would necessarily require more effort and funding. 3. A knowledge-based approach, by definition, relies on a comprehensive understanding of the subject matter and incorporates the expertise and experience of professionals. This involves gathering, organizing, and applying information effectively. 4. Comparing this to non-knowledge-based approaches, which might not rely on the same level of expertise, it seems reasonable to assume that the development and utilization of a knowledge-based system could involve higher levels of effort. 5. However, it is not necessarily true that a knowledge-based approach will always require more funding. The additional effort put into the process initially might lead to a more efficient and well-organized system, potentially reducing costs in the long run. Additional funding may be needed to support expert opinions, data acquisition, and system development. But this can vary depending on the nature of the project, and in some cases, it may even cost less due to reduced errors, rework, and improved decision-making. Conclusion: It is reasonable to infer that a knowledge-based approach would likely require more effort compared to non-knowledge-based approaches. However, it depends on the specific context and project whether the knowledge-based approach requires more funding or not. Therefore, the statement that a knowledge-based approach requires more effort and funding to implement does not necessarily follow from the given information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Information: - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"mágma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - A canyon (Spanish: cañón) or gorge is a deep cleft between escarpments or cliffs resulting from the erosive activity of a river over geologic timescales. Rivers have a natural tendency to cut through underlying surfaces so will eventually wear away rock layers to lessen their own pitch slowing their waters; given enough time, their bottoms will gradually reach a baseline elevationwhich is the same elevation as the body of water it will eventually drain into. This action, when the river source and mouth are at much different base elevations will form a canyon, particularly through regions where softer rock layers are intermingled with harder layers more resistant to weathering. - A landform is a natural feature of the solid surface of the Earth or other planetary body. Landforms together make up a given terrain, and their arrangement in the landscape is known as topography. Typical landforms include hills, mountains, plateaus, canyons, valleys, as well as shoreline features such as bays, peninsulas, and seas, including submerged features such as mid-ocean ridges, volcanoes, and the great ocean basins. - Earth, otherwise known as the world, is the third planet from the Sun and the only object in the Universe known to harbor life. It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - Volcanic gases include a variety of substances given off by active (or, at times, by dormant) volcanoes. These include gases trapped in cavities (vesicles) in volcanic rocks, dissolved or dissociated gases in magma and lava, or gases emanating directly from lava or indirectly through ground water heated by volcanic action. - A planetary body or planetary object is any secondary body in the Solar System that is geologically differentiated or in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus has a planet-like geology: a planet, dwarf planet, or the larger moons and asteroids. - In hillslope geomorphology, a rill is a shallow channel (no more than a few tens of centimetres deep) cut into soil by the erosive action of flowing water. Similar but smaller incised channels are known as microrills; larger incised channels are known as gullies. - A valley is a low area between hills, often with a river running through it. - A bay is a body of water connected to an ocean or lake, formed by an indentation of the shoreline. A large bay may be called a \\"gulf\\", a \\"sea\\", a \\"sound\\", or a \\"bight\\". A \\"cove\\" is a smaller circular or oval coastal inlet with a narrow entrance; some coves may be referred to as bays. A \\"fjord\\" is a particularly steep bay shaped by glacial activity. - A sea is a large body of salt water that is surrounded in whole or in part by land. More broadly, \\"the sea\\" is the interconnected system of Earth's salty, oceanic watersconsidered as one global ocean or as several principal oceanic divisions. The sea moderates Earth's climate and has important roles in the water cycle, carbon cycle, and nitrogen cycle. Although the sea has been traveled and explored since prehistory, the modern scientific study of the seaoceanographydates broadly to the British \\"Challenger\\" expedition of the 1870s. The sea is conventionally divided into up to five large oceanic sectionsincluding the International Hydrographic Organization's four named oceans (the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, and Arctic) and the Southern Ocean; smaller, second-order sections, such as the Mediterranean, are known as \\"seas\\". - A LAND (Local Area Network Denial) attack is a DoS (Denial of Service) attack that consists of sending a special poison spoofed packet to a computer, causing it to lock up. The security flaw was first discovered in 1997 by someone using the alias \\"m3lt\\", and has resurfaced many years later in operating systems such as Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP SP2. - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area , usually in the form of a peak . A mountain is generally steeper than a hill . Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism . These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth . Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers , weather conditions , and glaciers . A few mountains are isolated summits , but most occur in huge mountain ranges . High elevations on mountains produce colder climates than at sea level . These colder climates strongly affect the ecosystems of mountains : different elevations have different plants and animals . Because of the less hospitable terrain and climate , mountains tend to be used less for agriculture and more for resource extraction and recreation , such as mountain climbing . The highest mountain on Earth is Mount Everest in the Himalayas of Asia , whose summit is 8,850 m ( 29,035 ft ) above mean sea level . The highest known mountain on any planet in the Solar System is Olympus Mons on Mars at 21,171 m ( 69,459 ft ) . - Terrain or relief (also topographical relief) is the vertical and horizontal dimension of the land surface. When relief is described underwater, the term bathymetry is used. The Latin Word \\"Terra (The root word of terrain),\\" is \\"Earth.\\" - A river is a natural flowing watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing towards an ocean, sea, lake or another river. In some cases a river flows into the ground and becomes dry at the end of its course without reaching another body of water. Small rivers can be referred to using names such as stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill. There are no official definitions for the generic term river as applied to geographic features, although in some countries or communities a stream is defined by its size. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; examples are \\"run\\" in some parts of the United States, \\"burn\\" in Scotland and northeast England, and \\"beck\\" in northern England. Sometimes a river is defined as being larger than a creek, but not always: the language is vague. - Volcanic rock (often shortened to volcanics in scientific contexts) is a rock formed from magma erupted from a volcano. In other words, it differs from other igneous rock by being of volcanic origin. Like all rock types, the concept of volcanic rock is artificial, and in nature volcanic rocks grade into hypabyssal and metamorphic rocks and constitute an important element of some sediments and sedimentary rocks. For these reasons, in geology, volcanics and shallow hypabyssal rocks are not always treated as distinct. In the context of Precambrian shield geology, the term \\"volcanic\\" is often applied to what are strictly metavolcanic rocks. - In geology and earth science, a plateau (or ; plural plateaus or plateaux), also called a high plain or tableland, is an area of highland, usually consisting of relatively flat terrain that is raised significantly above the surrounding area, often with one or more sides with steep slopes. - A mid-ocean ridge is an underwater mountain system formed by plate tectonics. It consists of various mountains linked in chains, typically having a valley known as a rift running along its spine. This type of oceanic mountain ridge is characteristic of what is known as an oceanic spreading center, which is responsible for seafloor spreading. The production of new seafloor results from mantle upwelling in response to plate spreading; this isentropic upwelling solid mantle material eventually exceeds the solidus and melts. The buoyant melt rises as magma at a linear weakness in the oceanic crust, and emerges as lava, creating new crust upon cooling. A mid-ocean ridge demarcates the boundary between two tectonic plates, and consequently is termed a divergent plate boundary. - Volcanism is the phenomenon of eruption of molten rock (magma) onto the surface of the Earth or a solid-surface planet or moon, where lava, pyroclastics and volcanic gases erupt through a break in the surface called a vent. It includes all phenomena resulting from and causing magma within the crust or mantle of the body, to rise through the crust and form volcanic rocks on the surface. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Topography is the study of the shape and features of the surface of the Earth and other observable astronomical objects including planets, moons, and asteroids. The topography of an area could refer to the surface shapes and features themselves, or a description (especially their depiction in maps). After reading the paragraphs above, choose the best answer for the entity that related to 'mountain' with the relationship of 'part of'.

I recently watched Winter Soldier, and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel-- except it was about Iraq rather than Vietnam. Similar to Winter Soldier because of it's one-sided message, both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses, and allow our young and brave (and often naive) to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering. Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines, but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills necessary to effectively win the hearts and minds of the people they're supposedly fighting for. This is ultimately what lost the war in Vietnam, and will likely lose the war in Iraq as well. My only negative comment is that the film is so one-sided it could be easily passed off as left- wing propaganda. Not by me, mind you, but by those aiming to discredit the film and message. A more balanced point of view would speak to a larger audience. Choose your answer. How would you describe the sentiment of this review? Choices: 1). negative 2). positive","completion":"This review can be described as leaning towards a positive sentiment. Although the reviewer points out the one-sidedness of both Winter Soldier and The Ground Truth, they highlight the effective presentation of the films in illustrating the impact of false pretenses and inadequate training of soldiers on conflicts like the Vietnam War and the Iraq War. They mention the connection between the two films, effectively driving their point home about the similarities and the repeating pattern of events in history. Additionally, the reviewer acknowledges the importance of the message shown in both films, despite expressing a concern that the one-sided nature could lead some to dismiss the films as mere propaganda. Their suggestion for a more balanced point of view to reach a broader audience further demonstrates that they appreciate the overall message of the films and wish for its expansion to a wider group of people.

Please answer the following question: What is the answer for the question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005? from the following article ? The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way.

Now that my energy levels are returning I though that it is about time I told you about these amazing products! Okoii products are handmade by Yoko, formally from Japan, now living in Australia. Her aim was to introduce Australian women to traditional natural ingredients from Japan and Asia that they may not previously have been aware of. Some of these ingredients have been used in Japan for upwards of 1000 years, and recently the benefits of such ingredients have been scientifically proven. When you place an order with Okoii, your products are then made by hand, one by one, so you know that they are as fresh as they can possibly be. Other than Lush' Fresh Face Masks, I can't think of any other product that would be as fresh as Okoii. I find it quite exciting to know that when I purchase a product from Okoii, that it hasn't been sitting on the shelf of a warehouse for months, slowly deteriorating. It is recommended that the products be kept in the fridge to maintain their freshness and the all come with a recommended used by date that is between 3-6 months from when it was made. The first product that I am going to introduce you to is the Luxury Rice Bran Face Soap. I decided to review this one on its own for two reasons. Firstly, it was my absolute favourite of all the Okoii products I tried; and secondly, it was actually the product that I was most fearful of trying. Why? Well, the first beauty rule that is drummed into every girls head is to NEVER USE SOAP ON YOUR FACE and I was being forced to break this rule (I am a first born goodie goodie who NEVER breaks the rules - this was tough for me to do!).

Los Angeles (CNN) -- AEG Live executives feared Michael Jackson would sabotage his comeback concerts five days before his death, the company's CEO testified Thursday. Randy Phillips refused to advance money to help Jackson pay his staff because he believed the singer was \\"in an anticipatory breach\\" of his contract because he had missed rehearsals, he testified. Phillips testified in the sixth week of the trial to decide whether the concert promoter is liable in Jackson's death for the negligent hiring, retention or supervision of Dr. Conrad Murray, who was convicted of involuntary manslaughter. The lawsuit filed by Jackson's mother and children contends that Phillips and other AEG Live executives pressured Jackson to attend rehearsals despite his deteriorating health and ignored red flags that should have warned them about the dangers posed by Murray. OPTIONS: - AEG Live lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - CNN lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Conrad Murray lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Jackson lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Los Angeles lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Michael Jackson lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Murray lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Phillips lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. - Randy Phillips lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia.","completion":"- AEG Live lawyers claim the company executives had no way of knowing that Murray was giving Jackson nightly infusions of the surgical anesthetic propofol to treat his insomnia. This is the correct answer because AEG Live is the concert promoter being accused of being liable in Jackson's death. Their lawyers would be the ones claiming that the executives had no knowledge of Murray's actions. The other options are wrong because they are not the ones responsible for the trial or accused of negligence: - CNN lawyers, Los Angeles lawyers, and Phillips lawyers are not involved in the lawsuit regarding Jackson's death. - Conrad Murray lawyers and Murray lawyers would not be claiming innocence for AEG Live executives, as Murray was already convicted of involuntary manslaughter. - Jackson lawyers and Michael Jackson lawyers are the ones accusing AEG Live of negligence, so they would not be arguing that AEG Live executives had no way of knowing about Murray's actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:The island's previous Independent-led administration lodged an appeal after the High Court ruled in favour of a father who took his child on holiday. The Supreme Court challenge to that ruling is due to be heard next week. Conservative Chris Whitehouse said the case should have been dropped after the initial magistrates' hearing in 2015. Mr Whitehouse, who became executive member for children's services after the Conservatives took control of the council last week, said: \\"I have not changed my position on the school absences case, it should have been dropped immediately after the magistrates' hearing. \\"I am limited in what I can say formally about this case because of a legal agreement entered into by my predecessor on behalf of the council. \\"I intend to take further independent legal advice and may issue a purely personal statement in due course.\\" The Supreme Court hearing, due to be heard on Tuesday 31 January, follows months of legal wrangling over the case of Jonathan Platt, who was fined Â£120 after taking his daughter to Florida. When magistrates concluded Mr Platt had no case to answer because his daughter had attended school regularly, Isle of Wight Council appealed to the High Court, which also ruled in favour of Mr Platt. The latest challenge was launched by the then Independent-led council on the request of Schools Minister Nick Gibb, with a commitment from the Department for Education (DfE) to meet the council's costs. A Department for Education spokeswoman said: \\"Our position remains that children should not be taken out of school without good reason. \\"That is why we have tightened the rules and are supporting schools and local authorities to use their powers to tackle unauthorised absence. \\"The evidence shows that every extra day of school missed can affect a pupil's chances of achieving good GCSEs.\\" Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The Supreme Court is due to hear a challenge to a High Court ruling in favor of a father who took his child on holiday during school term.

Article: London police are well known in the world. Today there are policemen everywhere, but in 1700 there was no policeman in London at all. A few old men used to protect the city streets at night, and they were not paid very much. About 300 years ago, London started to get bigger. The city was very dirty and many people were poor. There were so many thieves who stole money in the streets that people had to stay in their homes as much as possible. In 1750, Henry Fielding started to pay a group of people to stop thieves. They were like policemen and were called \\"Bow Street Runners\\" because they worked near Bow Street. Fifty years later, there were 120 Bow Street Runners, but London had become very big and needed more policemen. So, in 1829, the first London Police Force was started with 3,000 officers. Most of the men worked on foot, but a few rode horses. There was no policewoman in London until 1920. Today, London police are quite well paid and only a few police officers still ride horses. Perhaps the London Police Force's greatest achievement is to meet changing conditions and provide excellent police service .

There's a bitter battle being fought on the High Street between retail titans Marks & Spencer and John Lewis. What are they fighting over? Well, that would be you, Mrs Middle England. It seems that every move M&S makes, John Lewis quickly copies it. Take the surprising similarities between John Lewis's spring/summer own-brand catalogue for the industry, released late last month, and M&S's, which came out in November. The pictures of models in little stripy dresses, floral prints and trendy pink suits are almost indistinguishable. Femail put key looks from each collection to the test and asked top independent stylist ANNE HAMLYN, founder of fashion consultancy company DressMe, to give her verdict... John Lewis: Somerset by Alice Temperley wide-leg trousers, £99, and silk jacket, £140. M&S: Jacket, £69, and Per Una trousers, £55. Wrap tops work nicely with wider leg trousers, which are an on-trend look this season. The John Lewis print is lovely. The Alice Temperley trousers are probably my favourite item from the entire John Lewis collection. Yes, they're a bit more expensive than most of the other clothes, but definitely worth it. You could easily team these with a jacket and heels for work. And thanks to the fabulous ribbon detail down the side of each leg, you could dress them up for a sexier look at night. These trousers would be flattering whatever your size. Sadly, M&S misses the mark. Its jacket is very heavy and strangely shiny - it looks like something you'd sell in a Christmas party range, not put in a spring collection. I'm not a fan of the trousers either, particularly after seeing the excellent John Lewis version. These are creased even on the hanger and they're cut very straight at the hip, which is going to be a problem for pear-shaped women. One good thing is that they're properly lined, so at least your knickers won't show through the white fabric. Personally, I'd spend the extra money and buy the Temperley trousers at John Lewis. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Cashmere jumper, £69, and Collection pink trousers, £59. M&S: Pink cashmere jumper, £65, and Per Una pink trousers, £59. Both retailers have gone for acid brights, with varying degrees of success. The John Lewis sweater is dull and dated - it's limp on the hanger, so it's going to look awful after a bit of wear. The rolled hem on the neckline and cuffs looks cheap. On the other hand, the trousers are well-cut, with ample room round the bottom. They've designed them with women's curves in mind. Knitwear is one of M&S's strong suits and this jumper is lovely. The longer back makes it stylish and the finish looks expensive. The cashmere is much heavier than the John Lewis version, despite the fact they're almost the same price. However, the trousers, are not good. The crotch is too low and there's too much fabric in the waistband. And why have the designers included fussy zip pockets at the side? WINNER: M&S for cashmere, JOHN LEWIS for trousers. John Lewis: Dress, £89. M&S: Navy and ivory dress, £35. The John Lewis dress would suit any age. It's beautifully tailored and is flattering whatever your shape. The nautical look isn't overdone (no sailor collars or brass buttons), so it could work in the office or at a wedding. The fabric is a little bit retro, which again will appeal to an older woman. Nautical stripes aren't a particular trend for 2014, but they're a spring/summer staple that you will see cropping up every year and I think John Lewis have executed this look well. Oh dear - then we come to M&S. I wonder who the designers had in mind when they designed this? It's too floppy and girly to wear to work, but too prim to be sexy. The scalloped edging on the stripes is weird and sticks up unattractively, particularly at the seams. Yes, it's cheap, but I just can't see many people looking good in it. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Collection white dress, £79, johnlewis.com. M&S: Per Una dress with leather panels, £199, marksandspencer.com. At first glance, these dresses are similar - until you put them on. Though a fitted, white dress isn't the easiest thing to wear unless you are super-slim, John Lewis has made their cotton version as flattering as possible. The waist seam curves upwards slightly, drawing the eye away from the tummy. And the deeper neckline elongates the silhouette. Then there's the M&S version, which I really don't like. Yes, they've picked fashion- forward snakeskin-esque fabric (which feels rather cheap to me), but it's clingy so will be unforgiving on lumps and bumps. Then there's that high neckline, which makes even our model look broad-shouldered. I'm surprised this is from Per Una, which is where I often take clients who want a larger size as the range goes up to 20. I can't for the life of me picture any of them wanting to buy this dress, or any older women looking anything less than mutton dressed as lamb in it. And the final blow is that it's more than double the price of John Lewis's version. My advice is to steer clear. WINNER: John Lewis. John Lewis: Floral print top, £49, and trousers, £59. M&S: Autograph floral top, £65, and trousers, £75. The John Lewis shirt is just about OK if you want to get this on-trend yellow into your wardrobe without coming on too strong, but how did those shocking trousers get past the design team? Look at the way that white panel runs across the hips at the widest area - and it's even worse at the back where it runs right across the knicker line. It's a classic case of using a print without thinking carefully enough about what it will look like on a real person. If I were a betting woman, I'd say these will be on the sale rail before long. I'm also not convinced by the M&S boxy floral top. I don't think it will flatter anyone with hips or a tummy. But the M&S trousers are brilliant. Despite being a critic of the store's normal range, there's often much better tailoring in the Autograph collection than in Per Una. The M&S designers have really thought about this print. It's not so huge that it will dwarf a little person, but not so small that it will be repeated hundreds of times across someone taller or wider. I'd wear these trousers with a plain sweater or silk blouse. The designers have made a very good job of this fashion-forward look. WINNER: M&S.

Envoy Brahimi Meets President Assad in Syria BEIRUT, Lebanon — The new United Nations peace envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi, said after a meeting with President Bashar al-Assad on Saturday that the civil war held consequences for “the region, and the whole world,” while acknowledging that he had not yet formulated a plan to address the escalating violence. “The crisis is very serious,” Mr. Brahimi said, adding that it was “becoming worse by the day.” That grim assessment came on the third day of Mr. Brahimi’s visit to Syria, where he said he had met opposition activists, government officials and diplomats representing Russia and China, countries that have offered support for President Assad’s embattled government. Mr. Brahimi, a seasoned diplomat from Algeria, took the job of special envoy representing the United Nations and the Arab League after Kofi Annan, a former United Nations secretary general, resigned last month. In announcing his resignation, Mr. Annan insisted there could be no solution unless Mr. Assad stepped down, and blamed the intransigence of both the Syrian government and its opponents for the continuing bloodshed. In the weeks since Mr. Annan resigned, there has been no lessening of the violence, with the Syrian government relying more and more on air power to vanquish its enemies as rebel militias continue to search for weapons to counter the military’s power. On Friday, Pope Benedict XVI added his voice to those warning of the dangers posed by weapons flowing into Syria, saying that the import of arms, by the government and the rebels, must stop. At a news conference on Saturday after his meeting with Mr. Assad, Mr. Brahimi said he was “continuing the work” that Mr. Annan had started, and declined to say how his approach would differ. “It is not a secret that the gap between the parties is very wide,” he said, adding that Mr. Assad was “more aware than me of the scope and the seriousness of the crisis.” “The common ground does exist,” Mr. Brahimi said. “These are Syrians, they love their country and want peace for their country.” Since Mr. Brahimi’s arrival on Thursday, witnesses have reported intense fighting in two neighborhoods south of Damascus, the capital, Hajar al-Aswad and Qadam. Protesters could be seen marching in both neighborhoods on Friday, escorted by armed rebels. In Qadam, government security forces in sport utility vehicles tried to disrupt the march, leading to clashes. A 30-year-old protester in Qadam, who gave only his first name, Ibrahim, took a dim view of Mr. Brahimi’s mission. “The U.N. envoys will do nothing, because they have no power,” he said. “They will spend their time in meaningless meetings with regime officials, or opposition figures who have no presence on the ground.” On Saturday, at least three people were killed in Hajar al-Aswad during hours of intense shelling by the government, activists in Damascus said. Hania Mourtada and Hwaida Saad contributed reporting from Beirut, and an employee of The New York Times from Damascus, Syria.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: Who does Lowell speak to constantly, as if they are children? , can you please find it? It is implied that, in the future, all plant life on Earth has become extinct. As many specimens as possible have been preserved in a series of enormous, greenhouse-like geodesic domes, attached to a large spaceship named \\"Valley Forge\\", forming part of a fleet of American Airlines space freighters, currently just outside the orbit of Saturn. Freeman Lowell, one of four crewmen aboard, is the resident botanist and ecologist who carefully preserves a variety of plants for their eventual return to Earth and the reforestation of the planet. Lowell spends most of his time in the domes, both cultivating the crops and attending to the animal life. The crew receives orders to jettison and destroy the domes (with nuclear charges) and return the freighters to commercial service. After four of the six domes are jettisoned and blown up Lowell rebels and opts instead to save the plants and animals on his ship. Lowell kills one of his crew-mates who arrives to plant explosives in his favorite dome, and his right leg is seriously injured in the process. He then jettisons and triggers the destruction of one of the remaining domes, trapping and killing the remaining two crewmen. Enlisting the aid of the ship's three \\"drones\\" (service robots), Huey, Dewey and Louie (named after Donald Duck's nephews), Lowell stages a fake premature explosion as a ruse and sends the Valley Forge careening towards Saturn in an attempt to hijack the ship and flee with the last forest dome. He then reprograms the drones to perform surgery on his leg and sets the Valley Forge on a risky course through Saturn's rings. Later, as the ship endures the rough passage, Drone 3 (Louie) is lost, but the ship and its remaining dome emerge relatively undamaged on the other side of the rings. Lowell and the surviving drones, Huey and Dewey, set out into deep space to maintain the forest. Lowell reprograms Huey and Dewey to plant trees and play poker. Lowell begins speaking to them constantly, as if they are children. Answer:","completion":"Lowell speaks constantly to the ship's three \\"drones\\" - Huey, Dewey, and Louie, as if they are children.

Given the question: When people are huddled at a conference or professional event, the subject often turns to the value of failure and embracing feedback. “It is the key to self improvement!”, many chant, channeling their inner self-help gurus, Sadly, many don’t quite practice what they preach. Seeing the value in critical feedback and the lessons that failure can offer is a tough pill to swallow. For those confident in their capabilities, their social standing (in their companies/communities etc), and their abilities, the pill goes down a little easier. For those who experience imposter syndrome, feel insecure about their work, or are new in their careers, it is more difficult. Here’s the thing: these are not binary personalities. While some people are overly confident about themselves, and some people are overly insecure about themselves, most people have a blend of both. As such, even the most confident people can feel the sting when they get critical feedback or screw something up. This is a guide with some things I have learned over the years about how to turn feedback and failure to your advantage. In my not-so-humble opinion, the perfect blend of a human being is confidence in their ability to execute and accomplish their goals, but with a healthy dose of awareness of their current limitations. Let’s face it, overly confident people are often not just at risk of being swallowed up by ego, but can also lack the empathy to understand other folks they need to work with who don’t share the same confidence. An understanding of our current limitations is healthy. When we understand we are not great at something, but we are eager to learn and improve, it opens us up to counsel and tuition. The confidence piece plays an important role in helping us to remember: “I might suck now, but I am going to learn and get better”. When we have this in our heads it makes the journey more palatable: we know that our failure to succeed right now is temporary and it will improve.

Question: \\"What effect does boosting bass and cutting treble have on the original signal?\\" Context: \\"Due to recording mastering and manufacturing limitations, both high and low frequencies were removed from the first recorded signals by various formulae. With low frequencies, the stylus must swing a long way from side to side, requiring the groove to be wide, taking up more space and limiting the playing time of the record. At high frequencies, hiss, pops, and ticks are significant. These problems can be reduced by using equalization to an agreed standard. During recording the amplitude of low frequencies is reduced, thus reducing the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies is increased. The playback equipment boosts bass and cuts treble so as to restore the tonal balance in the original signal; this also reduces the high frequency noise. Thus more music will fit on the record, and noise is reduced.\\" Answer:","completion":"Boosting bass and cutting treble in the playback equipment has a significant effect on the original signal, mainly in terms of tonal balance restoration and noise reduction. To understand this effect, it is essential to consider the reasons behind the equalization techniques used during the recording and playback processes. During the early days of recorded music, limitations in mastering and manufacturing imposed the need for reducing both high and low frequencies from the original recorded signals. In the case of low frequencies, the stylus had to make larger movements from side to side, demanding wider grooves and taking up more space on the record. This limited the playing time of the record. On the other hand, high frequencies presented the issue of hiss, pops, and ticks, which affected the overall listening experience. To combat these limitations, equalization techniques were employed. During the recording process, the amplitude of low frequencies was reduced to minimize the groove width required, and the amplitude at high frequencies was increased. This allowed more music to be fit onto the record without significantly compromising the sound quality. However, this standard equalization alone was not enough to provide an optimal sound reproduction, as the original tonal balance was altered. The playback equipment was designed to address this issue by boosting bass and cutting treble to restore the original tonal balance of the music. Boosting bass compensates for the reduced amplitude of low frequencies that occurred during the recording process, allowing for a fuller and more accurate reproduction of the original signal's low-end sounds. Cutting treble, on the other hand, has a two-fold effect: it not only restores the original amplitude of high frequencies but also reduces the high-frequency noise resulting from the limitations in the recording technology. By boosting bass and cutting treble, the playback equipment effectively negates the equalization applied during the recording process, ultimately restoring the original signal's tonal balance, while also minimizing noise and other audio artifacts. Consequently, this leads to an improved listening experience and a more accurate representation of the original music within the limitations of the recording technology."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I will provide a more detailed and specific answer. The mammalian, and more specifically, human colon is home to a vast and diverse community of bacteria, collectively referred to as gut microbiota. These microbial communities play a vital role in nutrient acquisition, regulation of host metabolism, shaping immune responses, and providing protection against pathogens. The most predominant species belong typically to two primary bacterial phyla: Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes. The Firmicutes comprise several genera, including but not limited to, Lactobacillus, Bacillus, Streptococcus, and Clostridium. The Bacteroidetes phylum contains notably Bacteroides and Prevotella. Another significant component of this microbiota belongs to the Actinobacteria phylum, particularly the Bifidobacterium genus, reputed for their probiotic properties. A lesser but significant proportion of the microbiota falls under the Proteobacteria phylum (including Escherichia and Helicobacter), as well as the Verrucomicrobia phylum, with Akkermansia muciniphila being a common representative species. Some yeasts and fungi (e.g., Saccharomyces and Candida species) also colonize the colon, albeit in much smaller quantities compared to bacteria. These communities are not static; they are affected by various factors such as diet, antibiotic usage, the host's immune state, and environmental factors. Alterations to the microbiota, known as dysbiosis, can lead to various health conditions, including inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, and even neuropsychiatric disorders. In essence, the mammalian colon is a complex and dynamic ecosystem teeming with bacteria, fungus and yeasts, predominantly from the phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia. Cultivating a balanced and diverse gut microbiota is integral to maintaining overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A member of the president’s Secret Service protective detail, who was being investigated for having an unreported romantic relationship with a foreign national, was found dead Saturday in an apparent suicide, according to law enforcement sources. The official cause of Rafael Prieto’s death is still pending. Text Size - + reset The investigation had led to the suspension of his access to Secret Service facilities, according to sources familiar with the case. The Secret Service does not believe that Prieto passed any sensitive or classified information to the Mexican woman, according to a senior law enforcement official. Instead, Prieto was in the midst of an “administrative process” related to his ongoing relationship, the source said. A well-liked veteran of the agency, Prieto may have violated security policy by not disclosing his close and continuing contact with the Mexican woman to his bosses, sources familiar with the probe said. There has been a crackdown on such relationships in the wake of the Secret Service prostitution scandal in Colombia earlier this year and ensuing reports of similar behavior in other places around the world over the course of many years. If found guilty of violating Secret Service disclosure policy, Prieto could have faced sanctions including dismissal. In the past, the alleged affair might have garnered a slap on the wrist, according to the law enforcement source. But the prostitution scandal has heightened sensitivity to unauthorized contact with foreign nationals not only at the Secret Service but at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the men and women who protect the president. “Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication and friendships,” Secret Service spokesman Ed Donovan said. “The Secret Service is mourning the loss of a valued colleague.” Donovan declined to discuss the circumstances of Prieto’s death or the details of the administrative process that led to Prieto’s suspension. According to a 1993 New York Times wedding announcement, Prieto was married to producer and consultant Ruth Pomerance. He hosted her for a tour of the West Wing on Oct. 1, 2011, according to visitor logs. Prieto had split time between Washington and the couple's home in New York. But they had become estranged, according to a law enforcement official. Prieto was also a member of former President Bill Clinton's protective team in New York. ||||| For nearly six years, a senior Secret Service agent kept his extramarital affair with a Mexican woman a secret from the agency responsible for protecting the president. But in the wake of an embarrassing prostitution scandal involving 13 agents and officers, Rafael Prieto's secret was revealed by a fellow employee amid concerns the Secret Service wasn't enforcing its rules consistently. With an internal investigation ongoing, Prieto apparently committed suicide last week, people familiar with the matter told The Associated Press. Prieto, a married father assigned to the security detail for President Barack Obama, admitted the years-long relationship with a woman from Mexico to U.S. investigators when confronted. Before his death, he was the subject of an investigation focused on whether he violated agency rules that require disclosing relationships with foreigners, those familiar with the matter said. They spoke on condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss Prieto's death or the investigation. Secret Service rules require that employees with a security clearance notify the agency about any relationship with a foreign citizen to ensure that the person is not a risk to national security. There is no evidence that Prieto's relationship posed any security threat. Failing to disclose such a relationship would be not be a crime, but a violation of the agency's administrative rules. Prieto was serving on the protective detail for Obama, though he was not on duty at the time of his death. As recently as 2009, he was identified as the resident agent in charge at the Secret Service's office in White Plains, N.Y. He had worked for the Secret Service for 22 years. He was 47, according to public records. Prieto's apparent cause of death was carbon monoxide poisoning. He was found in his car with the engine running. His death was being investigated by Metropolitan Police in Washington and the medical examiner's office. \\"Rafael Prieto had a distinguished 20-year career with the Secret Service that was marked by accomplishment, dedication and friendships,\\" agency spokesman Edwin Donovan said in a statement. \\"The Secret Service is mourning the loss of a valued colleague.\\" The Secret Service protects the lives of the president, vice president and their families, and also investigates counterfeiting, bank fraud, computer hacking and other financial crimes. The behavior of Secret Service agents and officers has come under scrutiny since 13 employees were implicated in a prostitution scandal in Cartagena, Colombia, in April. Those employees were in the Caribbean resort city in advance of Obama's arrival for a South American summit. After a night of heavy partying in some of Cartagena's bars and clubs, the employees brought women, including prostitutes, back to the where they were staying. The incident became public after one agent refused to pay a prostitute and argued with her in a hotel hallway. Prieto was never in Colombia during the scandal. Eight of those Secret Service employees have been forced out of the agency, three were cleared of serious misconduct and at least two are fighting to get their jobs back. The scandal prompted Secret Service Director Mark Sullivan to issue a new code of conduct that barred employees from drinking within 10 hours of the start of a shift or bringing foreigners to their hotel rooms. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"Rafael Prieto, a member of the President's Secret Service protective detail, was found dead in an apparent suicide amid an investigation into his undisclosed romantic relationship with a foreign national. Prieto's access to Secret Service facilities had been suspended, and he was undergoing an administrative process related to the ongoing relationship. The agency does not believe he passed any sensitive or classified information to the Mexican woman.

Summarize the following: If you want to write sad stories, you'll have to start by seeking inspiration. Consider what makes you sad. For about 10 minutes, free write on the topic of sadness. Talk about the kind of situations that make you sad. There are a lot of changes that come in life that can make people sad. Friendships and other relationships ending can cause sadness. The death of a loved one can also make someone sad. Sadness can also be caused by more minor events. Losing a family pet can be sad. Having to move to another city can be a cause of sadness. Consider what you think sadness is. What thoughts and emotions do you associate with sadness? As you write, talk about your own personal experiences with sadness. For example, when in life did you feel the most sad? Why? You may be able to use experiences from your own life in a short story. The best way to become a better writer is to read more. If you want to know how to write sad stories, you'll have to read a lot of stories with unhappy themes and plots. Read sad stories. Ask your friends and teachers for recommendations for sad stories. As you read, do so actively. Pay attention to how writers build their stories and characters. How do the stories start? How do they end? Why do you have an emotional response to these stories? Ask yourself these questions as you read. Pay attention to what works in these stories. When writing a short story, you only have a short period of time to get your reader's attention. As you read short stories, pay attention to opening lines. How does the writer get your attention? Where does the story start? Many short stories may start when some of the important actions or events have already occurred. Authors may recount such events in flashbacks or imply them through means like character dialogue. If you want to write a story, you'll need to know basic story structure. Stories are made up of exposition, rising action, a climax, falling action, and a resolution. The first parts of the story come with exposition and rising action. Your exposition comes at the beginning of the story. This is where you explain who the main character is and what he or she is doing at the beginning of the story. Exposition should be brief and grab the reader's attention. A story's rising action is the series of conflicts that move the story forward. No story can exist without a problem that needs resolving. In a sad story, there should be an element of tragedy to that problem. For example, maybe your main character is caring for her sick dog. The rising action could include her taking the dog to the vet, finding out the sickness is worse than she thought, and struggling with the setbacks and challenges of her dog's medical needs. Once you've figured out basic story structure, write a short outline for your story. Write out how your story will begin, what rising action you'll include, the climax, and how the story is resolved. An outline can be brief. It's not necessary to use full sentences in an outline. You just need to have some sense of the basic events that will occur. You can separate your outline into the five elements of story structure: exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution. An outline should use numbers and letters for structure. Big headings, like \\"exposition,\\" can be marked with a roman numeral. You can use letters or regular numbers to elaborate on aspects of that heading. For example, \\"I. Exposition, a. introduce Susan.\\" To help you see how to write an outline, let's return to this article's example. You could begin the outline with something like this: \\"Exposition, a. Introduce Ada, crying in art class, b. Sad to be reminded of her father's cancer, c. Returns home alone (her mother is at work) to help care for her ailing dog.\\" Summary:","completion":"To write sad stories, begin by seeking inspiration and understanding what makes you sad.

Write the last sentence in this story. (CNN) -- Some found it shocking when Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber granted convicted double-murderer Gary Haugen a reprieve Tuesday, setting aside Haugen's scheduled December 6 execution. Haugen, who killed another prisoner while serving a life sentence for a previous murder, had waived all appeals. In a previous term as governor, Kitzhaber allowed two men to be executed, and he explained Tuesday that \\"I simply cannot participate once again in something that I believe to be morally wrong.\\" A medical doctor with an active license, the governor also referred to his oath as a physician to \\"do no harm\\" as he announced Haugen's reprieve and a moratorium on executions for the remainder of his term in office. Notably, in issuing a reprieve (or delay) rather than commuting Haugen's sentence, Kitzhaber left open the possibility of Haugen's execution under a future governor. The courts that heard OPTIONS: - CNN's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Gary Haugen's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Haugen's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - John Kitzhaber's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Kitzhaber's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Mark Osler's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Oregon's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair. - Osler's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair.","completion":"- Haugen's appeals (up to the point he dropped them) found the process fair.

They boast over five hundred species of birds, and thousands of species of plants. Across the pond in England the situation is completely different. Centuries of extensive farming, industrialization, and urban sprawls have made it one of the least biodiverse place on Earth. But I can use this background: \\"There is now unequivocal evidence that biodiversity loss reduces the efficiency by which ecological communities capture biologically essential resources, produce biomass, decompose and recycle biologically essential nutrients... There is mounting evidence that biodiversity increases the stability of ecosystem functions through time... Diverse communities are more productive because they contain key species that have a large influence on productivity and differences in functional traits among organisms increase total resource capture... The impacts of diversity loss on ecological processes might be sufficiently large to rival the impacts of many other global drivers of environmental change... Maintaining multiple ecosystem processes at multiple places and times requires higher levels of biodiversity than does a single process at a single place and time.\\" What is an answer for this question: Would the ecosystem functions be less or more stable in England than in Nicaragua? Answer:","completion":"The ecosystem functions would likely be less stable in England than in Nicaragua. This is because, as the background information states, higher levels of biodiversity increase the stability of ecosystem functions through time. Since Nicaragua is more biodiverse than England, its ecosystem functions are expected to be more stable in comparison."},{"prompt":"The Jones family and the Bell family both entered a medical study for diabetes.The members of Jones family had mostly type 1 diabetes, while Bell family members had type 2 diabetes because they ate junk-food. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which family had more adults developing diabetes 2? Hint: Type 2 diabetes is much more common than type 1 diabetes. Type 2 diabetes occurs when body cells no longer respond normally to insulin. The pancreas still makes insulin, but the cells of the body can’t use it. Being overweight and having high blood pressure increase the chances of developing type 2 diabetes. This type of diabetes usually develops in adulthood. However, it is becoming more common in teens and children because more young people are overweight now than ever before.

Hall of Fame track coach resigns after admitting affair with athlete Bev Kearney was the first African-American coach to win an NCAA national team championship in Division I track and field. (CNN) -- Hall of Fame women's track and field coach Bev Kearney, whose story of recovery from a paralyzing auto accident inspired people around the country, has resigned due to an \\"intimate consensual relationship\\" with a University of Texas athlete in 2002, the school announced Saturday night. The head of the university's legal affairs department said in a written statement that Kearney was a good person who was important to the school. \\"However, she made this terrible mistake and used unacceptably poor judgment in having this relationship,\\" Patti Ohlendorf said. The relationship began 10 1/2 years ago and ended \\"at least about eight years ago,\\" the statement said. Neither the university nor Kearney, who first told the Austin American-Statesman of her decision to step down, identified the athlete. \\"You destroy yourself. You start questioning how could you make such a judgment,\\" Kearney told the newspaper. \\"How could you make such an error after all the years? You can get consumed (by it).\\" A CNN story in August profiled the coach, who learned to walk again after she was injured in a December 26, 2002, accident that killed two of her friends. Thrown more than 50 feet from an SUV, she suffered extensive spinal injuries that left her partially paralyzed. Kearney said she never doubted her ability to walk again and continued to lead her team from her hospital bed. \\"When they told me I was paralyzed, it went in one ear and out the next ... because I had to get up and coach,\\" she said. Coach overcomes homelessness, paralysis and inspires others Track practices were recorded and then played for Kearney on a VCR in her hospital room. \\"Because I was an intuitive coach ... whatever it is you need to do, I can describe it in a way that you internalize it and you feel it without me having to demonstrate it,\\" she said. She also started a foundation that connects young people with mentors. \\"If I can expose you to the best ... it has a great chance of inspiring you to be the best,\\" Kearney explained. Kearney's teams at Texas won six national championships, the most recent in 2006. She also led the University of Florida Gators to a title in 1992. She was inducted into the U.S. Track & Field and Cross Country Coaches Association Hall of Fame in 2007. \\"(My athletes) would say that I'm tough. That I believe in being the best you can be at all times,\\" she told CNN. \\"I am going to demand their best, and I am relentless at it.\\" Kearney, 55, told the American-Statesman that she might have to sell her home and some of her personal possessions to help support the daughter she adopted after the girl's mother was killed in the 2002 accident. The paper said her attorney, Derek A. Howard, issued a statement, which said in part: \\"We believe that Ms. Kearney has been subjected to a double standard and has received far harsher punishment than that being given to her male counterparts who have engaged in similar conduct. ... It is a shame that this remarkably talented female African-American coach, who has devoted her life to helping others, is being bullied and scapegoated by the University of Texas.\\" Ohlendorf denied Sunday that gender played a role in the university's review and said she knows of no other \\"UT head coach who has entered into such a relationship with a student-athlete on his or her team.\\" Kearney was the first African-American coach to win an NCAA national team championship in Division I track and field, and she was the first African-American to serve as a head coach at Texas. Howard said Sunday that Kearney was given until Monday at noon to resign or she would be fired. He said the relationship wasn't specifically against school policy, but the rules require someone in a supervisory role to report such a relationship. \\"It's not a terminable offense,\\" he said. \\"She was a perfect coach before and prior to the relationship. She had a pristine record. Why anyone would think she is not a suitable coach is mind-boggling to me.\\" Ohlendorf called such a relationship \\"unprofessional and unacceptable.\\" \\"We told Coach Kearney and Mr. Howard that such a relationship crosses the line of trust placed in the head coach for all aspects of the athletic program and the best interests of the student-athletes in the program,\\" she said in an e-mail to CNN Sunday night. Ohlendorf said the school is not naming the student, citing privacy laws. \\"We respect her privacy and appreciate her cooperation during our review,\\" Ohlendorf said. The ex-student reported the former relationship to the school in late October, she said, leading to Kearney being placed on leave in November. The school said the athlete was an adult when the relationship took place and it had no information that Kearney had any other similar relationships.

'' - Since 1901, the Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded annually to an author from any country who has, in the words of the will of Alfred Nobel, produced \\"in the field of literature the most outstanding work in an ideal direction\\" (original Swedish: \\"den som inom litteraturen har producerat det mest framstående verket i en idealisk riktning\\"). Though individual works are sometimes cited as being particularly noteworthy, here \\"work\\" refers to an author's work as a whole. The Swedish Academy decides who, if anyone, will receive the prize in any given year. The academy announces the name of the chosen laureate in early October. It is one of the five Nobel Prizes established by the will of Alfred Nobel in 1895; the others are the Nobel Prize in Chemistry, Nobel Prize in Physics, Nobel Peace Prize, and Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. - The Charterhouse of Parma is a novel by Stendhal published in 1839. Telling the story of an Italian nobleman in the Napoleonic era and later, it was admired by Balzac, Tolstoy, André Gide and Henry James. The novel has been adapted for opera, film and television. - Émile Édouard Charles Antoine Zola (2 April 1840 29 September 1902) was a French novelist, playwright, journalist, the best-known practitioner of the literary school of naturalism, and an important contributor to the development of theatrical naturalism. He was a major figure in the political liberalization of France and in the exoneration of the falsely accused and convicted army officer Alfred Dreyfus, which is encapsulated in the renowned newspaper headline \\"J'accuse\\". Zola was nominated for the first and second Nobel Prize in Literature in 1901 and 1902. - Le Rouge et le Noir (French for The Red and the Black) is a historical psychological novel in two volumes by Stendhal, published in 1830. It chronicles the attempts of a provincial young man to rise socially beyond his modest upbringing through a combination of talent, hard work, deception, and hypocrisy. He ultimately allows his passions to betray him. - Konstantine Gamsakhurdia (May 3, 1893 July 17, 1975) was a Georgian writer and public figure, who, along with Mikheil Javakhishvili, is considered to be one of the most influential Georgian novelists of the 20th century. Educated and first published in Germany, he married Western European influences to purely Georgian thematic to produce his best works, such as \\"The Right Hand of the Grand Master\\" and \\"David the Builder\\". Hostile to the Soviet rule, he was, nevertheless, one of the few leading Georgian writers to have survived the Stalin-era repressions, including his exile to a White Sea island and several arrests. His works are noted for their character portrayals of great psychological insight. Another major feature of Gamsakhurdia's writings is a new subtlety he infused into Georgian diction, imitating an archaic language to create a sense of classicism. - Mikheil Javakhishvili (birth surname: Adamashvili ) (8 November 1880 30 September 1937) was a Georgian novelist who is regarded as one of the top twentieth-century Georgian writers. His first story appeared in 1903, but then the writer lapsed into a long pause before returning to writing in the early 1920s. His recalcitrance to the Soviet ideological pressure cost him life: he was executed during the Great Purge and his writings were banned for nearly twenty years. In the words of the modern British scholar of Russian and Georgian literature, Donald Rayfield, \\"his vivid story-telling, straight in medias res, his buoyant humour, subtle irony, and moral courage merit comparison with those of Stendhal, Guy de Maupassant, and Émile Zola. In modern Georgian prose only Konstantine Gamsakhurdia could aspire to the same international level.\\" - Alfred Dreyfus (9 October 1859 12 July 1935) was a French Jewish artillery officer whose trial and conviction in 1894 on charges of treason became one of the most tense political dramas in modern French history with a wide echo in all Europe. Known today as the Dreyfus affair, the incident eventually ended with Dreyfus' complete exoneration. - Marie-Henri Beyle (23 January 1783 23 March 1842), better known by his pen name Stendhal (or ; in English , , or ), was a 19th-century French writer. Best known for the novels \\"Le Rouge et le Noir\\" (\\"The Red and the Black\\", 1830) and \\"La Chartreuse de Parme\\" (\\"The Charterhouse of Parma\\", 1839), he is highly regarded for the acute analysis of his characters' psychology and considered one of the earliest and foremost practitioners of realism. - Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) is a public research university in London, England, and a constituent college of the federal University of London. It dates back to the foundation of London Hospital Medical College in 1785. Queen Mary College, named after Mary of Teck, was admitted to the University of London in 1915 and in 1989 merged with Westfield College to form Queen Mary and Westfield College. In 1995 Queen Mary and Westfield College merged with St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College and the London Hospital Medical College to form the School of Medicine and Dentistry. - Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin (18 December 1878 5 March 1953) was the leader of the Soviet Union from the mid-1920s until his death in 1953. Holding the post of the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, he was effectively the dictator of the state. - Russia (from the Rus'), also officially known as the Russian Federation, is a country in Eurasia. At , Russia is the largest country in the world by surface area, covering more than one-eighth of the Earth's inhabited land area, and the ninth most populous, with over 140 million people at the end of March 2016. The European western part of the country is much more populated and urbanised than the eastern, about 77% of the population live in European Russia. Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - Donald Rayfield (born 1942, Oxford) is professor of Russian and Georgian at Queen Mary University of London. He is an author of books about Russian and Georgian literature, and about Joseph Stalin and his secret police. He is also a series editor for books about Russian writers and \\"intelligentsia\\". He translated Georgian and Russian poets and prose writers. - Henri René Albert Guy de Maupassant (5 August 1850 6 July 1893) was a French writer, remembered as a master of the short story form, and as a representative of the naturalist school of writers, who depicted human lives and destinies and social forces in disillusioned and often pessimistic terms. - Oxford is a city in the South East region of England and the county town of Oxfordshire.

The practical difficulties can be illustrated by the fact that the two most accurate methods, the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method, do not appear to agree with one another. The most likely reason is that the measurement uncertainty for one (or both) of the methods has been estimated too low – it is (or they are) not as precise as is currently believed – but for the time being there is no indication which method is at fault. Question: Why does this difficulty occur?","completion":"The difficulty in determining the Planck constant (h) stems from a combination of both practical and theoretical challenges that come into play when trying to measure or calculate this fundamental quantity. To begin with, let's discuss the practical difficulties. The Planck constant, a fundamental constant in quantum mechanics, has the dimensions of energy multiplied by time. It is an essential element in equations such as the famous E=hf, where E is energy, f is frequency, and h is the Planck constant. Since it's at the core of quantum mechanical phenomena, precise measurement of h becomes crucial for all sorts of scientific research and technological applications. At present, the two most accurate methods for measuring h are the watt balance technique and the X-ray crystal density method. Even though both methods are considered highly accurate, they do not agree with one another. This disagreement indicates that there might be some inaccuracies or errors in one (or both) of the methods. The most plausible explanation for this discrepancy is that the measurement uncertainty for one or both of these methods has been underestimated, meaning that they are not as precise as is currently believed. However, it is not yet clear which of the two methods is at fault, adding to the overall difficulty of establishing a more refined value for the Planck constant. Now let's examine the theoretical difficulties involved in determining h. The very nature of quantum mechanics poses challenges for measurements at this scale. Quantum mechanics is fundamentally probabilistic, with uncertainties inherent in its very principles. One such principle, the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle, illustrates that there are unavoidable limits in simultaneous measurements of certain pairs of quantities (e.g., position and momentum or energy and time). Measuring these quantities with high precision becomes increasingly difficult at the quantum level due to this inherent uncertainty. Another challenge comes from the definition and realization of the units of measurement involved in determining h, like mass, time, and length. The International System of Units (SI) forms the basis for a majority of scientific measurements and has undergone revisions to improve its accuracy and reliability. In 2019, the definition of the kilogram – a key unit relevant to the Planck constant – was redefined in terms of fundamental constants, including h, leading to a more stable and accurate definition. However, this redefinition has also generated additional difficulties in accurate determination and interconversion of the units. In conclusion, the difficulty in determining the Planck constant arises from a combination of practical and theoretical factors. The disagreement between the two most accurate methods – the watt balance and the X-ray crystal density method – suggests that one or both might have underestimated measurement uncertainties. On the theoretical side, the very nature of quantum mechanics introduces uncertainties, while the definition and realization of the units of measurement involved in determining h present additional challenges. Overcoming these difficulties and establishing a more accurate value for the Planck constant will help improve the precision of other scientific and technological applications that rely on this fundamental constant."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Scottish draft budget is traditionally published in September, but new finance secretary Mr Mackay has proposed delaying his until December - leaving much less time for MSPs to study the details before voting on it in February. He said uncertainty caused by the UK's vote to leave the EU, coupled with Holyrood's new financial powers, meant he would need to see what moves new Chancellor Philip Hammond makes in his statement on 23 November. Mr Crawford, an SNP MSP and former cabinet minister, acknowledged the government faces \\"a significant challenge\\" in putting the budget together, but said his committee \\"remains concerned at the amount of time which will be available for parliamentary scrutiny\\". And in a letter to the finance secretary, he said it was \\"unacceptable\\" that Mr Mackay was not prepared to give the committee any scenario planning information in advance of the draft budget being published.

Kant argues that the human mind creates the structure of human experience, that reason is the source of morality, that aesthetics arises from a faculty of disinterested judgment, that space and time are forms of human sensibility, and that the world as it is \\"in-itself\\" is independent of humanity's concepts of it. Kant took himself to have effected a \\"Copernican revolution\\" in philosophy, akin to Copernicus' reversal of the age-old belief that the sun revolves around the earth. Immanuel Kant was born on April 22, 1724 in Konigsberg, Prussia (since 1946 the city of Kaliningrad, Kaliningrad Oblast, Russia). His mother, Anna Regina Reuter (1697-1737), was also born in Konigsberg to a father from Nuremberg. (Her name is sometimes erroneously given as Anna Regina Porter.) His father, Johann Georg Kant (1682-1746), was a German harness maker from Memel, at the time Prussia's most northeastern city (now Klaipeda, Lithuania). Immanuel Kant believed that his paternal grandfather Hans Kant was of Scottish origin. While scholars of Kant's life long accepted the claim, there is no evidence that Kant's paternal line was Scottish; it is more likely that the Kants got their name from the village of Kantwaggen (today part of Priekule) and were of Curonian origin. Kant was the fourth of nine children (four of them reached adulthood). Baptized 'Emanuel', he changed his name to 'Immanuel' after learning Hebrew. Young Kant was a solid, albeit unspectacular, student. Kant was born into a Prussian German family of Lutheran Protestant faith in East Prussia. He was brought up in a Pietist household that stressed religious devotion, humility, and a literal interpretation of the Bible. His education was strict, punitive and disciplinary, and focused on Latin and religious instruction over mathematics and science. Kant maintained a belief in Christianity, in his work Groundwork of the Metaphysic of Morals he reveals a belief in human immortality as the necessary condition of our continued approach to the highest good possible. However, as Kant was skeptical about some of the arguments used prior to him in defence of Theism and maintained that human understanding is limited and can never attain knowledge about God or the soul, various commentators have labelled him a philosophical agnostic. Common myths about Kant's personal mannerisms are listed, explained, and refuted in Goldthwait's introduction to his translation of Observations on the Feeling of the Beautiful and Sublime. It is often held that Kant lived a very strict and disciplined life, leading to an oft-repeated story that neighbors would set their clocks by his daily walks. He never married, but seemed to have a rewarding social life -- he was a popular teacher and a modestly successful author even before starting on his major philosophical works. He had a circle of friends whom he frequently met, among them Joseph Green, an English merchant in Konigsberg. A common myth is that Kant never traveled more than 16 kilometres (9.9 mi) from Konigsberg his whole life. In fact, between 1750 and 1754 he worked as a tutor (Hauslehrer) in Judtschen (now Veselovka, Russia, approximately 20 km) and in Gross-Arnsdorf (now Jarnoltowo near Morag (German: Mohrungen), Poland, approximately 145 km).

Asia covers an area of , about 30% of Earth's total land area and 8.7% of the Earth's total surface area. The continent, which has long been home to the majority of the human population, was the site of many of the first civilizations. Asia is notable for not only its overall large size and population, but also dense and large settlements as well as vast barely populated regions within the continent of 4.4 billion people. - Southeast Asia or Southeastern Asia is a subregion of Asia, consisting of the countries that are geographically south of China, east of India, west of New Guinea and north of Australia. The region lies near the intersection of geological plates, with heavy seismic and volcanic activity. Southeast Asia consists of two geographic regions: - The telson is the posterior-most division of the body of an arthropod. It is not considered a true segment because it does not arise in the embryo from teloblast areas as do real segments. It never carries any appendages, but a forked \\"tail\\" called the caudal furca may be present. The shape and composition of the telson differs between arthropod groups. - Africa is the world's second-largest and second-most-populous continent. At about 30.3 million km² (11.7 million square miles) including adjacent islands, it covers 6% of Earth's total surface area and 20.4 % of its total land area. With 1.1 billion people as of 2013, it accounts for about 15% of the world's human population. The continent is surrounded by the Mediterranean Sea to the north, both the Suez Canal and the Red Sea along the Sinai Peninsula to the northeast, the Indian Ocean to the southeast, and the Atlantic Ocean to the west. The continent includes Madagascar and various archipelagos. It contains 54 fully recognized sovereign states (countries), nine territories and two \\"de facto\\" independent states with limited or no recognition. - An arthropod (from Greek \\"arthro-\\", joint + \\"podos\\", foot) is an invertebrate animal having an exoskeleton (external skeleton), a segmented body, and jointed appendages (paired appendages). Arthropods form the phylum Arthropoda, which includes the insects, arachnids, myriapods, and crustaceans. Arthropods are characterized by their jointed limbs and cuticle made of chitin, often mineralised with calcium carbonate. The arthropod body plan consists of segments, each with a pair of appendages. The rigid cuticle inhibits growth, so arthropods replace it periodically by moulting. Their versatility has enabled them to become the most species-rich members of all ecological guilds in most environments. They have over a million described species, making up more than 80% of all described living animal species, some of which, unlike most animals, are very successful in dry environments. - A subregion is a part of a larger region or continent and is usually based on location. Cardinal directions, such as south or southern, are commonly used to define a subregion. - India, officially the Republic of India (\\"Bhrat Gaarjya\\"), is a country in South Asia.

It contains the following species: - Atyopsis is a genus of freshwater shrimp from Southeast Asia . It was erected in 1983 by Fenner A. Chace , Jr. for two species formerly treated in the genus Atya . It differs from Atya by various characters , including the form of the telson ( which is longest at the corners in Atyopsis , but not in Atya ) and the presence of a \`\` massive spur '' on the male third pereiopod . The genus comprises two species , Atya spinipes and Atyopsis moluccensis . No fossil representatives are known . They are found on high islands from Sri Lanka to the Samoan Islands , and as far north as Okinawa , as well as on the Asian mainland from the Malay Peninsula to India . The two species differ in the number of teeth on the underside of the rostrum , A. spinipes having 2 -- 6 , while A. moluccensis has 7 -- 16 . When kept in the aquarium this species prefers to have a moderate water flow . This shrimp feeds using its feather like claspers to filter particles from the water . If food is scarce you may find them foraging through the substrate . Like any other crustacean the bamboo shrimp will molt in order to grow . During this process the shrimp is very vulnerable to predation so ample hiding spaces should be provided e.g. small cave structures , dense foliage , etc. 'atyopsis' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'parent taxon'?

Given the following context: A USCG pilot and his winchman Haig answer an SOS call at sea and arrive at a derelict schooner, the Requite. Haig lowers himself to the ship, where he finds three dead bodies along with one survivor, Eva, cowering in the cabin. As the pilot attempts to retrieve Haig and Eva with a rescue basket, the line breaks, plunging the two into the ocean. After they swim back to the boat, the pilot informs Haig that he must return to base because his fuel is borderline. Eva and Haig spend the night on the boat, during which time she recounts the story of the storm that killed everyone else aboard. She explains to him that the strange events began soon after they found a priest drifting in the ocean, apparently a survivor of a disaster. Then, she tells Haig of the violent storm that caused all of the freakish deaths on the boat. One man was hurled through a hatch; one is hanging from the ship's mast; another vanished before her eyes; and a fourth man is in an aft compartment, floating in the air. Eva attributes the deaths to supernatural causes, but Haig has a practical explanation for everything, including the man who appears to be floating in the air. Early the next morning, the pilot returns along with the Coast Guard cutter Venturous. Haig and Eva are transferred from the Requite to the deck of the Venturous, where they board the helicopter for the flight back to Miami.

The answer is:","completion":"No. While the statement \\"Today the Internet continues to grow, driven by ever greater amounts of online information, commerce, entertainment, and social networking\\" is a reasonable description of the current state and continued expansion of the internet, it does not actually answer the question, \\"when was the internet started?\\" A more detailed and long answer to the question would be: The origins of the internet can be traced back to the 1960s, with the development of packet-switching networks. Packet switching is the fundamental technology that underpins the internet, allowing data to be separated into smaller packets, transmitted, and then reassembled at their destination. One of the first networks to utilize this technology was ARPANET, which was developed in the late 1960s by the United States Department of Defense's research agency, ARPA (Advanced Research Projects Agency). ARPANET's first successful message was sent on October 29, 1969, between two computers at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Stanford Research Institute (SRI). This milestone can be considered as the beginning of the internet, although the term \\"internet\\" itself was not coined until 1974 when Vinton Cerf and Bob Kahn developed the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP), a set of rules that dictate how data is transmitted and received across multiple networks. This protocol became the standard for data communication and laid the foundation for the internet as we know it today. The internet continued to evolve throughout the 1970s and 1980s, with the addition of various networks and technologies, the development of email, and the establishment of the Domain Name System (DNS) to simplify addressing on the network. However, it was the creation of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989 and its public release in 1991 that truly revolutionized the way people used the internet. The web provided a user-friendly interface for accessing and sharing information, paving the way for the rapid growth and widespread adoption of the internet in the 1990s and beyond. Today, the internet is an integral part of daily life for billions of people worldwide and has transformed the way we communicate, work, learn, and interact.

Here's how you can walk through the solution: Step 1: Combine like terms on right side of the equation. The equation is currently: -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736. We can combine 1936 and 736 on the right hand side (RHS): 1936 + 736 = 2672. This simplifies the equation to: -2536 = -124*c + 2672. Step 2: Move 2672 from RHS to left hand side (LHS) of the equation. You can do this by subtracting 2672 from both sides. -2536 - 2672 = -124*c + 2672 - 2672. Which further simplifies the equation to: -5212 = -124*c. Step 3: Solve for c. To get c alone on the RHS, we divide both sides by -124. (-5212)/(-124) = -124c/(-124) This simplifies to: 42 = c. So, the solution to the equation -2536 = -124*c + 1936 + 736 is c = 42."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Brown team arrived in time and started their warm up, but Green team arrived late and skipped their warm up so they experienced some people getting injured. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which team experienced an increased blood flow to the muscles? Hint: Sometimes muscles and tendons get injured when a person starts doing an activity before they have warmed up properly. A warm up is a slow increase in the intensity of a physical activity that prepares muscles for an activity. Warming up increases the blood flow to the muscles and increases the heart rate. Warmed-up muscles and tendons are less likely to get injured. For example, before running or playing soccer, a person might jog slowly to warm muscles and increase their heart rate. Even elite athletes need to warm up ( Figure below ). A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, the Brown team experienced an increased blood flow to the muscles. This is because they arrived in time and started their warm-up before the competition, which allowed their bodies to gradually prepare for the physical activity. Warming up is crucial for athletes as it helps increase the blood flow to muscles and tendons, raises the heart rate, and enhances muscle flexibility and overall performance. By going through a proper warm-up routine, the Brown team effectively reduced their chances of experiencing injuries during the competition. On the other hand, the Green team arrived late and skipped their warm-up, which led to some of their athletes getting injured. Without properly warming up, the blood flow to their muscles was not adequately increased, making them more prone to injuries when engaging in the competition. As a result, the Green team's performance could have been negatively impacted to some extent due to these injuries, highlighting the importance of a warm-up routine in athletic activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Leadership is the art of getting someone to do something you want done because he wants to do it. People naturally want to follow a good leader. After meeting with an effective leader it is not unusual to feel uplifted , inspired, and motivated to work towards a common goal. An effective leader makes others feel good about themselves, as well as the work they are doing. The leader has a vision of what he or she wants to achieve, and can communicate that vision to others in a way that makes people want to be part of it. One thing a good leader typically does is to communicate the big picture, so that each employee can see how the particular role he or she plays makes a contribution to the final result. Good leaders are positive and optimistic when they speak about the future. Their enthusiasm wins them plenty of supporters who help make their vision a reality. Good leaders also understand that different people are motivated by different things. For employees motivated by a need for achievement, a leader explains how the task offers an opportunity to take on a challenge with an achievable goal. And employees are motivated by hearing how they will be part of a team of people working together. Good leaders will introduce employees by name first, rather than job titles. They refer to employees as team members, companions, or colleagues, never as \\"servants\\". Words have power, including the power to make people feel whether or not they are important to the success of an organization. Good leaders believe that every team member matters and set up environments that make everyone feel important. It is no wonder they can attract the support they need to help them achieve their goals. Question: We can infer from the passage that _ . - a good leader is always good at creating comfortable working conditions - the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal - names are much easier to remember than job titles - the motivation of the employees all comes from the leader The answer is:","completion":"the support of employees is necessary for a leader to reach his goal"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Information: - The Republic of Iceland, \\"Lýðveldið Ísland\\" in Icelandic, is a Nordic island country in the North Atlantic Ocean. It has a population of and an area of , making it the most sparsely populated country in Europe. The capital and largest city is Reykjavík. Reykjavík and the surrounding areas in the southwest of the country are home to over two-thirds of the population. Iceland is volcanically and geologically active. The interior consists of a plateau characterised by sand and lava fields, mountains and glaciers, while many glacial rivers flow to the sea through the lowlands. Iceland is warmed by the Gulf Stream and has a temperate climate, despite a high latitude just outside the Arctic Circle. Its high latitude and marine influence still keeps summers chilly, with most of the archipelago having a tundra climate. - Jón Þór \\"Jónsi\\" Birgisson (born 23 April 1975) is the guitarist and vocalist for the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. He is known for his use of a cello bow on guitar and his falsetto or countertenor voice. He is blind in his right eye from birth as a result of a broken optic nerve from the brain. He is openly gay. Apart from Sigur Rós, Jónsi also performs together with his partner Alex Somers as an art collaboration called Jónsi & Alex. They released their self-titled first book in November 2006, which was an embossed hardcover limited to 1000 copies, along with their first album, \\"Riceboy Sleeps\\", in July 2009. On 1 December 2009, Jónsi's official website, jonsi.com, was launched in anticipation of his debut solo album, \\"Go\\", which was released the week of 5 April 2010. After the release of the album, Jónsi promptly started a worldwide tour across North America and Europe, featuring songs from the album plus a few other selections, planning to tour from March to September. - A lava field, also called a lava plain or lava bed, is a large expanse of nearly flat-lying lava flows. Such features are generally composed of highly fluid basalt lava, and can extend for tens or even hundreds of miles across the underlying terrain. The extent of large lava fields is most readily grasped from the air or in satellite photos, where their typically dark, nearly black color contrasts sharply with the rest of the landscape. According to the US Geological Survey, monogenetic volcanic fields are collections of cinder cones, and/or Maar vents and associated lava flows and pyroclastic deposits. Sometimes a stratovolcano is at the center of the field, as at the San Francisco Volcanic Field in Arizona. Monogenetic volcano fields have systematic growth patterns that suggest they represent single magmatic systems in the same way that stratovolcanoes do, but monogenetic volcanoes grow laterally rather than vertically (Wood and Shoan, 1984). Detailed mapping indicates that some cinder cones in monogenetic fields (e.g., Cima, California, and Timber Mountain Volcanic Field, Nevada) may have had multiple eruptions separated by tens to hundreds of thousands of years (Wells, et al., 1989). Thus, some monogenetic cones may actually be polygenetic. This possibility differs from observations of historic eruptions (Wood, 1979), and is physically difficult to understand because cinder cone conduits are narrow and must solidify within a few years of eruption. Nonetheless, such multiple eruptions appear to have happened at least twice: Other cinder cones need to be closely reexamined. - Riceboy Sleeps is the debut studio album by ambient duo Jónsi & Alex, released on 20 July 2009. The album is an artistic collaboration between Sigur Rós vocalist Jón Þór Birgisson and partner Alex Somers which features acoustic instrumental music alongside a string quartet, Amiina, and the Kópavogsdætur Choir. - Alex Somers (born 7 March 1984) is an American visual artist and musician from Baltimore, Maryland. He is currently living in Reykjavík, Iceland with his long-time boyfriend, Jón \\"Jónsi\\" Þór Birgisson, the vocalist and guitar player for the Icelandic post-rock band Sigur Rós. Somers runs a recording studio in downtown Reykjavík where he produces, engineers, and mixes since 2010. - An island country is a country whose primary territory consists of one or more islands or parts of islands. As of 2011, 46 (approximately 24%) of the 193 UN member states are island countries. - Sigurrós is an Icelandic female name, formed by conjoining \\"sigur\\" (victory) and \\"rós\\" (rose). Over 200 women currently carry it as their first given name and around 100 as their second or third given name. - Reykjavík is the capital and largest city of Iceland. It has a latitude of 64°08' N, making it the world's northernmost capital of a sovereign state, and is a popular tourist destination. It is located in southwestern Iceland, on the southern shore of Faxa Bay. With a population of around 130,000 (and over 200,000 in the Capital Region), it is the heart of Iceland's cultural, economic and governmental activity. - Sigur Rós is an Icelandic post-rock band from Reykjavík, who have been active since 1994. Known for their ethereal sound, frontman Jónsi's falsetto vocals, and the use of bowed guitar, the band's music is also noticeable for its incorporation of classical and minimalist aesthetic elements.

Tarantulas often stop moving or don't move at all to conserve energy before a molt. If your tarantula has not been moving much lately, then this could be a sign that she is about to molt. Is your tarantula eating? Before a big molt, tarantulas will stop eating for extended periods of time, ranging from a few weeks to a couple of months. If you have noticed that your tarantula has not been eating or that she has been eating less than usual, then this could indicate that she is going to molt soon. Some tarantulas secrete tiny drops of a clear fluid between the joints on their legs, and this can indicate that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Check to see if you can see these droplets, but keep in mind that not all tarantulas do this before a molt. Some tarantulas will lose hair on their abdomens leading up to a molt. You might notice less hair on your tarantula’s abdomen or even a bald spot on your tarantula’s abdomen. If you see this, then it is a good sign that your tarantula is getting ready to molt. Your tarantula’s abdomen may also appear darker and shinier than usual before she molts. What position is the spider in? During a molt, a tarantula lays up-side down on her back or on her side to get out of the old skin easier. This happens when a tarantula is actively molting and the whole process takes just a few hours. If your tarantula is on her back or side, then she might be trying to molt her skin. Spiders curl up their legs tightly underneath them when they die. If your tarantula is on her stomach and has curled her legs tightly inwards, then she may be dead or dying. Summary:","completion":"This article explains various signs that can indicate a tarantula is preparing to molt, including decreased movement and eating, secretion of a clear fluid from their joints, loss of hair on the abdomen, and a darker, shinier abdomen. It emphasizes the change in positioning, such as lying on their back or side, during the actual molting process and distinguishes this behavior from the curling up their legs underneath them when they die."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The show features the Duggar family: parents Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar and their 19 children—9 girls and 10 boys, all of whose names begin with the letter \\"J\\". During the life of the show, three children were born, three children were married, and four grandchildren were born. The show focuses on the life of the Duggar family, who are devout Baptists,[1] and frequently discusses values of purity, modesty, and faith in God. The Duggars avoid birth control saying they have decided to allow God to determine the number of children they have. All of the children are homeschooled, and access to entertainment such as movies and television is limited. They practice chaperoned courtship, in which a couple becomes acquainted only in a group setting.[2] The values presented on the show have been associated with the Quiverfull movement, which has been described as promoting strict family conformity, male hierarchies, and subservient roles for women.[3][4][5] The Duggars have stated they are not associated with the Quiverfull movement.[6] The series began on September 29, 2008 and concluded on May 19, 2015.[7] The show was TLC's most popular, averaging 2.3 million viewers per new episode in Season 10, and scoring in the Nielsen \\"Cable Top 25\\".[8][9] On May 22, 2015, TLC suspended the series when the Duggars' eldest son Josh publicly apologized for having \\"acted inexcusably\\" following reports that he molested five girls, including some of his sisters, by fondling them. These events occurred in 2002 and 2003, when he was 14 to 15 years of age, and prior to the beginning of the show. On July 16, 2015, TLC (The Learning Channel) announced that the show was officially canceled and would not resume production.[10] A spin-off show, Counting On, aired in December 2015 and the fourth season premiered June 12, 2017.[11] Background [ edit ] The Duggars live in Tontitown, Arkansas, near Springdale, and originally appeared in several TLC and Discovery Health one-hour specials, mostly focused on four of Michelle's last five deliveries.[12][13] Jim Bob Duggar has an older sister, Deanna, who occasionally appears on the show. Michelle Duggar (née Ruark) has six older siblings (Pamela Ethel, Kathie Ann, Evelyn Alice, Carolyn Jeannite, Freda Louise, and Garrett Floyd Jr.). The couple met in the early 1980s when Duggar and a fellow church member were sent for a follow-up visit after Michelle experienced a religious conversion.[14] The Duggars were married on July 21, 1984, just after Michelle's high school graduation. When they married, she was 17 and he was 19; neither attended college. Together they first launched a used-car business, then towing and real estate businesses, and both are licensed real estate agents.[15][16] The Duggars initially chose to wait before having children and used birth control pills in the early years of their marriage. Their eldest child, Joshua, was born in 1988. They resumed using oral contraceptives after his birth but conceived again despite this precaution, Michelle miscarried. She has mentioned that they named that child Caleb, despite not knowing the baby's gender.[17] After consulting a doctor, the Duggars learned that birth control can in some cases allow conception but cause miscarriage. As a result, they decided to stop using birth control and allow God to determine the number of children they would have.[18] Michelle soon became pregnant again, this time with her first set of twins, Jana and John-David. Michelle gave birth 17 times (twice with twins) over a period of 21 and a half years, approximately one birth every 15 months on average. The Duggars are devout independent Baptists. They only watch programs they consider to be wholesome family television and various historical events. Their Internet service is filtered. They adhere to certain standards of modesty in clothing in accordance with their religious beliefs. Shorts and tank tops are prohibited, and the women do not wear skirts that go above the knee. According to Michelle Duggar, such standards are mandated by scripture. They believe that baring the thigh is \\"nakedness and shame\\", and runs the risk of \\"defrauding\\" others—or stirring up and arousing \\"desires in someone else that cannot be righteously fulfilled.\\" They avoid beaches and public swimming areas \\"because it's just too hard for the guys to try to keep their eyes averted in those situations.\\"[19] Female family members keep their hair long, and males are clean-shaven and short-haired. They practice chaperoned courtship, where the couple gets to know each other in a group setting. The Duggars describe this as \\"dating with a purpose\\" and the Daily Mail describes it as a \\"G-rated alternative to dating.\\"[2] The Duggars in 2007 Jim Bob Duggar served as a Republican member of the Arkansas House of Representatives from 1999 to 2002. He was defeated for the Republican nomination for the U.S. Senate by incumbent Tim Hutchinson in 2002 by a vote of 71,576 to 20,546.[20] He later became a real estate agent and investor. The Duggars' income is derived from rental proceeds of commercial properties they own.[15][21] They live debt-free.[22][23] Construction of their 7,000 square-foot (650 square-meter) house began in 2000 when they bought the lot and ordered two steel frames. One of the frames was not drilled correctly, so the Duggars received a third frame which was used to make the girls' room and the industrial kitchen.[24] Discovery Networks completed it, finding local Arkansas construction workers to donate their skills and time. The home was completed on January 20, 2006. Some of the painting, decorating, furnishings, appliances, and other finishing touches—such as a stocked pantry—were provided by Discovery Networks and corporate sponsors as part of the one-hour television special[15] entitled 16 Children and Moving In. Events during the series [ edit ] Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar Michelle Duggar gave birth via emergency Caesarean section to Josie Brooklyn Duggar on December 10, 2009, six months into her pregnancy. When she was rushed to the hospital for gallstones, doctors discovered that she was pre-eclamptic and performed an emergency delivery. Josie Duggar was premature at only 1 pound 6 ounces (0.62 kg) at birth. Nearly four months later, on April 6, 2010, the Duggars were able to take the infant to their temporary rental home in Little Rock while they awaited medical approval to take her home to Tontitown.[25][26] The Duggars took Josie home to Tontitown for good on June 23, 2010. By that December she weighed 15 pounds 12 ounces (7.1 kg).[27] The couple had discussed the possibility of having more children, with Michelle Duggar saying: We would love more! I'm 43, almost 44 this September. I know that my mommy years are probably numbered, and I don't know how many more children God will see fit to give me. ... [I]t is something we've been praying about because we do love children. Each child really is a gift and that doesn't mean just our children. We asked the Lord to give us a love of children the way He loves children. That is something that we've prayed about, and we'll just see what the Lord has in store for our family in the future.[28] On December 2, 2008, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar's book The Duggars: 20 and Counting! was released.[29] Their second book, A Love That Multiplies, was released on June 7, 2011.[30] The eldest four girls—Jana, Jill, Jessa, and Jinger—authored Growing Up Duggar: It's All About Relationships, which was released March 4, 2014.[31] On November 8, 2011, Michelle Duggar and family appeared on NBC's Today Show to announce she was expecting their 20th child.[32] On December 8, 2011, the Duggars announced she had miscarried.[33] Six days later, they held a memorial service for the stillborn baby girl that they named Jubilee Shalom (which means celebration and peace).[34][35] A few months after the birth of their daughter Mackynzie, Josh and Anna Duggar learned that she was pregnant with their second child, but the pregnancy ended in a miscarriage.[36] On their daughter's first birthday, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting again. The couple welcomed their second child, Michael James, on June 15, 2011.[37] They learned that they were expecting again in September 2012. Josh Duggar was offered a job at the Family Research Council during his wife's pregnancy with their third child. Marcus Anthony was delivered by a midwife on June 2, 2013.[37] Duggar announced he was hired to be the executive director of the Family Research Council's political action committee, FRC Action, on June 18, 2013, and the family would move to Washington, D.C.[38] On December 2, 2014, Josh and Anna Duggar announced they were expecting their fourth child.[39] The couple welcomed their fourth child, Meredith Grace, on July 16, 2015. They announced her birth on July 19, 2015 through the Duggar family website.[40] The Duggars issued an announcement that Jessa Duggar was in a courtship with Ben Seewald on September 18, 2013. The couple met through their church.[41][42] On August 15, 2014, after eleven months of courtship, the couple announced their engagement[43][44] and were married on November 1, 2014.[45] Jill Duggar's courtship with Derick Dillard was announced on March 31, 2014. They were introduced by Jim Bob Duggar and became further acquainted via supervised Skype and text conversations while Dillard was serving as a missionary in Nepal. Jill Duggar and her father traveled to Nepal to meet Dillard in person and began a formal courtship in November 2013.[46] The couple announced their engagement on April 9, 2014,[47] and were married on June 21, 2014.[48][49] The Dillards announced their first pregnancy on August 20, 2014.[50] Their son, Israel David Dillard, was born on April 6, 2015.[51] The Seewalds announced their first pregnancy on April 21, 2015, waiting until the second trimester.[52] On July 16, 2015, TLC announced that the series was officially canceled.[10] Reception [ edit ] Arnold Hamilton of The Dallas Morning News described 19 Kids and Counting as \\"part Little House on the Prairie, part Yours, Mine & Ours–except the only blending in this real-life family occurs with restaurant like precision at mealtimes.\\" He described the Duggars as acting \\"against the trend\\", considering the 2002 US Census found that only 0.3 percent of women ages 15 to 44 have given birth to seven or more children and that this number has declined steadily since 1976.[15] In an op-ed for The New York Observer, Nina Burleigh described the Duggars as \\"Good TV. Good, sugarcoated rat poison, politically speaking\\", referring to the Duggars political activity such as their opposition to abortion and their lobbying efforts against legislation which would allow transgender people use of public restrooms matching their gender identity.[53] In an article published in the Journal of Religion and Popular Culture, Christy Mesaros-Winckles described the Duggars as \\"unofficial spokespeople for the Quiverfull movement\\". Referring to the first season of the show, Mesaros-Winckles said the Duggars introduced themselves and their religious beliefs with the \\"subtle and disturbing\\" message of conformity and \\"rigid male hierarchy\\" associated with the Quiverfull movement. Mesaros-Winckles asserts that the show provides a platform for the legitimization of this movement, while downplaying \\"patriarchal gender roles and strict family conformity.\\" Mesaros-Winckles also said the Duggars \\"try to convince the audience that their way of life is best for raising healthy, godly children\\" and that a large family is a \\"biblical mandate.\\" She concluded that despite the small size of the Quiverfull movement, with perhaps only several thousand followers, the show 19 Kids and Counting has brought the movement to the forefront of American culture.[5] Feminist Amanda Marcotte referred to the Duggars as part of the \\"Christian patriarchy movement\\", which she described as interchangeable with the Quiverfull movement, saying the Duggars promote sexist values which run counter to mainstream American culture.[3] The Duggars have said they are not part of the Quiverfull movement, stating: \\"we are simply Bible-believing Christians who desire to follow God's Word and apply it to our lives\\".[6] Criticism [ edit ] The Duggar family has received criticism due to their stance on LGBT issues. In August 2014, Michelle Duggar recorded a political robocall regarding legislation affecting transgender individuals, which The Huffington Post described as \\"transphobic\\" and The Washington Post described as \\"anti-anti-discrimination.\\" The robocall includes Michelle saying: \\"The Fayetteville City Council is voting on an ordinance this Tuesday night that would allow men – yes I said men – to use women's and girls restrooms, locker rooms, showers, sleeping areas and other areas that are designated for females only. I don't believe the citizens of Fayetteville would want males with past child predator convictions that claim they are female to have a legal right to enter private areas that are reserved for women and girls.\\" In response to this robocall, a petition was started on Change.org calling for TLC to cancel the show 19 Kids and Counting, which received over 100,000 signatures. In response to the first petition, a second petition was started asking TLC to keep the show on the air, and it also received over 100,000 signatures.[54][55][56][57] In November 2014, the Duggars asked married couples to take a picture while kissing and share it on their Facebook page. Several users noted that pictures of same-sex couples were deleted from the Duggar's Facebook page.[58] While working for the Family Research Council, the Duggar's eldest son, Josh Duggar, said \\"I truly believe every child deserves a mother and a father\\"; the Family Research Council has been labeled as an anti-gay hate group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, with SPLC saying they were designated as such due to their publication of \\"anti-gay propaganda.\\"[59][60][61] Josh Duggar has been described as an \\"anti-gay activist\\" by GLAAD.[62] Josh Duggar molestation controversy [ edit ] On May 21, 2015, a police report from 2006 was revealed to the public by In Touch Weekly magazine, stating sexual molestation allegations against the Duggars' eldest son, Josh Duggar. The report states that in 2002–2003, Josh – then 14 to 15 years old – fondled five girls, including four of his sisters, by touching their breasts and genital regions on multiple occasions while they were asleep and in a few cases while awake.[63][64][65] These events occurred prior to the beginning of the reality series. The case was never fully investigated, and the statute of limitations has expired.[63] On May 22, 2015, TLC removed all reruns of the show that were previously set to air from its current airing schedule, with the statement, \\"we are deeply saddened and troubled by this heartbreaking situation, and our thoughts and prayers are with the family and victims at this difficult time.\\"[66][67][68] In the wake of the controversy, more than 20 advertisers, including General Mills, Walgreens, Payless ShoeSource, Choice Hotels, Pizza Hut, Sweet Leaf Tea, and Crayola announced that they were pulling their ads from the show;[69][70][71] Hulu also removed the show's entire back catalog of episodes from the streaming service.[72] Public reaction to the revelation led to several petitions calling for TLC to cancel the series on Change.org, citing conflict between the reported events and the show's promotion of family values.[65][73][74] Josh, along with his wife and his parents, responded to the revelations. Josh apologized, stating he had \\"acted inexcusably\\", and resigned from his position at the Family Research Council. Anna stated she knew about Josh's actions two years before she married him, and believed that the counseling he received after the incidents \\"changed his life.\\" The Duggars described this time as a dark period in their lives and said it caused their family \\"to seek God like never before.\\" They were featured in an interview with Megyn Kelly on Fox News Channel's The Kelly File on June 3, 2015, where they answered questions regarding the scandal.[75][76][77][78] Cancellation [ edit ] On July 16, 2015, Discovery Communications, parent company of TLC, confirmed to CNN that the show was officially canceled and that all further production would be ceased. In the wake of the allegations, the network announced that it would produce a one-hour, commercial-free documentary special on child abuse, that will include Jill and Jessa.[10] TLC paid the Duggar family an estimate of US25,000 to US45,000 per episode. Due to the show cancellation, the loss of endorsements, speaking engagements, and book deals based on the show would result in a loss of an estimate of US25 million a year.[79][80] A 3-part spin-off series, Jill and Jessa: Counting On, focusing on newlyweds Jill and Derick Dillard, Jessa and Ben Seewald, Anna Duggar, and several of the other adult Duggar children (sans Josh) aired in December 2015.[81] Its first episode attracted more than 2.2 million viewers, according to a report by The Nielsen Company.[82] The third episode garnered the highest ratings and viewership, at 2.5 million viewers, and ranked in the Top 5 cable shows for the night.[83] In March 2016, it was announced Counting On had been picked up for a full season, that premiered March 15, 2016.[84] Duggar family [ edit ] Parents [ edit ] They were married on July 21, 1984, aged 17 and 19, and have 19 children and 12 grandchildren.

Foals are a rock band from Oxford, England formed in 2005, consisting of lead vocalist and lead guitarist Yannis Philippakis, drummer and percussionist Jack Bevan, rhythm guitarist Jimmy Smith, and keyboardist Edwin Congreave. They are currently signed to Warner Bros. Records, and have released four studio albums: Antidotes (2008), Total Life Forever (2010), Holy Fire (2013), What Went Down (2015), one video album, six extended plays and nineteen singles. The band have toured internationally and have featured at Glastonbury, Coachella and Roskilde festivals. Holy Fire was released in both the UK and the US on 11 February 2013. The album's lead single, \\"Inhaler\\", received its first radio play on 5 November 2012. They played the song \\"My Number\\" for the first time on Later... with Jools Holland. Holy Fire was produced by Flood and Alan Moulder, who have worked with many artists, including Nine Inch Nails, The Smashing Pumpkins and My Bloody Valentine. The album was recorded at Assault & Battery studios in London. Yannis Philippakis stated that the recording process had some unconventional moments: \\"At one point we even made these poor studio interns collect bones. We were inspired by voodoo, these Haitian rhythms. We collected some ourselves, from butchers in Willesden High Road. Mainly cows, I think often they had gristle and cartilage on them, mainly cow and occasionally sheep. We had to order these big pots because one of the shoulder blades was too big! We boiled the flesh away so we could use them as percussion! We wanted to get primitive!\\" According to The Guardian: \\"Their producers, Flood and Alan Moulder, even tricked them by recording their rehearsal in order to capture a more uninhibited sound.\\" In late November to mid-December, Foals toured the UK for an album preview. The tour was supported by Petite Noir (a close friend of Philippakis'). In summer 2013, they attended a number of festivals and headlined Latitude Festival in Suffolk in July. The band have recently played a World and UK tour, which ended with two sell out shows at Alexandra Palace in February. The two shows were in stark contrast compared to playing the same venue 7 years earlier to an almost empty room while supporting Bloc Party, a sentiment which lead singer Philippakis did not fail to mention during the live shows. Holy Fire was nominated for the Mercury Prize in 2013. Q awarded Foals with the Best Live Act award the same year while \\"Inhaler\\" received the Best Track award from NME. Not only this, but in a reader-nominated \\"Best Album of 2013\\" poll, Holy Fire topped the list; as did single \\"My Number\\" in a \\"Best Song of 2013\\" poll, beating NME favourites Arctic Monkeys, amongst other acclaimed bands.

The story goes something like this: There is the future 'victim' getting on with their quotidian activities and whoosh, they are whisked into a life of gambling, drugs, sex or junk food addiction. After years of struggle, they finally find redemption and become good people again. As in any good tale of redemption, there has to be a 'reason' for why our 'victim' fell off the rails. Take your pick: they were molested, their parents ran away from home, they were denied desserts except on Sundays. Just thinking about it brings a tear to my stony face. How can you not be moved by tales such as these. What is the precipitating cause of the misery in my life? Well, my mother was French and my father was English.

My hometown was a mixture of French and English-speaking people and the results of their miscenagation. You could never tell by someone's last name who spoke your language (For instance, my good friend P. Arsenault spoke the Queen's English and my cousin Sean Doyle wouldn't have recognized an Oxford Dictionary if you shoved up his nose). As children, we were segregated by language; all the French-speaking kids went to one side of the school where they spoke French all the time. I was fortunate enough to be sent to the English side of the school and got to speak my native tongue. My parents decided my brother and sister wouldn't be quite so lucky. In an effort to bridge the great language divide, they both spent six years learning everything in French and mingling with the French people (My parents did this because it was the firm belief of all forward-thinking families that whatever road you took would be much smoother if you could speak both of Canada's official languages.

They receive a call and drive to the scene of a murder. As they push their way through the crowd at the crime scene, they see Brad McCullam leaving with a coffee cup. Inside the house, the detectives find the body of Mrs. McCullam, Brad's mother, who has just been stabbed with an antique sword. At the scene are the neighbors and chief witnesses, Mrs. and Miss Roberts. The detectives soon realize that they had just seen the murderer leaving the scene. The Robertses tell the detectives that Brad was disturbed, and had changed when he went to Peru recently. In a flashback we see Brad in Peru preparing for a kayak trip on a raging river. Back to the present time, the police have learned that Brad has taken two hostages in the house across the street. The police surround the house, and Brad's fiancÃ©e Ingrid arrives. Ingrid talks to Havenhurst about Brad's trip to Peru, saying that Brad's friends all drowned on their kayak trip, which Brad had decided at the last minute not to take part in; he later claimed that the voice of God had told him to stay behind. Several more flashbacks follow of Brad and Ingrid in Brad's bedroom, talking with Mrs. McCullam, looking at nearby houses, having dinner. Back in the present, Brad demands pizza for himself and the hostages, along with a car for transportation to Mexico. In another flashback, we see Brad in rehearsals for a Greek tragedy directed by Lee Meyers. As the pizza is delivered to Brad, Lee arrives at the scene of the crime. Lee talks with Havenhurst about Brad, and we flash back to Lee and Brad visiting Uncle Ted's ostrich farm. Brad convinces Uncle Ted to give him the antique sword which would be used in the crime. Brad uses the sword in more rehearsals for the play, in which he plays the part of a man who kills his mother, who is played by his fiancÃ©e Ingrid.

Undeterred, he decides to give it his best shot, focusing on putting power behind the ball. He takes a moment to collect his thoughts, watching the other players as they ready themselves for the serve. As the fat boy tosses the ball into the air, he jumps and swings his arm with all his might. The ball soars across the net, surprising the opposing team with its velocity. Nonetheless, the opposing team's most experienced player, a tall girl with short, dark hair, manages to successfully dig the ball, sending it flying upwards into the air. The other teammates on the opposing team scramble into position, coordinating their movements effortlessly. One of the players, a tanned man with sunglasses, bumps the ball towards their designated setter. The setter, a petite woman with a focused expression, leaps into the air and sets the ball perfectly for the tanned man, who has already begun his approach to spike the ball. Meanwhile, the fat boy's team readies themselves for the incoming spike. The team consists of a diverse group of people of varying ages and skill levels, bonded by their shared love of the game. A fit, older man with a grey beard and a teenager with braces both jump to block the tanned man's spike, but unfortunately, their timing is off. The spike sails past their attempted block, and for a split second, it appears as if the point will go to the opposing team. But just in time, the fat boy, still panting from his serve, lunges to his right, defying all odds and managing to dig the ball with an outstretched arm. His team looks on in amazement and cheers him on as they quickly reposition themselves, sensing the opportunity for a counterattack. A young woman with a ponytail sprints to the ball, bumping it towards their own setter who is now fully prepared to make a decisive play. As the team's spiker approaches the net, he notices a slight gap in the opposing team's defense. At that moment, the setter feints an attack of her own and then softly tips the ball into the open space, catching the opposing team off-guard. The ball falls to the sand, and the fat boy's team erupts in celebration, praising his initial dig and the setter’s smart play. As the game continues, the fat boy gains more confidence and begins to enjoy the game more thoroughly. His teammates encourage him and offer advice, impressed by his determination, commitment, and improvement. The opposing team also notices his progress and admires his unyielding spirit and sportsmanship.

Run the towels under cool water, then wring them out so they're damp but not dripping.","completion":"Step 1: Apply an enzymatic cleaner After absorbing the mess, apply a generous amount of enzymatic cleaner specifically designed for pet urine removal on the affected area of the carpet. Enzymatic cleaners break down the uric acid crystals in pet urine, which helps to eliminate the odor and stain. Read and follow the instructions on the cleaner's label carefully. Step 2: Let the cleaner sit Allow the enzymatic cleaner to sit on the stain for the recommended amount of time as indicated on the product label. This will give the cleaner enough time to break down the urine components effectively. Step 3: Blot the area After letting the cleaner sit for the appropriate amount of time, use clean, dry towels or paper towels to gently blot the area. This will help to absorb any remaining moisture and lift the stain from the carpet fibers. Step 4: Rinse the area with water Once the enzymatic cleaner has done its job, rinse the area with clean, cool water. Use a clean cloth or sponge to apply the water, being careful not to over-saturate the carpet. Step 5: Blot and dry After rinsing, blot the area again with dry towels or paper towels to remove excess water. Make sure to remove as much moisture as possible, as this will help to prevent any mold or mildew from forming. Step 6: Allow the carpet to air-dry Let the treated area air-dry completely. If necessary, use a fan to help speed up the drying process. Step 7: Vacuum the area Once the carpet is completely dry, vacuum the area to restore the carpet's texture and appearance.

The TMJ works like a hinge, but also uses a sliding motion. The joint also has cartilage, including a small disc of cartilage that acts as a sort of shock absorber. This disc can become damaged by arthritis, injury, or infection, or the disc can be out of alignment, causing pain. TMJ pain can also be associated with a clicking sound when you chew or talk, or there may be a sensation of grinding. Some people with TMJ have other conditions, such as chronic fatigue syndrome, chronic headache, endometriosis, fibromyalgia, bladder inflammation, irritable bowel syndrome, low back pain, sleep disorders, and painful sexual intercourse in women. It is not clear that TMJ and these other disorders are necessarily connected. TMJ occurs in both men and women, but women tend to have more severe pain and limitation of movement than men. The primary symptom of TMJ is pain in the joint and in the muscles of the jaw. Other symptoms include: Pain in the neck and in the shoulders Chronic headaches Stiffness in the jaw muscles Limitations in jaw movement Locking of the jaw Pain or pressure in the ear Ringing in the ears Painful clicking, popping, or grating in the jaw joint when the mouth is opening or closing A bite that feels off or is misaligned If you have any of these symptoms, it is recommended that you see a medical doctor as well as a pain specialist for treatment.

Please answer the following question: I can use this background: The lungs of mammals are unique in having alveoli . These are tiny, sac-like structures. Each alveolus is surrounded by a network of very small blood vessels (see Figure below ). Because there are millions of alveoli in each lung, they greatly increase the surface area for gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream. Human lungs, for example, contain about 300 million alveoli. They give the lungs a total surface area for gas exchange of up to 90 square meters (968 square feet). That’s about as much surface area as one side of a volleyball court! Now, I have a new situation: Two six graders learned about the lives of animals. Lori learned more about fish, while Dan learned more about mammals. Answer this question please: Which student learned less about gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream? A:","completion":"A: Dan, the student who learned more about mammals, learned less about gas exchange between the lungs and bloodstream as compared to Lori, who learned about fish. This is because the given background information highlights the unique features of gas exchange in mammals' lungs, which would better relate to Lori's studies on fish as mammals' lung structure and their gas exchange mechanism may not apply to fish directly.

The interview was conducted in the cafe rather than the office, as the","completion":"employer wanted a relaxed and casual environment instead of a stiff and formal one. The cafe was warm and cozy, filled with the rich aroma of freshly ground coffee beans. Mr. Lawrence, the employer, was waiting at a corner table sipping on his latte. He wore a great smile when Jack, the interviewee, arrived. He stood up to greet Jack with a firm handshake, showing his welcoming character. Step 1: Establishing the setup Firstly, I have described the venue based on the introductory sentence. It helps to engage the reader with a detailed description of the cafe's ambiance. Given the circumstances, it is reasonable to assume that the employer was already present and waiting. The employer’s traits, as well as some character development, have been attempted. This makes the story more relatable and immersive for readers. Next, Jack arrived, and Mr. Lawrence greeted him. This sets up for the interview's initiation, starting the main part of the plot. The two men sat down, facing each other. It was Jack’s first ever interview, and he was nervous, his palms slightly sweaty. Seeing this, Mr. Lawrence, with a comforting smile, tried to ease his nerves by sharing a light-hearted anecdote from his early career. The strategy worked. Jack laughed, and his shoulders relaxed a bit, signaling a reduction in his anxiety. Step 2: Developing actions Continuing the narrative, I have added more specifics about the characters' actions. This includes their feelings and reactions, which will help further develop the character image for readers and also progress the plot. As they let the conversation flow naturally, they talked about their favorite books, shared interesting life events, and discussed the job and its aspects in between. Mr. Lawrence could see Jack's passion for the work. He noticed Jack’s active participation and thoughtful questioning, which resonated with Mr. Lawrence’s idea of an ideal candidate for the job. Step 3: Further expanding the plot I've expanded the conversation in order to progress the story's core aim, i.e., the interview process, while keeping it engaging and natural. This also gives the employer a chance to gauge the candidate. Furthermore, these details enable the readers to become more involved in the story. The interview lasted about an hour. By the end, the cafe was alive with the chatter of patrons, and the delicious scent of pastries filled the room. Mr. Lawrence put down his now empty coffee cup and thanked Jack for his time. The young man left the café with a sense of satisfaction and hope. No matter the outcome, he was sure that he had gained invaluable experience from the process. Step 4: Concluding the event Finally, I concluded the event by describing the immediate atmosphere and stating the end of the interview. Indicating Jack's feelings provides closure and also opens up possibilities for continuing the story later on. This gives the readers a complete understanding of the event while keeping them intrigued about the potential results of the interview. I kept the ending positive, focusing on Jack's personal growth and learning from the experience rather than the immediate success or failure of the interview. This aligns with realistic scenarios, making the closure more relatable for readers."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

She knew the importance of wearing the right clothes for exercise, as it made a difference in how her body responded to the physical exertion. Step 2: Starting slow and warming up Maria understood that the key to a healthy workout routine was proper warmup. Therefore, she would start her jog at a slow pace, gradually increasing her speed. This slow warmup was necessary to prevent injuries and prepare her body for more intense exercise. Maria also knew that this helped her body adapt better to sweating, which in turn would help her strike the perfect balance between a fresh and dirty appearance. Step 3: Staying hydrated To maintain her vitality and appearance while jogging, Maria prioritized staying adequately hydrated. Drinking water in small sips throughout her jog not only replenished her body's fluids lost due to sweating but also aided in achieving that refreshing glow on her skin. She considered carrying a water bottle to be an essential aspect of her jogging routine. Step 4: Cooling down and post-jog routine As Maria approached the end of her jog, she would gradually slow her pace to a brisk walk for the last few minutes, allowing her body to return to normal and keep her sweating under control. Once back home, she would immediately change out of her sweaty clothes and take a shower to rid her body of any accumulated dirt and sweat. Step 5: Moisturizing the skin and replenishing nutrients Maria believed that cleansing her body from sweat was not enough. After her shower, she would moisturize her skin to restore any lost moisture and maintain a healthy and fresh appearance. Maria would also replenish her energy and nutrients by having a balanced breakfast, ensuring that she was taking care of herself both internally and externally.

Write some highlights for the following article: Champion cyclist Lance Armstrong won't be allowed to compete in international Ironman triathlon contests while he's under investigation for doping, the World Triathlon Corporation announced Thursday. The ruling bars him from the Ironman France competition scheduled for June 24 in Nice, the agency said. The decision comes after the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency, or USADA, confirmed Wednesday that it is opening proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates. Armstrong said Wednesday the agency intends to \\"dredge up discredited\\" doping allegations against him in a bid to strip him of his seven Tour de France victories. The champion cyclist has always insisted he never took performance-enhancing drugs. Armstrong was accused of using such drugs by other riders, but never failed a drug test. Armstrong started doing triathlons after retiring from cycling, and won a half-Ironman in Hawaii less than two weeks ago. He was the fastest cyclist and runner on the 70.3-mile course, and the third-fastest swimmer. But with the new investigation open, the World Triathlon Corporation suspended him. WTC rules \\"dictate an athlete is ineligible to compete during an open investigation. Armstrong is therefore suspended from competing in WTC-owned and licensed races pending further review,\\" the organization said in a statement. USA Triathlon said he can still compete in its events. \\"Lance Armstrong is currently still eligible to compete in all USA Triathlon-sanctioned races, with the exception of Ironman events as stated earlier by the World Triathlon Corporation,\\" said the body's communications director Chuck Menke. Armstrong lashed out at his accusers and the doping agency on Wednesday. \\"Unlike many of my accusers, I have competed as an endurance athlete for 25 years with no spike in performance, passed more than 500 drug tests and never failed one,\\" Armstrong said on his website. \\"That USADA ignores this fundamental distinction and charges me instead of the admitted dopers says far more about USADA, its lack of fairness and this vendetta than it does about my guilt or innocence.\\" A 15-page agency letter was sent Tuesday to Armstrong and several others. The Washington Post was the first to report the story. Justice Department prosecutors in February said they closed a criminal investigation after reviewing allegations against Armstrong. They had called witnesses to a federal grand jury in Los Angeles, but they apparently determined they lacked evidence to bring a charge that Armstrong used performance-enhancing drugs. \\"These are the very same charges and the same witnesses that the Justice Department chose not to pursue after a two-year investigation,\\" Armstrong said Wednesday. In the letter, a copy of which was obtained by CNN, the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency said it collected blood samples from Armstrong in 2009 and 2010 that were \\"fully consistent with blood manipulation including EPO use and/or blood transfusions.\\" EPO, or erythropoietin, boosts the number of blood cells. Opinion: Why fans shouldn't forgive Armstrong. The letter said Armstrong and five former cycling team associates engaged in a doping conspiracy from 1998 to 2011. Riders will testify that Armstrong used EPO, blood transfusions, testosterone and masking agents, and that he distributed and administered drugs to other cyclists from 1998 to 2005, according to the letter. In a statement obtained by CNN, U.S. Anti-Doping Agency CEO Travis T. Tygart said the five other people, formerly associated with the U.S. Postal Service pro cycling team, are three team doctors and two team officials. The letter included written notice of alleged anti-doping rule violations, Tygart said. \\"USADA only initiates matters supported by the evidence,\\" Tygart said. \\"We do not choose whether or not we do our job based on outside pressures, intimidation or for any reason other than the evidence.\\" All named individuals are presumed innocent until proven otherwise, he added. According to its website, the quasi-government agency is recognized as the official anti-doping agency for Olympic, Pan American and Paralympic events in the United States. Armstrong said the organization has \\"self-written rules\\" and punishes first and adjudicates the facts later. Armstrong has been dogged by allegations of drug abuse in recent years, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was found guilty of doping in the 2006 Tour de France, resulting in him being stripped of the title -- making a series of claims last year. Armstrong came out fighting once again in May 2011 in the face of fresh allegations made on the CBS News \\"60 Minutes\\" show by another American, Tyler Hamilton. In the CBS interview, Hamilton -- who retired in 2009 after twice testing positive himself -- says he first saw Armstrong use blood boosting EPO in 1999, the year of his first Tour de France victory. \\"I saw it in his refrigerator,\\" Hamilton told the American news program. \\"I saw him inject it more than one time like we all did, like I did many, many times.\\" On his Twitter page, Armstrong at the time said he never failed a drug test. Ex-teammate: I saw Lance Armstrong inject banned substances. CNN's Steve Almasy, Gary Morley, Terry Frieden and Jason Durand contributed to this report.","completion":"- World Triathlon Corporation (WTC) suspends Lance Armstrong from competing in international Ironman triathlons due to ongoing doping investigation. - Armstrong is barred from the Ironman France competition on June 24 in Nice. - U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) opens proceedings against Armstrong and five former teammates, accusing them of doping between 1998 and 2011. - Armstrong denies the allegations and states he never failed a drug test in over 25 years of competing as an endurance athlete. - Despite the suspension from WTC events, USA Triathlon confirms Armstrong is still eligible to compete in its sanctioned races."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The process described here is the weathering of rocks due to temperature fluctuations and water. Let me justify the steps: 1. Water seeps into rocks: Water finds its way into small cracks and pores in the rock formations. 2. The water freezes and thaws: As the weather fluctuates, the water within the cracks expands when it freezes (turns into ice) and contracts when it thaws (melts back into water). This puts pressure on the surrounding rock material. 3. Cracks form in the rocks: Due to the repeated freeze-thaw cycles, cracks in the rocks become more pronounced. 4. Cracks also form when rocks heat up: When rocks are heated, they expand. This expansion can also create or widen existing cracks.

However, these professionals cannot help out everyone just by themselves. They need our help! Consider Volunteering! What Exactly is Volunteering? Volunteering is when we regularly go and do nice things for other people. Volunteers may help out in local retirement homes, or in hospitals. Some volunteers work with poor people and other volunteers help teach orphaned children to read. There are many types of volunteers who help those who need help the most. Volunteering Teaches Mature Thinking Volunteering is something that really helps us as individuals. It gives us a chance to stop complaining about our own lives, and realized exactly how lucky we are. We are able to see the people who really need help. Volunteering also teaches us more about responsibility, patience, empathy , and above all, compassion . Doing Our part! Volunteering gives us a chance to do our share of the work of making this society the best it possibly can be. It helps us feel good about ourselves when we can help those who really need our help. When we can make someone else feel special, it helps us remember what life is really about. Ways to Start Volunteering There are many places that you can go to try to start volunteering. Here are just a few places you can go and what you can do at each place. 1) Hospital-ask if you can go and visit people who are really sick. Sometimes all they need is just someone who will talk with, or someone to give them hope. 2) Orphanage-the children living here really need someone to play with them. 3) Food Shelter --many food shelters can really use more people willing to just organize the shelters and help distribute the food to those who need it.

How to bridle a grumpy horse Halter and tie your horse. Your horse should be haltered and tied before attempting to put the bridle on. Keep them tied fairly short on the lead.","completion":"Step 1: Approach the horse calmly and confidently As horses can sense the emotions of humans, it is important to approach the grumpy horse with a calm and confident demeanor. This will help reduce the chance that the horse will resist or become agitated during the bridling process. Approaching the horse from the side rather than from the front or back can help avoid spooking the animal. Step 2: Comfort the horse with a gentle touch Before you try to bridle the horse, use a gentle touch to comfort and calm them down. Slowly stroke the horse's neck and shoulders while speaking softly and reassuringly. This will help relax them and make them more amenable to being bridled. Step 3: Check the bridle for proper fit and condition Before placing the bridle on the grumpy horse, ensure that it is clean, in good condition, and properly adjusted for the particular horse. This will help prevent discomfort or injury once it is put on. Step 4: Prepare the bridle Hold the bridle in your right hand, while using your left hand to grasp the cheekpiece. This will make it easier to slip the bit into the horse's mouth. Taking care to prevent the bit from hitting the horse's teeth can help avoid unnecessary discomfort and reduce the risk of resistance. Step 5: Gently pull the horse's head down Using your left hand, gently apply pressure to the top of the horse's head, encouraging them to lower their head to a more manageable height for bridle placement. Step 6: Present the bit to the horse With the horse's head lowered, present the bit to their mouth. Gently nudge their lips apart with your right hand, allowing the bit to be inserted. Encourage the horse to accept the bit by offering a gentle voice command or even a small treat. Step 7: Secure the bridle Once the bit is properly in the horse's mouth, carefully slip the crown of the bridle over the horse's ears one at a time. Adjust any straps or buckles as necessary to ensure a secure and comfortable fit. Step 8: Reassure the horse After the bridle is secured, give the horse a gentle pat on the neck and some more soothing words to acknowledge their cooperation. This will help reinforce positive behavior and make future bridling experiences easier. Step 9: Release the halter Once the bridle is properly in place and the horse is calm, gently remove the halter and lead. This will allow you to proceed with whatever activity you have planned with your horse. Step 10: Monitor for any signs of discomfort Throughout your time with the horse, keep an eye out for any signs of discomfort or irritation. If anything seems amiss, double-check the bridle's fit and make any necessary adjustments. This will help ensure that both you and the horse have a successful and enjoyable experience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the names of the performers who were prevented from preforming songs they had submitted? SVT selects performers for the entries. Artists who perform the demo of a song automatically enter the competition; they must perform their songs if suitable alternate performers cannot be found. The artists' songs risk disqualification if they refuse. In the past, this rule led to the disqualification of, among others, Carola's \\"När löven faller\\" in 2003 and Stephen Simmonds's \\"So Good\\" in 2006. SVT may also give songs to other performers without considering the interests of the demo artist. This prevented the Brandsta City Släckers (in 2004) and Pernilla Wahlgren (in 2005) from performing the songs they had submitted. Replacements for disqualified songs fare unpredictably at the competition. In 2006, \\"Naughty Boy\\" by Hannah Graaf (the replacement for Simmonds' song) finished second to last in its semi-final. In 2002 and 2007, by contrast, the replacements performed by Jan Johansen and Måns Zelmerlöw reached the final ten. The contestants that will perform the twenty-eight qualifiers from the preselection are announced in late November. Singer-songwriters are common. As such, artists often confirm that they will participate before the official announcement. The wildcard (joker) system was introduced in 2004 to diversify the music featured. Four artists, one in each semi-final, were invited by SVT to enter a song of their choice into the competition, provided it does not breach the rules. The wildcard songs and artists were announced in January. Since the wildcards' introduction, three have won the competition. In 2011 there were 15 wildcards. The wildcard system was discontinued in 2013.

Answer based on context: After a disappointing loss to the Miami Dolphins, the Patriots looked to bounce back against the lowly Vikings who were without Adrian Peterson who was suspended, but were led by ex-Patriot Matt Cassel at quarterback. The Vikings took the ball and marched right down the field 80 yards in just 7 plays, with Cassel finding Matt Asiata on a 25-yard touchdown pass for a 7-0 lead just over four minutes into game. This would the highlight of the game for the Vikings. After a Patriots three-and-out, safety Devin McCourty intercepted Cassel at the Patriots 39 and returned it 60 yards down to the 1 yard line. Two plays later, Stevan Ridley scored on a 1-yard run to tie the game. After a Vikings punt, the Patriots reached the Vikings 30-yard line where Gostkowski gave the Patriots a 10-7 lead on a 48-yard field goal from Gostkowski. On the fifth play of the Vikings' next drive, Cassel threw his second interception, this one to Darrelle Revis at the Patriots 39. The Patriots put together a 7 play, 61-yard drive, with Brady finding Edelman for a 9-yard touchdown pass, increasing the Patriots lead to 17-7. Late in the second quarter the Vikings drove to the Patriots 30, but Chandler Jones blocked Blair Walsh's field goal attempt and returned it 58 yards for a touchdown, widening the Patriots lead to 24-7 at halftime. The Patriots reached the Vikings 43 early in the third quarter, but were forced to punt, but the Vikings gave it right back when Cassel threw his third interception, this one to Ryan at the Vikings 45. The Patriots could only reach the Vikings 28, where Gostkowski was connected on a 46-yard field goal and the Patriots led 27-7. Following another Vikings punt the Patriots stormed to the Vikings 9, but their struggling offense couldn't get in the endzone, and Gostkowski's 39-yard field goal gave the Patriots a 30-7 lead. With less than seven minutes remaining in the game, rookie Dominique Easley intercepted Cassel at the Vikings 35. Neither team did anything for the rest of the game and the Patriots won the game. Brady was efficient completing 14 of 21 passes for 149 yards, one touchdown, and no interceptions, but continued to not be the superstar that he was known to be. Stevan Ridley led the Patriots in rushing, carrying the ball 25 times for 101 yards and a touchdown. Filling in for the suspended Adrian Peterson, Matt Asiata carried the ball 13 times for only 36 yards. Matt Cassel went 19 of 36 for 202 yards with 1 touchdown, but was intercepted 4 times by the Patriots.

An \\"R\\"-rated warning of the dangers of childhood bullying, Australian actor Joel Edgerton's tense directorial debut shows promise for both the modern psychological thriller genre and for himself as a legitimate filmmaker. 2. \\"The Gift\\" is a movie full of surprises - and one of them is that it is surprisingly good. 3. The conclusion will probably stun you, and it's firmly good and scary. But possibly not worth waiting through everything before it. 4. Clever and atmospheric, the film has enough twists to keep the average viewer guessing. 5. Those expecting a jump-filled home invasion movie may come away disappointed, but everyone else should find much to enjoy in this tense, uncomfortable work of high melodrama. 6. Officially, this is a blank-from-hell movie. But Edgerton has remixed the formula. 7. Joel Edgerton is a legitimate triple threat. 8. The Gift doesn't succumb to genre banalities until its final scenes. That's more than enough reason to see it. 9. Joel Edgerton's debut feature as director, The Gift, is the best kind of great movie: It doesn't announce itself as great at all. 10. This is a psychological thriller that reflects a genuine grasp of human psychology. That's uncommon. It's what made Hitchcock Hitchcock. It's what makes The Gift one of the extremely rare films that deserve to be described as \\"Hitchcockian.\\" What was the overall consensus about the movie?","completion":"The overall consensus about the movie \\"The Gift\\" is largely positive. The reviews highlight that it is a well-crafted psychological thriller with a gripping plot, effective atmosphere, and unexpected twists. Joel Edgerton, who is making his directorial debut, receives significant praise for his work both as a director and actor, with some reviews even describing the film as \\"Hitchcockian.\\" Many reviewers were impressed by the film's ability to steer away from genre clichés and offer a fresh take on the \\"blank-from-hell\\" movie format. The film is regarded as a promising start for Edgerton's career as a filmmaker, and it offers a thought-provoking examination of the consequences of childhood bullying. Despite some negativity on the pacing and the dissatisfaction of those expecting a more traditional horror film, most viewers found the movie to be an enjoyable and suspenseful experience. The film's conclusion, in particular, receives high praises for being \\"scary\\" and \\"stunning.\\" In summary, \\"The Gift\\" is considered a surprisingly well-executed and engaging psychological thriller, introducing Joel Edgerton as a competent filmmaker with potential for future growth in the industry.

Answer the question...what is the canada us air quality agreement??","completion":"The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement is a bilateral environmental accord between Canada and the United States. It was originally signed on March 13, 1991, with the primary objective of reducing and addressing transboundary air pollution in both countries, specifically acid rain and its subsequent environmental impacts. The agreement is focused on minimizing the emission of air pollutants that contribute to various environmental issues, including smog, poor air quality, and even climate change. The need for the agreement emerged during the latter half of the 20th century when acid rain became a significant concern for both nations. Acid rain occurs when sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) emissions from power plants, industries, and vehicles mix with atmospheric water vapor and fall back to the earth in the form of acids. This phenomenon severely damages ecosystems, water sources, soil quality, and even human health. The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement addresses this problem and aims to protect the environment and the health of citizens in both countries. It comprises two annexes which detail the procedures and commitments to reduce emissions: 1. The first annex, known as Annex 1: Acid Rain Annex, was signed in 1991 alongside the primary agreement. It primarily targets the reduction in SO2 and NOx emissions responsible for creating acid rain. Both countries committed to substantial reductions in emissions from their power generation sector, with milestones and a time-frame for achieving these goals. The annex also sets up a framework for prompt exchange of information and data on emissions, ambient air quality, and deposition rates. 2. The second annex, known as Annex 2: Ozone Annex, was added in 2000 as a response to the increasing concern of ground-level ozone or smog in both Canada and the United States. The annex is focused on reducing the emissions of NOx, volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and other precursors of ground-level ozone. It promotes the development and implementation of science-based emission reduction initiatives, particularly in areas where emissions negatively impact air quality in the other country. The Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement also results in periodic progress reports, which serve to document the actions taken and the progress achieved in meeting the emission reduction commitments outlined in the annexes. This bilateral cooperation also facilitates joint scientific and technical research, education, and public awareness initiatives. Over the years, the agreement has been a successful collaborative effort between the two countries, as both have made significant progress in reducing SO2 and NOx emissions and improving overall air quality. Furthermore, this partnership allows them to address emerging transboundary air pollution issues, promote technological advancements, and share best practices for mitigating environmental problems related to air pollutants. In summary, the Canada-U.S. Air Quality Agreement is a crucial environmental partnership between Canada and the United States. It recognizes the cooperative responsibility to address transboundary air pollution, reduce emissions, and protect natural resources, ecosystems, and the health of citizens in both countries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

When women bring home the bacon (The Frisky) -- Bread, bacon, clams - whatever you call it, women are the ones bringing it home these days. When your boyfriend or husband is unemployed and you're earning the dough, the relationship could suffer. According to The New York Times over the past year, as companies from Citibank to GM announced massive layoffs, a full 82 percent of the people getting pink slips have been men. Any day now, women are expected to become the majority of the American workforce. On the one hand, more women being primary money-makers is amazing-a real opportunity for us to get over the way-outdated idea that supporting a family is a man's job. But on the other hand, relationships can suffer when one source of income is lost and power dynamics shift. We talked to six women whose husbands/fiancé/boyfriends have lost their jobs. Here's how it's affecting their relationships: 1. Down to necessities. But now, he's needy. \\"My live-in boyfriend of 17 years lost his mechanical engineering job three months ago.

Then he posted his resume in Boston, where he's from. He got 10 calls quickly. We decided it was best for him to move back to Boston. The recession has split us up.\\" --Jennie, 27, counselor in Los Angeles 3. He's become a house-spouse. \\"My husband Paul is now responsible for keeping the house clean, washing the dishes, doing the laundry, taking our son to practices, helping with homework, plus walking the dog.\\" --Elizabeth Naculich, 40, event services manager in Fort Smith, Arkansas \\"I'm angry at my fiancé. I'm working around the clock, picking up hours so we can afford our apartment. I'll ask in the morning if he can do the laundry or figure out dinner. When I get home, it's obvious he's done nothing all day but play video games. I sympathize with him being out of work, but that's no excuse to not pick up the slack.\\" --Suzanne, 31, consultant in Chicago 5. Starting a family is even harder. \\"I'm nine months pregnant, I am so uncomfortable, and I just want to be at home. But, I'm at work.

To be involved in their job search, or not to be? That is the question. \\"My husband has been out of work for months, and I don't get the impression he's doing enough to change the situation. I keep asking, 'What jobs did you apply for today? Did you talk to so-and-so about things at his company?' I feel like a total nag. I'm trying to figure out the line.

This circumstance throws a new light on the gender roles within a relationship and can create a shift in traditional power dynamics. The article explores the experiences and reflections of six different women whose significant others have lost their jobs in the face of economic challenges. The women report various changes to their relationships and ways of living as a result of this situation. For example, some couples have had to forego luxuries and limit their spending to absolute necessities. Psychological changes in their partners are also observed, such as men becoming more needy due to the loss of their employment. In addition, the geographical presence of job opportunities has prompted couples to make tough decisions, with one woman's boyfriend choosing to move back to his hometown to find work, thereby splitting the couple up. The roles in the relationship change, with some men taking up domestic responsibilities. In some cases, this results in dissatisfaction where the woman feels her partner isn't pulling his weight despite the lack of employment, while in other cases it seems to work reasonably well. The crisis further complicates the issue of starting a family, where the woman must continue employment during pregnancy and cut maternity leave short to maintain income and health benefits, as her partner is unable to contribute financially. Finally, the article explores the question of involvement in the partner's job search, examining the tension between wanting to be supportive, not crossing personal boundaries, and avoiding the perception of nagging or emasculating their partners. All these changes and adaptations reflect the impact of economic hardships on intimate relationships and the evolving role of women as primary breadwinners."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The game consists of four quarters in which the two teams attempt to score goals by throwing the ball into their opponent's goal. The team with the most goals at the end of the game wins the match. A team consists of 6 field players and one goalkeeper in the water at any one time. Except for the goalkeeper, players participate in both offensive and defensive roles.

Question: What is the full name of the drummer that finished the arena tour after health issues cause the touring drummer to drop out? Answer the above question based on the context below: Following the release of With Teeth in 2005, the live band was reassembled for the Live: With Teeth tour. Since the previous tour five years earlier, much of the band had moved on in their careers, and only drummer Jerome Dillon rejoined. To find replacements, Reznor held auditions during December 2004. He stated that keyboardist Alessandro Cortini \\"fit in immediately\\", though he had trouble finding a guitarist to replace Robin Finck until auditioning Aaron North. The tour began with a series of small-club performances early in 2005. The band told journalists they were \\"pleasantly surprised by the interest\\" of fans despite their lengthy absence. This initial leg of the tour also included a headlining performance at Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival. The band followed with a North American arena tour in autumn 2005, supported by Queens of the Stone Age, Death From Above 1979, Autolux, and Saul Williams. Williams performed on stage with Nine Inch Nails at the Voodoo Music Experience festival during a headlining appearance in hurricane-stricken New Orleans, Reznor's former home. To conclude the With Teeth era of the band, Nine Inch Nails completed a tour of North American amphitheaters in the summer of 2006, joined by Bauhaus, TV on the Radio, and Peaches. The 2007 release Beside You in Time features performances from the North American arena tour, the North American amphitheater tour, and a number of studio rehearsals.Nine Inch Nails were scheduled to perform at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards, but dropped themselves from the show due to a disagreement with the network over the use of an unaltered image of George W. Bush as a backdrop to the band's performance of \\"The Hand that Feeds\\". Soon afterwards, Reznor wrote on the official Nine Inch Nails website: \\"apparently, the image of our president is as offensive to MTV as it is to me\\". MTV replied by saying they respected Reznor's point of view, but were \\"uncomfortable\\" with the performance being \\"built around partisan political statements\\". A performance...

A title slide is then shown, and then shows several ingredients used in a recipe for cookies. The video then shows the two boys mixing ingredients together. they","completion":"proceed to carefully measure each ingredient, ensuring they have the correct amount as per the recipe. The boys are following a classic chocolate chip cookie recipe, starting with the dry ingredients like flour, baking soda, and salt. They sift these together in a large mixing bowl, creating a uniform mixture that is free of clumps. Next, they move on to the wet ingredients. They begin by creaming together softened unsalted butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar in a separate mixing bowl. Once well combined and fluffy, they crack in one large, room-temperature egg and blend it into the butter-sugar mixture until further incorporated. They then add a generous splash of pure vanilla extract, which imparts a rich depth of flavor to the cookies. Once the wet ingredients are combined, the boys gradually add the dry ingredients into the wet, taking care not to overmix the cookie dough. Overmixing can lead to tough or dry cookies, so they carefully fold in the dry ingredients just until combined and no streaks of flour remain. With the dough almost ready, they turn their attention to the star of the show: the chocolate chips. In this case, they have chosen semi-sweet chocolate chips, which provide just the right balance of sweetness and bitterness to complement the dough. However, they also discuss other options like milk chocolate or white chocolate chips, and even mention the possibility of adding nuts or dried fruits, depending on personal preferences. After folding in the chocolate chips, ensuring an even distribution, they use a cookie scooper or a spoon to portion out dough balls onto a baking tray lined with parchment paper. Taking care to leave enough space between each dough ball for expansion during baking, they then preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C) while they allow the dough to rest for a few minutes. Once the oven has reached the desired temperature, they slide the prepared tray of cookie dough into the oven to bake for approximately 10-12 minutes. Throughout the baking process, they keep a close eye on the cookies to make sure they don't overcook, turning the tray halfway through for even baking. After the cookies have turned a golden brown around the edges and are slightly soft in the center, the boys remove the tray from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two. They then carefully transfer the freshly baked cookies to a wire rack so they can cool completely. In the meantime, they proceed to clean up their workspace, washing mixing bowls, measuring spoons and other kitchen tools that were used during the recipe preparation. As they clean, they chat about their love for baking and other recipes they'd like to try in the future. Finally, with the cookies completely cooled, they taste their culinary creation. With wide grins on their faces and crumbs falling onto the table, they rejoice in the delicious outcome of their efforts, savoring the delicate balance of flavors and textures they achieved through following the cookie recipe. The video concludes with a recap of the recipe's steps, as well as a call for viewers to comment on their cookie-baking experiences and engaging with the subscribers by encouraging them to suggest other recipes they'd like to see in future videos. With this engaging and informative approach, the boys manage to share a beloved cookie recipe while also fostering a sense of community and excitement among their viewers who share a passion for home-baked goodies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. (CNN) -- As Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited the U.N. General Assembly in New York last month, the spotlight was once again on Iran. And true to form, the Iranian president made his fair share of provocative statements for the Western media. But while Ahmadinejad's mercurial rants captured our media's attention, back in Iran a coordinated strategy against the women's movement continued. On the eve of Ahmadinejad's arrival to New York, Shiva Nazar Ahari, a prominent young female defender of human rights, received a heavy sentence of six years in prison on charges including the vague crime of \\"waging war against God\\" -- a convenient catch-all offense for anyone who criticizes the regime and its human rights record. There's no denying it -- Iran's women have had a bad year. Nazar Ahari joins a steadily increasing number of other women's rights activists who are in prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of the women. Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat and Mahdiyeh Golrou have all been sent to Tehran's notorious Evin Prison on trumped-up charges related to their activism. And while Nobel Peace Prize laureate Shirin Ebadi, arguably the most internationally recognized Iranian women's rights activist, remains unable to safely return to her country, the government is targeting those affiliated with her for arrest and imprisonment, including her lawyer Nasrin Sotoudeh and her former aide Jinous Sobhani. Since the 2009 disputed elections and associated government crackdown on the overall reform movement, the government has increasingly targeted women activists. The reasons behind this go well beyond the misogynist nature of Iran's religious leadership. Rather, it is more part of a deliberate and calculated strategy of the Iranian authorities to strike at the heart of the regime's greatest vulnerability -- internal legitimacy with its own people. See more CNN.com opinion articles Iran's government recognizes and fears the broader power of the women activists who have been on the front line of reform in Iran for more than a decade. One can roughly draw an analogy between the women's movement in Iran to movements of religious groups in Burma or Tibet, or the labor \\"solidarity\\" movements in the former Eastern bloc and associated labor-Roman Catholic solidarity in Poland -- all advocating initially for the freedoms of a specific group but which provoked government fears for their transformative power to promote broader human rights progress. While the outside world occasionally reacts to the most egregious manifestations of Iran's repression of women -- such as the international condemnation associated with Sakineh Mohammadi Ashtiani, an Iranian widow sentenced to stoning on charges of alleged adultery -- these events are often portrayed simply as a consequence of the regime's archaic viewpoint about gender. Question: \\"What are the names of five women who went to prison for no greater crime than their attempt to fight for the rights of women?\\" Response: \\"Nazar Ahari, Hengameh Shahidi, Alieh Eghdam Doust, Bahareh Hedayat , Mahdiyeh Golrou\\" Based on the paragraph, is the response to the question is factually correct?","completion":"Yes, the response to the question is factually correct.

How would someone go about accomplishing this goal? How can you extend the battery life on your cell phone?","completion":"Extending the battery life on your cell phone is an essential aspect of overall device performance, allowing it to last longer throughout the day and be available when you need it most. To maximize your smartphone's battery life, follow these comprehensive steps: 1. Update the software: Ensure that your device's operating system and apps are up to date. Developers often include battery life optimizations in software updates, which can improve performance and energy efficiency. 2. Optimize screen settings: The display is usually the most significant battery-drainer on smartphones. Consider lowering the brightness, enabling adaptive brightness (if available), and reducing the screen timeout interval. Additionally, avoid using live wallpapers, as they consume more power than static ones. 3. Manage background tasks: Some apps run in the background and consume power even when you are not using them actively. Identify these apps in your device settings, and either limit their background activity or uninstall them altogether if they are not crucial to your daily usage. 4. Enable power-saving mode: Many smartphones have a built-in power-saving or battery-saving mode that adjusts device settings to save energy automatically. Turn this on when you need a bit of extra juice to last the day. 5. Turn off connectivity features when not in use: Disable Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, GPS, and mobile data when you do not need them. Turning off location services or switching to battery-saving location mode can also save battery life. 6. Limit notifications: Frequent notifications not only consume power due to repeated phone vibrations or screen wake-ups but are also a constant distraction. Manage your app notifications in settings, turning off non-essential notifications, and customizing the notification frequency. 7. Disable automatic app updates: Updating apps over Wi-Fi or mobile data can quickly drain your battery. Go to your app store's settings, and turn off automatic updates. Schedule manual updates when your device is connected to a power source. 8. Use airplane mode in areas with weak signals: Searching for a signal consumes more power than maintaining a good connection. If you are in an area with a poor network, consider enabling airplane mode to save battery life. 9. Adjust app usage: Some apps, such as video streaming services or games, consume more power than others. Limit the usage of those apps when you need to save battery, or decrease the in-app settings like video quality for streaming apps. 10. Monitor app/device temperature: Devices that are continuously overworked or exposed to high temperatures can experience reduced battery life. Try to keep your device cool and give it a break if you notice it getting uncomfortably warm. 11. Disable syncing: Many apps sync data in real-time, which can be useful but also consumes power. Turning off auto-sync for specific apps can help save battery life. You can still manually sync when necessary. 12. Use battery-efficient apps: Opt for apps and services that offer battery-efficient options or consume less energy compared to their alternatives. 13. Charge your phone correctly: A good charging routine can help maintain your battery's health. Avoid using your phone while it's charging and unplug it when fully charged. Also, charging your phone overnight isn't recommended, as it may lead to overcharging in the long run. 14. Replace an old battery: If you have been using your device for an extended period, it might be time to replace the battery. Over time, batteries degrade and cannot hold a charge as efficiently as they once did. By applying these strategies, you can effectively extend the battery life of your cell phone, reduce power consumption, and keep your device running throughout the day. Remember that it's essential to adapt these tips according to your specific device and usage patterns for the best results."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Information: - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance.

Choose from options. \\"of one misses the surf tide in the morning, will they get another chance?\\" Options are: -they have zero chance -they are still in luck -it is too late -all of these","completion":"They are still in luck. The tide cycle occurs twice per day due to the gravitational forces exerted by the moon and, to a lesser extent, the sun. Tides are created by the differential gravitational pull of the moon and the sun on Earth's surface. The gravitational forces cause the ocean to bulge on the side that faces the moon and the opposite side, which results in two high tides and two low tides each day. This phenomenon is known as a semidiurnal tidal cycle. When one misses the surf tide in the morning, they still have a chance to catch it later in the day as the tide will occur again, approximately 12 hours and 25 minutes later. This is because the moon takes 24 hours and 50 minutes to complete one orbit around the Earth, and thus, it takes that much time for the same tidal phase (e.g., high tide or low tide) to recur at a specific location. Therefore, if someone misses the surf tide in the morning, they will have another opportunity to surf during the subsequent tide cycle later in the day, meaning they are still in luck. Additionally, factors such as the shape of the coastline, local bathymetry, and the location of the sun can affect the exact timing, height, and duration of the tides. Surf conditions can also be influenced by weather and swell, which are separate from tidal forces. However, as the tide cycles are regular and predictable, missing the morning surf tide will not eliminate the chance of catching a surfable tide later in the day. In conclusion, if one misses the surf tide in the morning, they are still in luck, as the regular and predictable nature of the twice-daily tide cycle will provide another opportunity to surf during the later tide cycle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Process: - A stream or river must occur - Through erosion, the stream cuts into the soil and bedrock - Through continuous erosion, a deep gash is cut through - After many years the river may dry up - A dry ravine is left - Perturbation hypothesis: suppose Less rain that year happens, how will it affect MORE or LARGER ravines forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The formation of ravines is a continuous process that primarily depends on the interactions between water flow (mostly from streams or rivers) and the erosion of soil and bedrock. The perturbation hypothesis you propose involves a situation with less rain in a particular year. This change in precipitation can indeed have an effect on the formation of more or larger ravines, both directly and indirectly. Direct effects: 1. Reduced water flow: Less rain in a specific year means that the streams or rivers responsible for erosion might experience a reduced flow of water. A lower volume of flowing water could potentially slow down the rate of erosion, affecting the formation of new ravines or the enlargement of existing ones. 2. Lowered erosion rates: Since the rate of erosion directly depends on the force exerted by water, reduced precipitation results in a lower erosive capacity. Consequently, the rate at which ravines form or expand will most likely decrease. Indirect effects: 1. Vegetation growth: Less rain can lead to lower soil moisture and might affect the survival or distribution of vegetation in the area. Vegetation can play a role in stabilizing soil, preventing erosion. In situations with reduced rainfall, it is conceivable that some vegetation might struggle to grow, which could potentially increase soil erosion and counterintuitively promote ravine formation in certain areas. 2. Changes to the watershed: Reduced rainfall might also impact the overall structure of the watershed in which streams or rivers flow. This could lead to changes in water flow patterns and subsequently alter the spatial distribution of erosion, possibly affecting the creation or development of ravines. In summary, a reduction in annual rainfall can have both direct and indirect effects on the formation of more or larger ravines. Directly, through diminished water flow and erosion rates, it might slow ravine formation or enlargement. Indirectly, it may influence factors like vegetation growth and watershed structures, which can also affect erosion and, subsequently, ravine development. Overall, the impact of less rainfall on ravine formation depends on the balance between these various direct and indirect effects and may vary depending on the specific landscape and ecosystem involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

At birth, the skull and clavicles are not fully ossified nor are the sutures of the skull closed. This allows the skull and shoulders to deform during passage through the birth canal. The last bones to ossify via intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt. Q: What process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence involves closing of the skull? Choices: - incubation - elongation - calcification - ossification A: Answer:","completion":"ossification Intramembranous ossification is the process that begins in utero during fetal development and continues on into adolescence, which involves the closing of the skull. This process is the formation of bone tissue from connective tissue, specifically occurring in flat bones such as the bones of the skull, clavicles, and face. At birth, the skull and clavicles are not entirely ossified, and the sutures of the skull are not closed, allowing the skull and shoulders to deform during passage through the birth canal. The ossification process ultimately leads to the development and growth of the skull, closing the sutures as the child matures. The final bones to ossify through intramembranous ossification are the flat bones of the face, which reach their adult size at the end of the adolescent growth spurt. This essential process facilitates cranial growth and development, providing essential protection for the brain and supporting various functions such as sight and hearing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Situated on the Boite river, in an alpine valley, it is a popular winter sport resort known for its skiing trails, scenery, accommodation, shops and après-ski scene, and for its jet set and aristocratic European crowd. - Alpine skiing, or downhill skiing, is the sport or recreation of sliding down snow-covered hills on skis with fixed-heel bindings. It is characterized by the requirement for mechanical assistance getting to the top of the hill, since the equipment does not allow efficient walking or hiking, unlike cross-country skis which use free-heel bindings. It is typically practiced at ski resorts which provide services such as ski lifts, artificial snow making and grooming, first aid, and restaurants. Back-country skiers use alpine skiing equipment to ski off the marked pistes, in some cases with the assistance of snowmobiles, helicopters or snowcats. Alpine skiing has been an event at the Winter Olympic Games since 1936 (except for the 1940 games). - The Winter Olympic Games is a major international sporting event that occurs once every four years. Unlike the Summer Olympics, the Winter Olympics feature sports practised on snow and ice. The first Winter Olympics, the 1924 Winter Olympics, was held in Chamonix, France. The original five sports (broken into nine disciplines) were bobsleigh, curling, ice hockey, Nordic skiing (consisting of the disciplines military patrol, cross-country skiing, Nordic combined, and ski jumping), and skating (consisting of the disciplines figure skating and speed skating). The Games were held every four years from 1924 until 1936, after which they were interrupted by World War II. The Olympics resumed in 1948 and was again held every four years. Until 1992, the Winter and Summer Olympic Games were held in the same years, but in accordance with a 1986 decision by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) to place the Summer and Winter Games on separate four-year cycles in alternating even-numbered years, the next Winter Olympics after 1992 was in 1994. - The 1952 Winter Olympics (Norwegian: \\"Vinter-OL 1952\\"), officially known as the VI Olympic Winter Games (French: Les \\"VIes Jeux olympiques d'hiver\\"), took place in Oslo, Norway, from 14 to 25 February. Discussions about Oslo hosting the Winter Olympic Games began as early as 1935; the city wanted to host the 1948 Games, but World War II made that impossible. Instead, Oslo won the right to host the 1952 Games in a contest that included Cortina d'Ampezzo in Italy and Lake Placid in the United States. All of the venues were in Oslo's metropolitan area except for the alpine skiing events, which were held at Norefjell, from the capital.

Article:","completion":"Title: The Art of Happiness: Cultivating Positivity in Daily Life Introduction The pursuit of happiness is a universal desire shared by individuals all around the world. Although the term 'happiness' may differ from culture to culture and person to person, it is ultimately about living an optimistic and fulfilled life. While external factors may seem like the driving force behind one's happiness, it is important to recognize the power of individual thoughts and habits in cultivating a positive outlook. In this article, we will delve into various practices, including creating happy memories, focusing on the bright side, practicing gratitude, and maintaining optimism in challenging situations, that can significantly improve one's overall happiness and well-being. 1. Create Happy Memories Memories are the building blocks of our lives, influencing our current emotions and shaping our future attitudes. Making an effort to create happy memories, as well as recalling and cherishing them, can be a powerful way to enrich one's happiness. Here are a few tips to help you create and recall happy memories: * Engage in activities that bring joy: Seek out and participate in hobbies, outings, and social engagements that make you feel good. * Document the good times: Capture special moments through photos, journaling, or even creating a memory jar to store positive notes from each day. * Reminisce with loved ones: Share happy memories with family and friends, as the act of storytelling can reinforce the positive emotions associated with the experiences. 2. Look on the Bright Side A key element of happiness is the ability to maintain a positive outlook on life. This involves striving to see the silver lining in difficult situations and focusing on the aspects of life that bring joy. Here are some strategies for maintaining a positive frame of mind: * Reframe negative thoughts: Whenever you catch yourself dwelling on the negative, make a conscious effort to shift your focus to the potential positive outcomes or learning experiences that may arise from the situation. * Surround yourself with positivity: Spend time with people who uplift you and engage in activities that bring about a sense of happiness and fulfillment. * Be proactive in problem-solving: Instead of simply dwelling on challenges, take a proactive approach to seeking solutions and developing coping strategies. This can boost your confidence and help to prevent feelings of helplessness. 3. Practice Gratitude Being grateful for what we have is a well-documented aspect of happiness. Practicing gratitude consistently can help to shift one's focus away from what is lacking and towards the abundance that exists in life. Some techniques for practicing gratitude include: * Maintaining a gratitude journal: Make a habit of writing down the things for which you are grateful each day, no matter how small. * Expressing gratitude to others: Take the time to thank the people in your life who bring you happiness or provide support during difficult times. * Engaging in mindfulness: Develop a habit of practicing mindfulness meditation to cultivate an attitude of gratitude and deepen your appreciation for life's simple pleasures. 4. Continue Optimism When Life is Hard One of the greatest tests of happiness is how we cope during times of hardship. Remaining optimistic may seem challenging, but it can be a powerful tool for resilience and overcoming adversity. Here are some tactics for maintaining optimism in tough times: * Remember past triumphs: Reflecting on previous challenges you have successfully overcome can provide the motivation and confidence needed to face current difficulties. * Focus on the bigger picture: When faced with a setback, remind yourself of your long-term goals and the progress you have made towards achieving them. This can help maintain perspective and minimize the impact of temporary setbacks. * Seek support: Reach out to friends, family, or professionals for guidance and encouragement during difficult times. Don't be afraid to ask for help and lean on your support network. Conclusion Ultimately, the key to cultivating happiness lies in the way we approach life and the mental habits we establish. By actively creating happy memories, maintaining a positive outlook, practicing gratitude, and being resilient during difficult times, we can significantly enhance our overall happiness and well-being. Take small steps each day to incorporate these practices into your daily routine, and you may find that the elusive concept of happiness becomes more attainable than ever before."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The answer \\"visit their friend's new home\\" is not relevant to Remy's plans for hosting a dinner party. Here is a detailed answer to the question: Before hosting a dinner party to show off their new house, Remy needs to take several steps to ensure the event goes smoothly and their guests have a great time. These steps include: 1. Planning the guest list: Remy should decide how many people they would like to invite and whether they want a small, intimate gathering or a larger party. 2. Sending out invitations: Remy needs to send out invitations, either through email, phone calls, or mailing physical invitations, giving guests enough time to RSVP and plan accordingly. 3. Planning the menu: Remy should decide on a menu that includes appetizers, main courses, and desserts that cater to their guests' dietary preferences and restrictions. 4. Shopping for groceries and supplies: Remy needs to purchase all the necessary ingredients, beverages, and supplies for the dinner party, ensuring there is enough food and drink for all attendees. 5. Deep cleaning the house: Remy should clean their new home thoroughly, paying special attention to the common areas like the living room, dining room, and kitchen, as well as the restrooms. 6. Setting up the dining table and seating: Remy needs to arrange the dining table with appropriate table settings, including tablecloths, napkins, silverware, glasses, and any necessary condiment stations. They should also ensure there is enough seating for all guests. 7. Preparing the food: Remy needs to cook the planned dishes, either the day of or the day before the dinner party, ensuring that the food is fresh and properly prepared. 8. Setting the mood: Remy can enhance the ambiance by choosing appropriate background music, lighting candles, and adjusting the lighting to create a warm and welcoming atmosphere. 9. Preparing a house tour: Since the purpose of this gathering is to show off their new house, Remy needs to plan a guided tour for their guests, highlighting the features and design elements they are most proud of. 10. Having a backup plan: Remy should be prepared for unexpected situations, such as guests arriving late or last-minute cancellations. Having a flexible mindset and being ready to adapt to changes will help ensure a successful dinner party. In conclusion, visiting their friend's new home does not play a role in Remy's preparations for hosting a dinner party to show off their own new house. Instead, focusing on planning, organizing, and executing a well-thought-out event will ensure Remy's dinner party is a success."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Eldrick Tont Woods (born December 30, 1975) better known as Tiger Woods, is an American professional golfer who is among the most successful golfers of all time. He has been one of the highest-paid athletes in the world for several years. Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur career, Woods was 20 years old when he turned professional at the end of summer in 1996. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters. Early in Woods' career, a small number of golf experts expressed concern about his impact on the competitiveness of the game and the public appeal of professional golf. Sportswriter Bill Lyon of Knight Ridder asked in a column, \\"Isn't Tiger Woods actually bad for golf?\\" (though Lyon ultimately concluded that he was not). At first, some pundits feared that Woods would drive the spirit of competition out of the game of golf by making existing courses obsolete and relegating opponents to simply competing for second place each week. A related effect was measured by University of California economist Jennifer Brown, who found that other golfers scored higher when competing against Woods than when he was not in the tournament. The scores of highly skilled (exempt) golfers are nearly one stroke higher when playing against Woods. This effect was larger when he was on winning streaks and disappeared during his well-publicized slump in 2003-04. Brown explains the results by noting that competitors of similar skill can hope to win by increasing their level of effort, but that, when facing a \\"superstar\\" competitor, extra exertion does not significantly raise one's level of winning while increasing risk of injury or exhaustion, leading to reduced effort. Many courses in the PGA Tour rotation (including major championship sites like Augusta National) have added yardage to their tees in an effort to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Woods, a strategy that became known as \\"Tiger-Proofing\\". Woods said he welcomed the change, in that adding yardage to courses did not affect his ability to win. What does tiger-proofing refer to?","completion":"Tiger-proofing refers to the strategy adopted by many golf courses in the PGA Tour rotation, including major championship sites like Augusta National, to reduce the advantage of long hitters like Tiger Woods. This strategy involves adding yardage to their tees, making it more challenging for players with exceptionally long drives. The term \\"Tiger-Proofing\\" was coined due to Woods' dominant impact on the sport and how his sheer power and skill compelled golf course designers to modify their courses in an attempt to level the playing field for other competitors. Despite the changes, Woods mentioned that he welcomed the modifications as they did not affect his ability to win."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What are the full names of the people who died at the palace? is inside the article: Following a fire at the Ajuda Palace in 1794, the Prince Regent John VI and his wife Carlotta Joaquina began to use Queluz themselves. The Robillon wing was enlarged and given an upper floor for the use of the princess and her nine children. These additions were destroyed in the fire of 1934. To escape the forces of Napoleon I in 1807, the Portuguese royal family abandoned Queluz and fled to Brazil. The French occupational forces took control of the palace, and their commander, General Junot, made several alterations to the building. On the royal family's return from exile in 1821, the King preferred to live at Mafra, leaving his wife, the Spanish Queen Carlotta Joaquina, to occupy Queluz with her aunt Princess Maria Francisca Benedita. The King visited Queluz infrequently. It was on one of these rare visits that João VI died in the circular domed King's Bedroom in 1826.Carlotta Joaquina, sometimes described as sinister, is said to have been ambitious and violent. Her features were reportedly ugly, and she was short in stature. Whatever her shortcomings she lived in great style at Queluz, employing an orchestra which William Beckford described as the finest in Europe. The Queen also had a small private theatre in the gardens, of which nothing remains today. She died at the palace in 1830.Following the death of Carlotta Joaquina, Queluz saw only intermittent use as a royal residence and was not again the primary residence of Portuguese royalty. Carlotta Joaquina's son King Miguel used the palace during the three-year civil war which he fought against his brother King Pedro IV, before being forced by his brother in 1834 to abdicate and go into exile. A year later, Pedro IV died of tuberculosis at the age of 35 at Queluz, the palace of his birth. Pedro I's daughter Maria II ruled until her death in 1853 and was succeeded by her son Pedro V. Following his untimely death in the cholera epidemic of 1861, the throne passed to his brother Luís. From this time the royal family lived chiefly at the rebuilt Ajuda Palace..., can you guess it ?

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I used to be a big proponent of keeping the US Postal Service in business, but over the past year, my mind has changed completely. Most recently, I sent a package to some friends in England. Over a month had gone by and they still hadn't received the shipment. One day, a box showed up at our door. It was the box that we had sent out about 5 weeks prior, except it had no contents. The box looked as though it had been ripped open and the books that I had sent to their children were missing. The Post Office on Russell Road could not help me at all. They told me they didn't know what happened, and despite the message on the package saying it had made it to Los Angeles, they told me it never actually left Las Vegas (according to their report they printed over the computer). The manager asked me to fill out a form (I would not be reimbursed for the box they made me buy to ship the books because they told me I could reuse it - despite the box being torn open). They also told me I would not be reimbursed for the contents which was valued at 22. I filled out the form the manager asked me to fill out and when I asked her what my case number was (one of the questions on the form) she told me she didn't know and that I'd have to do it online.

It couldn't be. And yet it was. The roar of the wheels told him that it was. The very feel of the luxurious seat in which he was sitting told him that it was.

Next question: when is spain's running of the bulls?","completion":"The Running of the Bulls, also known as \\"Encierro\\" in Spanish, is a significant event held annually in Pamplona, Spain, as part of the San Fermin Festival. The festival takes place from July 6th to July 14th each year, with the Running of the Bulls itself occurring on eight consecutive days, starting from July 7th until July 14th. The San Fermin Festival (Fiesta de San Fermín), celebrated in honor of Saint Fermin, the co-patron of Navarre, dates back to the 13th century. The festivities kick off at noon on July 6th, with the launching of a firecracker known as \\"Chupinazo,\\" which marks the commencement of the non-stop party atmosphere. The Running of the Bulls, the most iconic event of the festival, takes place in the medieval streets of Pamplona. It starts at 8 am sharp on each of the eight days. The route is approximately 930 yards (850 meters) long, with the bulls running from the Santo Domingo corrals, crossing through the narrow streets of the old town, and finally entering the bullring, where a bullfight takes place later in the day. Participants, commonly wearing traditional white clothing with red bandanas around the waist and neck, run alongside the bulls, attempting to avoid being gored or trampled. This adrenaline-pumping tradition has evolved over time from the necessity to move the bulls from the countryside to the bullring for bullfighting events. Today, it serves not only as an exciting spectacle for tourists but also as a spiritual experience for some participants, who have been running with the bulls for generations. Aside from the Running of the Bulls, the San Fermin Festival also offers a variety of cultural, gastronomic, and musical events, giving locals and visitors a unique experience where traditions and entertainment come together. However, it is crucial to note that safety has always been a significant concern for the Running of the Bulls, and numerous injuries and fatalities have occurred over the years.

The reviewer's dissatisfaction is clear, and their actions - discarding the product in the trash - further demonstrate their discontent. It is not unusual for potential buyers to rely on the experiences and opinions of others who have used the products they are interested in. In this case, the disappointment expressed by the reviewer would likely deter other potential buyers from purchasing the same product, especially if those potential buyers share the same values and expectations as the reviewer.

Gennady Golovkin was born on April 8, 1982, in the city of Karaganda in the Kazakh SSR, Soviet Union (now Karagandy, Kazakhstan) to a Russian coal miner and Korean mother, who worked as an assistant in a chemical laboratory. He has three brothers, two elder named Sergey and Vadim and a twin, Max. Sergey and Vadim had encouraged Golovkin to start boxing when Golovkin was eight years old. As a youth, Golovkin would walk the streets with them, who went around picking fights for him with grown men. After ending his amateur career in 2005, Golovkin signed a professional deal with the Universum Box-Promotion (UBP) and made his professional debut in May 2006. By the end of 2008, Golovkin's record stood at 14-0 (11 KO) and while he had few wins over boxers regarded as legitimate contenders, he was regarded as one of the best prospects in the world. Golovkin was given 4 more relatively easy bouts in 2009. In 2010, Universum started to run into financial issues after having been dropped by German television channel ZDF. This caused a number of issues for Golovkin who was effectively unable to fight in Germany, and contract disputes between the two parties got complicated. Golovkin terminated his contract with Universum in January 2010 and stated the following in an interview: \\"The reason for this decision is that I've always been placed behind Felix Sturm and Sebastian Zbik by Universum. Our demands to fight against Felix Sturm or Sebastian Zbik have been always rejected on absurd grounds. Universum had no real plan or concept for me, they did not even try to bring my career forward. They would rather try to prevent me from winning a title as long as Sturm and Zbik are champions. Further more, bouts against well-known and interesting opponents were held out in prospect, but nothing happened. This situation was not acceptable. It was time to move forward.\\" After cutting ties with Universum, the WBA issued an interim title fight between Golovkin, ranked #1 at the time, and Milton Nunez. Golovkin routed Nunez, defeating him in 58 seconds to become a world champion. Golovkin was promptly upgraded to WBA (Regular) champion. He tried to fight WBA (Super) champion Felix Sturm and Hassan N'Dam N'Jikam during this time, but was unable to get them in the ring. Oleg Hermann, Golovkin's manager, said \\"It is very hard to find a good opponent. Everybody knows that Felix Sturm is afraid of Gennady. Strictly speaking, Sturm should get out of boxing and become a marathon runner because he is running fast and long. He has an excellent chance to become a champion in athletics.\\" Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Anything else about his early career that you want to share?","completion":"Gennady Golovkin, also known as \\"GGG\\", started boxing when he was eight years old, encouraged by his older brothers Sergey and Vadim.

A man who was shot dead in an apparent road rage incident in Pennsylvania last Saturday made multiple calls to 911 as he was pursued by a crazed driver in a dark-colored pickup, police have revealed this weekend. Timothy Davison, 28, was driving from Florida home to Maine along Interstate 81 when the shooting occurred in Antrim Township. He told 911 in several calls in Maryland and Pennsylvania that he was being chased by an enraged driver who was very aggressive. Police have concluded that a 28-year-old Timothy 'Asti' Davison (pictured) was killed in a seemingly random act of road rage last Sunday in Pennsylvania. Driven off the road: Timothy Davison was run off the road by an enraged motorist and shot dead. Road rage: Timothy Davison called from Interstate 81 near Maryland early Saturday to say someone in a pickup truck was firing on him just moments before he was forced off the road (pictured) and shot dead. Police believe the shooter pursued Davison for up to 15 miles before he was run off the road onto a median strip and shot several times. Officials say the shooter was driving a dark Ford Ranger XLT pickup and are asking local mechanics to look out for a car fitting that description with damage to its driver's side as well as silver paint from Davison's car. Saluted: Fellow officers gathered from multiple states to attend the June 2013 funeral for Bardstown, Kentucky officer Jason Ellis, whose murder remains unsolved. As Davison called 911 in Northern Maryland to report the rage-filled motorist, he was being shot at by the trailing vehicle. The call was dropped and he called again, this time having crossed over the border into Pennsylvania. According to police, Davison was forced into a median, disabling his vehicle, before the assailant approached and fired several rounds at him. 'I think we can call it a road rage incident,' Pennsylvania state trooper Rob Hicks told The Portland Press Herald. Police are not releasing the recordings of the calls, but Hicks said that Davison indicated that a driving issue - like one person cutting another off or braking suddenly - may have sparked the problem. The only clues that the investigators, who have been joined by FBI teams, are basing their investigation on are grainy surveillance footage and bullet remnants. Search is on: The killer's car will have damage on the driver's side and silver paint from Timothy Davison's car. Crime scene: Davison's attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland, as Davison was driving home to Maine after visiting family in Florida. State police are searching for a Ford Ranger-style pickup. They say the vehicle may be blue and may have damage to the driver's side. They say Davison, who was from Poland, Maine, died at a York hospital following the 2.10am attack. Police say the attack occurred on northbound I-81 in Antrim Township, about 10 miles north of Hagerstown, Maryland. 'I just hope this doesnâ€™t happen to. anyone else. This wasnâ€™t just road rage. This person is obviously. crazy,' the victim's mother Theresa Alloca told The Kennebec Journal. According to police reports, Davison called 911 in Maryland shortly before 2am to report that he was being pursued by another motorist, but his call was dropped when he crossed into Pennsylvania.

Premise: A band performing on a stage Hypothesis: People are on stage. .Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?","completion":"If we consider the given premise - \\"A band performing on a stage,\\" it implies that there is a group of people or musicians who are playing music or singing live on stage as a cohesive unit. A band typically consists of various members who specialize in different instruments or provide vocals. Now, examining the hypothesis - \\"People are on stage.\\" The term \\"people\\" refers to a group of individuals who are present or active in a particular location or situation. In this context, the hypothesis seems to be talking about individuals being on stage. Analyzing the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis, we can observe that the premise indeed involves a group of musicians, which are people, performing on a stage. The premise gives us enough information to infer that people are present on the stage since a band is made up of individuals. Therefore, we can conclude that if the premise is true, i.e., \\"A band performing on a stage,\\" then the hypothesis, \\"People are on stage,\\" is also true. The presence of a band on the stage essentially implies that there are people on the stage who are performing as part of that band.

While we like to dine in their Bar, we opted for the dining room as we had guests. A waiter (Frank?) immediately checked in and my wife asked him to overview V's offerings. First mistake. He waxed poetically about anything he could on the wine list and sizable menu and never once did any discovery with us about what we might be interested in. This should be Rule #1 in Sales!!! For instance, he detailed all the beef highlights (we do not eat meat) as we actually came there for the seafood. Talk about pre mature advocation. He also mentioned that they had been working on quality control at their La Jolla restaurant as we had seen quality all over the board there as well. \\"Not here in Scottsdale though\\" We ended up changing tables as he was non stop, left us feeling uncomfortable knowing he was lurking. One has to wonder why he has been at sooo many Valley restaurants. Yet the morale of this story is that V's quality may not fit either the high end ambiance or the pricing. The Lobster Taco appetizer used to be amazing here and that night this was rubbery and the portion (for 18.00) has turned sadly smallish. A side of beets had to be returned as these seem liked they may have been pre cooked and then put in a microwave. Chewy at best. Of course, the Staff can always be a huge asset and the Team concept of service was exemplary. Yet one has to wonder if V's quality blips are Companywide in as much as La Jolla had/has issues. They are big in Texas and we have not yet dined there. In the end, it's summer here and V's can rock on any given night, yet quality issues will always trump the \\"sizzle\\" of an establishment over time.

The waiter's lack of discovery and understanding of the guests' interests, leading to an inappropriate overview of V's offerings. 2. The waiter's excessive talking made the guests feel uncomfortable. 3. Quality issues with the food, such as rubbery Lobster Taco appetizer with reduced portion size and chewy pre-cooked beets. 4. The reviewer has observed quality inconsistencies in the La Jolla restaurant as well.

So in this case, we don't have enough evidence to say for sure whether or not it was their first choice, so the correct answer is that it is not possible to tell. The answer is not (a) Yes, because going to a place does not necessarily mean it was the first choice. It could have been because of many reasons like affordability, proximity, or absence of admission in other preferred schools.

He tied his horse in front of the saloon, unwinding his long body as if a sudden movement might snap it. He turned down the collar of his greatcoat and checked to make sure his big Army Colt was loose in its holster. The saloon door was a single chunk of white pine, still oozing sap, and he had to put his shoulder to it to force it open. The long room inside was quiet, and not much warmer than the street. Clusters of people sat nursing coffee and drinks, talking quietly if they talked at all. Marlin spotted a few farmers the railroad had brought in from Europe: rounded hats, nervous eyes, skin as red as blood. At the far end of the room a half-dozen cowboys turned over cards with patient boredom. Marlin walked up to the bar. \\"Whiskey,\\" he said, and when the drink came he tossed it straight down and felt it pull his lips into a grimace. He nodded for a refill.

Please answer the following question: Process: - You place aluminum cans and other products into recycling bins - Your town or a private company collect and transport the aluminum to a recycling facility - The aluminum is sorted and cleaned at the central recycling facility - The aluminum is melted down to remove coatings and inks - The melted aluminum is formed into large formations called ingots - The ingots are transported to another facility and rolled out to make them easier to manipulate - The ingots can now be turned into new aluminum products. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less aluminum formed into ingots happens, how will it affect MORE aluminum cans being recycled. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If less aluminum is formed into ingots, it could potentially affect the recycling process and the production of more aluminum cans. This perturbation may have a direct or indirect effect on the process, depending on the specific cause for the reduction in ingot formation. Below are some possible effects: 1. (Direct effect) Reduced production capacity: If the recycling facility responsible for melting aluminum and forming it into ingots is operating at a reduced capacity, there will be fewer ingots available for manufacturing new aluminum products, including cans. This could cause a bottleneck in the recycling process and ultimately lead to a decrease in the number of aluminum cans being recycled and manufactured. 2. (Direct effect) Lower quality ingots: If the quality of the ingots is compromised, they might not meet the standards needed for manufacturing new aluminum products. Poor quality ingots could lead to a reduction in the production of aluminum cans, thus affecting the recycling process. 3. (Indirect effect) Higher production costs: In cases where fewer aluminum ingots are available for manufacturing, the overall cost of producing aluminum cans and other products from recycled material might increase. Higher production costs could discourage the use of recycled aluminum, and companies might opt for other alternatives, which would have a negative impact on aluminum recycling. 4. (Indirect effect) Resource limitations: If there is a reduction in the availability of aluminum ingots due to limited resources such as energy, labor, or machinery, this could inhibit ingot production and ultimately affect the recycling of aluminum cans. In conclusion, the perturbation of having less aluminum formed into ingots could have a direct or indirect effect on the process of recycling aluminum cans. The specific impact will depend on the underlying causes for the reduction in ingot formation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Write an article based on this summary: Read each problem carefully. Use pencil and paper while you study. Work out extra problems. Focus on concepts, not formulas. Article:","completion":"Title: Effective Strategies for Mastering Mathematical Concepts Introduction As a cornerstone of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education, mathematics is a critical subject that touches various aspects of everyday life. It enables us to solve real-world problems and make informed decisions. Yet, many students find themselves struggling to grasp mathematical concepts and perform well at different academic levels. This article outlines strategies on how students can effectively understand and retain mathematical knowledge, ultimately helping them excel in the subject. 1. Read Each Problem Carefully The first step in mastering mathematical concepts is to thoroughly read and understand each problem. Difficulties often arise when students skim through problems or fail to comprehend the question's requirements. Hence, students should take their time to examine a problem from all angles and be mindful of any specific conditions, constraints, or assumptions. Further, by dissecting each question and identifying its core components, students can develop a clear understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. 2. Use Pencil and Paper While Studying In our digital age, it is tempting to rely on online tools and calculators. However, it is essential to hone one's manual problem-solving skills by using a pencil and paper. Engaging in this traditional approach allows students to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable pieces. Moreover, when students write down each problem-solving step, it helps them identify gaps in understanding and trace their thought processes. Consequently, students are better equipped to learn from their mistakes, develop critical thinking skills, and gain a deeper understanding of mathematical concepts. 3. Work Out Extra Problems Practicing a sufficient number of problems is crucial to familiarize oneself with various question formats and types. Tackling additional problems provides students with extensive hands-on experience in applying mathematical concepts to solve real-life scenarios. To maximize learning benefits, students should seek out diverse resources, including textbooks, online portals, and expert guidance. Joining study groups, forums, or seeking help from teachers and tutors can provide students with additional problem sets and valuable feedback on their performance. Working on a variety of problems will not only build confidence but also reveal common pitfalls and misconceptions, ensuring a solid foundation in the subject. 4. Focus on Concepts, Not Formulas While formulas are undoubtedly an essential part of mathematics, they shouldn't be the sole focus. Relying solely on memorizing formulas leaves students vulnerable to forgetting them during exams and, more importantly, lacking understanding in the underlying principles. Instead, students should strive to comprehend the underlying concepts and appreciate the relationships between different components. This deeper understanding ensures that students can apply their knowledge to new and unfamiliar problems, rather than merely reproducing solutions to rehearsed problems. When faced with challenging questions, students with a strong conceptual foundation can adapt their approach, linking ideas together and deriving the required formula rather than repeatedly searching for a predetermined answer. Conclusion Mastering mathematical concepts requires a combination of persistence, diligence, and the right learning strategies. By reading problems carefully, using pencil and paper, working out extra problems, and emphasizing conceptual understanding over formula memorization, students can unlock their potential in mathematics. These strategies not only enable students to excel academically but also prepare them for real-world problem-solving and critical thinking scenarios that will serve them well beyond the classroom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer. What is probably true about Puskas? - He hates army life - not enough information - He's a good father - He likes soccer","completion":"Based on the information provided, it can be inferred that Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas enjoys army life, is a good father, and holds an interest in soccer. Since he's taking part in his fourth tour in Korea and lives in the army installation with his family, it indicates a certain level of contentment and dedication to the army life. The fact that this assignment has led him to establishing a family with his Korean wife Mi-jung, and raising his children much of their lives at military bases in Korea also points to his acceptance and likely enjoyment of his army lifestyle. In terms of Puskas being a good father, there are many elements within the text that highlight this aspect. His consistent presence at his daughters' high school soccer games shows his dedication to supporting his children in their extra-curricular activities. Additionally, the emphasis on maintaining a typical family life - going to church and engaging in activities such as spending time on the soccer field in the afternoons or going for bike rides, similar to what they'd do if they were living in the States - also demonstrate his commitment to family bonding, thus portraying him as a caring and involved father. Moreover, Puskas' interest in soccer is also apparent, as he makes an effort to attend most of his daughters' high school soccer games and spends a lot of time on the soccer field. This could indicate that soccer constitutes a shared interest within the family, and that Puskas appreciates and enjoys the sport. However, stating definitively that he 'likes' soccer may be an oversimplification, as his involvement could also be driven by the desire to share in his daughters' interests. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence to support the idea that he has some level of enjoyment or appreciation for soccer. Therefore, the assertions that 'he hates army life' and 'not enough information' can be effectively ruled out based on the information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Before you can explain to others what the parts of speech are, it is good to brush up on them yourself. Knowing the parts of speech can help clarify grammar lessons, increase understanding from students, and improve your own writing. It is best to start with the four basic parts of speech. These are the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Noun: a person, place, thing, or idea. A noun can be common (a general object) or proper (the name of a person or place). For example, dog and goodness are common nouns while Rhode Island and Joe are proper nouns. Verb: a word that shows action or state of being. For example, run, jump, sit, learn are actions that a subject can do. Adjective: a word that describes a noun or a pronoun. For example, pretty, large, beautiful, and loud are all adjectives. Adverb: a word that describes a verb, an adjective, or another adverb. Adverbs usually end in -ly, but not always. For example, quickly and carefully are adverbs that modify verbs while very is an adverb that modifies adjectives and other adverbs. As your lessons develop, you can start introducing the more complex parts of the speech. Pronouns, prepositions, and conjunctions are a good intermediate step, as they have a clear function in the sentence and they interact with the basic parts of speech. Pronoun: a word that takes the place of a noun. The most common type are person pronouns. Personal pronouns include: I, me, you, we, he, she, it, and they. There are many different kinds of pronouns besides the personal. They include indefinite, interrogative, reflexive, intensive, relative, and others. Preposition: a word that describes the position of an object. For example, in, on, under, over, beside are all prepositions. A preposition begins a prepositional phrase. Conjunctions: words that join words, phrases, or clauses. The most common are the coordinating conjunctions (and, or, but, nor, for, yet, and therefore) and subordinating conjunctions, which are those words that join dependent clauses to main clauses in complex sentences (since, when, where, if, although, etc.). Interjections and determiners can be difficult to teach and to learn because their function in the sentence is often ambiguous. Without a strong basis in the other parts of speech, learners might struggle with identifying these parts, and you might find it difficult to explain them. Save your lessons on these parts for last. Interjections: words that are used to express an emotion like surprise or shock or disappointment. They are words that are thrust into the midst of the sentence (hence, interjected). Determiners: the first words in noun phrases that act in a way that limits or quantifies the noun. Articles such as “a/an” and “the” as well as words like many, some, or two are what “determines” if the noun is specific or general. With eight differently colored pens or markers, underline, circle, or box every part of speech. Tell your students which color marker corresponds to which part of speech. For the rest of the lesson, whenever you underline that part of speech, use the same color. Once you are finished teaching the lesson, give your students a short passage to read. Ask them to underline each part of speech using the same corresponding colors as you did. For nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs, you can encourage students to ask certain questions to help them understand what the different parts of speech are. These questions will encourage them to think about how each part functions in the sentence as well as give them an easy tool for identifying the parts of speech. Nouns answer the questions “who?” and “what?” Adjectives answer the questions \\"what kind?”; \\"which?\\"; and \\"how many?\\" Verbs answer the question “what is it doing?” Adverbs answer the questions “how?”; “when?”; “where?”; and “why?” For the more difficult parts of speech—such as pronouns, conjunctions, interjections, and conjunctions—it may be easier to make a chart of the most common examples of these parts of speech. Explain these parts of speech, pointing to these examples on the chart. After the student has learned them, try asking them to make their own chart from memory. Diagramming sentences is a traditional method of explaining the parts of speech. In a sentence diagram, the parts are visualized on a series of connecting lines to show how the parts of speech relate to one another. On a horizontal line, write the noun subject and verb of the sentence. Divide these with a vertical line. Using diagonal lines, connect adjectives and determiners to the noun that they modify and adverbs to the verb or adjective that they modify. Use dotted lines to link conjunctions with the words that they connect.

It was a bitterly cold and windy winter morning when Emily, the woman in question, gazed outside her window and shivered at the sight of snowflakes swiftly falling to the ground. The streets were covered in a white blanket, and it was no secret that the day ahead would be colder than most. She knew that she had to dress warmly to brave the freezing weather, but she was always quite particular about her wardrobe. Emily opened her closet and stared at the two pieces of clothing she had laid out before her, her choices narrowed down to either the turtleneck or the scarf. The soft, black turtleneck was not only thick and knitted but was known to provide her with an ample amount of warmth during winter. Meanwhile, her favorite red scarf, adorned with intricate patterns and tassels, was lighter and far less effective at keeping the bitter cold at bay. However, as she weighed her options, a negative memory surfaced, reminding her of the last time she wore the turtleneck. It left her feeling suffocated and constricted around her neck, ultimately resulting in an itch that seemed to go on for hours. Although she couldn't quite remember when she had first recognized this discomfort, it had now become a deeply ingrained sensation, one she couldn't shake off every time she saw the turtleneck. On the other hand, the scarf had been her trusty companion for years. Its bright shade of red provided a pop of color on dreary winter days, and it was easily adjustable, allowing her to wrap it around her neck in various ways. Despite its shortcomings in providing adequate warmth and protection from the cold, it was an accessory that she genuinely enjoyed wearing. Taking a deep breath, Emily reached out for the scarf and wrapped it around her neck, admiring the way the red threads complemented her outfit. The turtleneck remained untouched, left to observe her choice from its spot in the wardrobe. As she stepped out of her home, the cold air gently brushed against her face. Emily pulled her scarf a little tighter and felt a renewed sense of appreciation for the freedom of movement it allowed. Although her neck was not as protected as it would have been with the turtleneck, she found comfort in knowing that she had chosen something that made her feel content and comfortable. Throughout the day, Emily received numerous compliments on her scarf, expressing admiration for her braving the cold with grace and style. Inwardly, she knew she had made the right choice, even though it meant making a slight compromise on warmth. This decision cemented her belief in valuing her own comfort and personal preference, fortifying her resolve to trust herself and follow her instincts when faced with future decisions. As she returned home that evening, Emily smiled softly at the sight of her turtleneck still hanging in her closet. Perhaps she would give it another try someday when she was ready to confront that lingering discomfort once more. But for now, she was more than content with her choice to wear the scarf, an accessory that not only suited her style but also signified her courage and self-assurance in a remarkably uncertain world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: S/he will examine the infected area and take an x-ray. to determine the severity of the situation and identify the best treatment. S/he will examine the position of the tooth to see whether it has fully or partially emerged from the gums. Your dentist will also take note of the condition of the surrounding gums. If the wisdom tooth has not yet emerged, the dentist may need to perform an x-ray to locate the tooth and identify its position. These factors will influence whether or not the tooth will need to be removed. Don’t forget your medical history. Your dentist will want to know if you’re allergic to any medication. Consult with your dentist about how much the procedure will cost. You should also ask about all the risks and benefits of the treatment, as well as any alternative treatments that may be an option. Don’t be afraid to ask questions. You have the right to understand your medical care. If the wisdom tooth is about to emerge from the gums without any problems and the infection is not too severe, the dentist may be able to clear the infection by simply cleaning the area with an antiseptic solution. The dentist will remove any infected tissue, pus, food debris or plaque from around the area. If there is an abscess on the gums, sometimes a small incision will be made to drain the pus. After the cleaning, your dentist will recommend home care for you to follow over the next few days. This might include mouth gels to bring down inflammation, antibiotics to fully clear the infection, and painkillers to relieve any pain. Commonly prescribed antibiotics include Amoxicillin, Clindamycin, and Penicillin. One of the main causes of wisdom tooth infection is when a section of gum covering the wisdom tooth — known as the gum flap —becomes infected due to bacteria, plaque and food debris becoming trapped underneath it. If the tooth is still buried within the gums (but is positioned to emerge from the gums correctly) it is often easier to remove the infected gum flap than the tooth itself. Your dentist might schedule a minor surgical procedure called an ‘operculectomy’, in which the soft gum tissue covering the wisdom tooth is removed. Once removed, the area will be a lot easier to keep clean and free of plaque and bacteria, which greatly reduces the chances of the wisdom tooth becoming reinfected. Before the procedure, your dentist will numb the area with a local anesthetic. S/he will then remove the infected tissue flap using surgical scalpel blades, lasers or electrocautery methods. If you have suffered from multiple infections and your wisdom tooth shows no sign of emerging on its own, it may be necessary to have the tooth removed. Extraction may also be necessary if the infection is very severe. Depending on the position of the tooth, the extraction will be conducted by your dentist or by an oral surgeon. The dentist will give you a local anaesthetic and will remove the tooth. You may be prescribed antibiotics and painkillers to prevent further infection and relieve any pain. It is essential that you follow your dentist's advice regarding good oral hygiene practices. You will need to schedule a follow-up appointment with your dentist to inspect the gums to ensure they are healing properly. The dentist will check the positioning of the opposite wisdom tooth, in case it need to be removed also.","completion":"The article describes the process of diagnosing and treating an infected wisdom tooth.

Rudolf Diesel had retired to his cabin aboard the SS Dresden, travelling from Belgium across the English Channel. His nightclothes were laid out on his bed, but Diesel did not change into them. The inventor of the engine that bears his name was thinking about his heavy debts and the interest payments that he couldn't afford. In his diary, that date - 29 September 1913 - was marked with an ominous \\"X\\". Before the trip, Diesel had gathered what cash he could and stuffed it into a bag, together with documents laying bare his financial mess. He gave the bag to his unsuspecting wife, with instructions not to open it until a week had passed. Diesel stepped outside his cabin, removed his coat, laid it neatly on the ship's deck, looked over the railings and jumped. Or did he? Conspiracy theorists have speculated that Diesel was assisted overboard. But who might have had an interest in the impecunious inventor's demise? Two possible candidates have been fingered. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economy highlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that have helped create the economic world we live in.

Steam supplied the power for trains and factories, but urban transport depended on horses. That autumn, equine flu brought US cities to a standstill. Grocery store shelves were bare and rubbish piled up in the streets. A city of half a million people might have 100,000 horses. Each one liberally coated the streets with 15kg of manure and 4 litres of urine every day. An affordable, reliable, small-scale engine that could replace the horse would be a godsend. The steam engine was one candidate: steam-powered cars were coming along nicely. Another was the internal combustion engine, early versions of which ran on petrol, gas, or even gunpowder. But when Rudolf Diesel was a student, both types of engine were woefully inefficient, converting only around 10% of heat into useful work. The young Diesel's life was changed by a lecture on thermodynamics at the Royal Bavarian Polytechnic of Munich, where he learned that it was theoretically possible to make an internal combustion engine that would convert all heat into work. Diesel set himself the task of translating theory into practice. He failed. His first working engine was only just over 25% efficient. Today, the best Diesel engines top 50%. But even so, 25% was more than twice as good as its rivals achieved. Diesel's engine is more efficient partly because of how it ignites the fuel. Petrol engines compress fuel and air together, then ignite it with a spark plug. But compress the mixture too much and it can self-ignite, which causes destabilising engine knock. Diesel's invention compresses only the air, and more so, making it hot enough to ignite the fuel when it's injected. And the higher the compression ratio, the less fuel is needed. Anyone who's researched buying a car will be familiar with the basic trade-off of a Diesel engine - they tend to be more expensive to buy, but more economical to run. Unfortunately for Rudolf, in early versions these efficiency gains were outweighed by reliability issues. He faced a steady stream of refund demands from unhappy customers. This dug the inventor into the financial hole from which he could not escape. Still, he kept working at his engine, and it kept improving. Other advantages became apparent. Diesel engines can use a heavier fuel than petrol engines - specifically, a heavier fuel that's become known as \\"diesel\\". As well as being cheaper than petrol to refine from crude oil, diesel also gives off fewer fumes, so it's less likely to cause explosions. This made it particularly attractive for military transport. By 1904, Diesel had got his engines into France's submarines. This brings us to the first conspiracy theory around Rudolf Diesel's death. In 1913 Europe, the drumbeats of impending war were quickening, and the cash-strapped German was en route to London. One newspaper headline luridly speculated: \\"Inventor thrown into the sea to stop sale of patents to British government.\\" It was only after World War One that Diesel's invention began to realise its commercial potential. The first diesel-powered trucks appeared in the 1920s, trains in the 1930s. By 1939 a quarter of global sea trade was fuelled by diesel. After World War Two, ever more powerful and efficient diesel engines led to ever more enormous ships. Fuel accounts for around 70% of the costs of shipping goods around the world. Scientist Vaclav Smil argues that steam-powered globalisation would have grown much more slowly than diesel allowed. The economist Brian Arthur isn't so sure. He describes the rise of the internal combustion engine over the past century as \\"path dependence\\": a self-reinforcing cycle in which existing investments and infrastructure mean we keep doing things in a certain way, even if we'd do them differently if only we could start from scratch. As late as 1914, Arthur argues, steam was at least as viable as crude oil for powering cars - but the growing influence of the oil industry ensured that much more money went into improving the internal combustion engine than the steam engine. With equal investment in research and development, perhaps today we'd be driving next-generation steam-powered cars. Alternatively, if Rudolf had had his way, perhaps the global economy would run on peanuts. Diesel's name has become synonymous with a crude oil derivative, but he designed his engine to use a variety of fuels, from coal dust to vegetable oils. In 1900, at the Paris World Fair, he demonstrated a model based on peanut oil. He became something of an evangelist and in 1912 - a year before his death - Diesel predicted that vegetable oils would become as important a source of fuel as petroleum products. A more appealing vision for owners of peanut farms than for owners of oil fields, the impetus to make it happen largely dissipated with Diesel's death. Hence the second conspiracy theory to inspire a speculatively sensationalist headline in a contemporary newspaper: \\"Murdered by agents from big oil trusts.\\" There's recently been a resurgence of interest in biodiesel. It's less polluting than oil fuel, but it's controversial - it competes for land with agriculture, pushing up food prices. In Rudolf's era, this was less of a concern: the population was much smaller, and the climate was more predictable. Diesel was excited by the idea that his engine could help to develop poor, agricultural economies. How different might the world look today, if the most valuable land during the past hundred years wasn't where you could drill for oil, but where you could cultivate peanuts? We can only guess - just as we'll never know for sure what happened to Rudolf Diesel. By the time his body reappeared 10 days later, it was too decomposed for an autopsy, or even for the crew to be willing to take it on board at all. Diesel's wallet, pocket knife and spectacles case were retrieved and later identified by his son. His body was taken by the waves.

However, on the Bengals' second possession they were able to drive deep into Denver territory, reaching the 11-yard line before setting up for a short field goal. However, the field goal snap was fumbled. After the flubbed field goal, both teams entered a period of offensive ineptness - Denver had four consecutive one-and-done drives, while Cincinnati was forced to punt, then had a promising drive end with a Carson Palmer interception after Denver cornerback Champ Bailey tipped the ball into the air and Wesley Woodyard recovered the interception. Denver was finally able to put together a drive at the end of the first half that finished with a Matt Prater 48-yard field goal as time ran out. Despite being out-gained in all offensive indicators, Denver took a 3-0 lead into halftime due to Cincinnati mistakes, including the fumbled field goal, interception, and multiple dropped passes. During the third quarter, neither team was able to sustain an offensive drive - Cincinnati punted 3 times, while Denver punted 2 times. However, Denver's defense showed improvement, including one Cincinnati drive that ended after two consecutive sacks of Carson Palmer. Denver was able to put together another field goal drive at the end of the third quarter, with Matt Prater this time kicking a 50-yard field goal to put the Broncos on top 6-0. The fourth quarter continued in much the same vein. Denver made it into field goal range again before a 5-yard penalty and 7-yard sack forced them to punt it away again. However, Cincinnati was able to put together their first sustained drive of the entire game during the second half of the quarter - the Bengals gained 90 yards on 11 plays over 5:40. This culminated with a 1-yard Cedric Benson touchdown run that avoided a Bengals shutout and put them on top for the first time. Denver regained control of the ball at their own 13-yard line with 38 seconds remaining. After an incomplete pass, Kyle Orton attempted a pass to Brandon Marshall with 28 seconds remaining. The ball was tipped into the air by Bengals defensive back Leon Hall and into the hands of Denver wide receiver Brandon Stokley, who then took it untouched 87 yards to the end zone with 11 seconds remaining. Records showed that this was the longest play from scrimmage in NFL history with less than 1 minute remaining in the game. The play was referred to by some as \\"The Immaculate Deflection\\" after The Immaculate Reception. Denver took a 12-7 lead but failed a two-point conversion. A desperation hail mary pass by Carson Palmer was intercepted in the end zone with 5 seconds to play by Denver tight end Tony Scheffler.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The NSWCA appealed to Lord Harris, and in reply he said he did not blame them or the cricketers of Sydney in any way, but said that \\"it [the riot] was an occurrence it was impossible he could forget\\". On 11 February, one day after the conclusion of the match and three days after the riot, Harris wrote a letter to one of his friends about the disturbance. It was clear that he intended the letter to be printed in the press, and it appeared in full in The Daily Telegraph on 1 April, among other London newspapers, reigniting the furore. Wisden Cricketers' Almanack considered the incident of such significance that it reprinted the whole correspondence. The letter gives a detailed contemporary account of what Lord Harris thought about the riot.Lord Harris referred to the crowd as a \\"howling mob\\" and said \\"I have seen no reason as yet to change my opinion of Coulthard's qualities, or to regret his engagement, in which opinion I am joined by the whole team\\". He further added that \\"Beyond slyly kicking me once or twice the mob behaved very well, their one cry being, 'Change your umpire'. And now for the cause of this disturbance, not unexpected, I may say, by us, for we have heard accounts of former matches played by English teams.\\" Harris further accused a New South Wales parliamentarian of assisting the gamblers in the inciting the unrest, although he did not name the accusee. He said I blame the NSW Eleven for not objecting to Coulthard before the match began, if they had reason to suppose him incompetent to fulfil his duties. I blame the members of the association (many, of course, must be excepted) for their discourtesy and uncricket like behaviour to their guests; and I blame the committee and others of the association for ever permitting betting, but this last does not, of course, apply to our match only.

Answer the following question: Question: Cats are laying by the refrigerator why do they do that? Options: - lie down - like heat - eating fish - drink water - come to dinner Explain why a human would choose \\"like heat\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human would choose \\"like heat\\" to answer the question \\"Cats are laying by the refrigerator why do they do that?\\" for the following reasons: Step 1: Understand the context of the question The person would understand that the question is about cats' behavior and their preference for a specific location (by the refrigerator). Step 2: Eliminate irrelevant options The person would then analyze each option and eliminate those that do not make sense in the context of the question: - lie down: Cats can lie down anywhere, not necessarily by the refrigerator, so this option is too general. - eating fish: There is no information about fish in the question, so this option is not relevant. - drink water: The refrigerator is not a source of water, making this option irrelevant. - come to dinner: The question does not mention anything about dinner time or food, so this option is not connected to the question. Step 3: Choose the most relevant option The person would then choose the \\"like heat\\" option, as it makes the most sense in the context of the question. Refrigerators usually emit heat from their cooling systems, making the area around them warmer. Cats are known to like warm places, which explains why they would lay there. So, the human would choose the \\"like heat\\" option because it is the most logical explanation for cats laying by the refrigerator, taking into account cats' known preference for warmth and the fact that refrigerators can emit heat."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Exploring the two, we can understand the similarities and differences in meaning between them. Sentence 1: (1) In 1962, further restoration was carried out for William Cardinal Godfrey, who had appointed the poet and mystic John Bradburne as caretaker. This sentence highlights the following information: - The time period during which the restoration work was carried out, which is 1962. - The restoration was done for William Cardinal Godfrey. - The connection between Godfrey and John Bradburne is established through the phrase \\"who had appointed.\\" This indicates that William Cardinal Godfrey made the decision to appoint Bradburne as the caretaker before 1962. Sentence 2: (2) Further restoration was carried out in 1962 for William Cardinal Godfrey who had earlier appointed the poet and mystic John Bradburne to be caretaker. This sentence conveys the same essential information as the first; nevertheless, there are some minor differences: - The restoration's purpose and the person who initiated it are still clear. - The connection between Godfrey and Bradburne is emphasized using the word \\"earlier.\\" This highlights that the appointment was made before the actual restoration work took place. However, it doesn’t explicitly indicate how long before the restoration the appointment occurred. In conclusion, both sentences describe the same situation and share the same core elements: restoration work took place in 1962 for William Cardinal Godfrey, with John Bradburne appointed as the caretaker. The main difference lies in the emphasis placed on the timing of Bradburne's appointment and the events in the sentences.

Later, his wife became accustomed to the sound of him falling down the stairs when his knee buckled under his weight. When he was fit enough, he used the federal G.I. bill's educational benefits and disability payments to enroll in the physical education program at Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio. He had been accepted to Antioch (his brother's alma mater) while in high school. His interests led him to the theater department and then to broadcasting. He changed his major to Literature and earned his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1950. \\"I was kind of mixed up and restless, and I kind of liked their work-for-a-term, go-to-school-for-a-term set-up,\\" he recounted. As part of his studies, Serling became active in the campus radio station, an experience which proved useful in his future career. He wrote, directed, and acted in many radio programs on campus, then around the state, as part of his work study. Here he met Carolyn Louise \\"Carol\\" Kramer, a student, who later became his wife. At first, she refused to date him because of his campus reputation as a \\"ladies man\\", but she eventually changed her mind. He converted from Judaism to Unitarianism in college, which allowed him to marry Kramer on July 31, 1948. They had two daughters, Jodi and Anne.

Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a 9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. District officials also took 1.7 million from student -activity accounts of its 38 schools. At Coffman's request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district's finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a 212 million bond issue for schools. In Frederick, students' parents are buying classroom supplies and offering to pay for groceries and utilities to keep first-year teachers and principals in their jobs.

Article: Scientists are closely concerned with the structure of buildings and with the quality of building materials. The World health Organization (WHO) observes that the introduction of air conditioning and energy conservation measures have been accompanied by growing problems of indoor air quality. Some pollutants arise from insulation products, some from moving cars, and others from modern housing materials. As many Europeans spend up to 90% of their lives in buildings, the health effects of the indoor climate are very important. Some construction materials, including fiberboard, insulation foams and certain glues for man-made wood floor boards, for example, give out organic products such as formaldehyde . Heat and humidity increase the release of formaldehyde and the gas seriously harms the eyes. Paint, lacquer, etc. can also release dangerous gas into indoor air. Construction materials can cause serious damage, especially when they contain asbestos . Asbestos is naturally present in rock formations worldwide. It belongs to a family of mineral substances made up of solid, non-combustible fiber. These properties make asbestos a highly sought-after construction material. As early as 1931, however, public health officers in the prefix = st1 /United Kingdomrevealed the connection between breathing in asbestos dust and such diseases as lung cancer. The land on which a building is sited may also contribute to pollution. Some kinds of granite or similar rocks contain traces of radium. As it breaks down, this naturally radioactive element produces some kind of radioactive gas that goes through tiny cracks in walls, floors and building materials, and makes its way into the building and the rooms. The better the homes are insulated, the more is the dangerous gas in indoor air. The main effect of this dangerous gas on health is to increase the risk of lung cancer. Question: Why is asbestos a sought-after building material? Options: A: It is a kind of insulation foam. B: Asbestos will not give out dangerous gas. C: This material is not easy to catch fire.

Interviews are being carried out by Portuguese officers with Scotland Yard detectives present. Mr Malinka and the other suspect left the central police station in Faro after they were interviewed. The Russian-born computer expert, who has Portuguese nationality, is likely to face more questioning on Wednesday. A third person, who is said to be suffering from severe schizophrenia, remained in the police headquarters after the other two had left. It is not clear when the fourth individual will be interviewed. All of those being questioned are Portuguese citizens. They have all been summoned to be interviewed; there have been no arrests. The status of arguidos in the Portuguese judicial system refers to individuals whom police may reasonably suspect are linked to a crime. Local Briton Robert Murat - who was himself named as an arguido in the case before being cleared of any involvement - said it was \\"ridiculous\\" that Mr Malinka had been questioned as a suspect.

Does the following review have a positive or negative opinion of the movie? felt like an answer to irvine welsh 's book trainspotting","completion":"The given review indicates a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer states that the movie \\"felt like an answer to Irvine Welsh's book Trainspotting.\\" This comparison suggests that the movie is similar to or a continuation of the themes and stories that Welsh explores in his novel, which is generally considered as a work of high quality. By associating the movie with the book, the reviewer is implying that the film exhibits the same level of complexity, emotional depth, or narrative resonance as Trainspotting. To understand better why this review is positive, it's important to give some context about the book 'Trainspotting.' Published in 1993, Trainspotting is a Scottish black comedy novel by Irvine Welsh, which follows a group of heroin addicts in the late 1980s and their adventures as they drift through life. The novel has been praised for its distinct voice, realistic approach to drug use, and the portrayal of urban decay, poverty, and disenfranchisement experienced by a lost generation of young people. Since the reviewer draws a connection between the movie and Welsh's Trainspotting, they seem to imply that the film might share similar qualities, such as strong character development, a gritty storyline, or exploration of dark yet authentic themes. By making this association, the reviewer likely appreciates these aspects in the film under consideration. Additionally, it's worth noting that the comparison to Trainspotting not only implies that the movie is of high quality but also may suggest that it speaks to a specific audience of viewers who enjoy raw, candid, and unsanitized stories that tackle uncompromising realities. Given the strong impact of Trainspotting, the reviewer's reference to the book would serve to intrigue or attract individuals who appreciate the profound themes handled in Welsh's novel. To sum up, although the review is brief and doesn't explicitly express a positive sentiment, its comparison indicates a positive opinion of the movie. The reviewer's parallel between the film and Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting suggests that the movie is engaging, thought-provoking, and shares qualities with a highly regarded novel, which could potentially pique interest among viewers who appreciate unflinching and compelling storytelling."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer??","completion":"In this problem, we're solving an equation for the variable a. We will follow the required steps in order to isolate a and find its value. 1. Begin by simplifying the equation -273*a = -7791 + 4492 - 11443. We start by simplifying the expression on the right side of the equation: Right side: -7791 + 4492 - 11443 First, let's add -7791 and 4492: -7791 + 4492 = -3299 Now, let's subtract -3299 and 11443: -3299 - 11443 = -14742 So, the simplified equation is: -273*a = -14742 2. To solve for a, we need to isolate the variable a on one side of the equation. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by -273: -273*a / -273 = -14742 / -273 Now, let's simplify the division: a = -14742 / -273 = 54 So, the value of a is: a = 54"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who built the worthless copper mines that the exclusive railroad of Colorado invested in? In 2016, the United States is in a sustained economic depression. Industrial disasters, resource shortages, and gasoline prices at 37 per gallon have made railroads the primary mode of transportation, but even they are in disrepair. After a major accident on the Rio Norte line of the Taggart Transcontinental railroad, CEO James Taggart shirks responsibility. His sister Dagny Taggart, Vice-President in Charge of Operations, defies him by replacing the aging track with new rails made of Rearden Metal, which is claimed to be lighter yet stronger than steel. Dagny meets with its inventor, Hank Rearden, and they negotiate a deal they both admit serves their respective self-interests. Politician Wesley Mouch—nominally Rearden's lobbyist in Washington, D.C.—is part of a crowd that views heads of industry as persons who must be broken or tamed. James Taggart uses political influence to ensure that Taggart Transcontinental is designated the exclusive railroad for the state of Colorado. Dagny is confronted by Ellis Wyatt, a Colorado oil man angry to be forced to do business with Taggart Transcontinental. Dagny promises him that he will get the service he needs. Dagny encounters former lover Francisco d'Anconia, who presents a façade of a playboy grown bored with the pursuit of money. He reveals that a series of copper mines he built are worthless, costing his investors (including the Taggart railroad) millions. Rearden lives in a magnificent home with a wife and a brother who are happy to live off his effort, though they overtly disrespect it. Rearden's anniversary gift to his wife Lillian is a bracelet made from the first batch of Rearden Metal, but she considers it a garish symbol of Hank's egotism. At a dinner party, Dagny dares Lillian to exchange it for Dagny's diamond necklace, which she does.

If it converges, what is the limit? Please tell me if those questions are the same. Choices: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"First, let's address the question about the Fedorov Avtomat and StG 44: The Fedorov Avtomat, designed in 1916 by Russian engineer Vladimir Grigoryevich Fedorov, can be considered a precursor to modern assault rifles, but not the first true assault rifle. The StG 44, designed by Germany during World War II, is widely considered the first proper assault rifle. The distinction lies in their technical specifications, such as the intermediate cartridge used in the StG 44. Now, let's address the second question about the sequence: We want to determine if the sequence a_n = (1^3)/(n^4) + (2^3)/(n^4) + ... + (n^3)/(n^4) converges or diverges. If it converges, we want to determine the limit. To do this, we can use the ratio test. First, let's rewrite the sequence as a series: Σ[(k^3)/(n^4)] from k = 1 to n Now, we want to find the limit as n goes to infinity: lim(n→∞) [Σ[(k^3)/(n^4)] from k = 1 to n] = lim(n→∞) [Σ[k^3/n^4] from k = 1 to n] We can take n^4 out of the summation since it remains constant for all k: lim(n→∞) [1/n^4 * Σ[k^3] from k = 1 to n] The sum of cubes of the first n natural numbers can be expressed as: Σ[k^3] from k = 1 to n = (n*(n + 1)/2)^2 Now we have: lim(n→∞) [1/n^4 * (n*(n + 1)/2)^2] We can simplify this and take the limit as n goes to infinity: lim(n→∞) [(n^2 * (n^2 + 2n + 1))/(4 * n^4)] lim(n→∞) [(n^4 + 2n^3 + n^2)/(4 * n^4)] As n goes to infinity, the highest power of n dominates, so we simply take the coefficients of the highest power terms: lim = 1/4 The sequence converges, and the limit is 1/4. Now, let's determine if these questions are the same. The first question is about the history and classification of firearms, specifically the Fedorov Avtomat and StG 44. The second question is a mathematical problem, determining the convergence or divergence of a particular sequence. In conclusion, the answer is: 1). no;"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This tragic event, known as the Tenerife Airport Disaster, remains the deadliest aviation accident in history, resulting in a total of 583 fatalities. On that day, both aircraft, the KLM Boeing 747-206B (KLM Flight 4805) and the Pan American World Airways Boeing 747-121 (Pan Am Flight 1736), were scheduled to arrive at Gran Canaria International Airport, also located in the Canary Islands. However, due to the presence of a terrorist bombing at Gran Canaria, several flights, including these two, were diverted to Los Rodeos Airport. The situation at Los Rodeos was chaotic, as the small airport struggled to accommodate multiple large aircraft, including the KLM and Pan Am 747s. While waiting for clearance to depart for Gran Canaria after the threat at their original destination had been resolved, both aircraft were instructed to backtaxi (taxi in the opposite direction of takeoff) on the only runway available at the time. The KLM 4805 moved to the start of the runway and prepared to turn around for takeoff, while the Pan Am 1736 was still taxiing on the same runway, looking for an appropriate exit to taxiway C3, that would allow it to clear the runway. The thick fog that had settled over the airport made visibility extremely low, which further exacerbated the situation. Miscommunication between the pilots, air traffic control, and the ambiguous standard phrases used at the time contributed to the confusion that led up to the disaster. The KLM 4805 commenced its takeoff roll without proper clearance from the air traffic controller, believing that it had been granted permission. At the same moment, the Pan Am 1736 was still on the runway heading towards the exit at taxiway C3. By the time the pilots of both aircraft realized their potentially catastrophic situation, it was too late. Despite attempting evasive maneuvers, the KLM 747 crashed into the top of the Pan Am 747, causing a massive explosion and fire that engulfed both planes. As a result of this tragic accident, 248 people on the KLM flight and 335 people on the Pan Am flight lost their lives. Only 61 of the Pan Am passengers and crew survived. The Tenerife Airport Disaster led to widespread changes and improvements in aviation communication and air traffic control procedures, including the implementation of standardized phrases and terminology in pilot-controller communications, and the introduction of crew resource management in order to improve decision-making and teamwork in the cockpit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The place of worship in Nome, North Dakota, was recently purchased by Craig Cobb, who tried to set up a whites-only enclave in another part of the state. The blaze was reported on Wednesday afternoon and the structure was razed by the time fire crews arrived after nearly an hour. Cobb said the fire at the former Zion Lutheran church was \\"100% arson\\". He told WDAY-TV, a Fargo-based news station, that he is offering a reward of 2,000 (Â£1,600) to anyone with any information related to the incident, which he said was a direct attack on his life. Local residents said that it appeared Cobb had not yet moved in the 108-year-old building. He says the gas and electric utilities had not been hooked up, so the fire could not have been accidental. The blaze occurred on the same day that news of the sale appeared on the front page of the Fargo Forum newspaper. The North Dakota State Fire Marshal's Office is helping with the investigation. Cobb told WDAY-TV that he is considering several options about what to do next. He says he might open a new church called \\"the President Donald J Trump Church of Rome\\", not Nome, the town located about 70 miles (112km) southwest of Fargo. Cobb is one of the best known white supremacists in North America, according to the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks hate groups.

By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon. Now, I have a new situation: Two pedologists studied different types of soil. Yun studied forest soils, while Jian studied grassland soil. They were both very surprised with they findings.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Question: Given the background: In common everyday speech, speed of sound refers to the speed of sound waves in air. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance: sound travels most slowly in gases; it travels faster in liquids; and faster still in solids. For example, (as noted above), sound travels at 343 m/s in air; it travels at 1,480 m/s in water (4.3 times as fast as in air); and at 5,120 m/s in iron (about 15 times as fast as in air). In an exceptionally stiff material such as diamond, sound travels at 12,000 metres per second (27,000 mph);[1] (about 35 times as fast as in air) which is around the maximum speed that sound will travel under normal conditions. and the situation: John and Keith are neighbors. They have been pondering about how to communicate with each other in a doomsday scenario when all the electronic devices would be useless. They connected their houses with three ducts. One of the ducts is filled with air; they called it channel A. Another duct is filled with water; they called it channel B. And the last duct is filled with iron; they called it channel C. They can now transmit sound with these channels of communication; in case, disaster strikes. Answer the following question: How much faster would be channel C than channel B in m/s, 3640 m/s or 3600 m/s? Answer:","completion":"To compare the speed of sound in channel C (iron) and channel B (water), we need to find the difference between their respective speeds. Speed of sound in iron (Channel C) = 5,120 m/s Speed of sound in water (Channel B) = 1,480 m/s Difference in speeds = Speed in iron - Speed in water Difference in speeds = 5,120 m/s - 1,480 m/s Difference in speeds = 3,640 m/s Therefore, channel C would be 3,640 m/s faster than channel B."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Swede Sundhage has no split loyalties Updated Jul 6, 2011 10:22 AM ET There's no questioning Pia Sundhage's loyalties, regardless of the passport she carries. The United States plays Sweden in the first-round finale of the Women's World Cup on Wednesday night, needing only a tie to win Group C and likely dodge a quarterfinal matchup with old nemesis Brazil. Never mind that Sundhage remains Sweden's greatest player, that she led her native country to the title at the first European Women's Championship in 1984 and the bronze medal in 1991 in the inaugural Women's World Cup. She has coached the U.S. since 2007, and when she says ''we'' these days she doesn't mean Sweden. ''For me, it's not Sweden. It's just a team,'' Sundhage said. ''It's a World Cup, and I hope we do very well in the World Cup so I can stay another year so I can win the Olympics again. That's all that matters.'' Avoiding Brazil could play a big part in how well the Americans do at this World Cup. Led by Marta, the five-time FIFA player of the year, the Brazilians were runners-up to the U.S. at the last two Olympics and again to Germany at the 2007 World Cup. After winning their first two games, they need only a draw against World Cup newcomer Equatorial Guinea to win Group D. The Group C runner-up, either Sweden or the U.S., has to play the Group D winner while whoever wins Group C gets the second-place team in Group D, likely Australia or Norway. ''Doesn't matter. We're prepared for whomever,'' Abby Wambach insisted. ''We can't control any of that. Right now, we're focused on Sweden. We want to get a good result against Sweden, we want to play well. That's the thing. We want to keep playing well, performing to our potential because we're going to continue to get better as the tournament goes on and hopefully we'll be, come the championship game, playing our best.'' Whether Wambach is even playing against Sweden remains in question. The striker, who is third on the all-time U.S. scoring list, is bothered by chronic tendinitis in her right Achilles and did not practice either Monday or Tuesday. Heather O'Reilly, who scored the first goal against Colombia on Saturday, also sat out practice with a sore groin. Sweden will be without captain Caroline Seger, who is suspended after picking up her second yellow card Saturday against North Korea. But Seger played down the impact of her absence. ''There is nothing new or anything that's going to surprise the U.S.,'' she said. ''We know each other very well.'' The two teams do play quite regularly, with the U.S. holding an 18-4-7 advantage, including 3-0 at the World Cup. But Sweden beat the Americans for the first time in almost seven years in January in the opener of the Four Nations tournament. The U.S. went on to win the tournament, but the defeat was one of three in a five-month span after the team had gone more than two years without losing a game. ''Of course when you beat another team, you always have good confidence,'' Sweden coach Thomas Dennerby said. ''But, it's a new game and it's a game in a (major) tournament. That is not exactly the same as a game in a training tournament. I think the U.S. will be so much better. So will the Swedish team.'' With both teams assured of spots in the quarterfinals, much of the pre-game attention has centered around Sundhage. She scored 71 goals in her 22-year international career, and remains the face of women's soccer in Sweden. Though she knows the Americans better, obviously, she had a hand in shaping Sweden's team, too, coaching some of the players on the country's youth squads from 1990 to 2001. Sundhage remains so celebrated in her home country that there were as many Swedish reporters at the U.S. practice Tuesday as there were at Sweden's. Her name was even floated as a possible coach of the men's team after it failed to qualify for the 2010 World Cup. ''Of course I know a lot about the way she wants football to be played,'' Dennerby said. ''But I don't think that's going to be a big deal in the game. We are still good friends and talk a lot when we see each other. I hope it's going to stay that way, after the game.'' What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the upcoming match between the United States and Sweden in the first-round finale of the Women's World Cup. Despite Pia Sundhage being Sweden's greatest player and having led her native country to numerous victories, she has been coaching the U.S. team since 2007 and has no split loyalties. Both teams have secured spots in the quarterfinals, and the United States needs only a tie to win Group C and potentially avoid a matchup with Brazil in the next round. The two teams have a long history of playing against each other, with the U.S. having an 18-4-7 advantage, including a 3-0 record at the World Cup. However, Sweden beat the U.S. for the first time in almost seven years in January during the Four Nations tournament.

The 2016 university ratings by \\"U.S. News & World Report\\" rank ASU No. 1 among the Most Innovative Schools in America for the second year in a row. - Astronomy is a natural science that studies celestial objects and phenomena. It applies mathematics, physics, and chemistry, in an effort to explain the origin of those objects and phenomena and their evolution. Objects of interest include planets, moons, stars, galaxies, and comets; while the phenomena include supernovae explosions, gamma ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. More generally, all astronomical phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere are within the purview of astronomy. A related but distinct subject, physical cosmology, is concerned with the study of the Universe as a whole. - Physical cosmology is the study of the largest-scale structures and dynamics of the Universe and is concerned with fundamental questions about its origin, structure, evolution, and ultimate fate. Cosmology as a science originated with the Copernican principle, which implies that celestial bodies obey identical physical laws to those on Earth, and Newtonian mechanics, which first allowed us to understand those physical laws. Physical cosmology, as it is now understood, began with the development in 1915 of Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, followed by major observational discoveries in the 1920s: first, Edwin Hubble discovered that the universe contains a huge number of external galaxies beyond our own Milky Way; then, work by Vesto Slipher and others showed that the universe is expanding. These advances made it possible to speculate about the origin of the universe, and allowed the establishment of the Big Bang Theory, by Georges Lemaitre, as the leading cosmological model. A few researchers still advocate a handful of alternative cosmologies; however, most cosmologists agree that the Big Bang theory explains the observations better. - Louis Dill Friedman (born July 7, 1941) is an American astronautics engineer and space spokesperson. He was born in New York and raised in the Bronx. Dr. Friedman was a co-founder of The Planetary Society with Carl Sagan and Bruce C.

Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities. As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System. This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit. Although eight of the planetary bodies discovered before 1950 remain \\"planets\\" under the modern definition, some celestial bodies, such as Ceres, Pallas, Juno and Vesta (each an object in the solar asteroid belt), and Pluto (the first trans-Neptunian object discovered), that were once considered planets by the scientific community, are no longer viewed as such. - The Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is a federally funded research and development center and NASA field center located in La Cañada Flintridge, California and Pasadena, California, United States. - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - The Sun is the star at the center of the Solar System. It is a nearly perfect sphere of hot plasma, with internal convective motion that generates a magnetic field via a dynamo process.<ref name=\\"doi10.1146/annurev-astro-081913-040012\\"></ref> It is by far the most important source of energy for life on Earth.

Arizona is one of the Four Corners states. It has borders with New Mexico, Utah, Nevada, California, and Mexico, and one point in common with the southwestern corner of Colorado. Arizona's border with Mexico is 389 miles (626 km) long, on the northern border of the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California. - A comet is an icy small Solar System body that, when passing close to the Sun, warms and begins to evolve gasses, a process called outgassing. This produces a visible atmosphere or coma, and sometimes also a tail. These phenomena are due to the effects of solar radiation and the solar wind acting upon the nucleus of the comet. Comet nuclei range from a few hundred metres to tens of kilometres across and are composed of loose collections of ice, dust, and small rocky particles. The coma may be up to 15 times the Earth's diameter, while the tail may stretch one astronomical unit. If sufficiently bright, a comet may be seen from the Earth without the aid of a telescope and may subtend an arc of 30° (60 Moons) across the sky. Comets have been observed and recorded since ancient times by many cultures. - A robot is a machineespecially one programmable by a computercapable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Robots can be guided by an external control device or the control may be embedded within. Robots may be constructed to take on human form but most robots are machines designed to perform a task with no regard to how they look. - The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA ) is an independent agency of the executive branch of the United States federal government responsible for the civilian space program as well as aeronautics and aerospace research. - Chemistry is a branch of physical science that studies the composition, structure, properties and change of matter. Chemistry includes topics such as the properties of individual atoms, how atoms form chemical bonds to create chemical compounds, the interactions of substances through intermolecular forces that give matter its general properties, and the interactions between substances through chemical reactions to form different substances. - Aeronautics (from the ancient Greek words \\"r\\", which means \\"air\\", and \\"nautik\\" which means \\"navigation\\", i.e. \\"navigation into the air\\") is the science or art involved with the study, design, and manufacturing of air flight capable machines, and the techniques of operating aircraft and rockets within the atmosphere. The British Royal Aeronautical Society identifies the aspects of \\"aeronautical Art, Science and Engineering\\" and \\"the profession of Aeronautics (which expression includes Astronautics).\\" - Aerospace is the human effort in science, engineering and business to fly in the atmosphere of Earth (aeronautics) and surrounding space (astronautics). Aerospace organisations research, design, manufacture, operate, or maintain aircraft and/or spacecraft. Aerospace activity is very diverse, with a multitude of commercial, industrial and military applications. - The Planetary Society is an American internationally active non-governmental, nonprofit foundation. It is involved in research, public outreach, and political advocacy for engineering projects related to astronomy, planetary science, and space exploration. It was founded in 1980 by Carl Sagan, Bruce Murray, and Louis Friedman, and has over 40,000 members from more than one hundred countries around the world. - Carl Edward Sagan (November 9, 1934 December 20, 1996) was an American astronomer, cosmologist, astrophysicist, astrobiologist, author, science popularizer, and science communicator in astronomy and other natural sciences. He is best known for his work as a science popularizer and communicator. His best known scientific contribution is research on extraterrestrial life, including experimental demonstration of the production of amino acids from basic chemicals by radiation. Sagan assembled the first physical messages sent into space: the Pioneer plaque and the Voyager Golden Record, universal messages that could potentially be understood by any extraterrestrial intelligence that might find them. Sagan argued the now accepted hypothesis that the high surface temperatures of Venus can be attributed to and calculated using the greenhouse effect. - In physics, an orbit is the gravitationally curved path of an object around a point in space, for example the orbit of a planet about a star or a natural satellite around a planet. Normally, orbit refers to a regularly repeating path around a body, although it may occasionally be used for a non recurring trajectory or a path around a point in space. To a close approximation, planets and satellites follow elliptical orbits, with the central mass being orbited at a focal point of the ellipse, as described by Kepler's laws of planetary motion. - Sir Arthur Charles Clarke, CBE, FRAS (16 December 1917 19 March 2008) was a British science fiction writer, science writer and futurist, inventor, undersea explorer, and television series host. - A research university is a university that expects all its tenured and tenure-track faculty to continuously engage in research, as opposed to merely requiring it as a condition of an initial appointment or tenure. Such universities can be recognized by their strong focus on innovative research and the prestige of their brand names. On the one hand, research universities strive to recruit faculty who are the most brilliant minds in their disciplines in the world, and their students enjoy the opportunity to learn from such experts. On the other hand, new students are often disappointed to realize their undergraduate courses at research universities are overly academic and fail to provide vocational training with immediate \\"real world\\" applications; but many employers value degrees from research universities because they know that such coursework develops fundamental skills like critical thinking. - Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter (MRO) is a multipurpose spacecraft designed to conduct reconnaissance and exploration of Mars from orbit. The spacecraft was built by Lockheed Martin under the supervision of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL). The mission is managed by the California Institute of Technology, at the JPL, in La Cañada Flintridge, California, for the NASA Science Mission Directorate, Washington, D.C. It was launched August 12, 2005, and attained Martian orbit on March 10, 2006. In November 2006, after five months of aerobraking, it entered its final science orbit and began its primary science phase. As MRO entered orbit, it joined five other active spacecraft that were either in orbit or on the planet's surface: \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\", \\"Mars Express\\", \\"2001 Mars Odyssey\\", and the two Mars Exploration Rovers (\\"Spirit\\" and \\"Opportunity\\"); at the time, this set a record for the most operational spacecraft in the immediate vicinity of Mars. \\"Mars Global Surveyor\\" and the \\"Spirit\\" rover have since ceased to function; the remainder remain operational as of September 2016. - A robotic spacecraft is an uncrewed spacecraft, usually under telerobotic control. A robotic spacecraft designed to make scientific research measurements is often called a space probe. Many space missions are more suited to telerobotic rather than crewed operation, due to lower cost and lower risk factors. In addition, some planetary destinations such as Venus or the vicinity of Jupiter are too hostile for human survival, given current technology. Outer planets such as Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are too distant to reach with current crewed spaceflight technology, so telerobotic probes are the only way to explore them. - Natural science is a branch of science concerned with the description, prediction, and understanding of natural phenomena, based on observational and empirical evidence. Mechanisms such as peer review and repeatability of findings are used to try to ensure the validity of scientific advances. - In physics, a wave is an oscillation accompanied by a transfer of energy that travels through a medium (space or mass). Frequency refers to the addition of time. \\"Wave motion\\" transfers energy from one point to another, which displace particles of the transmission mediumthat is, with little or no associated mass transport. Waves consist, instead, of oscillations or vibrations (of a physical quantity), around almost fixed locations. - 2001 Mars Odyssey is a robotic spacecraft orbiting the planet Mars. The project was developed by NASA, and contracted out to Lockheed Martin, with an expected cost for the entire mission of US297 million. Its mission is to use spectrometers and a thermal imager to detect evidence of past or present water and ice, as well as study the planet's geology and radiation environment. It is hoped that the data Odyssey obtains will help answer the question of whether life has ever existed on Mars and create a risk-assessment of the radiation future astronauts on Mars might experience.

Read this and answer the question The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment. The first journal, the Parisian Journal des Sçavans, appeared in 1665. However, it was not until 1682 that periodicals began to be more widely produced. French and Latin were the dominant languages of publication, but there was also a steady demand for material in German and Dutch. There was generally low demand for English publications on the Continent, which was echoed by England's similar lack of desire for French works. Languages commanding less of an international market – such as Danish, Spanish and Portuguese – found journal success more difficult, and more often than not, a more international language was used instead. French slowly took over Latin's status as the lingua franca of learned circles. This in turn gave precedence to the publishing industry in Holland, where the vast majority of these French language periodicals were produced. During which movement were the first scientific and literary journals established?","completion":"The first scientific and literary journals were established during the Enlightenment movement."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Request donations for things like running your website, using print media, and hosting educational events. You can put a donation area on your website and ask for donations at events to help increase the reach of your campaign. It helps put people's minds at ease if you set up a nonprofit organization. However, you might not be at that stage yet. If you get money from donations, consider doing a mail-out campaign. Once you start making a name for yourself, you can ask to speak at local events. Many companies and organizations are happy to have occasional speakers, so call around to organizations you think would be relevant. That is, know who you're presenting your message to and how they may or may not perceive it. For instance, if you're creating a campaign for better education in local schools, your message to a group of teachers is going to be different than your message to the general public or local officials. Think about each group you're going to be presenting your message to. If you know a group will support you, keep your message brief, such as explaining your main goals and asking for support. Be specific--and creative--about the range of things they can do, looking for what is easy or fulfilling. If your asking them to pass the message on to others, share arguments they can use as well as materials, web-links, etc. If the group you're presenting your message to is neutral or even antagonistic towards your message, you'll need to actually present an argument about why they should support your organization. Ask local experts to speak about your cause, and host the event. Check with local businesses, your local library, your school, or even your company to see if they're willing to host speakers. Since education is one of your primary goals, using experts to speak about the issue can only help. Know that donations will only take you so far. At some point, you're going to have to raise money yourself. Host events that both raise awareness of the cause and raise money. You can draw on your group of supporters to volunteer and run the event. For instance, if you're raising money for education, consider running a lock-in at the school for kids and parents. You could have games, food, and movies. Charge a small fee at the door, and sell tickets for some games and food. You can use all forms of media to promote events. A flier or poster can be used to get people's attention in public places, while social media can help you reach both current and new followers of the campaign. Always ask people to share with their friends, so you can raise awareness with new people.

While other kids ate candy for breakfast, I had to have cereal, eggs or toast. While others had Cokes and candy for lunch, I had to eat a sandwich. As you can guess, my supper was different from the other kids' too. But at least, I wasn't alone in my sufferings. My sister and two brothers had the same mean mother as I did. My mother insisted upon knowing where we were at all times. She had to know who our friends were and where we were going. She insisted if we said we'd be gone an hour, then we should be gone one hour or less -- not one hour and one minute. And she always insisted upon us telling the truth. Now you can see how mean she was. The worst is yet to come. We had to be in bed by nine each night and up at eight the next morning. We couldn't sleep till noon like our friends. So while they slept - my mother actually had the courage to break the Child Labor Law. She made us work. We had to wash dishes, make beds, and learn to cook. We had to wear clean clothes and take a bath every day. The other kids always wore their clothes for days. We reached the height of disgrace because she made our clothes herself, just to save money. I believe she laid awake at night thinking up mean things to do to us. Through the years, things didn't improve a bit. We could not lie in bed \\"sick\\" like our friends did, and miss school. Our marks in school had to live up to expectations. Our friends' report cards had beautiful colors on them, black for passing, red for failing. My mother, being as different as she was, would be satisfied with nothing less than ugly black marks. As the years rolled by, first one and then the other of us was put to shame. We graduated from high school. With our mother behind us, talking, hitting and demanding respect, none of us was allowed the pleasure of being a drop-out. My mother was a complete failure as a mother. Out of four children, a couple of us attained some higher education. None of us have ever been arrested or divorced. Each of my...

Paragraph: In short, the United States has to help defeat an ideology, not just a group of people, and we must do so under difficult circumstances. How can the United States and its friends help moderate Muslims combat the extremist ideas? Recommendation: The U.S. government must define what the message is, what it stands for. We should offer an example of moral leadership in the world, committed to treat people humanely, abide by the rule of law, and be generous and caring to our neighbors. America and Muslim friends can agree on respect for human dignity and opportunity. To Muslim parents, terrorists like Bin Laden have nothing to offer their children but visions of violence and death. America and its friends have a crucial advantage-we can offer these parents a vision that might give their children a better future. If we heed the views of thoughtful leaders in the Arab and Muslim world, a moderate consensus can be found. That vision of the future should stress life over death: individual educational and economic opportunity. This vision includes widespread political participation and contempt for indiscriminate violence. It includes respect for the rule of law, openness in discussing differences, and tolerance for opposing points of view. Recommendation: Where Muslim governments, even those who are friends, do not respect these principles, the United States must stand for a better future. One of the lessons of the long Cold War was that short-term gains in cooperating with the most repressive and brutal governments were too often outweighed by long-term setbacks for America's stature and interests. American foreign policy is part of the message. America's policy choices have consequences. Right or wrong, it is simply a fact that American policy regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and American actions in Iraq are dominant staples of popular commentary across the Arab and Muslim world. That does not mean U.S. choices have been wrong. It means those choices must be integrated with America's message of opportunity to the Arab and Muslim world.

(Photo: Scott Eklund, Red Box Pictures, for USA TODAY) Story Highlights \\"I really, really want this to not be just about what happened to me.\\" On the Kercher family: \\"I've always been afraid of just upsetting them.\\" \\"I had nightmares. I had panic attacks.\\" Excerpts from Amanda Knox's interview with USA TODAY's Susan Page about why she wrote her book, Waiting to be Heard, what could bring her closure and how she's been changed by her sensational murder trial and four years in an Italian prison. On hoping her book will convince readers she is innocent: 'I am living in this world' \\"I am living in this world, and if this world already has a certain prejudice of me and an idea of me, then it's really hard for me to go through it. An example of that is simply how people would confront me in prison. ... Most people came to the prison already thinking they knew who I was, and that changed the way I could ever interact with them. So I want to challenge those sorts of perceptions of me that are incorrect. ... \\"And it does hurt a lot to have people think that that's me and that's what, that's the kind of person I am. It doesn't affect me in the day to day. I haven't had people come up and threaten me or denounce me. But it does affect me — me, and the peace that I have inside. And I think that a lot of people in my family feel like: Don't admit that. Don't admit that because they'll just do it more ... the people who won't give up on the things that the prosecution claims and continues to claim no matter how their theory has fallen apart and imploded upon itself. And so it does affect me. ... \\"I've wanted, really, to share what I think is valuable about the experience and could be helpful to other people in just confronting really difficult situations and the fact of expressing an experience and someone can recognize some form of that inside themselves. I mean, prison is a classic metaphor. It just happened to be literal. ... \\"I really, really want this to not be just about what happened to me, but about what one can do in a bad place. And I'd love for it to open a discussion about some of the problems that surrounded my case — for instance, the idea of a public identity. The idea of trying to find the familiar in the completely unfamiliar. This existential crisis of things happening to you that you don't understand.\\" KNOX: 'I have a life that I want to live' COURTS: Legal case against Amanda Knox not closed WISH LIST: What Amanda Knox wrote in her journal BOOK LIST: Various takes on the Amanda Knox case TIMELINE: Key moments in the case On wanting to visit Meredith's grave: 'I wasn't allowed to grieve' \\"I really hope that the Kerchers (parents of her slain roommate, Meredith) read my book. And they don't have to believe me. I have no right to demand anything of anyone. But I hope they try.\\" (Have you contacted them?) \\"It's really hard. I've always been afraid of just upsetting them. And I feel like as long as there's question of my involvement in Meredith's death, I don't want to impose myself on them. And I really think that, at least from what I've read, that nothing I could say would make them feel better. ... \\"I mean, the ideal situation in my mind is that they could show me Meredith's grave. Because it was like, I wasn't allowed to grieve, either. And that, that would mean a lot to me. But you know what? It's all about what means to them. And if that never happens, then, then that's OK. Because ultimately it's about them. ... \\"This trial (ordered by the Italian Supreme Court last month) has been a barrier to that. It's this, this, this field of barbed wire that I'm having to crawl through so I can finally get to the side where, 'OK, we're finally on the same side!' And I can't hail at them when I'm in the middle of the barbed wire.\\" On considering suicide in prison: 'The thing that I was scared of' \\"I have a great amount of respect for life, and I always think that, no matter how bad situations get, you can always make something out of it. You can always do something that can make you feel good about your life despite what you're going through. So for me to arrive at the mind-set that there was nothing good that could come out of my life and nothing good that I could make of it — because it's not about what you get, it's about what you are able to make of what you get — and so to ever come to that point is really, it's not about an intellectual failing. It's about an emotional failing. \\"Really, like, to get to that point I think you just have to be so, so sad that you don't even want to try. And that is the thing that I was scared of: That I knew that I would know intellectually that there's something to glean out of life but that I would be so broken that I wouldn't care. I just wouldn't want to fight any more. It's not worth it to me. \\"But there's always the fact that I'm not alone. No matter how alone I am in the prison, I have a family to think about. And so I think that it would have to be a really, really, really, really drastic situation for me to go and do that. ... But I did write it down (as a possibility) because it was something that I thought about a lot.\\" Amanda Knox attends an appeal hearing at Perugia's Court of Appeal on Sept. 5, 2011. Her 2009 conviction in her roommate's murder would be overturned the next month. (Photo: FIle photo by Giuseppe Bellini, Getty Images) On adjusting to home: 'I had nightmares' \\"I had nightmares. I had panic attacks. I had all of those. There were times when I'd just be walking down the street and I'd see someone who immediately in my mind triggered what I was afraid of in prison. They might not even look remotely like them, but it's just this this panic, this panic instinct that had been ingrained in me. Or this instinct of, I'm alone. Like, everyone around me is potentially against me and so I'm alone, and so there's this tense survival instinct that is hard to get out of. \\"And indeed my mom, all my friends and ... my family were worried that I was suffering from post-traumatic stress. I kept thinking I was fine. I kept telling myself: 'I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine, I'm fine. It's not too bad. It's just residual thing. it's OK.' \\"They recommended once that I see a counselor. Again, one of those residual reasons why it's so difficult coming back. But I went to this counselor, and he was very nice. Not at all invasive. Just sat back and said, 'Talk to me about anything you want. It doesn't even have to be what you went through. Just talk to me about anything you want.' \\"And I started talking about the here and now, about the things that I went through, just the things that I was struggling with. Like I was disappointing the people I loved because I wasn't the same person anymore. And I worried and I feared that I disappointing them by not coming back quite the same. And in the process of talking about this very hesitantly — it was a very slow thing, and then all of a sudden it just crashed. I crashed in on myself. And I had to stop, and I was weeping uncontrollably and I just had to leave. I just felt that I was trapped, and I just had to leave, and I called my boyfriend. He picked me up. And then I went home and cried a lot. ... And I never went back.\\" On becoming a different person: 'A gravity to everything' \\"So I went to Perugia very carefree, hopeful, and also, I needed to gain a sense of self-confidence in myself, because I was still young and I was still figuring out who I was and what I wanted to do with my life. So that was something that very much characterized me and my personality at the time. So I'm a little unsure about everything. I'm just a kid who's, who's, who's doing the best I can. \\"And coming out of it, I'd say I've gained that sense of confidence in myself that I hadn't had before. I've gained a seriousness that has to do with a certain perspective, a gratitude for being able to see the importance of things. And that lends itself a gravity to everything. And that is something that I sort of carry as a weight but a good weight inside of me. \\"And I guess the only thing that maybe is not as great, I'm much more timid than before about being around people. If only before, believe it or not, the one thing I wasn't self-conscious about was being around people and feeling good about being around people, and 'Who are you; who are you?' And 'I am me, I am me.' And now I'm much more self-conscious when I'm around people, because there's the factor that maybe they know who I am. But more than that I know what it is to have been judged, and how devastating that is. And that has sort of stuck with me in a way that I wouldn't like it to. I'd like to be able to be a little looser, if I could. But I'm still a little tense. And I hope that that will relieve itself in time. And it definitely has gotten better over this year and a half that I've been back. Because when I got back, in the immediacy I really struggled. \\"I wasn't used to talking to anyone for more than an hour at a time, twice a week. And it was just very hard for me to relate to people because I was so used to being trapped inside. So this sort of slow creeping out from that — I feel like I'm a snail that has really retreated back in that (shell), so slowly coming back out.\\" On returning to Italy for the retrial: 'I'm thinking about a lot' \\"My lawyers have said that I don't have to and that I don't need to. I'm still considering it, to be honest. My family is like, No! Tina (Andreadis, her book publicist) is like, No! But I've thought about it, because it's not like I feel I'm far away from it. And so I could — I'd go back just to show that it means something to me. \\"But that's something I really have to think very hard about. So I can't say for sure if I am or I'm not. But it is something that I'm thinking about a lot. And it's scary, the thought. But it's also important for me to say, this is not just happening far away from me and doesn't matter to me. So somehow I feel it's important for me to convey that. And if my presence is what is necessary to convey that, then I'll go. But I want to see what that involves. ... \\"If that were a huge risk, then I wouldn't. I'm not that proud, and I'm not that brave.\\" At home in a coffee shop in Seattle, Knox knows there are those who will never believe she is innocent, including her former roommate's family. (Photo: Scott Eklund, Red Box Pictures, for USA TODAY) On learning about the media frenzy that had surrounded her case: 'I didn't know' \\"So there were photographers (at the court hearings). And there was my family, the media things they were doing. And there was the very fact that I was in the media affected the way that people in prison treated me. And there was all that and yet I had no idea what extent it could be. Because it's an experience that is completely foreign to me. It's not like I ever got any attention from the media in my life beforehand, so I didn't have anything to compare it to. . . . \\"The media is an incredibly powerful network and a machine that just chugs and there are so many different elements of it and so many different levels of it, and I had no idea. I had no idea about the media. I didn't know enough about the media to conceive what it would be like. And so, to this day, I'd say I don't even have a full understanding of the media and how it's played – like what every aspect of the media has done. There are always things that surprise me. . . . \\"No, I didn't know, and I did not expect the helicopters when I got back home to the airport and I did not expect the paparazzi who were ferociously chasing us through red lights and snapping pictures in our faces going: 'I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry' – and no, you're really not sorry. If you were you would stop doing it. \\"So it's this huge thing that is so powerful and I'm only learning now really how big it is and what it is. Because as I was writing my book I was focused on that and I didn't want to be influenced by other things. I really wanted to be true to what I had experienced before. And I was so, so careful. And I also just couldn't deal with it for the longest time. I just couldn't. I couldn't watch things that were about me and my case, I just couldn't. I just couldn't. But now I'm able to.\\" On coping: 'I was lost' \\"One of the things that I somewhat realized, especially right after I was convicted, was that sometimes really, really horrible things happen for no reason. . . I'm not Nelson Mandela. I'm not a Holocuast survivor or non-survivor. I'm not. But sometimes bad things really do just happen, and people are wrong about things, and that is so true about humanity, and for that reason — I was sad about it. I was angry about it. I was desperate. I was lost — like I didn't know how to understand that that could be me, that I could be a small, small speck in that spectrum of, like, crap. . . . \\"It's still this struggle that I cry about and I get angry about when I'm alone, and that is frustrating and that's incomprehensible in a lot of ways. But at the moment, being angry about it and being sad about it, again, doesn't help me. So I have to really just try to be patient enough to work my way through it.\\" ||||| In a medieval college town in Italy, two young women, Meredith Kercher and Amanda Knox, arrived for a year abroad, seeking new horizons.

A pity, because thanks to that person he reached his current status and number 67 on the list of the wealthiest Poles. Back then, during that beautiful, rusty white Christmas Eve night, Przekosniak, who was rudely kicked out from a social network for utopian fanatics of extreme phobias (www.ilovefobia.pl) just a few days earlier, got an idea. It was a quite good idea too, and the next SMS (\\"All at cart by unintentionally only honest lamb\\") convinced him it was the best idea of his life. Slawek Przekosniak, together with a friend from ilovefobia.pl - Czesiek Ciag, decided to set up an on-line service, through which one could send SMS greetings to mobile phones. And the most important feature of the service was that texts of the wishes were not going to be predetermined and there would be no set list of pre-selected options. Messages would be created by a special software program from random words provided by a customer. Such a system would allow for truly unique greetings, and after all, nobody said they had to be comprehensible. Czesiek took care of the development of the software, which for now they named \\"John of the Disc\\". Czesiek had suitable experience in the matter. While on the forum for (select as appropriate) phobics he designed an application, which created slogans for street protests. The application, even though it produced phrases completely illogical and nonsensical, became quite popular, and some of its most unique catchphrases you could have seen on TV - \\"Out With There Harm Out!\\" or \\"To Them Bag Away Now Now!\\" Two future men of success got to work and the SMS greeting portal bestbestbest.pl went live just before Easter.

They were fascinated by the subject and learned a lot. Team A studied Earth, team B studied planet Venus. Hint: Clouds on Earth are made of water vapor. Venus's clouds are a lot less pleasant. They are made of carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide and large amounts of corrosive sulfuric acid! The atmosphere of Venus is so thick that the pressure on the surface of Venus is very high. In fact, it is 90 times greater than the pressure at Earth’s surface! The thick atmosphere causes a strong greenhouse effect. As a result, Venus is the hottest planet.

Plot title: The Lake House Movie plot: Kate Forster is a Doctor in 2006, living alone in Chicago. She has moved into an apartment after living in a house built next to a scenic lake in a secluded countryside area. She writes a letter to the next tenant asking that they forward any mail, and that the paw prints and the box in the attic have always been there. The tenant Alex Wyler reads the letter, but finds no paw prints, no box and no sign of life within the last 5 years, so disregards the letter until a few days later when he is redoing the paint on the handrails and a stray dog, whom Alex takes in and names Jack although the dog is female, trots through the brown paint and leaves its paw prints all the way to the front door. He writes to Kate asking more about these incidents and leaves the letter in the mail box.On Valentine's Day 2006, Kate visits the Lake House after having a gentleman die in her arms after being hit by a bus, but finds the Mail Box Flag is up. She reads Alex's letter and states her current address, also stating it is 2006, not 2004 from which Alex's letter arrives from.

The premise is: \\"The pretty hillside town of Villefranche-sur-Mer is a good base for exploring the area, particularly for families with children.\\" The hypothesis is: \\"There are many museums and performances specifically for little kids in Villefranche-sur-Mer.\\" Step 2: Examine the premise and its relation to the hypothesis. The premise tells us that Villefranche-sur-Mer is a town suitable for families with children to explore the area. It is important to consider what factors may make a location suitable for families with children. Step 3: Analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis. While the suitability of a location for families with children may include factors like safety and comfort, it doesn't necessarily mean there are many museums and performances specifically for little kids. A town being a good base for exploring the surrounding area could be attributed to factors such as its central location, easy transportation, affordability, or various family-friendly activities and amenities. Step 4: Conclusion. The premise \\"The pretty hillside town of Villefranche-sur-Mer is a good base for exploring the area, particularly for families with children,\\" does not entail the hypothesis \\"There are many museums and performances specifically for little kids in Villefranche-sur-Mer.\\" It is possible that the town is an excellent base for families with children for various reasons, but that doesn't guarantee the presence of many museums and performances specifically designed for little kids."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey","completion":"The phrase 's kind of sad that so many people put so much time and energy into this turkey' would generally be considered negative in sentiment. This interpretation is based on a few key points: 1. The use of \\"sad\\": The word \\"sad\\" usually conveys a negative emotion, signaling something unfortunate or disappointing. In this phrase, the speaker expresses that it is sad how much effort people put into the subject of discussion. 2. \\"So many people\\": This phrase implies that the issue being discussed is widespread and applies to a large number of people, contributing to a sense of negativity due to the collective effort being expended. 3. \\"So much time and energy\\": This part of the phrase highlights the considerable amount of effort devoted to the subject. Indicating that this is an issue worth analyzing because of its impact on people's time and energy. 4. \\"This turkey\\": The term \\"turkey\\" in this context is used informally as slang to refer to something that is thought to be a failure, unsuccessful, or of poor quality. Calling the subject a turkey showcases the speaker's negative opinion of it. Putting all the components together, the phrase communicates that the speaker finds it regretful that a large number of people have invested a significant amount of time and energy into something they consider to be a failure or of low quality.

O'Donnell also stressed that the soundtrack would not be released at or near the release date of the game on September 25, 2007. The soundtrack was officially announced on October 17, 2007. The score to the game was used extensively for marketing purposes, even before the release of the game. The first piece heard was entitled \\"Finish the Fight\\", and was used in the announcement trailer for Halo 3 at Electronic Entertainment Expo 2006. This piece was accented with O'Donnell's well-known Halo theme, which now included a trumpet fanfare and heavy brass section; O'Donnell stated \\"I want the viewer to have a feeling of anticipation and wonder for the first fifty seconds or so, up until Master Chief is revealed and they realize that it's Cortana trying to tell them something.\\" The track opens with a piano section written by Matt Daspit, uncharacteristic for the series at that point; O'Donnell suspected \\"no [other announcement at E3] would start with a piano\\", thus grabbing attention. O'Donnell designed the opening to lull the listener into a sense of suspense, then wonder; \\"I want them to feel pride and longing the moment Master Chief walks out of the smoke.\\" he said. \\"I want them to be left with that, 'I can hardly wait to play this game' feeling\\". Another reworked theme from Halo was used as the background music for the Halo 3 E3 2007 trailer; O'Donnell later offered this track for free online.In addition to the music composed by O'Donnell and Salvatori, the announcement of the Halo 3 Soundtrack was followed with a call for entries to all artists or bands to submit their own original song to be included on the final CD.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"If the price of oil increases, it may lead to multiple direct and indirect effects on the process mentioned. Here's how it could potentially affect the process: 1. Oil gathering and mining operations: An increase in the price of oil may encourage more companies to invest in oil exploration and extraction, leading to a potential increase in available oil. However, this might not be guaranteed, as factors like operational costs, regulations, and available resources also play a significant role in oil production. 2. Transport to stores: Higher oil prices may result in increased transportation costs (as fuel prices can be linked to oil prices), which in turn could affect the supply chain and overall pricing of oil to the end consumer. 3. Oil purchasing by homeowners: If oil prices continue to rise, homeowners might consider alternative heating options (like natural gas or electric heating systems) or becoming more energy-efficient to reduce their dependency on oil. This could lead to a decrease in demand for oil. 4. Oil usage in the house: Higher oil prices may lead to more conservative use of oil in households, with homeowners potentially using less oil or using it more efficiently to keep their heating costs under control. 5. Warm air distribution: The efficiency of the heat distribution process within the house may not be directly impacted by the higher oil prices, but indirectly, homeowners could invest in better insulation or heating systems to reduce oil consumption. In summary, the perturbation of increased oil prices can have both direct and indirect effects on the process of using oil for heating at home. It may potentially increase the oil availability by encouraging more oil production, but it will also likely lead to a decrease in demand as homeowners search for alternative heating options or ways to use oil more efficiently. This effect on the demand could ultimately impact the overall oil consumption and process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Write an article based on this \\"Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone says he loves Indian cinema for \\"being able to switch between comedy, romance and tragedy at the same time\\".\\"","completion":"Title: The Magic of Indian Cinema: Exploring Versatility through Oliver Stone's Perspective Introduction Indian cinema, known for its colorful aspects and versatility, has long been recognized as a powerhouse of entertainment, stories, culture, and tradition. Many aspects of this vibrant industry continue to captivate audiences worldwide, one of them being its ability to effortlessly juggle between comedy, romance, and tragedy. In a recent statement, Oscar-winning director Oliver Stone expressed his affection for the Indian cinema, praising its ability to transition between contrasting themes simultaneously. Stone, known for his thought-provoking movies such as \\"Platoon,\\" \\"Born on the Fourth of July,\\" and \\"Wall Street,\\" applauds the ability of Indian movies to seamlessly thread together various storylines and emotional arcs. In this article, we will delve into why the Indian film industry excels in this particular aspect and how it has managed to create its unique identity on the global stage. The Roots of Indian Cinema's Versatility As the birthplace of cinema legends like Satyajit Ray, Guru Dutt, and Raj Kapoor, Indian cinema's foundation is rooted in the works of many visionary directors who have contributed to its growth and evolution. Their vision was to celebrate the myriad shades of human emotions, from humor, joy, and love to sadness, sorrow, and despair. Indian cinema is reflective of the diversity and intricacies of the Indian culture. The country's rich heritage and history have also shaped its storytelling mechanisms, embracing mythology, folklore, and epics to create cinematic masterpieces, transcending the boundaries of time and genres. This intrinsic connection between history, culture, and storytelling makes Indian cinema more than just entertainment; it's a representation of the Indian ethos. The Art of Emotional Storytelling One of the most striking aspects of Indian cinema is its ability to immerse viewers into an emotional, often melodramatic journey that stays with them long after the movie has ended. This is made possible by seamlessly transitioning between genres, particularly comedy, romance, and tragedy, which helps the audience identify as well as empathize with the characters. Indian filmmakers and writers weave emotions into a tapestry of interconnected lives and events, making for compelling narratives that resonate with diverse audiences. Moreover, the subtleness and poise of situational comedy in Indian movies are utterly relatable, endearing viewers of different backgrounds to the films. Music as the Binding Force In Indian cinema, music plays an integral role in expressing the emotions and themes of a movie. With powerful scores, lyrical depth, and soulful melodies, it is not uncommon for music to guide the transition between genres. Indian filmmakers rely on music and dance to build a bridge between joy and sorrow, allowing viewers to delve into the protagonist's world. Iconic songs from classic Indian movies, like the ones in \\"Mughal-e-Azam\\" and \\"Sholay,\\" have left an everlasting impact on popular culture and continue to be celebrated as magnificent pieces of art. Undoubtedly, music remains an essential key that unlocks the charm of Indian cinema. Finding a Global Audience Given the versatility and emotional depth that Indian movies offer, it's no surprise that the global arena has also embraced the enchanting world of Bollywood and regional cinema.

In Santa Monica, California, a pair of Mormon missionaries—by-the-book Elder Farrell, and his soon-to-leave companion, Elder Lozano (Ignacio Serricchio)—proselytize until they are caught between a gang drive-by shooting targeting nearby thugs. The shootout kills one thug and wounds another, Carl, whom Elder Lozano saves. After being released from the hospital, Carl tracks down the two missionaries, thanking Lozano for saving his life, who gives Carl a Book of Mormon. Later, the missionaries notice an unconscious street preacher lying behind a Dumpster. Despite Farrell's hesitation, the missionaries bring the man—later identified as Louis (Jo-sei Ikeda)—to rest in their apartment. Meanwhile, Carl, who has been reading the Bible and Book of Mormon, is eager to be baptized and begins taking lessons from the missionaries. While they do so, the missionaries ask their next-door neighbor, Holly, to check on the homeless preacher in their home. Upon their return, they have dinner with Holly and Louis and continue to do so for a few days. In this time, the missionaries learn that Louis once was a preacher who lost his congregation due to alcoholism and that Holly—a struggling actress—acted in a few adult movies, her parents back home discovering and cutting off contact with her as a result.

How to prevent frostbite Check the weather before you go out. Take time to look at the weather forecast and decide what you need to wear today. Preventing frostbite is all about being as prepared as possible.","completion":"Step 1: Choose the appropriate clothing Based on the weather forecast, select clothing that will adequately protect you from the cold. Ensure that your clothing is made of insulating materials like wool or fleece, and is water-resistant to keep you dry. Dress in layers to trap body heat and allow for better temperature regulation. Step 2: Protect your extremities Frostbite most commonly affects fingers, toes, ears, and nose. Wear gloves or mittens to protect your hands and consider using hand warmers for added warmth. Select warm, insulated, and waterproof footwear to keep your feet warm and dry. Wear a hat that covers your ears, or opt for earmuffs, and use a neck gaiter or scarf to cover your face. Step 3: Avoid tight clothing Make sure your clothing isn't too tight, as this can restrict blood flow and increase the risk of frostbite. Looser clothing allows for better circulation, which helps to keep extremities warm. Step 4: Stay dry Wet skin and clothing can increase the risk of frostbite. Make sure to wear moisture-wicking base layers and waterproof outer layers. If you begin to sweat, remove layers to avoid getting wet, and replace wet clothing with dry items as soon as possible. Step 5: Limit exposure to cold temperatures and wind Stay indoors or limit your time outside during extreme cold weather or when wind chill is significant. Wind can lower the temperature further and increase the risk of frostbite. Step 6: Stay physically active Keep your body moving to generate warmth and promote blood circulation when outside in cold temperatures. Avoid remaining stationary for long periods. Step 7: Know the signs of frostbite Familiarize yourself with the symptoms of frostbite, such as numbness, pale or grayish skin, and a cold or prickly feeling. If you notice these signs, seek warmth and medical attention immediately. Step 8: Plan for emergencies Carry a frostbite prevention kit when venturing outdoors for extended periods, including extra clothing layers, dry socks, hand and foot warmers, and a warm drink for hydration. Keep a charged cell phone with you in case of emergencies.

Hillary Clinton and the 2016 Democrats: Mostly Liberal, Together Among seven potential Democratic presidential contenders, Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming favorite — and the third-most liberal candidate. How the other candidates are arrayed on an ideological spectrum could make her run for the White House easier than the last time out. In some ways, the cast of candidates for 2016 resembles the group from the 2008 race, with a field of stalwartly liberal politicians. Mrs. Clinton was slightly more liberal in 2008 than now, according to Crowdpac, which scores politicians on a left-right scale of -10 to 10. (Crowdpac bases this mainly on campaign contributions, but also on votes and speeches.) Her problem was that Barack Obama, who was further to the left of her — at -7.8 to her -6.9 — also had the donors who were to the left of her. He ran a better campaign, particularly in Iowa, and benefited from a surge in money from small-dollar donors. This time, Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts (-8.2) and Bernie Sanders (-8.3), Vermont’s independent senator, are to her left. Ms. Warren has the higher fund-raising profile of the two, with a leadership PAC that raised more than 2 million during the 2014 election cycle. But she and Mrs. Clinton (and to a lesser extent Mr. Sanders) would be competing for a similar pool of donors. During her 2012 Senate race, Ms. Warren raised more than 3.4 million from individuals who also gave to Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign, Federal Election Commission data shows. Crowdpac ideological scores for potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates. Crowdpac ideological scores for potential 2016 Democratic presidential candidates. The field of potential Democratic presidential candidates is ideologically cohesive. While there is room to the left of Mrs. Clinton’s Crowdpac score of -6.4, there is not a lot. The lack of distance between the Democratic hopefuls suggests that creating a wedge between someone like Ms. Warren and Mrs. Clinton would be harder among Democratic donors, and perhaps among the broader primary electorate. There are few issues where the gap between those two is significant. Gun control policy and immigration are possible points of contention, according to Crowdpac, which also generates scores for issues. On both issues, Ms. Warren is scored as much more liberal than Mrs. Clinton. The situation is different for Republicans, with considerable space available to the right of Jeb Bush (4.2) — and a lot of candidates to vie for it. There is more room to the right of Mrs. Clinton. Most of the other potential candidates fit there, including Vice President Joe Biden, who has a -4.4 score, and Jim Webb, the former Virginia senator, who is at -5.3. Those two resemble the more centrist Democratic candidates that won the nomination in previous elections. Al Gore, for instance, had a Crowdpac score of -5.1 in 2000. Bill Clinton rated a -4.45 in 1996. Crowdpac scores for Democratic presidential candidates in 2008. Crowdpac scores for Democratic presidential candidates in 2008. Mr. Obama is the most liberal Democrat elected to the presidency in the period Crowdpac has analyzed, which began in 1980. Mr. Obama was able to broaden his pool of donors beyond what earlier Democratic primary candidates managed. Donors likely to support Democratic candidates will include moderates and some conservatives, but as the party has shifted left, its donors have gone with it. Mrs. Clinton benefits from that shift even as she stands quite a distance from her husband on the ideological spectrum. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"1. Hillary Clinton is the third-most liberal Democratic presidential contender according to Crowdpac ideological scores. 2. Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are considered more liberal than Clinton. 3. The 2016 Democratic candidates, including Clinton, are quite ideologically cohesive, making it harder to create a wedge between them and their donor base. 4. Few significant gaps exist between Clinton and her Democratic rivals on key issues such as gun control and immigration. 5. Republicans have more room ideologically to the right of Jeb Bush, with many candidates competing for that space. 6.

Article: When thirty-two-year-old tennis player Andre Agassi made to the final of the U.S. Clay Court Championship in April 2003, he set a new world record: he became the oldest player ever to be number one in the world's tennis rankings. It was one of the greatest achievements in Agassi's long and successful career. Andre Agassi turned professional in 1986 at the age of sixteen. His career soon took off, and in 1990, Agassi was famous around the world, though never having won an important tennis championship. Many people thought he was famous more for his long blond hair and colorful tennis shirts than for his tennis skills. They wondered if he could really win an important tournament. In 1992, Agassi proved _ wrong by winning one of the greatest prizes in world tennis--the Wimbledon singles final. His first attempt to win this tournament had been in 1987, but he lost his opening game. He then refused to take part in Wimbledon for the next three years. He said his reason for not playing was that the officials refused to allow him to wear his colorful shirts, but some people said it was because he was afraid to lose. After several more championship victories, Agassi's luck began to run out. By 1997, the year of his marriage to a movie actress--- Brooke Shields, Agassi's ranking had dropped to 141stin the world. Many people thought his career was over. Agassi and Shields divorced two years later, and Agassi made a comeback with a new trainer, a new hairstyle, and new determination. In 1999, he won both the French Open and the U.S. Open and ended the year back as the world's number one. By 2003, he had earned more than 27 million in prize money, making him one of the most successful tennis players of all times. Question: How old was Agassi when he won his first championship? Yes or no, is the answer \\"twenty-two\\"?","completion":"Andre Agassi won his first important tennis championship in 1992 when he claimed the Wimbledon singles title.

The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google does not provide the correct information about the number of whales in the world. Instead, it talks about the Welsh national sporting teams and the colors of their uniforms. To provide you with a detailed and long answer, let's discuss the topic of whale populations. Whales, which belong to the order Cetacea, are divided into two main groups: Baleen whales (Mysticeti) and Toothed whales (Odontoceti). The estimated global populations of each species is difficult to determine precisely, as many factors such as migration patterns, human impacts, and changing ecosystems affect their numbers over time. In general, it is estimated that there are around 1.5 million individual whales worldwide, distributed across different species. The most abundant species is the Antarctic Krill-eating Minke whale, with an estimated population of 515,000. Other abundant species include: 1. Common Dolphin: Approximately 500,000 – 3,000,000 individuals 2. Humpback Whale: An estimated population of 80,000 – 100,000 3. Blue Whale: Around 10,000 – 25,000 individuals 4. Orca (Killer Whale): A population of around 50,000 5. Sperm Whale: An estimated 300,000 – 450,000 individuals It is important to note that several whale species, such as the North Atlantic Right Whale, are considered endangered or critically endangered, with populations of only a few hundred individuals. The numbers provided are estimates based on research, and may not be completely accurate due to various factors that are difficult to measure. However, the primary take-away is that the answer you found on Google is incorrect and not related to whale populations. In summary, there are around 1.5 million whales in the world, spread across various species. Many species face challenges such as habitat loss, climate change, and hunting, which impact their populations to different extents. The correct approach to understand the number of whales in the world would be to account for different species and their populations separately."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

After an April 21, 1995, court hearing on the gun charges, but before McVeigh's release, federal agents took him into custody as they continued their investigation into the bombing. Rather than talk to investigators about the bombing, McVeigh demanded an attorney. Having been tipped off by the arrival of police and helicopters that a bombing suspect was inside, a restless crowd began to gather outside the jail. While McVeigh's requests for a bulletproof vest or transport by helicopter were denied, authorities did use a helicopter to transport him from Perry to Oklahoma City.Federal agents obtained a warrant to search the house of McVeigh's father, Bill, after which they broke down the door and wired the house and telephone with listening devices. FBI investigators used the resulting information gained, along with the fake address McVeigh had been using, to begin their search for the Nichols brothers, Terry and James. On April 21, 1995, Terry Nichols learned that he was being hunted, and turned himself in. Investigators discovered incriminating evidence at his home: ammonium nitrate and blasting caps, the electric drill used to drill out the locks at the quarry, books on bomb-making, a copy of Hunter (a 1989 novel by William Luther Pierce, the founder and chairman of the National Alliance, a white nationalist group) and a hand-drawn map of downtown Oklahoma City, on which the Murrah Building and the spot where McVeigh's getaway car was hidden were marked.

Context: It's often difficult to remember how or why you became friends with someone, especially if you've been friends with a person forever. But because of the very specific set of circumstances, I remember exactly how Barend and I became friends. This, of course, was long before he became famous for inventing the easy-foldable map, and infamous for the series of bodies he'd decided to bury in his backyard. Barend and I became friends because he had one of the most attractive shadows I'd ever seen. I remember gazing out over the playground, watching a waning sun scatter its dying light over the monkey bars, the metal skeleton contrasting against the turquoise sky, when I noticed this kid coming toward me. He was one of those mostly invisible characters; faded jeans, dirty jacket, snot caked on his upper lip. I probably wouldn't have noticed him if not for his shadow. For some reason, his shadow immediately caught my eye. Now, I'm not one for noticing shadows in general, never really noticed a shadow before or since, but this kid had the most incredible shadow I'd ever seen. I cannot even put in words what that means. What specific set of properties make an ordinary shadow into an incredible one, I'm not sure anyone can, but his shadow was like a piece of art; I didn't necessarily understand it, but I liked it. And that's why this boring looking kid and I first became friends. Our kindergarten games were harmless and boring, but when puberty hit, Barend began to change. We were both expected to change, but I guess some kids just change more than others. Bared didn't want to kill at first. Like many overachievers in the death game, his first brush with the craft came about more or less accidentally. All the elements had been in place, with all the players and attributes coming together as if gathered by some evil force, but, even then, I really had to push the kid.

If right i've also always thought about the idea you know most sports you know which are the N R A and people have their thing you know if you ban guns you're just banning the the recreation the sport of hunting things of that nature most of that's done with rifles and such uh though there's you know probably i'm sure some sector that does it with handguns but just by the mere fact of outlawing handguns would make it so that it would be not as conspicuous you couldn't be inconspicuous when you walked into a store stuff like that you could see someone coming or dressed inappropriately, can we conclude that \\"I don't think it would have a major impact on crime, though.\\"?","completion":"To analyze this statement, I will break it down into several components: 1. People enjoy recreational activities and sports that involve the use of firearms, such as hunting. 2. Banning guns would negatively impact these recreational activities. 3. Most of these activities are done using rifles rather than handguns. 4. Outlawing handguns would make it harder for individuals to be inconspicuous when attempting a crime. 5. The goal is to determine if we can conclude \\"I don't think it would have a major impact on crime, though.\\" Step 1: Understand the premises The first three components are based on the notion that the use of guns in recreational activities should not be impacted by efforts to restrict firearms for the sake of crime prevention. These points are generally accepted and don't need additional analysis for the purpose of crime impact evaluation. Step 2: Evaluate the impact of outlawing handguns on crime The fourth component highlights that outlawing handguns may make it more difficult for people to carry out crimes inconspicuously. This could be true, as someone attempting to use a larger firearm like a rifle is more likely to be noticed. Step 3: Assess the overall impact on crime To determine if outlawing handguns would have a major impact on crime, we must consider a few factors, such as: a. The proportion of handgun-related crimes compared to total crimes: If a large proportion of crimes involves handguns, outlawing them could have a more significant effect on reducing crime rates. b. The substitution effect: Would potential criminals simply switch to other weapons or methods of carrying out their crimes if handguns were no longer available? c. The potential for increased black market activity: Outlawing handguns may lead to a rise in black market sales, which might not significantly reduce the availability of handguns for criminal use. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the available information, we cannot definitively conclude that \\"I don't think it would have a major impact on crime, though.\\" As our analysis depends on various factors, more evidence and research may be needed to make a data-supported assertion about the overall impact of outlawing handguns on crime rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The offenses struggled in the first quarter, and the first points would actually come via special teams in the second quarter, when Ted Ginn Jr. returned a punt 87 yards to paydirt for Miami. Later in the quarter, McNabb, who had already thrown two interceptions, was hit as he threw, spraining his ankle. David Akers came on to make a 34-yard field goal, and McNabb left the game. A. J. Feeley was spun up to play quarterback, but threw an interception of his own on his first drive. In the third quarter, Correll Buckhalter took the ball in from eight yards out for the go-ahead touchdown, making it 10-7.

Ironically, China’s wind resource is much stronger in winter, which makes the grid-access problem even more frustrating for the wind industry. Make this lower case","completion":"Ironically, china's wind resource is much stronger in winter, which makes the grid-access problem even more frustrating for the wind industry. In countries like China, where the demand for renewable energy is consistently on the rise, wind power plays a crucial role in supplementing the country's energy needs. Although the potential of wind power in China is vast, the capacity of the existing power grid to integrate wind energy is a significant challenge. During the winter months, the situation gets worse due to the grid-access problems experienced by the wind industry. Wind power's strength in China during the winter months can be attributed to a combination of meteorological and geographical factors, such as variations in temperature and pressure, as well as the distribution of snow and ice. As a result, the potential for wind energy generation is greater during these colder months. However, this seasonal resource advantage is hindered by the obstacles faced during grid integration, frustrating the industry's efforts to harness the full potential of wind power. In addressing these grid access issues, the Chinese government has implemented measures to improve grid infrastructure and facilitate a more seamless integration of renewable energy resources, including wind power. Some of these initiatives include the upgrades of power grid infrastructure, enhancement of the energy storage systems, and technological advancements in wind turbine efficiency. Nevertheless, overcoming these challenges, both in the short- and long-term, requires a multifaceted approach. Here are some suggested strategies to improve the grid access situation for China's wind industry: 1. Upgrade and expand existing grid infrastructure: Enhancing China's energy grid can improve the efficiency of wind energy integration and transportation. More robust and extensive networks can be better utilized to manage and distribute the increased wind energy generated during the winter months. 2. Innovate and invest in energy storage technologies: Energy storage solutions, such as batteries, pumped hydro storage, and flywheels, can hold excess wind energy generated during times of high wind power potential. These solutions can alleviate grid access issues by providing a buffer between energy production and demand, allowing for greater flexibility and reliability. 3. Implement flexible energy markets and pricing mechanisms: Encouraging flexible and dynamic power pricing can incentivize efficient power generation and reduce grid congestion. By allowing for variable energy pricing based on supply and demand, wind power can be more easily integrated into the grid system, thus fostering a more competitive market. 4. Strengthen collaboration with neighboring countries: Developing stronger international connections can bolster China's domestic grid system by allowing for the cross-border trading of renewable energy resources. Sharing and trading excess wind energy with neighboring countries can alleviate grid-access issues and create a more efficient, interconnected regional power network. 5. Promote research and development: Continued investment in research and development can yield technological advancements in both wind power and grid infrastructure. Innovations bolster the efficiency, reliability, and capacity of the grid, resulting in improved access for wind energy during peak times. In conclusion, addressing the grid-access problem during China’s winter months is essential for harnessing its vast wind resource potential. Through a combination of infrastructure upgrades, technological advancements, and policy reforms, the Chinese wind industry can overcome these challenges and effectively contribute to the country's ambitious renewable energy goals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a question about the following article: The Bengals began Round 1 of 2006's Battle of Ohio in the Week 2 home-opener against the Cleveland Browns. Cincinnati scored first on a 22-yard TD pass to wide receiver Kelley Washington from Carson Palmer. The Browns responded with a 30-yard FG by kicker Phil Dawson. The Bengals extended their lead with an 8-yard TD pass to wide receiver Chad Johnson. In the second quarter, kicker Shayne Graham made a 37-yard field goal as time ran out to give Cincinnati a 17-3 halftime lead. In the fourth quarter, Graham would give the Bengals a 37-yard field goal, and the Browns responded with a 1-yard touchdown run by running back Reuben Droughns. Two touchdown runs by Bengal running back Rudi Johnson put the game out of reach. The Browns scored one more touchdown with quarterback Charlie Frye's 2-yard run, but it was not enough as the Bengals improved to 2-0. Several Bengals were injured during this game. David Pollack, a 2nd year linebacker, suffered a non-paralyzing broken neck (fracturing his C6 vertebra), and would miss the rest of the season. Safety Dexter Jackson suffered a severe ankle sprain. Center Rich Braham also suffered a leg injury, and was expected to be out for some weeks. Wide receiver, Chad Johnson appeared dinged up too. On his 8-yard touchdown reception, he appeared to have an injured shoulder (made noticeable by his unenthusiastic post-score celebratory dance). Even though he continued to play, he appeared to be in pain. Later in the game, during a Browns interception, he was blocked by a Brown's safety, which gave him a concussion.

He played college baseball at Louisiana Tech University. Can we draw the following conclusion? Kansas City Royals are a great baseball team","completion":"In order to draw the conclusion that the Kansas City Royals are a great baseball team based on the information provided, we need to analyze the relevant data step-by-step. Step 1: Consider the player's performance The given information tells us that Randall Kent McGilberry is a former Major League Baseball (MLB) pitcher who played for two seasons, including three games in the 1977 season and 18 games in the 1978 season. However, we don't have any information about how well he performed during those games. Step 2: Consider the team's performance Although we know that McGilberry played for the Kansas City Royals, we don't have any information about how well the team performed during those seasons or how they compare to other MLB teams. Step 3: Analyze historical performance Even if we had information about the success of the Kansas City Royals during the 1977 and 1978 seasons, this would only represent a specific period in the team's history. To accurately assess if the Royals are a great baseball team, we would need to analyze their performance over an extended period and compare it to other teams in the league. Step 4: Consider other factors \\"Evaluation of greatness\\" for a baseball team may involve several factors. These factors can include, among others, the number of championships won, the consistency of their winning record, and the overall contribution of their players (e.g., players inducted into the Hall of Fame). Conclusion: Based on the information provided, which only discusses one player's involvement with the Kansas City Royals during two seasons, we cannot draw the conclusion that the Kansas City Royals are a great baseball team. A more comprehensive analysis of the team's overall performance and other factors would be required to determine their greatness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

In this translation: - \\"Mi gratitud\\" means \\"my gratitude\\". - \\"es infinita\\" means \\"is boundless\\" or \\"is endless\\". - \\"por todo lo que\\" means \\"for all that\\". - \\"Él me da\\" means \\"He gives me\\". In Spanish, the pronoun \\"Él\\" is capitalized when referring to God, just as \\"He\\" is in English. - \\"y\\" means \\"and\\". - \\"se lo demuestro\\" means \\"I show Him\\". The pronouns \\"se\\" and \\"lo\\" are used to respectively indicate the recipient (to Him) and the thing being shown (the gratitude) in a more appropriate way in Spanish. - \\"de mil maneras\\" means \\"in a thousand ways\\". So the sentence \\"Mi gratitud es infinita por todo lo que Él me da, y se lo demuestro de mil maneras.\\" captures the intended meaning of \\"My gratitude is boundless for all that He gives me, and I show Him in a thousand ways.\\" in Spanish."},{"prompt":"Q:I can use this background: When soil is flooded, hypoxia develops, as soil microorganisms consume oxygen faster than diffusion occurs. The presence of hypoxic soils is one of the defining characteristics of wetlands. Many wetland plants possess aerenchyma, and in some, such as water-lilies, there is mass flow of atmospheric air through leaves and rhizomes. There are many other chemical consequences of hypoxia. For example, nitrification is inhibited as low oxygen occurs and toxic compounds are formed, as anaerobic bacteria use nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors. The reduction-oxidation potential of the rhizhosphere decreases and metal ions such as iron and manganese precipitate. Aerenchyma is a modification of the parenchyma. Now, I have a new situation: Two farmers are having a conversation at a bar about how their soil is doing. Jeff takes a sip of his beer and says that he just discovered that his soil is hypoxic. Brandon is trying to get the attention of the bartender so he can order another martini. Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Answer this question please: Does Jeff's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Brandon's? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jeff's soil, which is hypoxic, likely has more toxic compounds than Brandon's soil, which is not hypoxic. This is because anaerobic bacteria tend to produce toxic compounds in hypoxic conditions by using nitrate, manganese, and sulfate as alternative electron acceptors."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Multi-choice problem: Are these two questions inquiring about the same information? pick from the following. i. no. ii. yes.","completion":"i. no. These two questions are inquiring about different information. The first question asks about the importance of health and safety policy in a construction company. Health and safety policies are an essential part of any business, especially in the construction industry. The importance of implementing such policies includes: 1. Ensuring the safety and well-being of employees, subcontractors, and the general public. 2. Reducing the number of accidents, injuries, and fatalities on construction sites. 3. Minimizing the potential legal and financial risks to the company arising from health and safety-related incidents. 4. Providing clear guidelines and procedures for employees and subcontractors to follow, which helps to maintain a consistent safety culture throughout the company. 5. Meeting the regulatory and compliance standards set by the government, industry bodies, and clients. The second question concerns the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) health policy. The AAP is a professional organization of pediatricians dedicated to ensuring the optimal physical, mental, and social health and well-being of infants, children, adolescents, and young adults. Their health policies focus on various aspects of children's health, including preventive care, diagnosis and treatment, school health, environmental health, and child advocacy. These policies help to establish guidelines and recommendations for pediatricians and other healthcare providers concerned with the well-being of children.

Answer the following question: Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What is the full name of the person whose text shows elements of early Pietism? Erschallet, ihr Lieder is the third of the Weimar cantatas. It was the first composed for a feast day, Pentecost Sunday (Whit Sunday), Pentecost being a high holiday along with Christmas and Easter. The prescribed readings for the feast day are taken from the Acts of the Apostles, on the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1–13), and from the Gospel of John, in which Jesus announces the Spirit who will teach, in his Farewell discourse (John 14:23–31). As in many Bach cantatas, the libretto is compiled from Bible text, contemporary poetry and chorale. The poetry is attributed to Salomon Franck, although the verses are not included in his printed editions. Several of Bach's early stylistic mannerisms appear here, such as a biblical quotation in a recitative second movement rather than in a first choral movement, arias following each other without a recitative in between, and dialogue in a duet.Franck's text shows elements of early Pietism: the expression of extreme feelings, for example \\"O seligste Zeiten!\\" (O most blessed times) in the opening chorus, and a \\"mystical demeanour\\", for example in the duet of the Soul and the Spirit united. In the middle section of the first movement, Franck paraphrases the Gospel text, which says in verse 23 that God wants to dwell with man, to \\"Gott will sich die Seelen zu Tempeln bereiten\\" (God Himself shall prepare our souls for His temple, more literally: \\"God wants to prepare [our] souls to become his temples\\"). The words for the recitative are the quotation of verse 23 from the Gospel of John, \\"Wer mich liebet, der wird mein Wort halten\\" (Whoever loves Me will keep My Word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make Our dwelling with him). Movement 3 addresses the Trinity and movement 4 the Spirit that was present at the Creation. Movement 5 is a duet of the Soul and the Spirit, underlined by an instrumental quote from Martin Luther's Pentecost hymn \\"Komm, Heiliger Geist, Herre Gott\\", which is based on the Latin hymn \\"Veni Sancte Spiritus, reple tuorum corda fidelium\\"....

While travelling, Nielsen discovered and then turned against Richard Wagner's music dramas, heard many of Europe's leading orchestras and soloists and sharpened his opinions on both music and the visual arts. Although he revered the music of Bach and Mozart, he remained ambivalent about much 19th-century music. In 1891 he met the composer and pianist Ferruccio Busoni in Leipzig; they were to maintain a correspondence for over thirty years. Shortly after arriving in Paris in early March 1891 Nielsen met the Danish sculptor Anne Marie Brodersen, who was also travelling on a scholarship. They toured Italy together and married in St Mark's English Church, Florence, on 10 May 1891 before returning to Denmark. According to Fanning, their relationship was not only a \\"love match\\", but also a \\"meeting of minds\\"; Anne Marie was a gifted artist and a \\"strong-willed and modern-minded woman, determined to forge her own career\\". This determination would strain the Nielsens' marriage, as Anne Marie would spend months away from home during the 1890s and 1900s, leaving Carl, who was susceptible to opportunities with other ladies, to raise their three young children in addition to composing and fulfilling his duties at the Royal Theatre.Nielsen sublimated his anger and frustration over his marriage in a number of musical works, most notably between 1897 and 1904, a period which he sometimes called his \\"psychological\\" period.

Answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: Who asks Dillard to install an alarm system? The action is set in San Francisco during the 1980s. Weslake, who was laid off from his job, is working in a low-paying position at Garvey's pawn shop. Weslake has one friend nicknamed 'Turtle' who's homeless and is seen throughout the whole film searching for something to eat. One day, Dillard, who is an amateur musician, and Ramon, an illegal immigrant from Mexico who lives with his sister Maria, come to Garvey's shop. The purpose of their visit is to buy off a guitar pawned earlier by Dillard; because both have little money they're offering the pawn shop owner a stolen car radio, but it's not enough for Garvey. Instead, he offers Dillard a deal: he wants Dillard to install an alarm system in his shop (as Dillard is an electrician). Dillard is not thrilled by the deal but Ramon convinces him, arguing that when the alarm system is installed, Garvey may have enough confidence to leave the shop (he normally stays in it, since he lives there) and they may then get an opportunity to break in and get the guitar back. Their conversation is heard by a 'Boardwalk', a pimp who was just left by his girlfriend with his small child. He tells Weslake that he should report the plans of Dillard and Ramon to Garvey, but Weslake realizes that when the new alarm system is installed, Garvey may no longer find it necessary to employ him, and he will be broke again. Because of this Weslake doesn't inform his employer of the planned robbery, and instead joins Dillard, Ramon Boardwalk and Turtle in their attempted robbery. He becomes the brain of the whole operation, designing a plan for breaking into the large safe in the pawn shop. Answer:","completion":"The person who asks Dillard to install an alarm system is the pawn shop owner named Garvey.

Write a summary based on this article: Friends of a 14-year-old boy said they were in disbelief and needed time to pray after a game of hide-and-seek turned into a tragedy when he ran into the horn of a bull statue — impaling him through the chest — on Saturday, June 22. Friends and family gathered around the metal statue Tuesday, June 25, at the National Ranching Heritage Center for what they hoped would be an opportunity to find peace and honor Miguel Martinez where he died within minutes of the accident just before 3 a.m. Saturday. “We just need to get together and pray and be supportive,” said Brenda Garcia, a family friend. One of two adults near Martinez in his last minutes said his death was a “pure accident.” Marenda Podhorsky said Tuesday that she and her boyfriend took her four children and Martinez to play in the park area near the center early Saturday morning, according to the Associated Press. Martinez was spending the night with Podhorsky’s son and the children were awake well past midnight after eating sweets to celebrate her boyfriend’s birthday. When she heard a thump, she thought Martinez might have been knocked down by the bull’s horn during a game of hide-and-seek. Instead, Martinez suffered a chest wound. He died after being impaled by the horn. Texas Tech police, who continued investigating the death Tuesday, released a heavily redacted copy of a police report. The redacted report shows only the date, time, location and a brief synopsis. “He was running and ran into the horn of one of the statues,” the report states. “The boy was unresponsive and died because of his injuries.” Garcia said she has known Martinez for years. Her daughter and Martinez were close friends who attended Cavazos Middle School together. She described him as a good role model to their friends. “And he was always into sports,” she said, listing basketball, football and track. “Whatever season the sports were, he was playing.” Garcia said she would not allow her daughter out past midnight, but avoided laying blame for the accident. “Boys are going to be boys and they’re going to be out late,” she said. “This could happen to anybody, day or night.” Stephanie Cole, a store manager at Wells Fargo’s North University Avenue bank branch, said Martinez’s family is accepting donations through the Miguel Martinez Memorial Fund at Wells Fargo.

In March 2010 artist Spencer Tunick arranged and photographed 5,200 what in front of Sydney Opera House?","completion":"In March 2010, American artist Spencer Tunick orchestrated and photographed 5,200 nude volunteers on the steps and forecourt of the world-renowned architectural masterpiece, the Sydney Opera House in Sydney, Australia. This ambitious art installation was titled \\"Mardi Gras: The Base.\\" Spencer Tunick is best known for his large-scale, site-specific installations, often involving thousands of nude participants. These installations are both visually striking and sociopolitically thought-provoking, as they bring attention to various social, political, and environmental issues. The artist's primary goal is to impose a temporary transformation of the space and explore the relationship between the human body and the architecture or landscape it inhabits. The staging of this provocative artwork at the Sydney Opera House was part of a collaboration with the Australian city's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras Festival, an annual LGBTQ+ celebration that aims to promote inclusion, diversity, and equality. By arranging such a significant number of nude participants in a highly public space, Tunick sought to promote self-expression, body positivity, and unity among individuals, regardless of their race, gender, or sexuality. The installation also contributed to a broader conversation around the acceptance of nudity as a form of art and self-expression. In preparation for this large-scale work, Tunick had to plan meticulously and collaborate closely with the authorities, local organizations, and festival organizers. The participants were pre-registered and carefully briefed on the artistic objectives, as well as the best methods to maintain personal comfort and safety. As a result, the installation challenged societal norms, created a sense of camaraderie among those involved, and visually captured the essence of human vulnerability and resilience. The \\"Mardi Gras: The Base\\" installation is a testament to Spencer Tunick's dedication to engaging people from all walks of life in an exploration of the connections between our bodies, the environment, and the societies in which we live. By photographing 5,200 nude volunteers in front of the iconic Sydney Opera House, Tunick invited individuals and audiences alike to engage in a critical discourse about identity, freedom, and collective strength."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You are unlikely to get everything that you ask for. However, you won’t get any concessions unless you ask for them. Ask for a lower rental rate, shorter lease term, and a broad exclusive use clause. In your counteroffer, mention that you are also negotiating with another landlord. This news might spur the landlord to give you as many concessions as possible. Most landlords will require you to personally guarantee the lease. This means that if your business can’t pay the lease, then the landlord can come after you personally to pay. If you’re a small business without much credit history, you can expect to sign a personal guarantee. Many commercial landlords will expect a security deposit and/or prepaid rent. You can expect up to two months’ of rent as a security deposit and one to three months of rent prepaid. Summary:","completion":"In order to draft an effective counteroffer to the landlord's proposal, you should adopt an aggressive approach as it is unlikely that you will receive everything you ask for. Key elements to consider in your counteroffer include requesting a lower rental rate, a shorter lease term, and a broad exclusive-use clause. Furthermore, it is beneficial to inform the landlord that you are also in negotiations with another property owner, as this may encourage them to offer more concessions. Be prepared for landlords to require a personal guarantee for the lease, especially if you are a small business with limited credit history. This means that if your business fails to meet its lease commitments, the landlord can pursue you personally for payment. Lastly, anticipate that commercial landlords will typically expect a security deposit, often up to two months' rent, and one to three months of rent prepaid.

While the use of iron started to become more widespread around 1200 BC, mainly because of interruptions in the trade routes for tin, the metal is much softer than bronze. However, very small amounts of steel, (an alloy of iron and around 1% carbon), was always a byproduct of the bloomery process. The ability to modify the hardness of steel by heat treatment had been known since 1100 BC, and the rare material was valued for the manufacture of tools and weapons. Because the ancients could not produce temperatures high enough to melt iron fully, the production of steel in decent quantities did not occur until the introduction of blister steel during the Middle Ages. This method introduced carbon by heating wrought iron in charcoal for long periods of time, but the penetration of carbon was not very deep, so the alloy was not homogeneous. In 1740, Benjamin Huntsman began melting blister steel in a crucible to even out the carbon content, creating the first process for the mass production of tool steel. Huntsman's process was used for manufacturing tool steel until the early 1900s.

Answer: A:","completion":"Definitely positive B: Somewhat positive C: Neutral D: Somewhat negative E: Definitely negative Step 1: Analyze the title The title mentions some good-looking folds, which indicates a positive aspect, but also mentions incomprehensible instructions, which is a negative aspect.

Title: Il Paese del Sesso Selvaggio Movie plot: John Bradley is a British journalist and photographer on vacation in Bangkok, Thailand. He is first seen taking photos and seeing the sights, until he arrives at a kickboxing match with a date. His date grows increasingly bored and disgruntled by Bradley's refusal to leave, until she finally walks out on him, which doesn't bother him in the slightest. An unidentified man sees her leave, and presumably upset over the disrespect shown towards the young woman, he follows Bradley to a bar where he confronts him with a knife. After a brief struggle, Bradley manages to turn the weapon against the man and kills him. Even though he killed in self defense, Bradley immediately flees the scene knowing the Thai authorities will arrest him and probally sentence him to death for the killing as a result of being a foreigner in their country.The next day, Bradley begins his trip deep into the rain forest first by traveling by train to a point several hundred miles north of Bangkok. At the train's stop, John rents a canoe and a guide to take him down a nearby river towards the Burma border. Still fearing that he'll be captured by the Thai authorities, he pays off the man to not mention their encounter. After rowing a ways and taking several wildlife photos, Bradley's guide, Tuan, mentions his concerns about traveling so far down river, which he reports as being dangerous. Bradley agrees to head back after one more day of traveling.That evening, Bradley falls asleep, and when he awakes the next day, he finds Tuan dead with an arrow in his throat. Before he has any chance to escape, a native Thai tribe captures him in a net and carries him to their village. The chief, Luhanà, is told that the group has captured a large fish-man. At the village, Bradley is hung in the net from a high pole, where a group of young children hit him with bamboo stalks. While hanging, Bradley witnesses the execution of two war criminals by his captive tribe. The tribe is at war with another, even more primitive Burmese tribe of cannibals, whom are...

Background: William Randolph Hearst Sr. (; April 29, 1863 - August 14, 1951) was an American businessman, politician, and newspaper publisher who built the nation's largest newspaper chain and media company Hearst Communications and whose flamboyant methods of yellow journalism influenced the nation's popular media by emphasizing sensationalism and human interest stories. Hearst entered the publishing business in 1887 after being given control of The San Francisco Examiner by his wealthy father. Context: Beginning in 1919, Hearst began to build Hearst Castle, which he never completed, on a 240,000 acres (97,000 hectares) ranch at San Simeon, California, which he furnished with art, antiques and entire rooms brought from the great houses of Europe. He also used the ranch for an Arabian horse breeding operation. San Simeon was also used in the 1960 film Spartacus as the estate of Marcus Licinius Crassus (played by Laurence Olivier). He also had a property on the McCloud River in Siskiyou County, in far northern California, called Wyntoon. Wyntoon was designed by famed architect Julia Morgan, who also designed Hearst Castle and worked in collaboration with William J. Dodd on a number of other projects. In 1947, Hearst paid 120,000 for an H-shaped Beverly Hills mansion, (located at 1011 N Beverly Dr, Beverly Hills CA 90210) on 3.7 acres three blocks from Sunset Boulevard. This home, known as Beverly House, was once perhaps the \\"most expensive\\" private home in the U.S., valued at 165 million (PS81.4 million). It has 29 bedrooms, three swimming pools, tennis courts, its own cinema and a nightclub. Lawyer and investor Leonard Ross has owned it since 1976. The estate went on the market for 95 million at the end of 2010. The property had not sold by 2012 but was then listed at a significantly increased asking price of 135 million. The Beverly House, as it has come to be known, has some cinematic connections. It was the setting for the gruesome scene in the film The Godfather depicting a horse's severed head in the bed of film-producer, Jack Woltz. The character was head of a film company called International, the name of Hearst's early film company. According to Hearst Over Hollywood, John and Jacqueline Kennedy stayed at the house for part of their honeymoon. They watched their first film together as a married couple in the mansion's cinema. It was a Hearst-produced film from the 1920s. In the early 1890s, Hearst began building a mansion on the hills overlooking Pleasanton, California on land purchased by his father a decade earlier. Hearst's mother took over the project, hired Julia Morgan to finish it as her home, and named it Hacienda del Pozo de Verona. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club from 1925 to 1969, when it was destroyed in a massive fire. Question: Did he have other properties?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, William Randolph Hearst had other properties besides Hearst Castle, Wyntoon, and Beverly House. One such property was a mansion in Pleasanton, California, called Hacienda del Pozo de Verona, which was initially started by Hearst but later taken over by his mother. After her death, it served as the clubhouse for Castlewood Country Club until 1969 when it was destroyed in a fire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the name of the person whose cover version of Kool & the Gang's \\"Celebration\\" reached the top twenty of the UK Singles Chart?, using the article: Minogue's third album, Rhythm of Love was released in November 1990 and was described as \\"leaps and bounds more mature\\" than her previous albums. Her relationship with Michael Hutchence was also seen as part of her departure from her earlier persona. Its lead single, \\"Better the Devil You Know\\" peaked at number two in the UK and four in her native Australia. Rhythm of Love's second and fourth single, \\"Step Back in Time\\" and \\"Shocked\\" were both a top ten hit in the UK and Australia. She then embarked on the Rhythm of Love Tour in February 1991.

A). World. B). Sports. C). Business. D). Science/Tech.","completion":"D). Science/Tech. The appropriate title for this article is \\"Science/Tech\\" because the article is focused on the natural disaster of torrential rains in Sri Lanka and its effect on the tsunami survivors.

Option A, \\"World,\\" could be a secondary choice as the events are happening in a specific region of the world - Sri Lanka, but the focus on natural disaster and its repercussions make \\"Science/Tech\\" a more accurate choice. Option B, \\"Sports,\\" is not applicable to this article as the content is about natural disasters, meteorological events, and their impact on people, and not about any sports event or sportspeople.

If \\"Two dogs play in the snow.\\", does this mean that \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool.\\"?","completion":"No, the statement \\"Two dogs play in the snow.\\" does not mean that \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool.\\" These two sentences describe two entirely different scenarios, each involving different environments and activities. In the first sentence, \\"Two dogs play in the snow,\\" we understand that there are a couple of dogs engaged in playful activities while in the snow. This implies that the weather is likely cold, and the dogs are outdoors, possibly during winter. Snow is a form of precipitation that typically falls in colder temperatures, creating a chilly environment. Dogs might be playing by running around, catching snowballs, or jumping in the snow. On the other hand, the second sentence, \\"Two dogs are playing in a warm pool,\\" presents a completely different situation. In this case, the two dogs are not in the cold snow, but rather inside a pool filled with warm water. Pools are usually filled with water, not snow, and are meant for swimming or relaxing. The warm temperature of the water contrasts with the cold environment of the snow in the first sentence. Dogs in a warm pool may be swimming, splashing, or just enjoying the water. In conclusion, these two sentences illustrate different settings, weather conditions, and experiences for the dogs. The first statement talks about dogs playing in a cold, snowy setting, while the second statement describes dogs enjoying a warm and wet environment in a pool. Therefore, the first sentence does not mean the same as the second sentence, as the conditions, activities, and environments are entirely different from each other."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: pick from the following. [i] prostate gland; [ii] ureter; [iii] fallopian tube; [iv] vas deferens; Answer:","completion":"The name of the tube that carries sperm from the epididymis to the urethra is the vas deferens (option [iv]). The vas deferens is a crucial part of the male reproductive system and plays a significant role in the transportation of sperm. Sperm are produced in the testes, which are situated within the scrotum. From the testes, sperm move to the epididymis, where they mature and are stored temporarily. When ejaculation occurs, the sperm travel through the vas deferens, which is a long, muscular tube that propels the sperm forward. The vas deferens extends from the epididymis and passes through the inguinal canal into the pelvic region. Here, it loops around the bladder and joins with the seminal vesicle to form the ejaculatory duct. The other options provided are not related to the transportation of sperm from the epididymis to the urethra: [i] Prostate gland: The prostate gland is a male accessory gland situated below the bladder and surrounding the urethra. It produces a significant portion of the seminal fluid, which mixes with sperm to create semen. The prostate gland plays an essential role in nourishing and protecting the sperm, but it does not transport sperm. [ii] Ureter: The ureter is a tube that transfers urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. There are two ureters, one connected to each kidney. While the ureter is involved in the urinary system, it is not responsible for transporting sperm. [iii] Fallopian tube: The fallopian tube is part of the female reproductive system. It is the pathway through which the mature ovum (egg) travels from the ovary to the uterus after ovulation. The fallopian tube is also the site where fertilization typically occurs when sperm encounters the ovum. However, the fallopian tube is not involved in sperm transportation in the male reproductive system."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The industrial complex covers about 100 acres (40 ha) on both sides of Quehanna Highway at the southeast edge of the Quehanna Wild Area. Although the industrial complex lies within the historic 16-sided polygon, it is no longer part of the wild area. After Curtiss-Wright's lease ended and it donated six of the eight buildings in the complex to the state in 1963, Pennsylvania formed the Commonwealth Industrial Research Corporation to administer and lease the Quehanna facilities, which it did until 1967. Over the years a series of tenants have occupied parts of the industrial complex. One company manufactured logging trailers there from 1967 to 1971, and another processed frozen meat from 1968 to 1970. In 1968 Piper Aircraft established a plant to make metal and plastic parts for airplanes. The complex was renamed from Quehanna to Piper, a name it retains. Piper employed up to 1,000 people, but moved its operations from Pennsylvania to Florida in 1984.The Young Adult Conservation Corps was also based at Piper from 1977 to 1982.

First, let's look at the math problem given to us: 127505 - 861 = -2166 * o + 937 - 49739 Now, let's solve step-by-step. Step 1: Subtract 861 from 127505. 127505 - 861 = 126644 So now the problem looks like this: 126644 = -2166 * o + 937 - 49739 Step 2: Add 49739 to both sides of the equation. 126644 + 49739 = -2166 * o + 937 This will simplify to: 176383 = -2166 * o + 937 Step 3: Subtract 937 from both sides of the equation. 176383 - 937 = -2166 * o This simplifies to: 175446 = -2166 * o Step 4: Divide both sides by -2166 to find the value of \\"o\\". 175446 / -2166 = o After calculating this, we find the value of \\"o\\": o = -80.971 So there you have it, o equals approximately -80.971!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Available choices: *Cristin enjoyed seeing her favorite band that night. *Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year.","completion":"Cristin decided not to go to the festival next year. This unfortunate situation at the music festival left Cristin feeling quite disappointed. She had been looking forward to seeing her favorite band perform live and had even convinced some of her friends to join her for this much-anticipated event. As a die-hard fan, Cristin's enthusiasm prior to the festival was through the roof, so one can only imagine the extent of her frustration when the band's performance was cancelled. Admittedly, the festival organizers could not have foreseen that the band would have to cancel their performance. However, Cristin couldn't shake off a sense of having been let down. For her, as well as thousands of other fans, this was no small setback. Music festivals are typically filled with positive experiences and unforgettable memories. But in Cristin's case, this cancellation overshadowed what could have been a fantastic time. While some might argue that seeing the rest of the impressive lineup at the festival could make up for missing one band's performance, for Cristin, the entire experience was now tainted. The joy she took in discovering new artists and dancing along to old favorites was significantly dampened by the knowledge that she would not get to see her all-time favorite band. Considering the time and money Cristin had invested in attending the festival, the disappointment she now felt was palpable and, to some extent, understandable. Travel, accommodations, and festival passes can be quite expensive, and Cristin had willingly paid for it all with the expectation that she would see the band she adored. Now, with their performance cancelled, she couldn't help but feel like the entire experience had been a waste of her resources. As the festival drew to a close, Cristin and her friends spent time reflecting on the performances they had seen. While they admitted that many acts had been thrilling and had even exceeded their expectations, the absence of her favorite band had left an unmistakable void in Cristin's festival experience. Much to the dismay of her friends, she resolved not to attend the festival next year. Even though the rest of her group tried to persuade her to reconsider, Cristin had made up her mind. The sting of disappointment, coupled with the financial burden, had convinced her that passing on next year's festival was the right choice for her. Perhaps in the future, Cristin's festival experience might change for the better, but for the present moment, she was content to sit the next one out and find other ways to enjoy her favorite music."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eric Manu, a Langley, B.C. man who was crowned chief of the Akan tribe in the village of Adansi Aboabo No. 2 in southern Ghana last year, has returned to Canada for a few months, where he is resuming his job as a landscaper. “Sometimes we go to the (job) site and they say, ‘You are the chief. I saw you on TV. Why are you doing the landscaping?’” he told CTV News. “This is humbleness you understand. Anytime I’m in Canada, I’m proud to work for my boss.” Manu, 32, moved to B.C. in 2012 after marrying a Canadian woman he met in Ghana. But his uncle, who had served as chief of the tribe, died two years ago, placing Manu next in line for the honour. Hanging up his crown, even temporarily, isn’t a decision Manu takes lightly. He’s using his time in Canada to raise money to improve the health care standards for his tribe of 6,000. Manu and his Canadian boss Susan Watson started a foundation that packed a shipping container with medical supplies, school supplies, and clothing that arrived in Ghana this spring. The To the Moon and Back Foundation hopes to continue raising money and donations to send a second shipment and improve the local medical clinic. “The whole village was quite poor. The clinic only has a midwife and a few nurses. There is no doctor on site,” said Watson. -With files from CTV Vancouver ||||| Last year, Eric Manu left his landscaping job in Langley to take his rightful place as the crowned chief of a West African tribe.

That’s the question a team of students and professors at the University of Alabama is trying to determine. In many parts of the Black Belt, homeowners are resorting to “straight pipe” systems to dispose of wastewater and sewage, rather than sewers or septic tanks because of a type of thick, clay soil and widespread poverty across isolated areas. In those instances, untreated wastewater and sewage are simply flushed out of a plain PVC pipe from the house into the woods, or even the backyard, raising concerns about tropical diseases like hookworm and other public health issues. Al.com reports University of Alabama graduate students and professors, backed by a federal grant, are joining efforts to determine just how widespread these practices are and what can be done about them. The UA team received a 15,000 grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “People, Prosperity and the Planet,” program, a competition for students proposing a yearlong project to address an environmental or public health issue. The students will use computer models to map how widespread sanitation issues are in Alabama’s Black Belt, a region plagued with sewage and wastewater problems and reports of tropical diseases like hookworm that are associated with poor sanitation. The student project will go hand-in-hand with efforts by university researchers and state and federal agencies. University of Alabama civil engineering professor Mark Elliott, a faculty adviser for the project, said the Black Belt is being hampered by a combination of poor soil conditions where traditional septic systems don’t work, high levels of poverty, and people living in relatively isolated areas where connecting to municipal sewer lines is not an option. Elliott said the “shrink-swell clays” that make up about half the soil in the Black Belt don’t allow water to flow through, and make most septic systems “almost impossible to use.” “So in that situation, understandably, many people, especially poor people, have decided not to waste their money on a system that they know is going to fail,” Elliott said. One survey conducted by UA and the Alabama Department of Public Health found that 60 percent of homes surveyed in Wilcox County that weren’t connected to municipal sewer lines had a visible straight pipe. Though disposing of waste through a straight pipe is illegal, most of the people who resort to such methods cannot afford to install a septic system, and in large areas in the Black Belt, most septic systems would not work anyway. The Alabama Department of Public Health has decreased emphasis on fining offenders and instead is focused on finding workable solutions. In recent months, political figures including Cory Booker, Al Gore and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez have attempted to draw attention to the area’s struggles, but it’s still not clear just how widespread those problems are. “There’s been publicity around this issue, particularly in Lowndes County, for a long time but the scope of the problem was never really defined,” Elliott said. “It was presented as a series of anecdotes, and that made it hard to define how much it would cost to fix the problem and what solutions would be appropriate.” The students, led by UA graduate student Aaron Blackwell, plan to construct a computer model to estimate how likely a home is to have a straight pipe, based on factors such as soil conditions, existing infrastructure, population density and property values. The students will apply their model to five of the 17 counties traditionally included in Alabama’s Black Belt: Lowndes, Wilcox, Perry, Dallas and Hale Counties. UA’s team is in the first phase of the program, and will attend the TechConnect World Innovation Conference and Expo in Boston in June to showcase its research. The team can then apply for a second-phase grant for funding up to 100,000 to further the project design. Other members of the team include Joseph Weber, UA professor of geological sciences, Sagy Cohen, UA associate professor of geological sciences, and Rebecca Greenberg, a UA graduate student studying geology. The students’ project will be part of a larger collaborative effort involving a group of state and federal health and environmental agencies, universities and elected officials to find solutions to the problems. That group, dubbed the Alabama Rural Water and Wastewater Management Consortium, continues to meet to discuss which potential solutions might work best and how to pay for those solutions. Elliott said one idea that is frequently discussed among the group is identifying clusters of houses that could be grouped together to use smaller-scale treatment systems that that would be more effective than a typical septic system but less expensive than expanding municipal sewer lines to remote areas. Output:","completion":"The University of Alabama team, aided by a federal grant, is looking into the widespread use of \\"straight pipe\\" systems for waste disposal in Alabama's Black Belt region due to issues like thick clay soil and poverty, which are significant contributors to sanitation problems, including the occurrence of tropical diseases like hookworm."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What might be the first step of the process?","completion":"The first step of the digestion process begins in the mouth, which is also known as the oral cavity. This initial phase is crucial for the breakdown of food and the preparation of nutrients to be utilized by the body. Here is a detailed explanation of the first step and the subsequent stages of the digestion process. 1. Ingestion and Chewing: The act of taking food into the mouth is known as ingestion. Once the food is in the oral cavity, the teeth start breaking it down into smaller pieces through a process called mastication or chewing. This action increases the food's surface area, making it easier for enzymes to act on it. 2. Saliva Secretion and Mixing: The salivary glands in the mouth secrete saliva, which mixes with the food particles. Saliva contains salivary amylase, an enzyme that breaks down carbohydrates like starch into simpler sugars. Saliva also contains mucus, which helps make the ingested food moist and soft, facilitating easier swallowing. 3. Formation of Bolus: The tongue helps in forming the chewed and moistened food into a compact mass called the bolus. Taste buds on the tongue help identify tastes like sweet, salty, bitter, and sour, which can aid in evaluating the quality of ingested food. 4. Swallowing: The bolus is then squeezed down the esophagus, a muscular tube that leads to the stomach, through a process called peristalsis. Peristalsis is the rhythmic contraction and relaxation of the muscular layers of the esophagus, which propel the bolus towards the stomach. 5. Gastric Digestion: Once the bolus reaches the stomach, gastric acid, and enzymes, such as pepsin, commence the process of breaking down proteins. The stomach's muscular churning also helps mix food with gastric juice, turning the bolus into a liquid called chyme. 6. Small Intestine Digestion and Absorption: The partially digested food is passed into the small intestine, where enzymes and fluids from the liver and pancreas continue breaking it down into smaller molecules. Nutrients are then absorbed through the villi, tiny finger-like projections on the inner lining of the small intestine, and enter the bloodstream. 7. Large Intestine and Fecal Formation: Unused materials that the small intestine didn't absorb are passed into the large intestine. Here, water and some electrolytes are absorbed, and the remaining waste materials are compacted to form fecal matter. 8. Elimination: The fecal matter is eventually expelled from the body through the rectum and anus, completing the digestion process.

John Herbert Gleason was born in 1916 at 364 Chauncey Street in the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn. Named Herbert Walton Gleason, Jr., at birth, he was baptized John Herbert Gleason, and grew up at 328 Chauncey (an address he later used for Ralph and Alice Kramden on The Honeymooners). His parents were Herbert Walton \\"Herb\\" Gleason, an Irish-American insurance auditor, and Mae \\"Maisie\\" (nee Kelly), originally of Farranree, Cork, Ireland. Gleason was one of two children; his brother Clement J. died of meningitis at age 14. Gleason worked his way up to a job at New York's Club 18, where insulting its patrons was the order of the day. Gleason greeted noted skater Sonja Henie by handing her an ice cube and saying, \\"Okay, now do something.\\" It was here that Jack L. Warner first saw Gleason, signing him to a film contract for 250 a week. By age 24, Gleason was appearing in movies: first for Warner Brothers (as Jackie C. Gleason) in such films as Navy Blues (1941) with Ann Sheridan and Martha Raye and All Through the Night (1941) with Humphrey Bogart, for Columbia Pictures for the B military comedy Tramp, Tramp, Tramp (1942) and finally for Twentieth Century-Fox, where Gleason played Glenn Miller Orchestra bassist Ben Beck in Orchestra Wives (1942). He also had a small part as a soda shop clerk in Larceny, Inc. (1942), with Edward G. Robinson, and a modest part as an actor's agent in the 1942 Betty Grable-Harry James musical Springtime in the Rockies. During World War II, Gleason was initially exempt from military service, since he was a father of two. However, in 1943 the US started drafting men with children. Gleason reported to his induction where the doctors discovered that his broken left arm had healed crooked, the area between his thumb and forefinger was nerveless and numb, a pilonidal cyst existed at the end of his coccyx, and that he was 100 pounds overweight. Gleason was therefore classified 4-F and rejected for military service. Gleason did not make a strong impression on Hollywood at first; at the time he developed a nightclub act that included comedy and music. At the end of 1942, Gleason and Lew Parker led a large cast of entertainers in the road show production of Olsen and Johnson's New 1943 Hellzapoppin. He also became known for hosting all-night parties in his hotel suite; the hotel soundproofed his suite out of consideration for its other guests. \\"Anyone who knew Jackie Gleason in the 1940s\\", wrote CBS historian Robert Metz, \\"would tell you The Fat Man would never make it. His pals at Lindy's watched him spend money as fast as he soaked up the booze.\\" Gleason's first significant recognition as an entertainer came on Broadway when he appeared in the hit musical Follow the Girls (1944). While working in films in California, Gleason also worked at former boxer Maxie Rosenbloom's nightclub (Slapsy Maxie's, on Wilshire Boulevard). what movie was he in first","completion":"Jackie Gleason's first movie appearance was in Navy Blues (1941) for Warner Brothers, where he acted under the name Jackie C.

According to Belgian newspaper De Standaard, Buffett, the world's richest man, not only supports Inbev's offer, he is scheduled to meet Anheuser Chief Executive August Busch IV about it. InBev (other-otc: INBVF - news - people ) shares rose 1.6%, or 74 cents, to close at 48.58 in New York, while Anheuser gained 1.1%, or 67 cents, to 61.20. If Buffett, whose Berkshire-Hathaway is Aheuser's second-largest investor with 35.3 million shares, or a 5.0% stake, publicly backs InBev's offer, other investors in the American brewer are likely to be take heed, said one analyst who spoke on condition of anonymity. Anheuser-Busch (nyse: BUD - news - people ) shares have never reached 65.00, which is what InBev is offering to acquire the company. The stock was trading around the 48.00 mark when Buffett first bought his stake in early 2005, and they were still trading at around that level last April, before reports about interest from InBev first emerged. \\"If you are an Anheuser shareholder, the offer looks pretty attractive,\\" said Paul Hofman, an analyst with Cheuvreux. \\"Buffett is a shareholder and he wants the best price for the shares. His backing of the bid seems logical.\\" Buffett may be interested in a cash offer or even a share swap. While Anheuser's shares have been stagnant since the billionaire's investment in 2005, InvBev's have nearly doubled. And Buffett has recently been scouring Europe for good investments in order to diversify himself out of dollar assets. (See: \\"Buffett Going Shopping In Europe\\") Last week Anheuser-Busch, which was apparently seeking to avoid the embrace of Belgian-Brazilian brewer InBev, got the cold shoulder from Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo (other-otc: GPMCF - news - people ). Just as Anheuser would prefer to remain American, Modelo said it wanted to stay Mexican, though it did not rule out the idea of being bought. (See: \\" Modelo Frosty To Anheuser-Busch\\") A deal between InBev and Anheuser would constitute the biggest ever takeover of an alcoholic beverages company and create the world's largest brewer, headquartered in Belgium. InBev itself is the result of an earlier brewing mega-merger, the 2004 amalgamation of Belgium's Interbrew and the Brazi's Ambev. Its brands include Stella Artois and Beck's. InBev Chief Executive Carlos Brito visited Capitol Hill on Tuesday to promote the takeover. He told reporters the 65 per share offer was the highest the company would bid. Some analysts have said InBev would have to raise the offer closer to 70 in order to secure the deal. When asked whether InBev has reached out to Buffett or Mexican brewer Grupo Modelo, Brito said, \\"Right now we're trying to engage with [the Anheuser-Busch] board; that's the top of the agenda.\\" Brito has said he hoped for a friendly deal with Anheuser, and would keep the company in St. Louis, Mo. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.), who serves on the Senate Commerce Committee, did not have a friendly reaction. McCaskill, who served Budweiser beer to attendees of the discussion, said afterward, \\"I was very up front I explained to them that I would do everything I could to stop this sale from going through.\\" The senator said she was concerned the takeover could threaten pensions of Anheuser employees and \\"good middle-class jobs\\" the brewer has provided in her state. Reuters contributed to this article. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"A very rich man named Warren Buffett might help a company called InBev buy another company called Anheuser-Busch. Anheuser-Busch makes a famous drink called Budweiser beer. InBev wants to pay a lot of money for Anheuser-Busch, but some people don't want the company to be sold.

Given these facts, what controls anti-aging among the following options: - A computer - air - chemical messengers - ice - an electric stove - Electrical energy - water - Chemical energy A:","completion":"Anti-aging is predominantly controlled by chemical messengers, specifically hormones, within the human body. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various biological processes, such as growth, metabolism, reproduction, and stress response. Growth hormone, also known as somatotropin, is a peptide hormone produced by the anterior pituitary gland. It stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration in humans and animals, contributing to both physical and cellular growth throughout the body. As an anti-aging hormone, growth hormone has been shown to improve bone density, increase muscle mass, reduce body fat, enhance cardiovascular function, and improve skin elasticity. Growth hormone works in conjunction with other hormones, such as insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), which is produced in the liver in response to growth hormone secretion. Together, these hormones play essential roles in regulating cellular growth, division, and maintenance. In addition to growth hormone, other critical hormones in anti-aging processes include: 1. Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA): A steroid hormone produced by the adrenal glands, DHEA is a precursor to the production of both androgens and estrogens. DHEA levels decline with age, leading to a decrease in the production of sex hormones, which are essential for maintaining overall health and vitality. 2. Melatonin: Produced by the pineal gland in the brain, melatonin is a hormone responsible for regulating sleep patterns. Adequate and restful sleep is essential for rejuvenation and cellular repair, thus contributing to anti-aging effects. 3. Estrogen and Testosterone: These sex hormones play crucial roles in maintaining bone density, muscle mass, cardiovascular health, and cognitive function. A balance of estrogen and testosterone is essential for overall health and well-being, with imbalances leading to various aging-related symptoms. 4. Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4): These hormones regulate cellular metabolism, body temperature, and energy levels. Proper function of the thyroid gland and the maintenance of optimal T3 and T4 levels can contribute to overall health, mood, and energy levels, thus contributing to anti-aging effects. The other options listed, such as a computer, air, ice, an electric stove, electrical energy, water, and chemical energy, do not have direct control over the anti-aging process. While some of these elements (air, water, and certain types of energy) may contribute to overall health and well-being, they do not have a direct impact on the hormonal regulation of anti-aging. Instead, it is the complex interplay of hormones and chemical messengers within the body that controls the aging process and contributes to overall longevity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The background was that after 7 years of marriage, and 2 tragic miscarriages, THIS pregnancy had come to full term, and the child—deliberately they did NOT want to know the gender—was healthy, and both “mom” and “dad” were excited about the upcoming birth. The child finally emerged, the MD held up the child, and “dad” blurted out “It’s a girl!! You wanted a girl!!! Oh my God, she’s beautiful!!” Then he buried his face on his wife’s shoulder and was sobbing for pure joy. The MD quickly put him to work…he was to cut the umbilical cord. “I’m not going to hurt her, am I??” MD assured him no, he wouldn’t.

His earliest and strongest musical influence was Django Reinhardt, the gypsy guitarist. Byrd was best known for his association with Brazilian music, especially bossa nova. In 1962, Byrd collaborated with Stan Getz on the album \\"Jazz Samba\\", a recording which brought bossa nova into the mainstream of North American music. - Bossa nova is a genre of Brazilian music, which developed and was popularized in the 1950s and 1960s and is today one of the best-known Brazilian music genres abroad. The phrase \\"bossa nova\\" means literally \\"new trend\\". A lyrical fusion of samba and jazz, bossa nova acquired a large following in the 1960s, initially among young musicians and college students. - Stanley \\"Stan\\" Getz (February 2, 1927 June 6, 1991) was an American jazz saxophonist. Playing primarily the tenor saxophone, Getz was known as \\"The Sound\\" because of his warm, lyrical tone, his prime influence being the wispy, mellow timbre of his idol, Lester Young. Coming to prominence in the late 1940s with Woody Herman's big band, Getz is described by critic Scott Yanow as \\"one of the all-time great tenor saxophonists\\". Getz went on to perform in bebop and cool jazz groups, but is perhaps best known for popularizing bossa nova with the worldwide hit single \\"The Girl from Ipanema\\" (1964) performed with Astrud Gilberto, and for his work done under the influence of João Gilberto and Antônio Carlos Jobim. - A pseudonym (and ) or alias is a name that a person or group assumes for a particular purpose, which can differ from their original or true name (orthonym). Pseudonyms include stage names and user names (both called \\"screen names\\"), ring names, pen names, nicknames, aliases, superhero identities and code names, gamer identifications, and regnal names of emperors, popes, and other monarchs. Historically, they have often taken the form of anagrams, Graecisms, and Latinisations, although there are many other methods of choosing a pseudonym. - Jazz Samba is a bossa nova album by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd released by Verve Records in 1962. \\"Jazz Samba\\" signaled the beginning of the bossa nova craze in America. Stan Getz was the featured soloist and the tracks were arranged by Charlie Byrd, who had first heard bossa nova during a tour of Brazil in 1961. - Frederick Eugene John \\"Gene\\" Lees (February 8, 1928 April 22, 2010) was a Canadian music critic, biographer, lyricist, and former journalist. Lees worked as a newspaper journalist in his native Canada before moving to the United States, where he was a music critic and lyricist. His lyrics for Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Corcovado\\" (released as \\"Quiet Nights of Quiet Stars\\"), have been recorded by such notable singers as Frank Sinatra, Peggy Lee, Queen Latifah, and Diana Krall. Lees married his wife Janet in 1971. - \\"Desafinado\\", a Portuguese word (usually rendered into English as \\"Out of Tune\\", or as \\"Off Key\\"), is the title of a bossa nova song composed by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics (in Portuguese) by Newton Mendonça. The English language lyrics were written by Jon Hendricks and \\"Jessie Cavanaugh\\" (a pseudonym used by The Richmond Organisation). Another English lyric, more closely based on the original Portuguese lyric (but not a translation) was written by Gene Lees, and appears on some recordings as well. The version by Stan Getz and Charlie Byrd (from the album \\"Jazz Samba\\") was a major hit in 1962, reaching number 15 and number 4 on \\"Billboard\\"s pop and easy-listening charts, respectively; their definitive rendering also reached number 11 in the UK, while Ella Fitzgerald's version made number 38. The song was voted by the Brazilian edition of \\"Rolling Stone\\" as the 14th greatest Brazilian song. - Rolling Stone is an American biweekly magazine that focuses on popular culture. It was founded in San Francisco in 1967 by Jann Wenner, who is still the magazine's publisher, and the music critic Ralph J. Gleason. It was first known for its musical coverage and for political reporting by Hunter S. Thompson. In the 1990s, the magazine shifted focus to a younger readership interested in youth-oriented television shows, film actors, and popular music.

Registration fees for Illinois lawyers could jump as much as 49 a year if lawmakers adopt two separate measures to bolster pro-bono services and support for lawyers with drug and alcohol problems. The Illinois Supreme Court is pushing for legislation that would allow it to dedicate money raised through the fee hikes to legal services to the poor. The justices are floating a 42 increase to shore up financing for pro-bono work, as the normal funding mechanism for legal services has fallen short in recent years. Currently, support for non-profit legal aid groups comes from interest generated on the Lawyers' Trust Fund, which pools clients' money that attorneys hold for such matters as escrow funds. But low interest rates and a sagging economy mean there is less money being generated. After hours of discussion, the high court agreed that raising the registration fees would be the best way to address the declining revenues, Chief Justice Moses W. Harrison II said. The judges were reluctant to raise those fees but eventually decided that supporting probono services was important enough \\"and lawyers had a responsibility to contribute\\" to the cause, Harrison said. Last year, the high court raised the base fee for active attorneys to 180 from 140. Lawyers in their first three years of practice or who are inactive pay 90, and retired lawyers pay nothing. Legislation circulated by the high court's lobbyist specifies that the hike would apply to attorneys \\"paying full annual registration fees.\\" In 2001, there were 57,392 active attorneys in Illinois and 74,311 on the full roll, according to the Attorney Registration and Disciplinary Commission. The hike would raise roughly 2.4 million. Last year, interest on the trust fund totaled 4.5 million, but service and handling fees consumed 538,000 of that amount. This year's returns are projected to be anywhere between 700,000 and 1 million short of that mark, said Ruth Ann Schmitt, the executive director of Lawyers Trust Fund of Illinois. Harrison said the fee hikes are designed only to counter the shortfall in interest income, not add to the total amount available. \\"Our legal services are already stretched to the breaking point,\\" Schmitt said. \\"We have a tough time raising enough money to properly fund services that our clients need.\\" Neither the Illinois State Bar Association nor The Chicago Bar Association has taken a stance on the proposed hikes. Choose from options: Based on the paragraph, does the response \\"To improve legal facilities\\" correctly answer the question \\"Why does the Illinois Supreme Court want to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers?\\"? Available options: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"2). yes; The Illinois Supreme Court wants to raise the registration rates for Illinois lawyers to improve legal facilities for the poor. The fee hikes will help support pro-bono services and generate more funds for non-profit legal aid groups, which have faced a decline in funding due to low interest rates and a struggling economy. By raising the registration fees, the court aims to address the declining revenues and help provide better legal services to those who need it most. Other options like \\"no\\" are incorrect because the paragraph clearly explains the reason for wanting to raise the registration rates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this and answer the question Czech (/ˈtʃɛk/; čeština Czech pronunciation: [ˈt͡ʃɛʃcɪna]), formerly known as Bohemian (/boʊˈhiːmiən, bə-/; lingua Bohemica in Latin), is a West Slavic language strongly influenced by Latin and German language, spoken by over 10 million people and it is the official language of the Czech Republic. Czech's closest relative is Slovak, with which it is mutually intelligible. It is closely related to other West Slavic languages, such as Silesian and Polish. Although most Czech vocabulary is based on shared roots with Slavic, Romance, and Germanic languages, many loanwords (most associated with high culture) have been adopted in recent years. What languages strongly influenced Czech?","completion":"The Czech language has been strongly influenced by two main languages: Latin and German. Latin's influence on Czech can be traced back to the Middle Ages. During this period, Latin was widely used in areas such as science, law, and religion, leading to an influx of Latin words and phrases into the Czech language. Moreover, Latin was the language of the church and the royal court, adding to its influence. The German language influence on Czech can be attributed to the historical interactions between the German-speaking and Czech-speaking populations in Central Europe. The geographic closeness of Czech lands to German-speaking regions played a considerable role in this influence. Over the centuries, the linguistic exchange has been significant. During the Habsburg rule of Czech lands, German served as the language of administration and higher education, contributing to the Germanic influence on the Czech language. Additionally, it's worth noting that Czech has also been influenced by Slavic, Romance, and other Germanic languages. The language has also assimilated many loanwords, often associated with high culture, into its vocabulary in recent years."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Background: The sloping surface of the inclined plane supports part of the weight of the object as it moves up the slope. As a result, it takes less force to move the object uphill. The trade-off is that the object must be moved over a greater distance than if it were moved straight up to the higher elevation.

Furthermore, the premise states that Ted Kennedy's invocation of the family curse was a clever way of papering over these differences.

Question: The autumn storms had what effect on the North Sea by 1870? Context: The French Marines and naval infantry intended for the invasion of northern Germany were dispatched to reinforce the French Army of Châlons and fell into captivity at Sedan along with Napoleon III. A shortage of officers, following the capture of most of the professional French army at the Siege of Metz and at the Battle of Sedan, led naval officers to be sent from their ships to command hastily assembled reservists of the Garde Mobile. As the autumn storms of the North Sea forced the return of more of the French ships, the blockade of the north German ports diminished and in September 1870 the French navy abandoned the blockade for the winter. The rest of the navy retired to ports along the English Channel and remained in port for the rest of the war.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: While the numerical aperture can be used to compare resolutions of various objectives, it does not indicate how far the lens could be from the specimen. This is specified by the “working distance,” which is the distance (in mm usually) from the front lens element of the objective to the specimen, or cover glass. The higher the NA the closer the lens will be to the specimen and the more chances there are of breaking the cover slip and damaging both the specimen and the lens. The focal length of an objective lens is different than the working distance. This is because objective lenses are made of a combination of lenses and the focal length is measured from inside the barrel. The working distance is a parameter that microscopists can use more readily as it is measured from the outermost lens. The working distance decreases as the NA and magnification both increase.

Article: I call my story the story of a bad boy, partly to distinguish myself from those faultless young gentlemen, and partly because I really was not an angle. I may truthfully say I was a friendly, impulsive teenager. I didn't want to be an angel. In short, I was a real human boy, such as you may meet anywhere in New England. Whenever a new scholar came to our school, I used to ask him \\" My name's Tom Bailey; what's your name?\\" If the name struck me favorably, I shook hands with the new pupil _ , but if it didn't, I would turn and walk away, for I was particular on this point. I was born in Rivermouth almost fifty years ago, but, before I became very well acquainted with that pretty New England town, my parents moved to New Orleans. I was only eighteen months old at the time of the move, and it didn't make much difference to me where I was, because several years later, when my father proposed to take me North to be educated, I had my own view on the subject. I instantly kicked over the little boy, Sam, who happened to be standing by me at the moment, and declared that I would not be taken away to live among a lot of Yankees! You see I was what is called \\" a Northern man with Southern principles,\\" I had no recollection of New England: my earliest memories were connected with the South. I knew I was born in the North, but hoped nobody would find it out. I never told my schoolmates I was a Yankee, because they talked about Yankees in a scornful way which made me feel that it was quite a shame not to be born in the South. And this impression was strengthened by Aunt Chloe, who said, \\"There wasn't no gentlemen in the North no way.\\" With this picture of Northern civilization in my eye, the readers will easily understand my terror at the bare thought of being transported to Rivermouth to school, and possibly will forgive me for kicking over little Sam, when my father announced this to me.

First, I lived in a cottage that was in an old motel. It had a cottage in front where the landlady lived and there were ten little cottages in a half-moon configuration around it. Ours was a party place and we didn't have a phone. This was in the early 1970's. The landlady was in her 50's I'd guess. The only phone was a pay-phone outside her cottage and it was o party line with her phone. When we used it, she would try to listen, especially if we were talking to a girl. We could tell and sometimes we'd ask he to hang up, but other times we'd talk about sexy stuff and let her listen. We could hear her breathing heavy when we did. When we'd be parting, she'd come to the door wearing sexy clothes that were completely inappropriate and want to be invited in. Though we were a bunch of horny sailors, no one wanted any part of that. We never let her come in. I got married and moved into an apartment that was three rooms in a huge old house. They closed that Navy base and all of the sailors were transferred elsewhere. There were bumper-stickers that said, \\"Will the last sailor to leave, please turn out the lights.\\" In those days, Newport was a small town that leached off of sailors. My landlord said that when my wife and I were completely out and it was completely clean, he'd refund my deposit. We left the apartment immaculately clean and he wouldn't refund my deposit.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Monte Beragon, the second husband of Mildred Pierce, is shot. The police tell Mildred that the murderer is her first husband, Bert Pierce, after he is interrogated and confesses to the crime. Mildred protests that he is too kind and gentle to commit murder, and reveals her life story to the investigating officer in flashback. Mildred and Bert are unhappily married. Mildred must bake and sell pies and cakes to support the family after Bert splits with his business partner, Wally Fay. Bert bitterly accuses Mildred of favoring their daughters, especially Veda, over him. Their quarrel intensifies after a phone call from Bert's mistress, Maggie Biederhof, and they decide to separate. Mildred retains custody of her two daughters, the 16-year-old Veda, a bratty social climber and aspiring pianist, and 10-year-old Kay, a tomboy. Mildred's principal goal is to provide material possessions for Veda, who longs for a social status above that of her family and is ashamed of her mother's work as a baker. When Mildred is forced to take a job as a waitress, she tries to hide the fact from Veda, but Veda learns the truth and treats her mother with derision. Mildred meets Monte Beragon, a Pasadena society playboy and heir whose inheritance is almost depleted. Beragon owns the building that Mildred wants to purchase for a restaurant, and he pursues a romantic interest in her.

Are these two sentences paraphrases of each other?","completion":"No, these two sentences are not perfect paraphrases of each other. Here's why: A paraphrase is a restatement of the meaning of a text or passage using other words. The goal is to convey the same information using different words and structure while preserving the original meaning. In the first sentence, it's stated that \\"According to the United States Census Bureau, Harmony Township has a total area of, of which is land and , or 5.21%, is water.\\" The sentence features unspecified total area and land contents, but it does provide specific information about the water composition, which takes up 5.21% of the total area. The second sentence says, \\"According to the United States Census Bureau, Harmony Township has a total area of which land is and, or 5.21%, is water.\\" Like the first sentence, it does not specify the total area and land contents. It also provides specific information about the water composition, accounting for 5.21% of the total area. While these two sentences have similarities in their structure and they both reference data from the United States Census Bureau about the composition of Harmony Township, they aren't exact paraphrases of each other mainly because there are missing information in both sentences and it feels incomplete. They leave out significant facts such as the exact total land and water area, so one cannot be used to represent the other in full. Without the complete information, we are unable to accurately assess if they are genuine paraphrases. They share some elements, however, so if the missing information were the same in both sentences, it could be possible that they would be paraphrases of each other. But in the form as they're given now, they are not exact paraphrases based on the definition and general understanding of paraphrasing. To paraphrase correctly, all the key information from the original sentence needs to be preserved, but presented differently."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The Post's Lena Sun visited Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Silver Spring, Md., where scientists there identified a strain of bacteria resistant to the last-resort antibiotic, colistin. The bacteria was found in a Pennsylvania woman. Microbiologist Patrick McGann explains how his team identified the gene that gives the bacteria this resistance (Monica Akhtar,Lena Sun/The Washington Post) For the first time, researchers have found a person in the United States carrying bacteria resistant to antibiotics of last resort, an alarming development that the top U.S. public health official says could mean “the end of the road” for antibiotics. The antibiotic-resistant strain was found last month in the urine of a 49-year-old Pennsylvania woman. Defense Department researchers determined that she carried a strain of E. coli resistant to the antibiotic colistin, according to a study published Thursday in Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a publication of the American Society for Microbiology. The authors wrote that the discovery “heralds the emergence of a truly pan-drug resistant bacteria.” [How these biomedical detectives identified the dreaded new superbug in U.S.] Colistin is the antibiotic of last resort for particularly dangerous types of superbugs, including a family of bacteria known as CRE, which health officials have dubbed “nightmare bacteria.” In some instances, these superbugs kill up to 50 percent of patients who become infected. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has called CRE among the country’s most urgent public health threats. Health officials said the case in Pennsylvania, by itself, is not cause for panic. The strain found in the woman is still treatable with other antibiotics. But researchers worry that its colistin-resistance gene, known as mcr-1, could spread to other bacteria that can already evade other antibiotics. [Superbug known as ‘phantom menace’ on the rise in U.S.] It’s the first time this colistin-resistant strain has been found in a person in the United States. In November, public health officials worldwide reacted with alarm when Chinese and British researchers reported finding the colistin-resistant strain in pigs and raw pork and in a small number of people in China. The deadly strain was later discovered in Europe and elsewhere. In this Nov. 2015 video, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Thomas Frieden said that the CDC is committed to fighting antibiotic resistance. (YouTube/CDC) “It basically shows us that the end of the road isn’t very far away for antibiotics — that we may be in a situation where we have patients in our intensive care units, or patients getting urinary-tract infections for which we do not have antibiotics,” CDC Director Tom Frieden said in an interview Thursday. [1 in 3 antibiotics prescribed in U.S. are unnecessary] “I’ve been there for TB patients. I’ve cared for patients for whom there are no drugs left. It is a feeling of such horror and helplessness,” Frieden added. “This is not where we need to be.” Separately, researchers at the Agriculture Department and the Department of Health and Human Services reported that testing of hundreds of livestock and retail meats turned up the same colistin-resistant bacteria in a sample from a pig intestine in the United States. USDA said it is working to identify the farm the pig came from. CDC officials are working with Pennsylvania health authorities to interview the patient and family to identify how she may have contracted the bacteria, including reviewing recent hospitalizations and other health-care exposures. The CDC hopes to screen the patient and her contacts to see if others might be carrying the organism. Local and state health departments also will be collecting cultures as part of the investigation. ['A nightmare superbug': What is it? And what are the risks?] The woman was treated in an outpatient military facility in Pennsylvania, according to a Defense Department blog post about the findings. Samples were sent to the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for initial testing. Additional testing was done by a special Defense Department system that tracks multi-drug-resistant organisms. Thursday’s study did not disclose further details about the Pennsylvania woman or the outcome of her case. The authors could not be reached for comment. A spokesman at the Pennsylvania Department of Health was not immediately available to comment on the case. Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolfe (D) issued a statement saying his administration immediately began working with the CDC and the Defense Department to coordinate \\"an appropriate and collaborative\\" response. [Feds ramp up efforts to deal with antibiotic resistance] \\"We are taking the emergence of this resistance gene very seriously,\\" he said, adding that authorities will take all necessary actions to prevent it from becoming a widespread problem with \\"potentially serious consequences.\\" Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr. (D-Pa.) said he is concerned about the reports. In a statement, Casey said he supported legislation for and participated in hearings about antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which he said “present an urgent public health problem that we must focus on intensively.” He said he planned to get a full briefing on the case in the coming days. Colistin is widely used in Chinese livestock, and this probably led bacteria to evolve and gain a resistance to the drug. The gene probably leaped from livestock to human microbes through food, said Yohei Doi, an infectious-disease doctor at the University of Pittsburgh who has studied the problem. This animated video from 2013 from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention highlights the key points and graphics of the \\"Antibiotic Threats in the United States\\" report. (YouTube/CDC) \\"Food handlers may be at higher risk,\\" he said. In places like China, where live animal markets are often in close proximity to food stalls, it may be more likely for the bacteria to spread from animals to humans. He and other experts in infectious diseases called for speedier action to curb the overuse of antibiotics in livestock worldwide. \\"It's hard to imagine worse for public health in the United States,\\" Lance Price, director of the Antibiotic Resistance Action Center and a George Washington University professor, said Thursday in a statement about the case. \\"We may soon be facing a world where CRE infections are untreatable.\\" Scientists rang the alarm bells about the gene in November, but not enough attention was paid. \\"Now we find that this gene has made its way into pigs and people, and people in the U.S.,\\" Price said. \\"If our leaders were waiting to act until they could see the cliff's edge -- I hope this opens their eyes to the abyss that lies before us.\\" Scientists and public health officials have long warned that if the resistant bacteria continue to spread, treatment options could be seriously limited. Routine operations could become deadly. Minor infections could become life-threatening crises. Pneumonia could be more and more difficult to treat. Already, doctors had been forced to rely on colistin as a last-line defense against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The drug is hardly ideal. It is more than half a century old and can seriously damage a patient’s kidneys. And yet, because doctors have run out of weapons to fight a growing number of infections that evade more-modern antibiotics, it has become a critical tool in fighting off some of the most tenacious infections. Bacteria develop antibiotic resistance in two ways. Many acquire mutations in their own genomes that allow them to withstand antibiotics, although that ability can’t be shared with pathogens outside their own family. [Scientists discover why pancreatic cancer resists chemotherapy drug] Other bacteria rely on a shortcut: They get infected with something called a plasmid, a small piece of DNA, carrying a gene for antibiotic resistance. That makes resistance genes more dangerous because plasmids can make copies of themselves and transfer the genes they carry to other bugs within the same family as well as jump to other families of bacteria, which can then “catch” the resistance directly without having to develop it through evolution. The colistin-resistant E. coli found in the Pennsylvania woman has this type of resistance gene. Public health officials say they have been expecting this resistance gene to turn up in the United States. “This is definitely alarming,” said David Hyun, a senior officer leading an antibiotic-resistance project at the Pew Charitable Trust. “The fact that we found it in the United States confirms our suspicions and adds urgency to actions we need to work on antibiotic stewardship and surveillance for this type of resistance.” Late last year, as part of a broader budget deal, Congress agreed to give hundreds of millions of dollars to the federal agencies engaged in the battle against antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The largest chunk of that money, more than 150 million, was slated to go to the CDC as part of an effort to build and strengthen capacity at state and local health departments to prevent and monitor superbug outbreaks. Other funding went to the National Institutes of Health for research on combating antimicrobial resistance, as well as to an agency known as BARDA, which works on national preparedness for chemical and biological threats, including developing new therapies.

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. / Updated By Maggie Fox A drug-resistant “superbug” that doctors have been dreading has shown up in the U.S. for the first time, researchers reported Thursday. The bacteria has genetic changes that make it resistant to a last-ditch antibiotic called colistin and while it had been seen in Europe and China, no one in the U.S. had been seen with it before. A team at the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research identified a strain of E coli from a Pennsylvania woman that carries a much-feared gene called mcr-1 that turns bacteria into \\"superbugs. Here, a lab worker tests some of the sample. Walter Reed Army Institute of Research It doesn’t spell doom just yet. The mutant E. coli germ was found in a Pennsylvania woman with symptoms of a urinary tract infection, but it does not appear to be spreading at epidemic proportions. And it was susceptible to other antibiotics, so the patient was not left without any hope. What's worrying is the gene that made the E. coli drug-resistant. It's called mcr-1, and it is passed from one bacteria to another. It sits on a piece of material called a plasmid, which makes it easy for one species of bacteria to pass it along to another species of bacteria. Scientist fear an E. coli bacteria with the mcr-1 gene could pass it to another superbug with other mutations-- creating a truly super-superbug that resists all known antibiotics. \\"It is the end of the road for antibiotics unless we act urgently.\\" If such a superbug spread, it would take the world back to a time when there were no antibiotics, says Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \\"It is the end of the road for antibiotics unless we act urgently,\\" he said. This discovery suggests the drug-resistance gene has been here in the U.S., flying under the radar. “This patient hadn’t traveled,” Frieden said. Patrick McGann and colleagues at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research just outside Washington D.C. have been looking at samples from patients, keeping an eye out for bacteria with the mutation. They reported Thursday they found one. The sample is E. coli bacteria with mcr-1. \\"I was extremely surprised when it came up positive,\\" McGann told NBC News. It was the very first sample his lab tested in the new search for the gene. This little stretch of DNA, which bacteria can swap easily among themselves, gives them the ability to fight off the effects of colistin. \\"It was an old antibiotic, but it was the only one left for what I called nightmare bacteria, carbapenem-resistant enterobacteriaceae, or CRE,\\" Frieden said. Luckily, this particular bacteria was not also resistant to carbapenems. But it was resistant to several other classes of antibiotics, including fluoroquinolones, and the fact that it had the mcr-1 gene raises alarm bells. “To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of mcr-1 in the USA,” the Walter Reed researchers wrote in their report, published in the journal Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy. They’ve only been looking for this particular mutation for three weeks, so they said they’re not sure just how widespread it is. “We know now that the more we look, the more we are going to find,” Frieden said in a speech at the National Press Club in Washington. “The more we look at drug resistance, the more concerned we become.” Later Thursday, the health and Human Services Department said scientists had also found the mcr-1 mutation in a sample from a pig. \\"Out of 949 animal samples screened so far, one strain of colistin-resistant E. coli was found in a pig intestinal sample,\\" it said in a statement. \\"The DNA sequence of this isolate revealed that the strain contained the mcr-1 gene on a plasmid. The scientists also determined that the mcr-1 carrying colistin-resistantE. coli is resistant to other antibiotics including ampicillin, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline.\\" CDC has been warning for years about the threat of drug-resistant bacteria. It’s been urging drug companies to develop new antibiotics, and asking people to make better use of the antibiotics now available so that more superbugs do not evolve. “The medicine cabinet is empty for some patients,” Frieden said. The CDC said it was working with the state health department in Pennsylvania to talk to the patient and her family to see how she may have been infected. \\"We know now that the more we look, the more we are going to find.\\" They’ll also test others in the area who may have been in contact to see if they are carrying the bacteria – which may not necessarily cause illness or any symptoms at all. \\"An urgent public health response is underway to contain and prevent potential spread of mcr-1,\\" Walter Reed said in a statement. Dr. David Hyun of the Pew Charitable Trusts, who follows the issue of drug-resistant bacteria, said details will be important. \\"I am very interested in finding out how did this patient do,\\" he told NBC News. \\"What kind of treatment did she receive?\\" There have been reports in other countries of patients with bacteria carrying mcr-1, but not many details of how they were cared for or whether other antibiotics cured their infections. Related: Patients Carry Superbugs on Their Hands Colistin, used to treat carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae or CRE, is an older antibiotic with some tough side-effects such as kidney damage. That's why it's only used as a last resort. Hyun said in several of the international cases, people have been infected with CRE that carried the mcr-1 gene. That would leave them with few, if any, option for treatment. \\"If we are finding it in other countries, chances are that it's already happened in the United States as well,\\" he said. Bacteria develop resistance to drugs quickly. Even before penicillin was introduced in 1943, staphylococcus germs had genes that would have made them resistant to its effects. Just nine years after tetracycline was introduced in 1950, a resistant strain of Shigella evolved. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) evolved just two years after methicillin hit the market in 1960. The last new antibiotic to be introduced was ceftaroline, in 2010. It took just a year for the first staph germ to evolve that resisted its effects. The CDC says more than two million people are infected by drug-resistant germs each year, and 23,000 die of their infections. The biggest killer by far in the U.S. is diarrhea-causing C. difficile. Near-untreatable cases of diarrhea, sepsis, pneumonia and gonorrhea are infecting millions more globally, the World Health Organization says. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A strain of E.coli bacteria found in a woman from Pennsylvania is the first case of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the US. Although the strain is resistant to antibiotics such as colistin, it remains treatable by other means. The US is now at risk to the rise of untreatable bacteria, as the E.coli bacteria contains the colistin-resistant mcr-1 gene, which can spread easily to bacteria that are immune to other antibiotics, thereby making antibiotic-resistant infections more difficult to treat.

Ever wanted to know just how much Hollywood could get away with before the Hayes Code was officially put into effect? Well, unfortunately \\"Convention City\\" is lost, so well just have to watch \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" to find out. For 1934, there is a remarkable amount of sexual innuendo and even exposed flesh. Just look at Jane's nude swim. While Tarzan is often thought of as b-adventure films made for young boys and no one else, this picture proves that the series was originally very adult. Over seventy years later, it is still as sexy as it was when it came out. In addition to the envelope pushing taboo nature, it is a superb and exciting adventure story. I've always enjoyed the jungle films that Hollywood churned out in the 30s and the 40s, but there are few from the genre I'd call great films. \\"Tarzan and His Mate\\" is by far the best film from this long gone subgenre. The sequences of the attacks on the safari by either apes or natives still manage to create tension today. Also, the animals are all too cool (espescially the apes throwing boulders). The acting won't win any major awards soon, but is certainly more than adequate for this type of picture. The film is once again stolen by Cheetah, the smartest monkey in the jungle.

Question: New evidence suggests that \\"hot spots\\" may form in response to \\"twisting\\" stresses on plates. It is theorized that these stresses may eventually result in the splitting apart of the tectonic plate in the area of the hot spot. Which of the geographic features would be affected most by the splitting of a tectonic plate? Answer:","completion":"The splitting of a tectonic plate would have a significant impact on various geographic features in the area of the \\"hot spot.\\" Some of the most affected geographic features would include: 1. Mountain Ranges: When tectonic plates split apart, large chunks of the Earth's crust may be displaced, leading to the creation of new mountain ranges or the modification of existing ones. This can significantly alter the local landscape and ecology by affecting precipitation patterns, creating new ecosystems, and generating new habitats for various species. In some cases, mountain ranges can also disappear, causing major changes to regional geography. 2. Volcanoes: Volcanic activity is closely associated with tectonic plate movements, and the splitting of a plate can lead to the formation of new volcanoes or the reactivation of dormant ones. Due to the movement and interaction of magma beneath the Earth's crust, the splitting of a tectonic plate can increase the likelihood of volcanic eruptions in the affected region. This can have significant implications for local populations, who may be exposed to the hazards associated with volcanic activity, including ashfall, lahars, and pyroclastic flows. 3. Earthquakes: As tectonic plates split apart and interact with one another, stress accumulates along the boundaries between plates, leading to an increased likelihood of earthquakes. These seismic events can cause significant damage to infrastructure, disrupt transportation and communication networks, and pose a serious threat to human life. In some instances, the splitting of a tectonic plate can even trigger major earthquakes that can have devastating effects on entire regions. 4. Rift Valleys: The opening and widening of rift valleys is a direct consequence of the splitting of tectonic plates. As plates pull apart, rift valleys form and can often fill with water, creating large lakes or even seas. This can significantly impact water resources, migration patterns of species, and the overall landscape of the affected region. 5. Oceanic Trenches: The process of seafloor spreading and tectonic plate movement can cause the formation of deep trenches in the ocean floor. This occurs as one tectonic plate is pushed beneath another, resulting in the subduction of a portion of the Earth's crust. Oceanic trenches can have a significant impact on ocean circulation patterns, marine ecosystems, and the distribution of nutrients in the affected area. 6. Coastal Erosion and Creation: As tectonic plates split, continents and islands may be physically shifted or even separated, resulting in the rapid erosion or creation of coastal features like beaches, cliffs, and inlets. This can have a significant impact on local ecosystems, as well as on human settlements and infrastructure located near the coastlines. In conclusion, the splitting of a tectonic plate could lead to significant changes in the geographic features of the region surrounding the \\"hot spot.\\" Mountain ranges, volcanoes, earthquakes, rift valleys, oceanic trenches and coastal features would be the most affected by this geological process. As these features evolve, the resulting alterations to the landscape can have far-reaching consequences for both local ecosystems and human populations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Irving, was an English stage actor in the Victorian era, known as an actor-manager because he took complete responsibility (supervision of sets, lighting, direction, casting, as well as playing the leading roles) for season after season at the Lyceum Theatre, establishing himself and his company as representative of English classical theatre. In 1895 he became the first actor to be awarded a knighthood, indicating full acceptance into the higher circles of British society. Irving is widely acknowledged to be one of the inspirations for Count Dracula, the title character of the 1897 novel Dracula whose author, Bram Stoker, was business manager of the theatre. After a few years' schooling while living at Halsetown, near St Ives, Cornwall, Irving became a clerk to a firm of East India merchants in London, but he soon gave up a commercial career for acting. On 29 September 1856 he made his first appearance at Sunderland as Gaston, Duke of Orleans, in Bulwer Lytton's play, Richelieu, billed as Henry Irving. This name he eventually assumed by royal licence. When the inexperienced Irving got stage fright and was hissed off the stage the actor Samuel Johnson was among those who supported him with practical advice. Later in life Irving gave them all regular work when he formed his own Company at the Lyceum Theatre. For 10 years, he went through an arduous training in various stock companies in Scotland and the north of England, taking more than 500 parts. his delineations of the various characters (...) were admirably graphic, and met with repeated rounds of applause. Possesed of a fine voice, which he modulated with great taste and judgment, he was able to mark the depth or frivolity of the character he was representing with remarkable facility. He gained recognition by degrees, and in 1866 Ruth Herbert engaged him as her leading man and sometime stage director at the St. James's Theatre, London, where she first played Doricourt in The Belle's Stratagem. One piece that he directed there was W. S. Gilbert's first successful solo play, Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack (1866) The next year he joined the company of the newly opened Queen's Theatre, where he acted with Charles Wyndham, J. L. Toole, Lionel Brough, John Clayton, Mr. and Mrs. Alfred Wigan, Ellen Terry and Nellie Farren. This was followed by short engagements at the Haymarket Theatre, Drury Lane, and the Gaiety Theatre. Finally he made his first conspicuous success as Digby Grant in James Albery's Two Roses, which was produced at the Vaudeville Theatre on 4 June 1870 and ran for a very successful 300 nights. In 1871, Irving began his association with the Lyceum Theatre by an engagement under Bateman's management. The fortunes of the house were at a low ebb when the tide was turned by Irving's sudden success as Mathias in The Bells, a version of Erckmann-Chatrian's Le Juif polonais by Leopold Lewis, a property which Irving had found for himself. The play ran for 150 nights, established Irving at the forefront of the British drama, and would prove a popular vehicle for Irving for the rest of his professional life. With Bateman, Irving was seen in W. G. Wills' Charles I and Eugene Aram, in Richelieu, and in 1874 in Hamlet. The unconventionality of this last performance, during a run of 200 nights, aroused keen discussion and singled him out as the most interesting English actor of his day. In 1875, again with Bateman, he was seen as the title character in Macbeth; in 1876 as Othello, and as Philip in Alfred Lord Tennyson's Queen Mary; in 1877 in Richard III; and in The Lyons Mail. During this time he became lifelong friends with Bram Stoker, who praised him in his review of Hamlet and thereafter joined Irving as the manager for the company.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Background: Any unused energy in food—whether it comes from carbohydrates, proteins, or lipids—is stored in the body as fat. An extra 3,500 Calories of energy results in the storage of almost half a kilogram (1 pound) of stored body fat. People who consistently consume more food energy then they need may become obese. Obesity occurs when the body mass index is 30.0 kg/m 2 or greater. Body mass index (BMI) is an estimate of the fat content of the body. It is calculated by dividing a person’s weight (in kilograms) by the square of the person’s height (in meters). Obesity increases the risk of health problems such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Paragraph: Two groups of adults were a part of a diet experiment. Group Brown ate 3500 extra calories a day for 3 months, while group Yellow, had a normal diet. Group Brown gained a lot of weight. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which group has a smaller chance of getting more health problems? A:","completion":"Group Yellow Given the paragraph above, Group Yellow, which followed a normal diet, has a smaller chance of getting more health problems. This is because Group Brown consumed 3500 extra calories a day for three months, leading to significant weight gain.

Step 2: Analyze the information given - A weak immune system is assumed, so we should think about how this might affect the viral reproduction process. Step 3: Connect the weak immune system to the viral reproduction process - A weak immune system means that the body's defense mechanisms are not functioning at their optimal level, which could lead to a reduced ability to fight off infections and prevent viral replication. Step 4: Determine the impact on the number of viruses coming out of the cell - Due to the weak immune system, the body might not be able to effectively combat and limit viral replication. However, the question asks for the outcome of less viruses coming out of the cell. In this case, the weak immune system may actually result in fewer viruses being eliminated by the body's defenses, meaning that the number of viruses coming out of the cell could potentially be less than in an individual with a healthier immune system.

Answer the above question based on the context below: The highlight of Doubleday's career came after 7 February 1845 when a young man, who later admitted having spent the prior week \\"indulging in intemperance\\", smashed the Portland Vase, an example of Roman cameo glass and among the most famous glass items in the world, into hundreds of pieces. After his selection for the restoration, Doubleday commissioned a watercolour painting of the fragments by Thomas H. Shepherd. No account of his restoration survives, but on 1 May he discussed it in front of the Society of Antiquaries of London, and by 10 September he had glued the vase whole again. Only 37 small splinters, most from the interior or thickness of the vase, were left out; the cameo base disc, which was found to be a modern replacement, was set aside for separate display. A new base disc of plain glass, with a polished exterior and matte interior, was diamond-engraved \\"Broke Feby 7th 1845 Restored Sept 10th 1845 By John Doubleday\\". The British Museum awarded Doubleday an additional £25 (equivalent to £2,500 in 2016) for his work.At the time the restoration was termed \\"masterly\\" and Doubleday was lauded by The Gentleman's Magazine for demonstrating \\"skilful ingenuity\\" and \\"cleverness ... sufficient to establish his immortality as the prince of restorers\\". In 2006 William Andrew Oddy, a former keeper of conservation at the museum, noted that the achievement \\"must rank him in the forefront of the craftsmen-restorers of his time.\\" Doubleday's restoration would remain for more than 100 years until the adhesive grew increasingly discoloured.

Answer the following question: You are presented with the quiz \\"what uses hearing to sense sound?\\" But you don't know the answer, so you turn to your teacher to ask for hints. He says that \\"hearing is used for sensing sound by animals\\" and \\"cows are social animals\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? Answer:","completion":"Based on the hints provided by the teacher, the best answer to the question \\"What uses hearing to sense sound?\\" would be \\"animals,\\" and more specifically, in the context of the hint, \\"cows\\" can be considered as an example of animals that use hearing to sense sound. Hearing is a vital sense that helps animals to perceive their environment, communicate with each other, and detect potential threats or opportunities for survival and reproduction. In the case of cows, as mentioned by the teacher, they are social animals, which implies that they use sounds to maintain communication and social order within their groups, known as herds. Cows, like many other animals, have a well-developed auditory system that enables them to detect a range of frequencies, interpret sounds, and respond accordingly. Their ears can move in different directions, allowing them to localize the source of a sound, and their highly sensitive hearing helps them stay alert to any relevant auditory cues in their surroundings. This is important for cows as they rely on effective communication to maintain their social structure, for example, when a cow is in distress, it can produce specific vocalizations that alert other cows in the herd. Furthermore, hearing plays a crucial role in ensuring the safety and well-being of cows, as it allows them to be aware of potential predators or dangers in the environment. This early detection system is particularly crucial for newborn calves, who rely heavily on hearing their mother's calls to remain close to her and stay protected. In summary, the best answer to the quiz question is that animals, like cows, use hearing to sense sound. Hearing is an essential sense for these animals as it facilitates effective communication within their social groups or herds and enables them to stay vigilant to potential dangers and threats in their environment."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before Elmo and Carsie got together, Elmo and Macy used to spend hours almost every night in that room. Some nights he had almost kissed her. She left her milk and cookies on the kitchen counter and went down another flight of stairs, which came out in the Recreation Room. Macy could hear the sound of the TV coming from Media Room.

Mike now needs to figure out how the predator prey relationship balance the ecosystem. But I can use this background: Predators play an important role in an ecosystem. For example, if they did not exist, then a single species could become dominant over others. Grazers on a grassland keep grass from growing out of control. Predators can be keystone species . These are species that can have a large effect on the balance of organisms in an ecosystem. For example, if all of the wolves are removed from a population, then the population of deer or rabbits may increase. If there are too many deer, then they may decrease the amount of plants or grasses in the ecosystem. Decreased levels of producers may then have a detrimental effect on the whole ecosystem. In this example, the wolves would be a keystone species. What is an answer for this question: If species B population increase, would species C population increase or decrease? Answer:","completion":"If species B population increases, species C population would likely decrease.

Jaojoby's success and popularity attained new heights in 1998 with the release of E! Tiako. He was named \\"Artist of the Year\\" in Madagascar for two consecutive years (1998–1999), and the single \\"Malemilemy\\" received regular airplay across the island more than a year after the album was released. In July 1999, Jaojoby was named Goodwill Ambassador to the United Nations Population Fund and supported the United Nations' activities in Madagascar related to raising awareness of sexually transmitted diseases, unintended pregnancy, and other concerns relevant to the Malagasy youth population. The lyrics of his songs commonly address social issues, typified by a track on E! Tiako that encourages the use of condoms to avoid contracting HIV/AIDS.Aza Arianao was recorded over five days in the summer of 2000 and released the following year. In the wake of its success, Jaojoby performed at a political rally to an audience of 50,000 partisans of candidate Marc Ravalomanana less than a month before the divisive 2001 presidential elections that nearly resulted in the secession of the island's coastal provinces. Jaojoby's 2004 follow-up album Malagasy, which was recorded in semi-live conditions on the island of Réunion in a small venue before an audience of the artist's friends, featured lyrics that sought to promote optimism and national reconciliation; the artist announced that he would not involve himself in national politics in the future. The same year he toured extensively in France, the United States and Canada.The March 2008 release of Donnant-Donnant celebrated Jaojoby's roots as a cabaret performer of soul, funk, and other Western popular genres.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Talking Heads were an American rock band formed in 1975 in New York City and active until 1991. The band comprised David Byrne (lead vocals, guitar), Chris Frantz (drums), Tina Weymouth (bass), and Jerry Harrison (keyboards, guitar). Described by critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine as \\"one of the most critically acclaimed bands of the '80s\\", the group helped to pioneer new wave music by integrating elements of punk, art rock, funk, and world music with avant-garde sensibilities and an anxious, clean-cut image. Former art school students, who became involved in the 1970s New York punk scene, Talking Heads released their debut Despite David Byrne's lack of interest in another album, Tina Weymouth, Chris Frantz, and Jerry Harrison reunited for a one-off album called No Talking, Just Head under the name The Heads in 1996. The album featured a number of vocalists, including Debbie Harry of Blondie, Johnette Napolitano of Concrete Blonde, Andy Partridge of XTC, Gordon Gano of Violent Femmes, Michael Hutchence of INXS, Ed Kowalczyk of Live, Shaun Ryder of Happy Mondays, Richard Hell, and Maria McKee. The album was accompanied by a tour, which featured Johnette Napolitano as the vocalist. Byrne took legal action against the rest of the band to prevent them using the name \\"Talking Heads\\", something he saw as \\"a pretty obvious attempt to cash in on the Talking Heads name\\". They opted to record and tour as \\"The Heads\\". Likewise, Byrne continues his solo career. Meanwhile, Harrison became a record producer of some note - his resume includes the Violent Femmes' The Blind Leading the Naked, the Fine Young Cannibals' The Raw and the Cooked, General Public's Rub It Better, Crash Test Dummies' God Shuffled His Feet, Live's Mental Jewelry, Throwing Copper and The Distance To Here, No Doubt's song \\"New\\" from Return of Saturn, and in 2010, work by The Black and White Years and Kenny Wayne Shepherd. Frantz and Weymouth, who married in 1977, had been recording on the side as Tom Tom Club since 1981. Tom Tom Club's self-titled debut album sold almost as well as Talking Heads themselves, leading to the band appearing in Stop Making Sense. They achieved several pop/rap hits during the dance-club cultural boom era of the early 1980s, particularly in the UK, where they still enjoy a strong fan following today. Their best-known single, \\"Genius of Love\\", has been sampled numerous times, notably on old school hip hop classic \\"It's Nasty (Genius of Love)\\" by Grandmaster Flash and on Mariah Carey's 1995 hit \\"Fantasy\\". They also have produced several artists, including Happy Mondays and Ziggy Marley. The Tom Tom Club continue to record and tour intermittently, although commercial releases have become sporadic since 1991. The band played \\"Life During Wartime\\", \\"Psycho Killer\\", and \\"Burning Down the House\\" together on March 18, 2002, at the ceremony of their induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. However, reuniting for a concert tour is unlikely. David Byrne states: \\"We did have a lot of bad blood go down. That's one reason, and another is that musically we're just miles apart.\\" Weymouth, however, has been critical of Byrne, describing him as \\"a man incapable of returning friendship\\" and saying that he doesn't \\"love\\" her, Frantz, and Harrison. Did they go on tour when they reunited in 1996?","completion":"When some members of the Talking Heads reunited in 1996, they went on a tour.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Magma crystalizes - Lava cools on the surface - Lava crystalizes - Minerals dissolved in water crystlize. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step in the process you have described, which covers the formation of igneous and sedimentary rocks through crystallization, is the generation of molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle. This complex process can be outlined as follows: 1. Formation of Magma or Lava: Magma is formed through the process of melting within Earth's mantle and crust. This can occur due to various factors, such as increased temperature and pressure or the addition of water and other volatiles in the mantle rocks. In some cases, the melting of existing rocks can also generate magma. Typically, the mantle's composition consists of solid silicate minerals, which begin to melt when exposed to high temperatures and pressures or when they come into contact with hotter materials from the Earth's core. As the molten material rises, it forms magma chambers in the crust. When magma reaches the Earth's surface, it is known as lava. This can occur during a volcanic eruption, where molten rock or lava is expelled from a vent or fissured area of Earth's crust. Lava can also be extruded quietly and slowly from volcanic fissures without any explosive activity. 2. Magma Crystallizes: As magma cools, minerals start to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is called crystallization, and the resulting rocks are classified as igneous rocks, particularly intrusive (or plutonic) rocks, as they form beneath the Earth's surface. Examples of intrusive rocks include granite and gabbro. The rate at which the magma cools and the specific minerals present determine the size and texture of the resulting rock. 3. Lava Cools on the Surface: When lava reaches the Earth's surface and flows out of a volcanic vent or fissure, it starts to cool and solidify. This process is quicker than the crystallization of magma beneath the surface due to the exposure to ambient temperature and air. The cooling allows minerals to crystallize and form solid rock, developing into extrusive (or volcanic) igneous rocks. Examples of extrusive rocks include basalt and andesite. 4. Lava Crystallizes: As lava cools, the minerals within it begin to crystallize and form solid rock. This process is similar to the crystallization of magma beneath the surface but occurs more rapidly. The resulting rocks are also classified as igneous rocks and are grouped as extrusive rocks since they form at or near the Earth's surface. 5. Minerals Dissolved in Water Crystallize: In addition to igneous rocks, crystals also form through the process of precipitation from water solutions. Over time, minerals dissolved in water can reach supersaturated levels, causing them to crystallize and form solid rock. This process, known as precipitation, contributes to the formation of sedimentary rocks, such as limestone, evaporites, and chert. These rocks are composed of mineral grains deposited from a water-based solution, like lakes, oceans, or groundwater. In summary, the missing first step in the process you have outlined is the formation of the molten material (magma or lava) from Earth's mantle through melting induced by factors like increased temperature, pressure, or the addition of water and other volatiles. This sets the stage for the series of steps that follow, leading to the crystallization of igneous and sedimentary rocks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Miami Heat NBA Win Streak Ends at 27 After Loss to Chicago Bulls CHICAGO—With two-tenths of a second left, LeBron James took the final inbounds pass in his own end, dropped the ball to let time expire, turned and walked toward the exit. No record for James and the Miami Heat, either. The Heat's bid for NBA history ended Wednesday night when their 27-game winning streak was snapped by the Chicago Bulls 101-97, setting off a raucous celebration inside United Center. Miami Heat forward LeBron James expressing displeasure at a second-half call—a theme he picked up after the game Miami finished six shy of the 33-game record held by the 1971-72 Los Angeles Lakers. James said there was no shame in falling short. \\"It's one of the best that this league has ever seen,\\" James said, referring to the streak that began on Super Bowl Sunday, Feb. 3. \\"We recognized that and rightfully so.\\" James tried to spur yet another comeback in the final minutes, getting mad after a rough foul. But the reigning MVP could never get the defending champions even or, more importantly, ahead. Luol Deng scored 28 points, Carlos Boozer added 21 points and 17 rebounds, and the Bulls brought the Heat's stampede to a screeching halt. Miami's superstar did all he could to keep the run going, scoring 32 points and even collecting a flagrant foul during a physical final few minutes. \\"We haven't had a chance to really have a moment to know what we just did,\\" James said. \\"We had a moment, just very fortunate, very humbling and blessed to be part of this team and be part of a streak like that.\\" For the better part of two months, since they lost since to the Pacers in Indianapolis on Feb. 1, the Heat were the NBA's comeback kings. They erased seven double-digit deficits during the streak, once rallying from 27 down in Cleveland. They found themselves trailing in the fourth quarter 11 times, and won them all. \\"We understand, probably more so later on in our careers, the significance of that. And then that was it,\\" Heat coach Erik Spoelstra said. \\"We took that moment to acknowledge it, to acknowledge each other, that experience, but it was never about the streak. We have a bigger goal, but also right now, it's about 'Are we getting better?'\\" They walked off the floor stoically after the loss, not exchanging any handshakes or pleasantries with the Bulls. James slapped high-fives with a couple of teammates and coaches, then glared at a fan who grabbed his head as he headed toward the tunnel leading to the visitors' locker room. James was frustrated on the court at times, and showed more of the same in the locker room afterward with regard to how he's officiated. He cited two instances from Wednesday alone—a play where Kirk Hinrich took him down with two hands in the first quarter, and one where Taj Gibson appeared to make contact around his neck with about four minutes remaining—where he thought the contact was excessive. Referees reviewed the Gibson hit, but did not award a flagrant foul. So, seconds later, James tried to barrel through Carlos Boozer on a screen, only to be called for a flagrant four himself. \\"Those are not basketball plays and it's been happening all year,\\" James said. \\"I've been able to keep my cool and try to tell Spo, 'Let's not worry about it too much,' but it is getting to me a little bit.\\" The Bulls, meanwhile, whooped and slapped hands with anyone they could reach. It will go down as the second-longest winning streak in the history of American major pro sports. And some of those long-ago Lakers believed their streak would be surpassed this time, with Jerry West among those saying that he believed the reigning NBA champions had a real shot at pulling it off. The streak began in Toronto, a day when Heat players were mildly annoyed about having to miss football's title game. They were scheduled to be flying home at Super Bowl time, for a game the following night. So team officials changed course, as a surprise. After Miami beat the Raptors that afternoon, they stayed in the city several more hours to watch the Super Bowl together, an event highlighted by an impromptu Shane Battier speech about appreciating little moments as a team. For whatever reason, the Heat were unbeatable for nearly the next two months, winning every which way—from blowing out good teams like the Los Angeles Clippers, Oklahoma City Thunder and the Bulls to inexplicably struggling to overcome lottery-bound Cleveland, Detroit, Sacramento, Charlotte and Orlando. There was the 27-point, third-quarter hole at Cleveland, a 13-point deficit with eight minutes left against Boston, and 11-point deficits against Detroit and Charlotte—all in a seven-day span, no less. \\"There are several teams that can do it,\\" Pistons guard Jose Calderon said, when asked what it would take for someone to beat Miami. \\"It's difficult to maintain this concentration every day. It will likely take everyone to have a bad day.\\" Even when those bad days happened, the Heat found ways to win. A layup by James with 3.2 seconds left against Orlando. Double-overtime against Sacramento. Huge comebacks. Whatever it took. \\"To do something like this, everyone needs to step up,\\" said Battier, who was earlier part of a 32-game winning streak at Duke and a 22-gamer with the Houston Rockets. There were times when even the Heat themselves didn't know how long the streak was. Because it was interrupted by the All-Star break, Spoelstra was surprised when a staff member said something about Miami having won nine in a row. When it was at 24 games, Dwyane Wade made a reference to \\"23, 24, whatever it is.\\" They insisted they did not care about it, whatever the number was. Heat President Pat Riley, who played for the Lakers team that won 33 in a row, remained silent throughout Miami's streak—both because he rarely gives interviews these days because the official team stance was that it simply did not matter. This season is championship-or-bust for Miami. Still, the streak will go down as the story of the regular season. When it started, Miami was 5½ games behind San Antonio for the overall NBA lead, only a half-game ahead of New York in the Eastern Conference race, held just a four-game edge over Atlanta in the Southeast Division and were the league's ninth-best road team by of winning percentage. Funny what two months or so without losing can do. The Heat now sit atop the overall NBA standings, gained 12 games over New York in the East entering Wednesday, put away the Hawks for good several weeks ago and are now, by far, the league's best road team. And with the streak over, all that's left now is getting ready for the postseason. They trailed by as much as 13 in the first half, took the lead while outscoring Chicago 22-14 in the third quarter and were within two early in the fourth after a basket by Wade. That's when Deng answered with a 3-pointer from the wing and Kirk Hinrich brought the crowd to its feet with a floater. Then, after a layup by James, Deng nailed a 3 to make it 83-75 with just over six minutes left. It got testy after that. James did all he could to keep the streak going, taking enough hard hits that even his headband was dislodged, and finished with seven rebounds. Chris Bosh scored 21. Wade added 18 points after a sore right knee sidelined him for victories over Charlotte and Orlando, but the Heat fell to a team that continues to give them fits even though Derrick Rose has been sidelined all year. Deng came up big, burying four 3-pointers. He also had seven rebounds and five assists. Boozer was a force inside. Jimmy Butler provided a spark with 17 points and the Bulls stopped Miami even though they were missing Joakim Noah (right foot), Marco Belinelli (abdominal strain) and Richard Hamilton (lower back). For the Heat, luck simply ran out after all those recent late rallies—though when Battier nailed a 3 with 4:30 left in the third quarter to give them a 59-58 lead, it looked like they just might pull this one out, too. They were up by two in the closing seconds of the quarter when Boozer converted a three-point play off a neat bounce pass from Taj Gibson to send Chicago into the final 12 minutes with a 69-68 lead. Miami failed to close again, and as the game neared the finish the fans started chanting \\"End of streak! End of streak!\\" \\"We were much more competitive in the second half. It became make or miss in the fourth quarter, and we couldn't get the necessary stops we needed to,\\" Spoelstra said. \\"In the last handful of games, those shots were going down and maybe that masked a few things going down the stretch.\\" The Bulls were the biggest threat to Miami in the Eastern Conference the past two years, but without superstar Rose, they're just part of the pack. Still, the Bulls have now won two of the past three, winning in Miami in early January and falling at the United Center last month before Wednesday's win.

Latif comes from an upper-class family and had attended school with Uday, where the other students would remark on their likeness. Latif initially refuses the position, but is imprisoned and tortured, ultimately relenting when his family is threatened. Latif undergoes minor cosmetic surgery to perfect his resemblance to Uday and practices emulating the young Hussein's mannerisms and wildly volatile persona. He is given access to all of the luxurious benefits of the Husseins' fortune, including massive palaces, expensive wardrobes and Uday's Ferrari and various other exotic cars.

He goes where he’s needed, putting on free-of-charge rock shows that spread messages of hope, encouragement and empowerment to middle school and high school students who are suffering — often in silence. His band has performed in many communities in crisis, such as the Pimicikamak Cree Nation in northern Manitoba, which made headlines earlier this year after six young people died by suicide in the span of three months. More than 100 are on suicide watch. Like the new ink on his arm, Nash has made an indelible impression on many kids. Now, more than 500 students have handed him suicide notes — and that number doesn’t include the kids who have reached out to him via social media. He’s kept many of the notes, but stresses that all suicide letters he receives are dealt with by the appropriate professionals. Nash and his band are not counsellors; they are there, as he puts it, to open a dialogue about suicide and self-harm. He works closely with schools so students can get the follow-up help they need. Many of his fans have his name or his inspirational lyrics tattooed on their arms. Taylor Bowman, a young woman I first met at one of Nash’s shows last spring, has both. His name is inked on her arm; now hers is inked on his. \\"I want to show them that they’re a big part of my life as well,\\" Nash tells me. \\"I’m glad I got the second chance when I came back from the dead after a car accident, and this is what I’m trying to do with that second chance.\\" At 17, Nash was in a head-on collision with a semi on the highway outside of his hometown of Kleefeld and was pronounced dead on the scene. Incredibly, he survived — his skull is mostly made of metal — but, as he told me last year, he didn’t wake up wanting to change the world. He woke up wanting to burn it down. He was angry and bitter. He felt insignificant. Through music, he discovered how he could be useful. His story could help others. He could have had a more conventional music career — and for a while, he did — but he wanted to make himself even more accessible and available to his fans. And so, he plays in schools at no cost to either the schools or the students. He gives out his music for free. Reflecting on the permanence of the tattoo — which will be a one-off; he doesn’t plan to keep adding names — he says he further wants to show young people he’s sincere. \\"Kids can smell bullshit a mile away. We’re here because we care.\\" Nash recalls the first time he received a suicide note. He was at a school that was dealing with the suicide of a student. The note revealed there was a pact with another student, but the principal didn’t know who. \\"So we went to do the show right away, and it was a bizarre feeling knowing somebody in the audience was about to take their life and we didn’t know who it was. So we spoke directly. ‘We know someone in the audience is having these dark thoughts.’ And we spoke directly about suicide that day and, sure enough, a young girl came up after the show and she handed me her suicide note, planning to take her life that weekend. What a crazy feeling that was.\\" There’s a consistent through-line in all the letters he’s received since: everyone feels alone. \\"I want to show them my arm and say, ‘Look, you think you’re alone, but look at all these names on my arm. These are all kids that were in the same place as you. They did not want to be alive anymore. And they ripped up their notes, they found the strength, the kept walking, they got off the train tracks. They’re still here.’ \\"These people needed my story. Someone out there needs your story. That’s why you need to keep walking.\\" jen.zoratti@freepress.mb.caTwitter: @JenZoratti ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Winnipeg musician Robb Nash, known for his self-harm prevention work, had the names of 120 young people tattooed onto his right arm as a tribute.

The context of the sentence is that the mom is telling her son to stay in bed instead of going to school. Step 2: Evaluate each answer choice. A. more rest: While it's possible that the mom could say this, it does not provide a clear reason for staying home. There's no explicit connection between needing more rest and skipping school. B. rest more: Similar to option A, this choice implies that the son might be tired, but it doesn't address the specific reason for staying home. C. were sick: This option seems like a misspelling or incorrect grammar. It could be an attempt at saying \\"we are sick,\\" but that would imply both the mom and the son are sick. Since the focus is on the son and not the mom, this answer doesn't fit. D. drink water: Drinking water is a generic suggestion and doesn't specifically address why the son should stay home from school.

Hibernation is a state of inactivity and metabolic depression in animals during winter to conserve energy when food resources are scarce. Step-by-step process: 1. (Missing step) As winter approaches, the animal starts to prepare for hibernation by increasing its food intake to build up fat reserves. 2. Winter comes, and the animal finds a place to hibernate (safe and insulated from temperature fluctuations). 3. Over a period of days, the animal's heart rate and breathing rate drop slowly, conserving energy and reducing the need for oxygen. 4. Electrical activity in the brain almost ceases completely, though some areas remain active to monitor the surroundings and maintain basic life functions. 5. The animal has entered hibernation mode, where it will remain until environmental conditions improve.

His publicist Joy Fehily confirmed the tragic news, reporting that Duncan passed away in a Los Angeles hospital, nearly two months after suffering a massive heart attack that left him hospitalized since July 13. Born in Chicago in 1957, Duncan, who stood at a towering 6 feet 5 inches tall and weighed around 315 pounds, began his Hollywood career with small roles in movies such as Friday, Renaissance Man, and Armageddon. However, it was his breakthrough performance in the 1999 adaptation of Stephen King's ‘The Green Mile’ that catapulted him into stardom. Playing opposite Tom Hanks, Duncan's portrayal of a gentle, miracle-working death row inmate earned him a best supporting actor nomination at the Academy Awards. Duncan's sudden death has left Hollywood reeling and is a great loss to the acting community. Colleagues, co-stars, and fans have taken to social media and other platforms to express their shock and grief at his passing. Tom Hanks was one of the first to pay tribute to Duncan, saying, \\"I am terribly saddened at the loss of a Big Mike, a treasure we all adored. He was a man of big love who embraced every moment of every day. He was magic.\\" Actress and TV host Holly Robinson Peete, who knew Duncan, also expressed her condolences, tweeting: \\"RIP Michael Clarke Duncan… Devastated. Speechless. Sending rowing prayers for Omarosa & MCD's family.\\" Director Frank Darabont, who directed Duncan in ‘The Green Mile,’ said in a statement, \\"I'm devastated at the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan, one of the finest people I've ever had the privilege to work with or know. Michael was the gentlest of souls—a big man with an even bigger heart, a devout Christian who loved everyone and had a smile that would light up a room.\\" Duncan's impressive film career also included the box office hits such as ‘Daredevil,’ ‘Planet of the Apes,’ ‘Sin City,’ and ‘Kung Fu Panda.’ He also lent his deep, resonant voice to various animated projects, including the role of Tug in the movie ‘Brother Bear.’ The actor's journey to success was not an easy one. Prior to his acting career, Duncan worked as a ditch digger, club bouncer, and even a personal bodyguard for celebrities such as Will Smith and Notorious B.I.G. His success story, though sadly short-lived, is a testament to his determination and perseverance in the face of adversity. Duncan's death has come as a significant blow to the industry, particularly to those who knew him closely. With his incredible talent, resonant voice, and one-of-a-kind presence, the late actor is sure to be remembered by many for his unforgettable performances in his unassuming, genuine, and, at times, dazzling roles. His fiancée, Omarosa Manigault, who has been by his side throughout this difficult time, expressed her gratitude for the support and well-wishes that she and Duncan's family have received in the wake of his passing. Ultimately, the loss of Michael Clarke Duncan serves as a poignant reminder of the fragility of life, and his legacy will remain etched in our hearts and on the silver screen. May he rest in peace."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Change is a part of life and can be a positive thing if you use it correctly. Be prepared to grow and adapt at every stage of life. Ask yourself which aspects of your life are being influenced by past hurts, insecurities, and regrets. Once you identify those issues, commit to letting them go so that they no longer control who you are. Write out the things that frustrate you, or that you think hold you back. Expressing your feelings can help you let go of anything unpleasant in your past. This type of list can help you learn about the skills you need to develop in order to feel fulfilled. Realize that whatever your regrets are, in some ways you are better off than others. Focus on your strengths and other positive things you take away from your past. In order to reinvent yourself, it is important not to dwell too much on the past. However, there are often lessons you can take away from the past that can improve who you are in the present. Analyze a relationship that ended painfully to determine what went wrong. Think about what you can do to prevent the same thing from happening in your next relationship. Look at which decisions led you or your family to make financial mistakes in the past. Based on this, work to develop a financial plan for the future that corrects these errors. Correcting bad habits is an important part of leaving the old you behind. It can, however, be very difficult and even intimidating. Instead of trying to change yourself all at once, focus on breaking one bad habit at a time. Make a list of the habits that really bother your. Narrow it down to the top few that you would like to break, then start by working on the most important one. Focus on the positive feelings that you first have when trying to break a bad habit. This can help you succeed. Try replacing a negative habit with a positive one. For example, if you have a habit of snacking on junk food, replace it with healthy snacks, or spend more time exercising. As soon as a negative thought about yourself or your life pops into your mind, try replacing it with a positive one. Doing so trains your mind to focus on possibilities instead of difficulties. Conceptualize the things that cause you to feel stress. Think about how you have responded to them in the past. Then, actively replace negative thoughts about those stressors with positive ones. For instance, a bad date might cause you to think something like, “I'll never find someone. There must be something wrong with me.” Correct yourself with something like “This date went poorly, but that doesn't mean the right person isn't out there waiting for me. I won't find that person unless I keep looking.” Your opinion of yourself is formed in part by your idea of how others see you. If you really want to redefine yourself, however, you'll need to become the person you want to be, not the person someone else expects you to be. You also need to identify and step away from social pressure that comes from society itself. Society may hold certain expectations of you based on your race, gender, economic class, or religion, and these expectations can be just as restricting. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: Reinventing oneself is a positive and achievable process at any stage in life.

Tampa Bay's defense dominated a good part of the game, forcing six turnovers, and despite quarterback Jeff Garcia sitting out most of the game, the Buccaneers held on for a 19-13 victory. On the game's first play, Garcia tried to scramble, but injured his back upon being tackled by Cornelius Griffin. He lasted only two more plays, and was replaced by Bruce Gradkowski until early in the fourth quarter. Garcia's injury seemingly galvanized the Tampa Bay defense, who went on to cause 4 turnovers in the first half. Phillip Buchanon forced a fumble off the Redskins' first pass which was recovered by Tanard Jackson who advanced it 8 yards to the Washington 19. Three plays later, Earnest Graham scored a 1-yard touchdown run. On the third play of Washington's next drive, Greg White hit Clinton Portis hard, forcing a fumble which Jackson recovered at the 19-yard line. Tampa took a 10-0 lead after a Matt Bryant field goal. Early in the second quarter, Greg White forced yet another fumble as he sacked Jason Campbell which Kevin Carter recovered. The turnover led to another field goal. Portis fumbled again on the following drive as he took a bone-jarring hit from Jermaine Phillips and Tampa Bay capitalized with a third field goal. Before the half, Washington got on the board with a field goal, then Tampa Bay kicked a fourth field goal as the half expired to lead, 19-3. The second half saw Washington attempt a comeback. Despite injuring his hand, Campbell stayed in the game, and threw a 39-yard touchdown pass to Chris Cooley. Meanwhile, Gradkowski stayed in at quarterback for Tampa Bay, and continued to perform poorly. Tampa Bay managed only 9 yards of offense in the third quarter, and 0 yards passing. The Redskins drove 66 yards in 13 plays and over nine minutes to the Tampa Bay 4-yard line. Tampa Bay's defense held on 4th and 1 at the 4, however, as linebacker Derrick Brooks shed several blockers to down Portis for no gain. Washington narrowed the score to 19-13 in the fourth quarter. With about 11 minutes to go, Jeff Garcia returned to the game, hoping to spark Tampa Bay's offense, and hold on for the win. He was unable to do much against the Redskins' well-rested and fired up defense, however, and Tampa Bay ended up having to punt. Josh Bidwell pinned the Redskins at their own 9-yard line, and Campbell drove them to the Tampa Bay 32-yard line. Ronde Barber stopped the threat when he intercepted the ball at the 28-yard line. With less than a minute to go, Campbell drove the Redskins to the Tampa Bay 16-yard line, but Brian Kelly intercepted the pass in the end zone with 17 seconds remaining, to clinch the victory for the Buccaneers.

Fact 2: Ozone is represented chemically as O3. Given the two facts above, answer the question \\"The depletion of what results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth?\\" with the following options: - O3 - O2 - oil - pan - h2o - CO2 - DNA - DDT Answer:","completion":"The depletion of O3, also known as ozone, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. To provide a comprehensive understanding, let's first discuss the two facts mentioned and then analyze the given options. Fact 1: Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. Ozone is a gas predominantly present in the upper layers of Earth's atmosphere, specifically in the stratosphere. It plays a critical role in protecting life on Earth by absorbing harmful ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. The depletion of the ozone layer can lead to an increase in the amount of UV radiation that reaches the Earth's surface, causing various environmental and health problems, such as skin cancer, cataracts, and suppression of the immune system in humans, as well as negative effects on plants and marine ecosystems. Fact 2: Ozone is represented chemically as O3. Ozone is a molecule composed of three oxygen atoms (O3). It is formed by the reaction of diatomic oxygen (O2) and a single oxygen atom (O) in the presence of ultraviolet radiation or electrical discharge. Now, let's go through the options provided: - O3: Given the two facts above, the depletion of O3 or ozone results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. As discussed earlier, ozone absorbs the harmful UV radiation from the sun, and its depletion leads to increased UV exposure at the Earth's surface. - O2: O2 represents diatomic oxygen, which is a vital component of the atmosphere but does not directly absorb UV radiation like ozone. - Oil: Oil refers to hydrocarbon substances, such as petroleum and its derivatives, which have no connection to ozone depletion or the increase in UV radiation. - Pan: A pan is a cooking utensil, which is irrelevant to the topic of ozone depletion and UV radiation. - H2O: H2O represents water, which is not directly related to ozone depletion or the increase in UV radiation. - CO2: CO2 is carbon dioxide, a greenhouse gas that contributes to global warming and climate change. It does not directly deplete the ozone layer or affect UV radiation levels. - DNA: DNA stands for Deoxyribonucleic Acid, which is the genetic material found in living organisms. It is not related to ozone depletion or UV radiation levels. - DDT: DDT is an abbreviation for Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane, a pesticide that was once widely used but is now banned in many countries due to its harmful environmental effects. DDT does not directly deplete the ozone layer or contribute to increased UV radiation levels. In conclusion, the depletion of O3 (ozone), given the facts stated above, results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. It is crucial to protect the ozone layer as it acts as a shield against the harmful effects of ultraviolet radiation, which can have severe consequences for life on our planet."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Journalist, John Lawrence (Robert Clarke) explains he does not think he will survive the night, but is determined to tell the story of the man from planet X before he dies.Flashback...............John Lawrence discusses with an astronomer about the discovery of planet X rushing towards Earth and reports Earth has been bathed in radar waves. The astronomer tells Lawrence about the work of Professor Elliot (Raymond Bond) has been involved on an isolated Scottish Island. The Island was chosen because Prof Elliot worked out this would be the closest point of approach by planet X to EarthLawrence travels to the island to interview Elliot about his research and findings regarding the planet. On arriving he is greeted by Enid Elliot (Margaret Field) Who at first he does not recognize, but realizes he'd known since she was a young girl.The professor and his daughter have taken up residence in a small castle with the professors assistant Dr Mears ( William Schallert) A man we discover has a checkered past, and who might be less than reliable. After settling in and having dinner Lawrence and Enid go for a walk across the moor. While enjoying each others company they discovered a small rocket, which they immediately return to the castle.Elliot deducts the object is from space, possibly even Planet X. The object is made from some exotic metal that could be extremely useful to Earth. Later that night Enid drives Lawrence to town. On the return journey she blows a tire.

Article: To make your own pH indicator, you will need half a head of red cabbage, a knife, water, a stove, and a medium saucepan. Red cabbage contains a chemical called anthocyanin that changes color based on acidity. By boiling the cabbage, you can make a pH indicator from this chemical and test the acidity of your rain. Adult supervision is recommended for this because you will need to handle a hot stove and a sharp knife. . You want about 2-3 cups of red cabbage cut into small pieces. If you are young, have an adult help you with this step to avoid potential injury. The exact amount of cabbage is not important, so just cut up half of the head of cabbage. Place the chopped cabbage into the saucepan and add enough water to cover the cabbage. Put the saucepan on the stove and bring the water to a full boil. Once the solution boils, turn the heat off and let the water cool to room temperature. Have a parent help with this step to avoid injury when using the stove and working with boiling water. You should notice that the water is now purple. Pour the cabbage and water mixture through a strainer into a bowl. The purple water (the indicator) is currently neutral because the water from your tap is neutral. In the presence of an acid, the indicator turns pink. In the presence of a base, the indicator turns blue. You can refrigerate the solution until you need it. To make sure the indicator is working properly, you can test it using baking soda and vinegar. Put 1 teaspoon (~5 mL) of the cabbage water into two small, clear glasses. Add a teaspoon of vinegar to one glass and a teaspoon of baking soda to the other. Vinegar is acidic, so the water will turn pink. Baking soda is basic, so the water will turn blue. Collect some rainwater in a clean, plastic container. Pour 1 teaspoon of cabbage water into a small, clean glass. Add a teaspoon (~5 mL) of the collected rainwater to the cabbage water. The water should turn pink because all rain is slightly acidic. The deeper the pink, the higher the acidity in your area. This method will not tell you the exact pH of the rain, but will give you an idea of how acidic it is. If you are traveling, you can compare rain from different areas such as different cities, state or province, or even countries and see if the deepness of the pink changes. What is a summary?","completion":"A summary of the article is as follows: To create your own pH indicator using red cabbage, follow these steps: Chop half a head of red cabbage into small pieces and place them into a saucepan.

The indicator will change colors in the presence of acids (turning pink) and bases (turning blue). Test the indicator with vinegar and baking soda, observing the color changes. Finally, collect rainwater and mix it with the cabbage indicator to determine its acidity, with deeper pink indicating higher acidity levels.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: United States has varied geographical characteristics. Take for example, the Mississippi Delta. The delta has vast wetland that gets inundated every year. On the contrary, farther west, the Mojave Desert in Nevada sees very little precipitation or floodwater. Both places are beautiful in their own right, and attract many tourists every year. Would Mojave Desert be less or more prone to hypoxia than Mississippi Delta? Answer:","completion":"The Mojave Desert would be less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta due to their distinctive geological and environmental characteristics. Hypoxia occurs when an environment has a low concentration of dissolved oxygen, creating stress for the organisms living within that ecosystem. This condition is mainly observed in aquatic environments and wetlands, and can be triggered by factors such as excessive nutrient input, organic matter decomposition, and limited water circulation. The Mississippi Delta is an expansive wetland with a network of rivers, marshes, and swamps. It experiences regular flooding, which brings in a large amount of nutrients from the surrounding watershed. These nutrients stimulate the growth of algae and aquatic plants in the water, and when these organisms die and decompose, bacteria consume the oxygen for their metabolic processes, reducing dissolved oxygen levels in the water. This increased biological oxygen demand can lead to hypoxic conditions, causing stress and even death to various marine organisms in the area. On the other hand, the Mojave Desert is an arid region characterized by dry landscapes, sparse vegetation, and limited water sources. Due to it being a desert, it does not experience regular flooding, and the scarce water bodies in the region, such as springs or small ponds, are less likely to have high nutrient input. Consequently, the risk of hypoxia in the Mojave Desert is significantly lower than in the Mississippi Delta, as the factors that contribute to hypoxic conditions are not present or are minimal in this environment. In summary, the Mojave Desert is less prone to hypoxia than the Mississippi Delta due to differences in their geographical and ecological characteristics. The Mississippi Delta's wetlands and nutrient-rich waters promote conditions that can lead to hypoxia, while the Mojave Desert's arid environment does not support such processes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The tie dye for the white shirt involved carefully preparing the dyes, folding the fabric in intricate patterns, and patiently waiting for the colors to seep into the fibers, resulting in a vibrant and mesmerizing swirl of hues that seemed to dance and intermingle on the surface. This captivating piece of wearable art not only showcased my creativity but also served as a reflection of my personality, with each color symbolizing a different aspect of who I am and what I believe in. On the other hand, the grey shirt required a different approach altogether. This seemingly plain piece of clothing held a blank canvas, inviting me to project my thoughts and ideas onto it. After carefully considering several potential words and phrases, I chose one that resonated deeply within me, a word that held immense significance and evoked powerful emotions. The word embodied my core values and aspirations, encapsulating the essence of my journey through life. With a steady hand and an unwavering focus, I skillfully etched the word onto the grey shirt, using a fabric marker to ensure its permanence and boldness. The two shirts, though vastly different in appearance and execution, shared a common thread – they both stood as physical manifestations of my identity. The tie dye represented the multifaceted aspects of my character, the kaleidoscope of experiences, and emotions that have shaped me into the person I am today. Meanwhile, the word on the grey shirt served as a reminder of my guiding principles and the driving force behind my actions, urging me to stay true to who I am despite the challenges and uncertainties that life may throw my way. Ultimately, these seemingly simple projects turned out to be so much more than just decorating shirts. They became a form of personal expression and self-discovery, allowing me to explore my creativity while simultaneously delving deeper into my thoughts and ideals. As I wear these distinctive pieces, I am reminded of the time and effort that went into their creation and the growth that occurred during the process. And with each passing day, they serve as a visual and tangible testament to my individuality, my values, and my unwavering resolve to remain true to myself, more than living up to their original purpose as stylish and meaningful wardrobe additions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: In this article, I’ll address a real mainstay of modern medicine: laboratory tests that require drawing blood. This is sometimes referred to as “checking labs,” “doing bloodwork,” or even “checking blood.” Most older adults have been through this. For instance, it’s pretty much impossible to be hospitalized without having bloodwork done, and it’s part of most emergency room care. Such testing is also often done as part of an annual exam, or “complete physical.” Last but not least, blood testing is usually — although not always — very helpful when it comes to evaluating many common complaints that affect aging adults. Fatigued and experiencing low energy? We should perhaps check for anemia and thyroid problems, among other things. Confused and delirious? Bloodwork can help us check on an older person’s electrolytes (they can be thrown off by a medication side-effect, as well as by other causes). Blood tests can also provide us with information related to infection, kidney function, and much more. Like much of medical care, blood testing is probably overused. But often, it’s an appropriate and an important part of evaluating an older person’s health care concerns. So as a geriatrician, I routinely order or recommend blood tests for older adults. Historically, laboratory results were reviewed by the doctors and were only minimally discussed with patients and families. But today, it’s becoming more common for patients to ask questions about their results, and otherwise become more knowledgeable about this aspect of their health. In fact, one of my top recommendations to older adults and family caregivers is to always request a copy of your laboratory results. (And then, keep it in your personal health record!) This way, if you ever have questions about your health, or need to see a different doctor, you’ll be able to quickly access this useful information about yourself. In this article, I’m going to list and briefly explain the blood tests that are most commonly used, for the primary medical care of older...

Here is an article: Hillary Clinton distanced herself from Barack Obama’s strategy for defeating Islamic State extremists on Thursday in a sweeping foreign policy speech that called for greater use of American ground troops and an intensified air campaign. Though ruling out deploying the tens of thousands of US troops seen in Iraq and Afghanistan, the former of secretary of state made clear she would take a notably more hawkish approach than the current administration if she is elected president. “The United States has been conducting this fight for more than a year; it’s time to be begin a new phase and intensify and broaden our efforts,” Clinton told the Council on Foreign Relations in New York. “We should have no illusions about how difficult the mission before us really is … but if we press forward on both sides of the border, in the air on the ground and as well as diplomatically, I do believe we can crush Isis’s enclave of terror,” she added. The extensive but nuanced speech singled out coalition efforts against Isis in Iraq for particular implied criticism, urging that US troops be given “greater flexibility” to embed with Iraqi troops on the frontline and target airstrikes. She also said the US should arm Sunni tribes and Kurds in the country if the government in Baghdad refused to. But Clinton called for further US special forces to be deployed to Syria too, reiterated her call for a no-fly zone and demanded an “intelligence surge” to allow the airstrikes against Isis to be stepped up. “We have a lot of work to do to really decimate Isil in Iraq and Syria,” she said, using an alternate name for Isis. Dressed entirely in white, a determined Clinton also used the speech to attack a number of key allies, including Turkey and the Gulf states for not doing enough to tackle fundamentalism. She called on Silicon Valley to stop viewing the US government “as the enemy” and urged the tech industry to design encryption tools that can balance privacy and yet still allow for state surveillance. Taking questions afterward, Clinton said her speech called for an “intensification and acceleration” of the Obama strategy, rather than a major change to it. She also defended the White House response to the Syrian refugee crisis, in the face of opposition from Republicans who want to bar new entrants to the US. “We are in a conflict of ideas against an ideology of hate … but let me clear, Islam is not our adversary,” added Clinton. “The obsession in some quarters with a clash of civilisation, or repeating the words Islamic terrorism, isn’t just a distraction, it plays into their hands by alienating people we need by our sides.” In the question and answer session, Clinton made clear she would directly arm Kurds and Sunni tribes if Baghdad refused to do so, saying the war required “a second Sunni awakening” after the alliance of tribes that took on al-Qaida in Iraq in the mid-2000s. She was also specific about a no-fly zone for northern Syria to cut off supply lines of resources and foreign fighters to Isis – at the same time insisting Turkey “finally locks down its border”. Related: Turkey could cut off Islamic State’s supply lines. So why doesn’t it? | David Graeber Republican candidates have been robust in their attacks on Obama, and by extension Clinton, casting the administration’s record as weak and risky given his decision to enter into an agreement with Iran. Among the proposals put forth by presidential candidates, frontrunner Donald Trump has suggested bombing oil fields in the Middle East, and Jeb Bush and Texas senator Ted Cruz have suggested only allowing Christian refugees into the United States from the Syrian conflict zone. South Carolina senator Lindsey Graham, the most hawkish of the candidates, has gone as far as to call for the deployment of 10,000 American troops to Iraq and Syria. The Democratic candidates have been more restrained in their response in the aftermath of the Paris attacks, the bombing of a Russian passenger jet over Egypt and explosions that killed 43 people in Beirut, all of which have been claimed by Isis. During the Democratic television debate on Saturday, in which the candidates paused for a moment at the outset to remember the victims of the Paris attacks, Clinton sought to distinguish herself from Obama when she was asked about his comments hours before the Paris terrorist strike in which he said the group had been “contained”. “It cannot be contained. It must be defeated,” Clinton responded on Saturday. It was a theme she returned to in more detail in New York on Thursday, with a lengthy section on what she believed were the shortcomings of the current coalition approach against Isis. “A key obstacle standing in the way is a shortage of good intelligence about Isis and its operations, so we need an immediate intelligence surge in the region, including technical assets, Arabic speakers with deep expertise in the Middle East, and even closer partnership with regional intelligence services,” said Clinton. “Our goal should be to achieve the kind of penetration we accomplished with al-Qaida in the past. This would help us identify and eliminate Isis’ command and control and its economic lifelines.” The speech drew heavily on Clinton’s involvement in the Obama administration’s efforts against al-Qaida and Osama bin Laden, so is unlikely to alarm the White House hugely, but nonetheless the president deliberately sought to pre-empt some of Clinton’s suggestions – such as a no-fly zone in Syria – during remarks at the G20 this week, in which he said US experts had examined such options and decided they would be counterproductive. Perhaps the toughest criticism was reserved for the combat in Iraq, where in the fight against Isis-controlled cities such as Ramadi is increasingly bogged down despite overwhelming numerical superiority by the coalition. “We’ve been in a similar place before in Iraq,” said Clinton. “In the first Sunni awakening in 2007, we were able to provide sufficient support and assurances to the Sunni tribes to persuade them to join us in rooting out al-Qaida. Unfortunately, under Prime Minister Maliki’s rule, those tribes were betrayed and forgotten. “So the task of bringing Sunnis off the sidelines into this new fight will be considerably more difficult,” she added. “But nonetheless, we need to lay the foundation for a second Sunni awakening. We need to put sustained pressure on the government in Baghdad to get its political house in order, move forward with national reconciliation, and finally stand up a national guard.” Clinton, who is fond of noting that she traveled to 112 countries during her four-year tenure as secretary of state, had hoped her near million miles of travel would give her an unassailable advantage on foreign policy – a record that includes pushing Obama to intervene earlier in Syria and take a harder line with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin. Her Democratic challengers cannot match her knowledge of foreign affairs, but during the second debate, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley and Vermont senator Bernie Sanders attacked her for her 2002 vote in favour of invading Iraq and her policies in Libya, which left a vacuum for extremists to exploit. She pushed to topple the Libyan strongman Muammar Gaddafi, to which Sanders responded during the debate: “I’m not a big fan of regime change.” This was Clinton’s second major foreign policy speech, in a campaign that has been largely dominated by economic policies and supporting the middle class. In September, she offered a robust endorsement of the Iran nuclear deal at a speech at the Brookings Institute in Washington DC.

The name of the band comes from the Kingdom of Delain in Stephen King's novel, \\"The Eyes of the Dragon\\". - Within Temptation is a Dutch symphonic metal band founded in April 1995 by vocalist Sharon den Adel and guitarist Robert Westerholt. They have always been classified by critics as gothic metal, although the \\"gothic\\" influence varies with each album. Their most prominent and well-known sound is described as symphonic metal, although their earlier material, such as debut album \\"Enter\\", was mostly gothic metal. \\"Enter\\" even had a hint of doom metal. In an interview, Den Adel said they fell into a symphonic rock genre with various influences. In a later interview with Dutch music platform 3VOOR12, den Adel stated that \\"we consider ourselves more a symphonic rock band ... in my opinion, we are no gothic band\\". - Classical music is art music produced or rooted in the traditions of Western music, including both liturgical (religious) and secular music. While a more accurate term is also used to refer to the period from 1750 to 1820 (the Classical period), this article is about the broad span of time from roughly the 11th century to the present day, which includes the Classical period and various other periods. The central norms of this tradition became codified between 1550 and 1900, which is known as the common-practice period. The major time divisions of Western art music are as follows: European art music is largely distinguished from many other non-European and some popular musical forms by its system of staff notation, in use since about the 16th century. Western staff notation is used by composers to indicate to the performer the pitches (e.g., melodies, basslines, chords), tempo, meter and rhythms for a piece of music. This can leave less room for practices such as improvisation and \\"ad libitum\\" ornamentation, which are frequently heard in non-European art music and in popular-music styles such as jazz and blues. Another difference is that whereas most popular styles adopt the song (strophic) form, classical music has been noted for its development of highly sophisticated forms of instrumental music such as the concerto, symphony, sonata, and mixed vocal and instrumental styles such as opera which, since they are written down, can sustain larger forms and attain a high level of complexity. - Nightwish is a symphonic power metal band from Kitee, Finland. The band was formed in 1996 by lead songwriter and keyboardist Tuomas Holopainen, guitarist Emppu Vuorinen, and lead singer Tarja Turunen. The band soon picked up drummer Jukka Nevalainen, and then bassist Sami Vänskä after the release of their debut album, \\"Angels Fall First\\" (1997). In 2002, Vänskä was replaced by Marco Hietala, who also took over the male vocalist role previously filled by Holopainen or guest singers. - Symphonic metal is a subgenre of metal music which combines the characteristics of this genre, such as heavy drums and guitars, with different elements of classical music including symphonic instruments, choirs and on occasion, a full symphony orchestra. Keyboards reminiscent of power metal also often find a dominant place in this subgenre. Symphonic metal bands often feature classically trained female vocalists, giving rise to the nickname opera metal or operatic metal, and it is not uncommon for them to feature a second vocalist performing growls, a more common characteristic of gothic metal. Perhaps the most typical and prominent examples of symphonic metal bands are Finnish band Nightwish, Dutch bands Within Temptation, Delain and Epica, and Swedish band Therion, all four of which place a large focus on elements prevalent in film scores on top of the more basic classical components utilized more widely in the genre. - Vanishing Point are a progressive / symphonic metal band based in Melbourne , Australia .

Help as much as you can. I'm not good at sticking to the rules, not even the ones I set myself. I'm really terrible with the rules set by others, especially companies. Even as a child, I could never stay inside the lines in colouring books. Some of you might put this down to poor hand-eye coordination, but I maintain that I was a rule-breaker right from the beginning. One of my roles as an engineer with a multiplicity of companies was to set up projects, define the scope of the work, contract the work out and manage the project. I was setting up a robot-based manufacturing cell for the company in the business of making early cellphones. The cell design required some equipment to be designed and built from scratch, so I got a local designer, Fergus, to give me a quote and got him started on the work. Now, any project will run over budget and take longer than planned and the contractor may come back for more money. And so it was with this designer; he wasn't really vocal about it, but he indicated that the work did take a lot more time and expense than he's originally budgeted. My usual reaction to these things is that this is not my problem. Most of the companies I've work for have lost money, so why should I give a rat's ass if some other company comes up a little short? In this case though, I liked Fergus and, as he was really a one-man operation, I decided to cut him some slack. But first, I had to get permission from my boss to drop another few grand into Fergus's jeans. My boss refused. Having someone tell me I can't do something really brings out my dark side; especially around the time of the full moon. Not long before, we had just waved a fond(-ish) farewell to our president as he was going on to greener fields. As a parting gift, the company bought him either a boat or a motor home, I forget which, and equipped it with three of their cell phones. Question: who is the author?

One day he catches the attention of gangster Dutch Schultz. Changing his last name to Bathgate, after a local street, he goes to work for Schultz's organization, serving mostly as a gopher for Schultz. Billy is present when Schultz murders his former partner Bo Weinberg, who Schultz believes betrayed him. Schultz then begins a relationship with Weinberg's beautiful, married, girlfriend, Drew Preston. Facing legal charges in a court in upstate New York, Schultz brings Billy and Drew along. He successfully charms the locals, presenting himself as charming and good natured. While his boss Dutch stands trial, Billy's job is to watch over Drew. His loyalties to Schultz are tested as he begins falling in love with the flirtatious Drew. Realizing that Drew is about to be killed, Billy calls her husband, who hurries to town and takes her home before Schultz's men can make their move. Having beaten the rap in court, Dutch is indicted again on federal tax evasion charges. He wants to have federal prosecutor Thomas Dewey murdered, but his request is rejected by the Mafia Commission. Schultz sends Billy to another gangster with some bribe money, but the effort is rejected. When Billy returns with the bad news, he and Schultz have a falling out and Billy is fired by Schultz's associate Otto, who lets him keep the bribe money as a severance package. As Billy leaves, he is abducted and beaten by gangsters working for Lucky Luciano. The men storm Dutch's hideout and kill everyone inside. Billy is taken before Luciano, who warns him that he knows where Billy's family lives, before letting him go. Guess a valid title for it! Answer:","completion":"A suitable title for this story could be \\"Bronx Betrayal: Billy Bathgate and the Tangled Web of Loyalty.\\" This title captures the essence of Billy Behan's journey, from a poor teenager in the Bronx to his involvement with notorious gangster Dutch Schultz as he adopts the name Billy Bathgate. It highlights the theme of betrayal — Schultz's suspicions about his former partner, Bo Weinberg, Billy's shifting loyalties as he navigates the dangerous world of organized crime, and the ultimate betrayal by Lucky Luciano's men, leading to Dutch Schultz's downfall. The title also emphasizes the importance of loyalty and the web of deceit and shifting allegiances that form the undercurrent of this story. From Billy's initial loyalty to Dutch Schultz, which is put to the test as he falls in love with Drew Preston, to the various betrayals and double-crosses that take place throughout the narrative, the reader is constantly left guessing as to who can be trusted and in whom loyalty truly lies. The inclusion of both \\"Bronx\\" and \\"Billy Bathgate\\" in the title explicitly connects the story's setting and protagonist, grounding the tale in its gritty, urban environment, and providing an immediate sense of place and character. Ultimately, the title \\"Bronx Betrayal: Billy Bathgate and the Tangled Web of Loyalty\\" encapsulates the central themes and conflicts of the story, promising a thrilling tale of love, crime, and the high-stakes battle for power and survival in the dangerous world of gangland New York."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: You are considering whether to buy a product.

After a 1-1 draw in last week's first leg in Buenos Aires, two goals from Brazil-born Qatar striker Emerson gave coach Tite's Corinthians a 2-0 second-leg win in Sao Paulo. Wednesday's historic win over six-time champions Boca ensured Corinthians' qualification for December's FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. It also means South America's premier club competition has been won by a Brazilian team in each of the last three years, following on from Santos in 2011 and Internacional. \\"This afternoon, I spoke with the president and informed him that I would not continue,\\" OPTIONS: - Argentina told reporters. - Argentine told reporters. - Boca told reporters. - Boca Juniors told reporters. - Brazil told reporters. - Brazilian told reporters. - Buenos Aires told reporters. - CNN told reporters. - Copa Libertadores told reporters. - Corinthians told reporters. - Emerson told reporters. - FIFA Club World Cup told reporters. - Internacional told reporters. - Japan told reporters. - Juan Roman Riquelme told reporters. - Qatar told reporters. - Santos told reporters. - Sao Paulo told reporters. - South America told reporters. - Tite told reporters.","completion":"Juan Roman Riquelme told reporters.

Stunned by the news, the media clamored for more information from the legendary Argentine footballer. Riquelme, who had been instrumental in Boca Juniors' previous successes, spoke about his decision to step away from his beloved club. \\"I gave it my all for Boca Juniors, but now it's time for a new chapter in my life and for the club to move forward with fresh talents,\\" Riquelme revealed. As he stated this, his eyes welled with a mixture of sadness and pride for the journey he had with the team. The news of Riquelme's departure left the Argentine football world in a state of shock and disbelief. Many fans and fellow players took to social media to express their gratitude and admiration for the skillful playmaker who had been such a vital part of Boca Juniors' history. In the weeks that followed, Boca Juniors began the process of rebuilding their team without their cornerstone player, focusing on training and scouting for promising future stars. The fans understood that replacing Riquelme would not be a simple task, but they remained hopeful and excited about the club's future. As for Riquelme, he embarked on a new journey mentoring young players, sharing his knowledge and experience with the next generation of footballers. He took part in charity events and youth training camps, inspiring those who looked up to him as a role model, and ensuring that his legacy would continue to live on through the future stars of Argentine football. In December, Corinthians participated in the FIFA Club World Cup in Japan, where they represented South America at the prestigious global club competition, showcasing the strength and talent of Brazilian football. Although they faced fierce competition from teams across the globe, Corinthians showed their grit and determination, proving that they were indeed worthy champions of South America. As the years went by, the stories of Riquelme and Corinthians continued to intertwine, with former Boca Juniors players and coaches praising the talented Brazilian team for their growth and success. The Copa Libertadores victory resonated in both Brazilian and Argentine football history, creating a lasting bond between the two nations as they continued to compete at the highest level. Even though the South American powerhouses would always maintain their fierce rivalries, the spirit of respect and admiration would endure, thanks to those unforgettable moments and heroes like Juan Roman Riquelme."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Russian support has been crucial in turning the tide of Syria's civil war in favour of government forces, led by president Bashar al-Assad. Mr Putin made a similar withdrawal announcement last year, but Russian military operations continued. When asked how long it would take for Russia to withdraw its military contingent, Mr Shoigu said that this would \\"depend on the situation\\" in Syria. The Russian president was met by Mr al-Assad at the Russian Hmeimim airbase near Latakia. Mr Putin said: \\"I order the defence minister and the chief of the general staff to start withdrawing the Russian group of troops to their permanent bases,\\" according to the Russian RIA Novosti news agency. \\"I have taken a decision: a significant part of the Russian troop contingent located in Syria is returning home to Russia,\\" he added. Syria campaign boosts Russian influence By Steve Rosenberg, BBC Moscow correspondent Less than a week after announcing he will stand for re-election, Vladimir Putin flies to Syria and declares victory. Coincidence? Probably not. Signalling the end of Russia's military operation in Syria will go down well with Russian voters. Electoral concerns apart, Moscow views its two-year campaign in Syria as a success - and not only in terms of fighting international terrorism. The Russians have succeeded in keeping a key ally, President Assad, in power. In the process, Russia has been guaranteed a long-term military presence in Syria, with its two bases Hmeimim and Tartus. Moscow has also raised its profile across the Middle East. Then there's the global stage. The operation in Syria prevented Moscow's international isolation. Russia's annexation of Crimea in 2014 had sparked Western sanctions and earned the country, in the eyes of some Western governments, the label \\"pariah state\\". The Syria operation forced Western leaders to sit down and negotiate with Russia's leadership. Mr Putin said that if \\"terrorists raise their heads again\\", Russia would \\"carry out such strikes on them which they have never seen\\". \\"We will never forget the victims and losses suffered in the fight against terror both here in Syria and also in Russia,\\" he said. He told President Assad that Russia wanted to work with Iran, the government's other key ally, and Turkey, which backs the opposition, to help bring peace to Syria. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Russia has been carrying out air strikes in Syria since September 2015 Last week, Mr Putin announced the \\"total rout\\" of jihadist militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) along the Euphrates river valley in eastern Syria. Russia launched an air campaign in Syria in September 2015 with the aim of \\"stabilising\\" Mr Assad's government after a series of defeats. Officials in Moscow stressed that it would target only \\"terrorists\\", but activists said its strikes mainly hit mainstream rebel fighters and civilians. The campaign has allowed pro-government forces to break the deadlock on several key battlefronts, most notably in Aleppo. The Syrian and Russian air forces carried out daily air strikes on the rebel-held east of the city before it fell in December 2016, killing hundreds of people and destroying hospitals, schools and markets, according to UN human rights investigators. Moscow has consistently denied that its air strikes have caused any civilian deaths. However, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reported on Sunday that Russian air strikes had killed 6,328 civilians, including 1,537 children. The UK-based monitoring group has documented the deaths of 346,612 people in total since the start of the uprising against Mr Assad in 2011. ||||| Russian President Vladimir Putin exhibited his growing diplomatic clout with a lightning tour through the Middle East on Monday, surprising Russian troops with his first visit to a Russian air base in Syria before skipping across the region to discuss bilateral ties in Cairo and Ankara. Along the way, he announced a withdrawal of Russian troops from Syria, presided over the signing of a 21 billion plan to build a nuclear power plant in Egypt, and called President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel \\"counterproductive\\" and \\"destabilizing,\\" a criticism he leveled without mentioning Trump by name. The decision could \\"provoke conflict,\\" he said during a news conference following a meeting with Egyptian President Abdel Fatah al-Sissi. Putin, who declared last week that he would run for a fourth term as president, has largely staked his legacy on Russia's revival as the dominant military power in its region and a counterweight to the West in the Middle East. His tour to shore up bilateral ties comes at a time when U.S. policy in the Middle East is in flux, amid Trump's decision on Jerusalem and apparent support for the rise of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman in Saudi Arabia, as well as growing questions about the future role and mission of the U.S. military in Syria. The trip began with a surprise visit to Russia's Khmeimim air base in Syria, where Putin announced an imminent drawdown of Russian forces in the wake of his declaration of victory in Moscow's intervention in the Syrian war. Russian warplanes secretly flew to Syria in late 2015. It was Putin's first known visit to Syria. At the air base, Putin ordered his defense minister, Sergei Shoigu, to begin the \\"withdrawal of Russian troop contingents\\" to their permanent bases. But he left open the door to a continued Russian presence in Syria, saying that Russia's air base at Khmeimim and naval base at Tartus would keep operating. He promised further strikes \\"if terrorists raise their head again\\" — an apparent reference to forces in Syria's long civil war that sought to topple the regime of President Bashar al-Assad. \\"We will deliver such strikes on them that they have not seen yet,\\" he told military personnel at the air base in remarks carried by Russian news services. Russia's military intervention in Syria bolstered Assad's government and gave Syrian forces a critical edge against rebel factions backed by the West and its Middle Eastern allies. Iran, another key supporter of Assad, provided military advisers and other aid. [A Putin-Assad embrace launches Russia’s new peace bid for Syria] U.S. defense officials cast doubt Monday on Putin's announcement of a troop withdrawal. Similar pronouncements in the past — including one in March 2016 and another in January — \\"don't often correspond with actual troop reductions,\\" said Col. Rob Manning, a Defense Department spokesman. The speech to the troops also had the whiff of a reelection campaign at times. \\"You are victorious, and you are going home to your families, parents, wives, children and friends,\\" Putin told pilots at the air base. \\"The fatherland is waiting for you, my friends. Have a safe trip home. I am grateful for your service.\\" The deployment of troops to Syria marked Moscow's first major overseas military campaign since the invasion of Afghanistan in late 1979 under the Soviet Union. In July, Russia extended its lease of the Khmeimim air base for 49 years, giving Moscow a military foothold in the region for generations. Putin met at the air base with Assad, whose regime appeared close to defeat in the summer of 2015 before the Russian intervention. At the time, it appeared that Assad would be forced to step down. \\"I have come, as I promised,\\" Putin told him. While hailing the fall of the Islamic State, Putin also noted the rebuke to Western plans in the region. \\"Syria has been preserved as a sovereign independent state,\\" he said. Putin has been eager to declare the intervention a victory, and his March 2016 drawdown announcement came as Syrian troops backed by Russian air power and special forces made a final push to recapture the ancient Roman city of Palmyra. Western leaders were skeptical that Russia would pull back its troops, and Russian forces later played a key role in the race by pro-government forces to retake territory ahead of the Islamic State's eventual collapse. The intervention has showcased much of Russia's military might: new warplanes, helicopters and warships, as well as cruise missiles fired from the Caspian Sea. It has come at the cost of more than 40 Russian soldiers killed, according to official statistics. The deaths of a similar number of military contractors have been reported by Russian journalists. In Cairo, Putin met with Sissi and discussed the conflicts in Syria and Libya, a possible resumption of direct air travel after a 2015 terrorist attack aboard a Russian charter jet, and Trump's decision on Jerusalem. The contract signed during a meeting between Putin and the Egyptian president calls for the construction and a supply of nuclear fuel for Egypt's Dabaa power plant, scheduled to begin operating in 2026. Russia has also signed agreements to build nuclear plants in Turkey and Jordan. Russia finished construction on Iran's Bushehr nuclear power station — a project begun by a German firm under the shah — and opened it in 2011. Putin arrived in Ankara, Turkey, on Monday evening for talks with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. The leaders discussed developments in Syria and elsewhere in the region as well as relations between their countries, Turkish officials said. Alex Horton in Washington contributed to this report.

Given the question \\"What does Addison need to do before this?\\", is \\"get the water\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Yes, \\"get the water\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"What does Addison need to do before this?\\" given in the context of Addison supplying the classroom with water because the water was out in the entire building. To generate a more detailed response, one needs to analyze the situation and steps taken by Addison. The water outage in the entire building would necessitate an alternative source of water for the classroom. Before Addison could supply the classroom with water, they would have to perform the following actions: 1. Identify an alternative water source: Before Addison could provide water to the classroom, they would need to find a source that still had water available. This could involve checking nearby buildings, contacting local water suppliers, or searching for water storage facilities in the area. 2. Ensure the water is safe for consumption: Depending on the source of the water, it may not be suitable for drinking purposes. Addison would need to confirm that the water is safe to consume, either by following the guidelines of the local health department or by conducting tests to ensure its quality. 3. Acquire proper containers for water storage: In order to transport the water to the classroom, Addison would need suitable containers that could hold the volume of water required. These containers should be clean, leak-proof, and, preferably, portable enough to be carried or transported easily. 4. Arrange transportation: Depending on the distance between the alternative water source and the classroom, Addison might need to arrange transportation for the water containers. This could involve securing a vehicle that can adequately carry the filled containers or enlisting the help of people to assist in carrying or moving the water. 5. Get the water: With the necessary preparations in place, Addison would have to collect the water from the identified source. This step involves filling the prepared containers with the required amount of water. It is essential to ensure that the water remains uncontaminated during this process. 6. Transport the water to the classroom: Following the collection of the water, Addison would need to transport the filled containers to the classroom. This could involve carrying them personally, loading them into a vehicle, or using another form of transportation previously arranged. After completing these steps, Addison will have successfully supplied the water to the classroom, allowing the students and teachers to have access to it despite the water outage in the building. Therefore, \\"get the water\\" constitutes a valid answer to the question, as it encompasses a crucial step before Addison can supply the classroom with water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.
