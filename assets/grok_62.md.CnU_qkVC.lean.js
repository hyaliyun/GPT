The group had previously attempted the crawl as teenagers in 1990 but failed to reach the final pub, The World's End. Gary arrives in Newton Haven with friends Peter (Eddie Marsan), Oliver (Martin Freeman), Steven (Paddy Considine), and Andy (Nick Frost), and they begin the crawl. In the second pub, the group is briefly joined for a drink by Oliver's sister Sam (Rosamund Pike), whose affections Gary and Steven fought over in school. At the third pub, Gary is turned away due to being barred as a teenager, but drinks some beer left behind on a table outside. In the toilets of the fourth pub, Gary picks a fight with a teenager and knocks his head off, exposing a blue blood-like liquid and subsequently exposing him as an alien android. Gary's friends join him and fight more androids, whom they refer to as \\"blanks\\" to disguise what they are talking about. They decide to continue the pub crawl so as not to make the androids suspicious of their actions, as Gary had told various people that they were doing the Golden Mile. At the seventh pub, the group runs into Sam again. In the garden, Gary, Sam and Steven get into a fight with androids impersonating Sam's twin friends, making Sam convinced of the androids' invasion after previously not believing Gary. At the eighth pub, androids impersonating attractive girls from their youth attempt to seduce Gary, Andy and Peter, while Basil, a man whom they had spoken to in their previous pub crawl in 1990 and who had been known for making wild theories, explains to Steven the details of the android invasion.

Based on the premise \\"compost pile i haven't been very successful i'm on my third year now and i still have a a pile in the back yard and it it doesn't decompose i guess i got\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I have been super successful\\" is true (see options)? Choose your answer from: a. yes; b. it is not possible to tell; c. no;","completion":"c. no Based on the provided premise, it is clear that the individual has not been successful with their compost pile. They have been trying for three years, and the compost still does not decompose as intended. This indicates a lack of success in achieving the desired outcome. Consequently, we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"I have been super successful\\" is true for this situation. There could be several reasons for the compost pile's failure to decompose properly. Here are some possible factors to consider: 1. Poor aeration: For compost to break down effectively, it needs an adequate supply of oxygen. You should turn the pile regularly to mix the materials and introduce air into the compost. Insufficient aeration can slow down the decomposition process. 2. Imbalanced carbon-to-nitrogen ratio: A proper balance of carbon-rich materials (like leaves, straw, and paper) and nitrogen-rich materials (like grass clippings, kitchen scraps, and coffee grounds) is essential for efficient decomposition. The ideal ratio is around 30 parts carbon to 1 part nitrogen. If your pile consists of too much carbon or not enough nitrogen, it could hinder the decomposition process. 3. Inadequate moisture: Water is an essential factor for the microorganisms and insects that help break down organic matter in a compost pile. Ideally, the contents of the pile should be about as damp as a wrung-out sponge. Both too little and too much moisture can hinder decomposition. 4. Inappropriate size: A compost pile should typically be at least 3 feet wide, 3 feet long, and 3 feet tall to maintain sufficient heat for effective decomposition. A pile that is too small may not be able to generate enough heat, while a pile that is too large may be difficult to aerate. 5. Unfavorable weather conditions: Extreme heat, cold, or drought can slow down the decomposition process by affecting the microorganisms' activity in the compost pile. Try to maintain consistent temperature and moisture levels, and protect the pile from harsh weather conditions. In conclusion, given the premise, we cannot support the hypothesis that the individual has been super successful with their composting endeavor. Instead, they might benefit from investigating the factors contributing to their lack of success and implementing appropriate solutions to improve the composting process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - The Country Music Association (CMA) was founded in 1958 in Nashville, Tennessee. It originally consisted of only 233 members and was the first trade organization formed to promote a music genre. The objectives of the organization are to guide and enhance the development of Country Music throughout the world; to demonstrate it as a viable medium to advertisers, consumers and media; and to provide a unity of purpose for the Country Music industry. However the CMA may be best known to most country music fans for its annual Country Music Association Awards broadcast live on network television each fall (usually October or November). - The Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance was first awarded in 1965, to Dottie West. The award has had several minor name changes: - The Country Music Association Awards, also known as the CMA Awards or CMAs, are presented to country music artists and broadcasters to recognize outstanding achievement in the country music industry. The televised annual presentation ceremony features performances and award presentations by popular country music artists. - A Grammy Award (originally called Gramophone Award), or Grammy, is an honor awarded by The Recording Academy to recognize outstanding achievement in the mainly English-language music industry. The annual presentation ceremony features performances by prominent artists, and the presentation of those awards that have a more popular interest. It shares recognition of the music industry as that of the other performance awards such as the Emmy Awards (television), the Tony Awards (stage performance), and the Academy Awards (motion pictures). - The Academy of Country Music Awards, also known as the ACM Awards, were first held in 1966, honoring the industry's accomplishments during the previous year. It was the first country music awards program held by a major organization. The Academy's signature \\"hat\\" trophy was created in 1968. The awards were first televised in 1972 on ABC. In 1979, the Academy joined with Dick Clark Productions to produce the show. Dick Clark and Al Schwartz served as producers while Gene Weed served as director. Under their guidance, the show moved to NBC and finally to CBS, where it remains today. - Dottie West (born Dorothy Marie Marsh; October 11, 1932 September 4, 1991) was an American country music singer and songwriter. Along with her friends and fellow recording artists Patsy Cline and Loretta Lynn, she is considered one of the genre's most influential and groundbreaking female artists. Dottie West's career started in the 1960s, with her Top 10 hit, \\"Here Comes My Baby Back Again\\", which won her the first Grammy Award for Best Female Country Vocal Performance in 1965. - The Academy of Country Music (ACM) was founded in 1964 in Los Angeles, California as the Country & Western Music Academy.

Given the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\", is \\"get her oils on Kendall's face\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether or not \\"get her oils on Kendall's face\\" is a valid answer to the question \\"Why did Jan do this?\\" However, this scenario can be analyzed from multiple perspectives to gain a better understanding of the possible reasons behind Jan's action. Firstly, it is essential to consider the context in which the scene unfolded, as this can greatly influence the interpretation of the characters' actions. If Jan and Kendall are in a romantic relationship, Jan's action might be interpreted as an expression of intimacy or affection. In such a case, it would be unlikely that her primary objective would be to \\"get her oils on Kendall's face.\\" On the other hand, if Jan and Kendall are friends or relatives, Jan's action could be seen as a gesture of comfort or support. In scenarios where Kendall is not feeling well, for example, Jan might try to soothe or console her friend by resting her head against her forehead. Once again, the primary motivation behind Jan's action would likely not be the transference of her oils. In the absence of any indication that Jan is attempting to perform a specific task or ritual that involves getting her oils on Kendall's face, it is unlikely that this is the main reason behind her action, especially given the context of the characters being on the bed. While it is physically possible that some amount of oil from Jan's face could have transferred onto Kendall's face, it is improbable that this was her primary goal. Instead, more plausible explanations for her action might include showing affection, providing comfort, or checking for fever, among other possibilities. In conclusion, based on the given information and the various factors that were analyzed, the answer \\"get her oils on Kendall's face\\" is not a valid answer because it disregards the emotional or psychological reasons behind Jan's action. Thus, it is essential to examine the context and the relationship between the characters to comprehend the true motivation behind Jan's actions in this scenario."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Mr. Knight was the manager of a hotel. One weekend all of the hotels in the city were full because there was a large meeting. On Friday, three men came into the hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Knight said there were no rooms ready because of the meeting. The men were unhappy. Mr. Knight wanted to help them. He remembered that Room 418, a small room, was empty. He asked them if they could share a room. The three men said they would. Mr. Knight said the room would be thirty dollars; ten dollars for each person. Each man gave him the money and then went up to the room. Mr. Knight soon began to feel sorry. \\"Thirty dollars is a lot to ask as a price for that small room.\\" he thought. He called his assistant over and said, \\"Here is five dollars. Take it to the men in Room 418. I asked too much for their room.\\" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way there, he started to think, \\"How can three men divide five dollars? I'll give them each only one dollar and keep the two dollars for myself. The men will be happy to get something back. And Mr. Knight will never know.\\" So the assistant returned one dollar to each man. Each man had at first paid ten dollars. After the assistant returned them one dollar each, each had actually(in fact) paid nine. There were three men. 9 3=\\"27.\\" The assistant kept2. 27+2=\\"29.\\" Where is the missing dollar? Question: At first _ . Options: A: 27 was paid by the three men B: 30 was paid by each of the three men C: 25 was paid by the three men D: 10 was paid by each of the three men A:","completion":"The correct answer is D: 10 was paid by each of the three men. This conclusion is directly drawn from the scenario presented in the text. It clearly states that Mr. Knight, the hotel manager, asked for ten dollars from each man for the room. Following this, \\"Each man gave him the money\\", further reinforcing that ten dollars was indeed paid by each of the three men. The total amount Mr. Knight received initially was thirty dollars (10 x 3 = 30). This action occurred before the assistant decided to return a dollar to each man and kept two for himself, which subsequently resulted in the men having paid nine dollars each in actuality. Hence, the initial amount paid by each of the three men was ten dollars, providing the accurate answer for the question in contention. Option B: 30 was paid by each of the three men is incorrect because it wrongly triples the individual contribution. Each person only paid 10, not 30. The total amount paid was 30, but it was split among the three men. Option A: 27 was paid by the three men is incorrect too, as it refers to the amount paid by the men collectively after they were returned a dollar by the assistant and does not regard the initial amount paid by each man. Option C: 25 was paid by the three men is also incorrect because it does not reflect any transaction reflected in the text.

The actual carrier of oxygen molecules is the protein hemoglobin, which binds to the oxygen and moves it throughout the body, releasing it in areas where the concentration of dissolved oxygen is low. A certain mutation in the gene for hemoglobin causes a slight change in the structure of this crucial protein, resulting in a disease called sickle-cell anemia. For people with this mutation, the hemoglobin produced by their red blood cells has a tendency to clump together, distorting the shape of the red blood cells and giving rise to the crescent-shaped cells seen above. By understanding the changes in structure that are the underlying cause of this disease, we have developed various ways to treat and manage this illness. and the situation: Doctors studied Dan, a normal patient, whit a normal number of red blood cells, and Jim, a patient that had sickle-cell anemia.

The strike, called in September 1913 by the United Mine Workers, over the issue of union representation, was against coal mine operators in Huerfano and Las Animas counties of southern Colorado, where the majority of CF&I's coal and coke production was located. The strike was fought vigorously by the coal mine operators association and its steering committee, which included Welborn, president of CF&I, a spokesman for the coal operators. Rockefeller's operative, Lamont Montgomery Bowers, remained in the background. Few miners actually belonged to the union or participated in the strike call, but the majority honored it. Strikebreakers (called \\"scabs\\") were threatened and sometimes attacked. Both sides purchased substantial arms and ammunition. Striking miners were forced to abandon their homes in company towns and lived in tent cities erected by the union, such as the tent city at Ludlow, a railway stop north of Trinidad. Under the protection of the National Guard, some miners returned to work and some strikebreakers, imported from the eastern coalfields, joined them as Guard troops protecting their movements. In February 1914, a substantial portion of the troops were withdrawn, but a large contingent remained at Ludlow. On April 20, 1914, a general fire-fight occurred between strikers and troops, which was antagonized by the troops and mine guards. The camp was burned, resulting in 15 women and children, who hid in tents at the camp, being burned to death. Costs to both mine operators and the union were high. This incident brought unwanted national attention to Colorado. Due to reduced demand for coal, resulting from an economic downturn, many of CF&I's coal mines never reopened and many men were thrown out of work. The union was forced to discontinue strike benefits in February 1915. There was destitution in the coal fields. With the help of funds from the Rockefeller Foundation, relief programs were organized by the Colorado Committee on Unemployment and Relief. A state agency created by Governor Carlson, offered work to unemployed miners building roads and doing other useful projects. The casualties suffered at Ludlow were successfully labeled a massacre and mobilized public opinion against the Rockefellers and the coal industry. The United States Commission on Industrial Relations conducted extensive hearings, singling out John D. Rockefeller Jr. and the Rockefellers' relationship with Bowers for special attention. Bowers was relieved of duty and Wellborn restored to control in 1915, then industrial relations improved. Rockefeller denied any responsibility and minimized the seriousness of the event. When testifying on the Ludlow Massacre, and asked what action he would have taken as Director, John D. Rockefeller stated, \\"I would have taken no action. I would have deplored the necessity which compelled the officers of the company to resort to such measures to supplement the State forces to maintain law and order.\\" Rockefeller admitted that he had made no attempt to bring the militiamen to justice.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the last name of the person who planned to work with his longtime librettist? is inside the article: The one-act opera genre had become increasingly popular in Italy following the 1890 competition sponsored by publisher Edoardo Sonzogno for the best such work, which was won by the young Pietro Mascagni's Cavalleria rusticana. With Tosca essentially completed by November 1899, Puccini sought a new project. Among sources he considered, before proceeding with Madama Butterfly, were three works by French dramatist Alphonse Daudet that Puccini thought might be made into a trilogy of one-act operas.After Butterfly premiered in 1904, Puccini again had difficulty finding a new subject. He further considered the idea of composing three one-act operas to be performed together, but found his publisher, Giulio Ricordi, firmly opposed to such a project, convinced that it would be expensive to cast and produce. The composer then planned to work with his longtime librettist, Giuseppe Giacosa, on an opera about Marie Antoinette, a project frustrated by the librettist's illness. Puccini wrote in November 1905, \\"Will we go back to it? [Maria Antonietta] If I find three one-act works that suit me, I'll put off M.A.\\" Puccini pursued neither project, as Giacosa's illness led to his death in September 1906.In March 1907, Puccini wrote to Carlo Clausetti, Ricordi's representative in Naples, proposing three one-act operas based on scenes from stories by Russian novelist Maxim Gorky. By May the composer had set aside this proposal to concentrate on the project which became La fanciulla del West, although he did not wholly abandon the idea of a multiple-opera evening. His next idea in this vein, some years later, was for a two-opera bill, one tragic and one comic; he later expanded this to include a third opera with a mystic or religious tone. By November 1916 Puccini had completed the \\"tragic\\" element, which became Il tabarro, but he still lacked ideas for the other two works. He considered staging Il tabarro in combination with his own early work Le Villi, or with other two-act operas which might be used to round out the evening's..., can you guess it ?

No doubt intended as a totally campy joke, \\"Full Moon High\\" portrays 1950s teenager Tony Walker (Adam Arkin) accompanying his father (Ed McMahon) on a trip to Romania. Sure enough, Tony gets bitten, and grows fur and fangs whenever there's a full moon. A particularly interesting aspect in this movie is that he can't age as long as he has the werewolf curse, and that he has to fulfill a destiny - even if it takes twenty years. But otherwise, the movie's just plain funny once it gets going. Ed McMahon's character is an over-patriotic right-wing yahoo (he thinks that everyone should have listened to Joe McCarthy), Kenneth Mars's coach/principal is a tense dweeb, and then there's more. One of the most eye-opening cast members is Demond Wilson - best remembered as Lamont on \\"Sanford and Son\\" - as a bus driver who gets a big surprise. But probably the funniest scene is the changing of the presidents; then gag with Gerald Ford really summed him up! Anyway, it's a real treat. Considering that Alan Arkin - who plays a zany psychiatrist - just won an Oscar on Sunday night and thanked his sons, I wonder whether or not he remembers co-starring with two of them in this movie (aside from Adam, his son Anthony also has a small role).

Please write a short summary for the following article: COLLEGE FOOTBALL- BCS computer projections The most anticipated matchup in college football history actually lived up to its billing with one of the greatest games in history. Top-ranked USC kept its win-streak alive and secured its bid as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas in a Rose Bowl game that featured stellar performances from the heralded and unheralded alike. After a five-yard touchdown on a keeper by Heisman Finalist QB Vince Young put the Longhorns on top 7-0 half-way through the first quarter, fellow Heisman Finalist QB Matt Leinart revived an offense that looked sluggish on its first few possessions with three quick TD strikes to three different receivers and the Trojans found themselves up 21-7 at halftime. Aside from its first drive the Longhorn offense looked stale and one-dimensional. Things did not really get better in the third quarter either when Reggie Bush found his groove and then the endzone with a 32-yard run that improved the USC lead to 28-10 at the time. A David Pino field goal with a minute left in the third-quarter chipped the lead to 15, but Texas' chances still looked bleak. Apparently though, an entirely different Longhorn squad on both sides of the ball came out for the fourth quarter. USC punter Tom Malone's coffin-corner kick from the Longhorn's 36 went awry, allowing Aaron Ross to return the ball all the way to the USC four-yard line to set up a Ramonce Taylor touchdown. USC scored almost too quickly on its next possession, kicking a field goal to lead 31-20 with plenty of time to play at 10:37 in the fourth. On the second play of Texas' next possession, Vince Young put on one of the greatest shows in BCS history with a seemingly effortless 71-yard run that stunned the Trojans and left the millions watching in awe. He then took the snap from shotgun into the endzone on a draw to narrow the gap to just three after the successful two-point conversion. Texas forced USC into another short possession and punt to get the ball back on its own 12 yard line with about six minutes left in the game. It didn't quite take that long. A surprising burst from 270-pound freshman RB Henry Melton set up a 36-yard Pino field goal to cap unlikeliest of comebacks. The Trojans offensive weapons were just too much for the exhausted Longhorn's though. USC used runs by both Reggie Bush and LenDale White as well as four key completions by Leinart to prepare for a 43-yard field goal. Mario Danelo's kick sailed through the uprights with 31 seconds remaining and a Rose Bowl victory in sights. Young missed on deep attempts on the final Texas possession and the Trojans walked away the victors. The two-headed all-purpose monster of Bush and White combined for 360 yards from scrimmage and Leinart was spectacular in the biggest game of his illustrious collegiate career, going 22-40 for 290 yards, three touchdowns and no interceptions. Despite leading his team to a successful comeback and turning even more heads with his rushing prowess, Young may want to rethink his NFL future after completing just eight of 22 passes, throwing zero touchdowns and coming up short when it truly counted. For now though, it's the same as it has been for three years, the Trojans are on top and everyone else is looking up at them. Player of the Game: Reggie Bush (241 yards from scrimmage, 2 TDs) Fiesta Bowl Notre Dame (9-3) 20, Ohio State (10-2) 27","completion":"In an unforgettable Rose Bowl game, top-ranked USC managed to keep its win streak alive, securing its place as one of the greatest teams in college football history with a narrow victory over second-ranked Texas. The game showcased outstanding performances from both well-known and lesser-known players. After a slow start, USC quarterback Matt Leinart led the team to a 21-7 lead by halftime. Although Texas seemed to be faltering, Vince Young led a stunning revival in the fourth quarter, demonstrating incredible skill with a 71-yard run, and bringing the gap to just three points. However, USC's offensive weapons proved too much for Texas, with a combination of runs and key completions leading to a final field goal and a thrilling USC victory. Despite the loss, Young's performance during the game further solidified his impressive reputation, while USC's Reggie Bush was named Player of the Game, contributing 241 yards from scrimmage and 2 touchdowns. In the Fiesta Bowl, Ohio State triumphed over Notre Dame with a final score of 27-20."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Evans' first-quarter performance was a Buffalo record for a period and just shy of the NFL record for yards receiving in a quarter of 210 by Baltimore's Qadry Ismail in 1999. The first touchdown came after Nate Clements' interception on the third play of the game. Both were after Evans got in front of Texans cornerback Demarcus Faggins for the easy score. The 83-yard TDs were career highs for both Losman and Evans and marked the first time in franchise history the Bills have had two 80-yard passes in a single game. David Carr opened 1 for 3 with an interception on his first pass before completing his next 22 throws. Carr finished 25 of 30 for 223 yards and no touchdowns. Carr tied the record held by Mark Brunell, who had 22 consecutive completions in Washington's 31-15 win over the Texans at Reliant Stadium on September 24. He tied Brunell's record on a short pass to Wali Lundy for no gain with 6:19 left. The streak was broken when his pass to Andre Johnson with 5:44 remaining fell short. Lundy cut the lead to 14-7 with a 17-yard run in the first quarter. That score was set up by a 17-yard reception by Eric Moulds on third-and-8. Samkon Gado made it 17-14 on a 1-yard run in the second quarter. Moulds also had a key third-down reception on that drive. Dunta Robinson gave the Texans the lead on a 9-yard interception return midway through the third quarter. Losman was throwing out of the end zone when Robinson intercepted the pass intended for Evans to score his first career touchdown and the Texans' first defensive touchdown since 2004. But after the offense failed to put the game away in the fourth quarter the Texans gave the Bills just enough time to beat them. Losman hit a diving Peerless Price in the back of the end zone for the 15-yard touchdown with 13 seconds left, giving Buffalo the 24-21 win. Answer this question based on the article: What happened twice during the first quarter?","completion":"In simple words, during the first quarter, the Bills' wide receiver Lee Evans and quarterback J.P.

This experience has provided Jessica with the necessary skills and expertise in handling and serving alcoholic beverages, particularly beer, while Felicia lacks such exposure to enhance her beer pouring abilities. Working in a distillery environment exposes staff members to important aspects of the brewing process, allowing them to understand the intricate steps that go into crafting a perfect beverage. This knowledge is vital when it comes to pouring a beer, as there are certain techniques and methods that must be followed to ensure a perfect pour and an enjoyable drinking experience for the consumer. For example, working at a distillery would have taught Jessica the proper tilt angle when pouring a beer from a tap, so as to minimize foam and ensure a consistent flow of beer. Additionally, she would have gained experience in managing the speed of the pour and understanding the characteristics of different types of beer, such as ales, lagers, and stouts. These elements are crucial when pouring a beer because they determine the optimal temperature and the appropriate glassware for serving. Moreover, working at a distillery would have given Jessica the opportunity to interact with other professionals in the industry, such as brewers, product developers, and other skilled bartenders, which would have continuously honed her beer-pouring skills. This interaction helps build a strong foundation of knowledge and best practices through experience sharing and continuous feedback. As such, Jessica's distillery experience would have provided her with numerous opportunities to practice and perfect her beer pouring abilities, while also giving her a solid appreciation for the craft and artistry involved in brewing and serving these beverages. In contrast, Felicia's lack of distillery experience means she has not been exposed to the same level of instruction and practical hands-on learning that Jessica has. As a result, she may be less familiar with the specific techniques and nuances of pouring beer and might struggle with aspects such as controlling foam, selecting the appropriate glassware, or understanding how different beer types should be poured and served. In conclusion, Jessica's advantage over Felicia in pouring beer mainly stems from her distillery experience, which has allowed her to refine her skills, acquire invaluable knowledge about the brewing process, and develop a better understanding of the various factors that contribute to an enjoyable beer-pouring and drinking experience. This background has equipped Jessica with the mastery and proficiency necessary to outperform Felicia in this particular aspect and ensures that customers can appreciate the best qualities of their beverages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In his final speech, he blamed the Jewish people for the problems between Israel and the Palestinians. \\"The Jews have taken land of the Muslims,\\" he said. \\"What if part of America was given to the Jews as Israel? Would the Americans let it happen? Of course not.\\" His words angered many western governments, but Mahathir doesn't care. \\"I like to speak my mind,\\" the 77-year-old explained. \\"Sometimes people don't like it. But that is what leadership is all about.\\" Loved by some and disliked by others, his 22 years in power have seen great changes in Malaysia. He has taken it from being one of Asia's poorest countries to the world's 18th largest trading nation. It is also a peaceful country with native Malaysians living alongside minority groups. Chinese make up a quarter of the population, while a further 7.4 percent are of Indian origin. Teenage girls wearingMuslim1headscarves happily walk around large stores as ethnic Chinese playmah-jong2in nearby cafes. But Mahathir has made enemies at home and abroad and some people will be glad he has gone. The US was unhappy when he often blamed it for globalization. Meanwhile, critics say that he has limited the freedom of the Malaysian people in order to stay in control of the country. Despite this, he is a hero to leaders in Southeast Asia as well as those in theIslamic3world. \\"He marked out the path to success for developing nations in the region to follow,\\" said Thai President Thaksin Shinawatra.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Twitter is making direct messages open to people you don't follow. Users will have to opt in to the feature. Some see broader communication, while others see spam. Article:","completion":"Title: Twitter's Direct Message Update: A Path to Broader Communication or a Gateway to Spam? Introduction: Twitter, the popular social media platform, continues to evolve and adapt to the ever-changing digital landscape. In a recent update, the company has now made direct messages open to people users don't follow, a significant change in how users can communicate and interact with each other. However, with this new feature comes potential drawbacks that have ignited a debate about whether this update will lead to broader communication or open the floodgates for spam. Step 1: Explain the new feature and its requirements The new feature, which allows Twitter users to receive direct messages from people they don't follow, requires users to opt into the service. By doing so, users open their inbox to messages from any individual on the platform, creating new opportunities for networking and exposure. This change makes it much easier to connect with others who share interests, work in the same industry or have a question about a particular topic. Step 2: Discuss the potential pros of the update For some Twitter users, this update presents exciting possibilities for broader communication. By opting into the feature, users can engage in conversations with individuals they might not have otherwise had the chance to connect with, potentially leading to fruitful discussions, collaborations, or networking opportunities. Additionally, this feature could redefine public figure-fan interactions, enabling a more direct line of communication between celebrities, influencers, and their followers. Step 3: Address the concerns surrounding spam On the other hand, many users worry that this new feature will leave their direct message inboxes vulnerable to spam and unsolicited messages. With an open door policy for direct messages, spammers and bots could flood inboxes with unwanted content, making it challenging for users to sift through genuine messages. The influx of spam could also lead to privacy concerns, as more users could potentially receive inappropriate or harmful content. Step 4: Offer potential solutions to minimize spam influx To alleviate these concerns, Twitter could implement a more stringent verification process for accounts to reduce the likelihood of bots and spammers taking advantage of the new feature. The platform could also offer customizable message filtering options, enabling users to set specific parameters for what types of messages they receive. By doing so, users retain control over the content that enters their inbox while enjoying the benefits of an open direct message system. Conclusion: While the debate over Twitter's direct message update continues, it is clear that the new feature has the potential to redefine how users communicate and interact on the platform. As with any significant change, there will be both positive outcomes and challenges to face. It is up to Twitter and its user base to find a balance that cultivates meaningful connections while maintaining privacy and security. Only time will tell if this update ultimately proves to be a boon or a burden for the social media giant."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Uncontacted tribe: extraordinary aerial footage This film, narrated by Gillian Anderson, shows extraordinary aerial footage of an uncontacted tribe living in the Uncontacted Frontier. The highest concentration of uncontacted tribes on Earth live here, on the borders of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia. ‘ The uncontacted people are like us before we were contacted. They move from place to place, and when they see a white person they flee. But I can assure you that they are there. Salomon Dunu, Matsés ’ On the border of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia lives the highest concentration of uncontacted tribes on Earth. They know no borders, crossing between countries as part of their nomadic routes. They include the Isconahua, Matsigenka, Matsés, Mashco-Piro, Mastanahua, Murunahua (or Chitonahua), Nanti, Sapanawa and Nahua, and many more whose names are unknown. Not much is known about them. But we do know that they have rejected contact, often as a result of horrific violence and diseases brought in by outsiders. Some chose isolation after surviving the rubber boom, in which thousands of Indians were enslaved and killed. Many fled to the deepest parts of the Amazon and have evaded long-term contact ever since. On the very rare occasions when they are seen or encountered, they make it clear they want to be left alone. Sometimes they react aggressively, as a way of defending their territory, or leave signs in the forest warning outsiders to stay away. How they live The Amazon Uncontacted Frontier, a large area on the Peru-Brazil border that is home to the highest concentration of uncontacted tribes in the world. © Survival International These uncontacted tribes are not backward and primitive relics of a remote past. They are our contemporaries and a vitally important part of humankind’s diversity. Almost all are nomads, moving throughout their territories according to the seasons in small, extended family groups. In the rainy season, when water levels are high, those who generally do not use canoes live away from the rivers deep in the rainforest. During the dry season, however, some camp on the beaches and fish and collect turtle eggs. Some live in communal houses and plant crops in forest clearings, while also hunting and fishing. Abandoned hut, believed to belong to the uncontacted Mashco-Piro, taken during a FENAMAD trip to Tayacomme, Manu National Park, Peru. © FENAMAD Others, such as the Mashco-Piro, are hunter-gatherers who can quickly build camps and abandon them. They hunt animals such as monkeys with long bows and arrows. Outsiders are moving in There are many outsiders who seek to force contact in the Uncontacted Frontier. Missionaries, for example, want to evangelize tribes as they consider them to be primitive. Some academics are calling for uncontacted tribes to be forcibly contacted as they consider their existence to be “not viable in the long term”. Other intruders have shot the Indians, and even massacred whole villages, when engaged in illicit activities such as drug trafficking. Very often, however, contact occurs simply because outsiders want to steal the tribes’ lands and resources. Tribal peoples are the best guardians of the environment and as a result, their lands are resource-rich. The timber from their forests is incredibly profitable. So too is the oil and gas that lies beneath their feet. Isconahua Indians with the missionaries who forced contact © Survival These threats have ripple effects throughout the region as Indians are forced to abandon their gardens and hunting grounds and flee. For example, a group of Sapanawa recently made contact in Brazil after outsiders massacred the majority of their elderly. So many people were killed that they couldn’t bury them all and their corpses were eaten by vultures. Fatal first contact Survival opposes attempts by outsiders to contact uncontacted people. It’s always fatal and initiating contact must be their choice alone. Those who enter uncontacted tribes’ territories deny them that choice. A Tragic First Contact Jorge, a Murunahua man who lost his eye when he was shot by loggers during first contact, recalls the tragedy that followed. Whole populations are being wiped out by diseases like flu and measles to which they have no resistance. The young and elderly are often the first and most likely to die. ‘Before we knew it, we’d all caught pneumonia.’ The Matis of Brazil recall the devastating impact of first contact. First contact with the Matis in the Javari Valley in Brazil ocurred in 1978 and rapidly killed over half of them. They stopped practising their ceremonies and, like many Indians suffering from the trauma of first contact, stopped having children. By 1983 only 87 Matis survived. Today the shattered remnants of the Matis are regrouping but suffer from the impacts of introduced diseases such as malaria and hepatitis. In the early 1980s, exploration by Shell led to contact with the isolated Nahua tribe. Within a few years around 50% of the Nahua had died. To this day, the surviving Nahua suffer from a variety of diseases such as tuberculosis and Hepatitis B, and receive little help from the government. The problems do not stop after contact. Sometimes governments try to forcibly integrate and mainstream indigenous peoples by settling and integrating them. Officials believe that the tribes need “modernizing” but the fact that these societies are not industrialized does not mean they are not already part of the modern world, with just as much right to choose the way in which they live as any other society. The underlying objective, however, is to free up indigenous land so that the resources can be used. Protecting the land All uncontacted tribal peoples face catastrophe unless their land is protected. This means that all of the Uncontacted Frontier region must receive protection. Survival is doing everything it can to secure the uncontacted tribes’ land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. Several uncontacted reserves, indigenous territories and national parks exist in this region. But this is not enough. More must be created so that all tribal territory is included inside a protected area. And, most importantly, the borders of these areas must be properly policed. For example, the Brazilian government has recognized territories for uncontacted tribes in this region. However, cuts in funding mean that monitoring posts are understaffed and even abandoned which has enabled drug traffickers and loggers to operate on uncontacted land with impunity. Furthermore, oil exploration and roads continue to be approved in the very hearts of these protected lands. Sierra del Divisor: The Watershed Mountains Contacted Matsés living nearby have strongly opposed any oil exploration © Survival A newly created park in Peru has failed to protect the uncontacted people living inside. The Sierra del Divisor region straddles both Peru and Brazil. It is known for its unique landscape and is a stronghold for rare and endangered animals. It is also home to a number of uncontacted tribes, including the Matsés and Isconahua. In 2015, a national park was created on the Peruvian side. But the region continues to be overrun by loggers, drug-traffickers and miners. Despite being a national park, large areas can still be opened up to oil exploration. Any oil exploration is devastating for uncontacted peoples and forces them to run for their lives. Tribal peoples are the best conservationists. Protecting them is therefore the best way to protect the environment, for all humanity. When contact is made When members of a tribe initiate contact, or contact is forced upon them by outsiders, the country’s government has an obligation to react swiftly and decisively to try and reduce the very high risk of loss of life. Expert medical teams must travel to the area immediately and remain in situ on a long-term basis. Care must be taken not to encourage the tribal peoples to become dependent. The boundaries of the uncontacted peoples’ territories should be policed to prevent incursions by unauthorised people. The latter must also be kept away if tribespeople have voluntarily left the borders of their own land. Contact must not be initiated by anyone other than the tribe in question, as nearly all contacts result in loss of life. Mashco-Piro Uncontacted Mashco-Piro Indians on a riverbank near the Manú National Park. 2011. © Jean-Paul Van Belle In 2011, outsiders began to regularly make contact with a group of Mashco-Piro. These outsiders included missionaries and tourists, who gave the Indians objects such as machetes, plantain and clothes. The Peruvian government did not stop these interactions until 2015, after the Mashco-Piro killed a man in a local indigenous community. The government now monitors the tribe to ensure that there is no more violence and to prevent the spread of disease. However, there is minimal medical presence and disaster could strike at any moment. Help Survival All of the Amazon Uncontacted Frontier must be protected if the tribal peoples who live there are to survive. Their territories should never be opened up to outside projects, including oil exploration, deforestation and roads. We’re doing everything we can to secure their land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. ||||| Survival International, a global indigenous rights group, warned that given the small sizes of the uncontacted Amazon tribes, this latest episode could mean that a significant percentage of a remote ethnic group was wiped out. “If the investigation confirms the reports, it will be yet another genocidal massacre resulting directly from the Brazilian government’s failure to protect isolated tribes — something that is guaranteed in the Constitution,” said Sarah Shenker, a senior campaigner with the rights group. Under Brazil’s president, Michel Temer, funding for indigenous affairs has been slashed. In April, Funai closed five of the 19 bases that it uses to monitor and protect isolated tribes, and reduced staffing at others. The bases are used to prevent invasions by loggers and miners and to communicate with recently contacted tribes. Three of those bases were in the Javari Valley, which is known as the Uncontacted Frontier and is believed to be home to more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Approximately 20 of the 103 uncontacted tribes registered in Brazil are in the Valley. “We had problems with previous governments, but not like this,” said Ms. Sotto-Maior, the Funai coordinator. Her agency’s budget this year for the uncontacted tribes department was just two million reais, or about 650,000, down from 7.5 million reais in 2014. “What can I do with two million reais?” she said. President Temer, who is deeply unpopular, has sought support from powerful agricultural, ranching and mining lobbies to push economic changes through Congress and shelter him from a corruption investigation. Last month, the lower house of Congress voted to spare him from standing trial for corruption in the Supreme Court, but only after the president doled out jobs and agreed to a series of concessions, many of which affected longstanding deforestation and land-rights regulations. A decree by Mr. Temer that opened up a large reserve in the Amazon to mining prompted an international outcry. After a judge blocked the decree, the government announced that it would revise its decision, but critics are wary. ||||| Genocide: goldminers “massacre” uncontacted Amazon Indians September 8, 2017 Evidence of an attack? Burnt communal houses of uncontacted Indians, seen in December 2016, could be signs of another massacre in the Uncontacted Frontier. © FUNAI Public prosecutors in Brazil have opened an investigation after reports that illegal goldminers in a remote Amazon river have massacred “more than ten\\" members of an uncontacted tribe. If confirmed, this means up to a fifth of the entire tribe have been wiped out. Two goldminers have been arrested. The killings allegedly took place last month along the River Jandiatuba in western Brazil, but the news only emerged after the goldminers started boasting about the killings, and showing off “trophies” in the nearest town. Agents from Brazil’s indigenous affairs agency, FUNAI, confirmed details of the attack to Survival International. Women and children are believed to be among the dead. FUNAI and the public prosecutor’s office are currently investigating. The area is known as the Uncontacted Frontier, as it contains more uncontacted tribes than anywhere else on Earth. Several government teams who had been protecting uncontacted indigenous territories have recently had their funding slashed by the Brazilian government, and have had to close down. Uncontacted Indians in the Brazilian Amazon, filmed from the air in 2010. © G.Miranda/FUNAI/Survival President Temer’s government is fiercely anti-Indian, and has close ties to the country’s powerful and anti-indigenous agribusiness lobby. The territories of two other vulnerable uncontacted tribes – the Kawahiva and Piripkura – have also reportedly been invaded. Both are surrounded by hundreds of ranchers and land invaders. Uncontacted tribes are the most vulnerable peoples on the planet. However, when their rights are respected, they continue to thrive. All uncontacted tribal peoples face catastrophe unless their land is protected. Survival International is doing everything it can to secure their land for them, and to give them the chance to determine their own futures. Survival’s Director Stephen Corry said: “If these reports are confirmed, President Temer and his government bear a heavy responsibility for this genocidal attack. The slashing of FUNAI’s funds has left dozens of uncontacted tribes defenseless against thousands of invaders – goldminers, ranchers and loggers – who are desperate to steal and ransack their lands. All these tribes should have had their lands properly recognized and protected years ago – the government’s open support for those who want to open up indigenous territories is utterly shameful, and is setting indigenous rights in Brazil back decades.\\" ||||| Summary:","completion":"In a remote area where the borders of Peru, Brazil and Bolivia meet, there is a large group of uncontacted tribes, known as the Uncontacted Frontier. These tribes move from place to place without borders and include many different groups like the Isconahua, Matsigenka, Matsés, and more. They live like our ancient ancestors, living off the land, hunting, and fishing. The tribes often run away when they see outsiders, because sometimes outsiders bring harm to them. Unfortunately, some people want to take their lands and resources, like wood, oil and gas.

My reply is often a brief \\"You have as much time as the president.\\"I usually carry on a bit about there being twenty-four hours in the day for everyone, and suggest that \\"not enough time\\" is not an acceptable explanation of not getting something done. Once in graduate school,I tried to prove to one of my professors by saying that I was working hard.His answer to me was. \\"That's irrelevant .What's important is the quality of your work. \\" Since then I have had time to think carefully about the \\"hard worker\\" dodge ,and I have come to some conclusions--all relevant to the problem of how much time we have. If you analyze the matter, you can identify two parts of the prob1em:There is, of course,the matter of \\"time\\", which we call think of as fixed. Then there is the problem of \\"work\\" during that time. But, as my professor suggested, it's not how hard one works but the quality of the product that's important. That led me to a new idea: the quality of the work.That concept is perhaps best explained by a sign I once saw on the wall in someone s office: \\"Don't work harder. Work smarter.\\" There is a lot of sense in that idea. If you can't get more time,and few of US can,the only solution is to improve the quality of the work.That means thinking of ways to get more out of the same time than we might otherwise get.That should lead us to an analysis of our work habits.Since \\"work\\" for students usually means \\"homework\\", the expression \\"work habits' should be read as \\"study habits\\".

Your task is to investigate and analyze the case. Step 1: Gather case information and evidence (justify reasoning) To better understand the investigation, it's crucial to gather all case information and evidence that has been presented. Collecting information such as court records, law enforcement reports, and expert testimonies will provide a solid foundation for the analysis. Reasoning: Examining all available information is essential for forming a thorough understanding and identifying potential discrepancies or inconsistencies in the statements. Step 2: Analyze witness testimonies (justify reasoning) Given that Keith Wiens is the defendant, his statement will be scrutinized for consistency and credibility. Other testimonies by people who have interacted with Wiens and Kalmring, including neighbours, family, and friends, will be collected to paint a more comprehensive picture of their relationship and personalities. Reasoning: Witness testimonies are important sources of information as they can offer different perspectives and insights into the case, leading to possible contradictions or new evidence. Step 3: Investigate inconsistencies and discrepancies (justify reasoning) Having gathered and analyzed witness testimonies and evidence, the next step is to identify inconsistencies or discrepancies in the statements and evidence. These might involve the timeline of events, descriptions of the crime scene, or conflicting witness accounts. Reasoning: Uncovering inconsistencies or discrepancies can help reveal potential falsehoods in the defendant’s testimony and increase the chance of discovering the truth behind the murder. Step 4: Cross-reference with expert opinions (justify reasoning) Examine the expert testimonies and evidence, such as forensic findings and psychologists' opinions. Cross-referencing these expert insights with the case information and witness testimonies can help identify any gaps or confirm the reliability of the evidence. Reasoning: Experts can provide valuable information that might be beyond the scope of a layperson, reinforcing or debunking the presented evidence. Step 5: Analyze the case considering all available information (justify reasoning) Combining all the gathered information, including evidence, testimony, and expert opinions, perform a comprehensive analysis of the case. This synthesis will help determine the likelihood of whether the murder was premeditated or an act of self-defense, as the defendant claims. Reasoning: Drawing conclusions based on a thorough analysis of all information is crucial for providing an informed judgement on the case's possible outcomes, ensuring that justice is served. Step 6: Present the findings (justify reasoning) Finally, with a detailed analysis of the case's circumstances, present the findings either supporting or refuting the claim that the murder was premeditated. Make sure to provide clear explanations for each point made, referring to the evidence and expert opinions as supporting material.

The album is considered crucial in the thrash metal genesis because it introduced fast percussion, low-register chords, and shredding leads to the genre. Hammett played some pentatonic patterns in addition to his breakneck solos. Ulrich adopted a double time snare pattern that would become a mainstay on Metallica's subsequent albums. Hetfield's vocals evolved from the melodic wail on No Life 'til Leather to a rough-edged bark, and the entire band played faster and more accurately on Kill 'Em All. Music writer Joel McIver said Burton's and Hetfield's performances were nearly virtuosic, because of the smooth-sounding bass of the former and the precise picking skills of the latter. According to journalist Chuck Eddy, the juvenile lyrical approach to topics such as warfare, violence and life on the road gives the album a \\"naive charm\\". The musical approach on Kill 'Em All was in contrast to the glam metal bands who dominated the charts in the early 1980s. Because of its rebellious nature and Metallica's street appearance, it appealed to fans who were not into the mainstream of hard rock. \\"Phantom Lord\\" is a lyrical nod to devilry. The song begins with synthesized bass drone and contains a middle section with clean, arpeggiated guitar chords. Written by Mustaine, its central riff is in NWOBHM fashion. \\"No Remorse\\" is a mid-tempo song which suddenly accelerates its tempo in the fifth minute. The song is about not feeling any remorse or sense of repentance during battle. \\"Seek & Destroy\\" was inspired by Diamond Head's \\"Dead Reckoning\\" and is the first song Metallica recorded during the Kill 'Em All sessions. Hetfield wrote the main riff in his truck outside a Los Angeles sticker factory where he was working. Because of its simple, one-line chorus, the song became a permanent setlist fixture and a crowd singalong. \\"Metal Militia\\", one of the fastest songs on the album, is about heavy metal's way of life and nonconformity...., can you guess it ?

Given the below context: Peace between England and the Netherlands in 1688 meant that the two countries entered the Nine Years' War as allies, but the conflict—waged in Europe and overseas between France, Spain and the Anglo-Dutch alliance—left the English a stronger colonial power than the Dutch, who were forced to devote a larger proportion of their military budget on the costly land war in Europe. The 18th century saw England (after 1707, Britain) rise to be the world's dominant colonial power, and France becoming its main rival on the imperial stage.The death of Charles II of Spain in 1700 and his bequeathal of Spain and its colonial empire to Philippe of Anjou, a grandson of the King of France, raised the prospect of the unification of France, Spain and their respective colonies, an unacceptable state of affairs for England and the other powers of Europe. In 1701, England, Portugal and the Netherlands sided with the Holy Roman Empire against Spain and France in the War of the Spanish Succession, which lasted until 1714. At the concluding Treaty of Utrecht, Philip renounced his and his descendants' right to the French throne and Spain lost its empire in Europe. The British Empire was territorially enlarged: from France, Britain gained Newfoundland and Acadia, and from Spain, Gibraltar and Menorca. Gibraltar became a critical naval base and allowed Britain to control the Atlantic entry and exit point to the Mediterranean.

Rice noted at the time that a more wide-ranging examination of policy toward Afghanistan was needed first. She wanted the review very soon. Rice and others recalled the President saying, \\"I'm tired of swatting at flies.\\" The President reportedly also said,\\"I'm tired of playing defense. I want to play offense. I want to take the fight to the terrorists.\\" President Bush explained to us that he had become impatient. He apparently had heard proposals for rolling back al Qaeda but felt that catching terrorists one by one or even cell by cell was not an approach likely to succeed in the long run. At the same time, he said, he understood that policy had to be developed slowly so that diplomacy and financial and military measures could mesh with one another. Hadley convened an informal Deputies Committee meeting on March 7, when some of the deputies had not yet been confirmed. For the first time, Clarke's various proposals-for aid to the Northern Alliance and the Uzbeks and for Predator missions-went before the group that, in the Bush NSC, would do most of the policy work. Though they made no decisions on these specific proposals, Hadley apparently concluded that there should be a presidential national security policy directive (NSPD) on terrorism. Clarke would later express irritation about the deputies' insistence that a strategy for coping with al Qaeda be framed within the context of a regional policy. He doubted that the benefits would compensate for the time lost. The administration had in fact proceeded with Principals Committee meetings on topics including Iraq and Sudan without prior contextual review, and Clarke favored moving ahead similarly with a narrow counterterrorism agenda. But the President's senior advisers saw the al Qaeda problem as part of a puzzle that could not be assembled without filling in the pieces for Afghanistan and Pakistan. Rice deferred a Principals Committee meeting on al Qaeda until the deputies had developed a new policy for their consideration.

They were ancestors. Who knows? But you’re not supposed to sit on them because you’re not supposed to expose your genitalia to them. I, however, was in a wetsuit for this whole shoot, and oh my god, they were so good for butt-itching.” Lawrence then went on to describe how she accidentally knocked one of the stones loose. “One rock that I was butt-scratching on ended up coming loose, and it was a giant boulder, and it rolled down the mountain, and it almost killed our sound guy,” she said. “It was this huge dramatic deal, and all the Hawaiians were like, ‘It’s the curse!’ And I’m in the corner going, ‘I’m your curse.

Answer:","completion":"Return to Never Land and Fun and Fancy Free are both considered animated features, but only one of them contains a combination of live-action and animation. Let's examine each film individually to understand their classification. Return to Never Land (2002) is an animated fantasy film produced by DisneyToon Studios in Sydney, Australia, and Disney Television Animation. It is a sequel to the Disney 1953 classic, Peter Pan. The film follows the story of Wendy's daughter, Jane, who is whisked away to Never Land by Captain Hook and meets Peter Pan and the Lost Boys. Return to Never Land is entirely animated, with no live-action components. As a result, it is not classified as a live-action animated feature. Fun and Fancy Free (1947) is an American animated musical fantasy film produced by Walt Disney Productions. It contains two different segments, \\"Bongo,\\" narrated by Dinah Shore, and \\"Mickey and the Beanstalk,\\" narrated by Edgar Bergen alongside his puppets Charlie McCarthy and Mortimer Snerd. Fun and Fancy Free combines live-action and animated elements as the latter segment starts and ends with live-action scenes featuring human actors Edgar Bergen, Luana Patten, and the two puppets. The story of Mickey and the Beanstalk is told through animation, but the live-action sequences play a significant role in moving the plot forward. Given the incorporation of both live-action and animation within the film, Fun and Fancy Free is considered to be a live-action animated feature. In conclusion, while both Return to Never Land and Fun and Fancy Free are animated features produced by Disney, only Fun and Fancy Free is classified as a live-action animated feature due to the mixture of live-action and animated elements present in the film.

Help as much as you can. Combine facts and answer this: How is Bumbo different from Clover Club Cocktail? A:","completion":"Bumbo and Clover Club Cocktail are different primarily in their ingredients and flavor profiles. Bumbo, also known as Bombo or Bumboo, is a rum-based cocktail that usually consists of dark rum, water, sugar, and nutmeg or cinnamon. Its taste is characterized mainly by the sweetness from the sugar, warm spiciness from the nutmeg or cinnamon, and the richness of the dark rum. Bumbo was popular during the 17th and 18th centuries, particularly among pirates and sailors. On the other hand, the Clover Club Cocktail is a classic pre-Prohibition era gin-based cocktail that features gin, lemon juice, raspberry syrup or grenadine, and egg white. The cocktail is shaken with ice to create a frothy texture from the egg white. The Clover Club Cocktail has a fruity and tart flavor profile, with raspberry or grenadine providing a fruity sweetness alongside the citrusy kick from the lemon juice. The gin contributes a juniper-forward, dry character, balancing the overall taste. In summary, Bumbo and Clover Club Cocktail differ primarily in their base spirits (rum vs. gin), flavor profiles (sweet and spiced vs. fruity and tart), and historical contexts (17th-18th century sailors vs. pre-Prohibition era)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned about the ways of whom?\\" Context: \\"Jehovah's Witnesses believe that the Bible condemns the mixing of religions, on the basis that there can only be one truth from God, and therefore reject interfaith and ecumenical movements. They believe that only their religion represents true Christianity, and that other religions fail to meet all the requirements set by God and will soon be destroyed. Jehovah's Witnesses are taught that it is vital to remain \\"separate from the world.\\" The Witnesses' literature defines the \\"world\\" as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants\\" and teach that it is morally contaminated and ruled by Satan. Witnesses are taught that association with \\"worldly\\" people presents a \\"danger\\" to their faith, and are instructed to minimize social contact with non-members to better maintain their own standards of morality.\\" Answer:","completion":"Jehovah's Witnesses are concerned about the ways of the people they consider to be part of the \\"world.\\" As mentioned in the context you provided, the \\"world\\" is defined by the Witnesses' literature as \\"the mass of mankind apart from Jehovah's approved servants.\\" This means that they are primarily concerned about the ways of those who do not adhere to their specific religious beliefs and practices, as well as the influences of other religions that they believe are not in line with the true teachings of Christianity. Their concern stems from the belief that association with the \\"worldly\\" people poses a significant threat to their faith and spiritual wellbeing. This is because Witnesses believe that the broader world is morally contaminated and under the control of Satan, which can potentially lead to dangerous consequences for their faith. Consequently, they are taught to maintain a separate and distinct way of life from that of the general society, and this includes limiting their social contact with non-Witnesses. Aside from being concerned about non-Witnesses, Jehovah's Witnesses are also cautious about other religious groups that they perceive as competing with their understanding of true Christianity. They reject the idea of participating in interfaith or ecumenical movements that aim at bringing religious groups together under a common cause. This is based on their belief that only their religion abides by the truth that comes from God, and all other religious groups ultimately fail to meet the divine requirements needed for salvation. Furthermore, Jehovah's Witnesses believe that God's judgment is fast approaching, and that anyone who is not part of their religion will perish in Armageddon – the prophesied destruction of the present world systems. This belief reinforces the need to dissociate from the \\"worldly\\" way of living and other religious influences, as they are considered to be on the wrong side of God's coming judgment. Overall, the concern of Jehovah's Witnesses revolves around the ways of people who are not part of their religious community, as well as the influences of other faith traditions that they deem false or misleading. This concern is anchored in their commitment to maintain their distinct beliefs and way of life, which they believe would ensure their salvation in the face of God's imminent judgment. To safeguard their faith and protect their community from moral contamination, Jehovah's Witnesses are encouraged to minimize social contact with non-members and remain separate from the wider world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: As someone diagnosed with bpd this question kinda tugged at my heart, for a few reasons. From my understanding, the core of the disorder is an unstable sense of self and an inherent shame or worthlessness. Before I was treated I thought I just needed someone else, the right person to come along to love me in just the right way, being mindful of trauma and never triggering my symptoms. I was living in a fantasy world. You cannot expect another person, a whole person with a sound mind and stable to sense of self to subject themselves to the circus act of our lives. We can't even manage it ourselves!! I have been in two long-term relationships, and dozens of short ones six months or less. One of the two began when I was very low and lasted a very toxic 3 years. I entered treatment during that relationship, which resulted in it's demise. I was much happier afterward. The second relationship began after I completed treatment. We have seperated twice during the past 2 and a half years, and our relationship is currently rocky as well. But who I am in the relationship has changed. I am no longer the girl who needs extra reassurance daily that he's coming home from work. I can breathe when he goes to hang out with his friends. I am not threatened by every waking thought of his not being about me. Instead I am the woman that validates him and myself in arguments, and I put respect over everything.

Now, as Malala Yousufzai lies in a hospital bed in Birmingham, England, the shock and outrage among her countrymen have given way to a new sentiment: What will the government do about this? While the Pakistani news media debate how the country should respond to the attack, thousands of people nationwide have joined in rallies in support of the wounded 14-year-old. Malala: Global symbol, but still just a kid The shooting has prompted an unusually strong and united reaction of disgust and anger among many Pakistanis, analysts say. \\"There is a groundswell of sympathy for her and also a very strong demand for the Pakistani state to do something about this issue,\\" said Raza Rumi, director of policy and programs at the Jinnah Institute, a Pakistani research organization. Much of the discontent is directed toward the Pakistani Taliban, the extremist group that has claimed responsibility for the shooting and said it will seek to kill Malala if she recovers from her injuries. \\"This has created a very bad feeling for the Taliban,\\" said Saleem Khan, an executive with a paper manufacturing company in the city of Lahore. Khan said he was \\"crying and weeping\\" after hearing of the attack on Malala, who had defied extremists in the northwestern Swat Valley by insisting on the right of girls to go to school. Pakistani Foreign Minister Hina Rabbani Khar, the first woman to hold that job, said Sunday that she thinks the shooting marked a \\"turning point\\" in the ferocity of how Pakistan goes after Taliban offenders and extremist groups. \\"Pakistan, at the diplomatic, political and every level, has been asking ... to take this matter seriously, to not let them (the Taliban) have a safe haven,\\" she said. Meanwhile, police in Birmingham said \\"two well-wishers\\" were stopped when they came to the hospital overnight wanting to see the girl. No arrests were made, contrary to earlier reports from the hospital. Hospital director Dave Rosser said the intruders were \\"probably people being over-curious,\\" but he added that the hospital is taking no chances and that tight security is in place. Standing with Malala: Teen inspires others to fight for education At a rally organized by the powerful MQM political party in Karachi, thousands of people gathered, some waving flags and banners with messages of support for Malala. \\"Our prayers are with you,\\" read one. Another said, \\"Malala -- (an) attack on you is an attack on education and progress.\\" Social activist Saman Jafery said: \\"If Taliban is a mindset, then Malala is a mindset, too. It's a mindset of educated and empowered women.\\" Another of those at the rally, Haider Rizvi, said people \\"don't want the Taliban anymore in Pakistan, and after the Malala incident, it is time for people to stand up.\\" \\"The message is right here ... all these people. They are condemning the act of the Taliban,\\" added student Ashwar Waqi. The Taliban, who operate in northwestern Pakistan along the border with Afghanistan, have fallen foul of Pakistani public opinion in the past, notably in 2009, when a video emerged of the flogging of a teenage girl in the Swat Valley. The video provoked appalled reactions in Pakistan at the time, but \\"the scale of protests for Malala are bigger,\\" said the Jinnah Institute's Rumi. \\"Even the right-wing mainstream media have expressed outrage.\\" The Taliban became increasingly unpopular among Pakistanis in 2009 as the military carried out an offensive against members of the group in northwestern areas. But the military operations failed to root them out altogether, and their continued influence in the region was demonstrated last week by the gun attack on Malala and two other girls as they were being driven home from school. The two other girls were less severely wounded than Malala. Opinion: One girl's courage in the face of Taliban cowardice One of them, Kainat Ahmed, is being treated locally. She said she was so scared after the attack on the bus in which they traveled that she couldn't sleep for two days. The 16-year-old girl is in the 10th grade. But despite the injury to her arm and the terror of the attack, Ahmed said she does not regret studying and hopes to continue. \\"Girls' education here is more important than boys' because boys can have any jobs they want to but girls cannot,\\" she said. \\"I want to tell all the girls to continue their mission to get an education.\\" Interior Minister Rehman Malik, visiting the three girls' school in the town of Mingora on Tuesday, said the name would be changed from \\"Khushal Public School\\" to \\"Malala Public High School.\\" A task force will be established to protect all girls' schools in the region that are under threat of militants, he told reporters. \\"I am not only grieved, the whole nation is grieved,\\" he said. The hunt for those responsible has made \\"considerable progress,\\" Malik added, although he gave few details of the investigation. Authorities have forensic evidence, Malik said. Police Chief Gul Afzal Afridi of the Swat District said that 60 suspects are being detained, interrogated or investigated. \\"We have sufficient evidence to find the culprits,\\" the chief said. \\"Soon we will catch them.\\" Politicians and commentators in Pakistan have slammed the attack. But the condemnation of the Taliban has not been as universal. \\"Everybody was angry that it happened, but not everybody was angry with the Taliban,\\" said Tazeen Javed, an Islamabad-based communications consultant who writes for The Express Tribune newspaper. The cricket star-turned-politician Imran Khan, who visited Malala in a hospital in Peshawar last week, has drawn criticism for not condemning the Taliban outright for the attack. Khan \\"showed a lot of concern but couldn't resist bringing in the issue of the drone strikes as a cause for this attack, which was a bit of a deflection,\\" said Rumi, referring to the drone attacks carried out by the United States in northwestern Pakistan that have generated resentment in the country. Certain commentators have also begun to question the official version of events, suggesting that the attack on Malala may be used as a pretext by the government for military action against the Taliban in the restive tribal region of North Waziristan. Gordon Brown: Millions face Malala's fight \\"The Malala incident is the CIA's latest attempt to divide public opinion and incite conflict in Pakistani society,\\" Haider Mehdi, a contributor to the Pakistani daily The Nation, wrote in a column Tuesday. As the controversy about the attack rages in Pakistan, the doctors treating Malala thousands of miles away said they are \\"very pleased\\" with her progress and optimistic that she will make a good recovery. However, she faces reconstructive surgery and there is \\"still a long way to go,\\" said Rosser, of the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham. Her family is not yet in England to be by her bedside, but the Pakistani high commissioner is making arrangements on that front, he said. In the meantime, the 14-year-old appears to be \\"every bit as strong as we had been led to believe,\\" Rosser said, adding that the consultant leading her care \\"is impressed by her resilience and her strength.\\" Reza Sayah reported from Swat Valley and Jethro Mullen from Hong Kong.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. Question: \\"What new fire technology astonished Marco Polo when he reached the capital of China?\\" Answer: \\"Candles\\" Is this answer to the question correct? - no - yes","completion":"- no The answer is incorrect because the text states that Marco Polo was astonished by the Chinese using black stones dug out of mountains as fuel, which refers to coal.

The removed isomer solution now has a _____ boiling point. Answer: higher Student:","completion":"To understand the answer to this question, we need to know what branching isomers are, and how their physical properties relate to their structure. Isomers are two or more compounds with the same formula but a different arrangement of atoms in the molecule and different properties. Branching isomers are variations of an organic molecule where the carbon atoms are arranged differently along the backbone. In this problem, Eric takes away the branching isomers from a solution. Branching in isomers decreases the boiling point. The reason for this is because the degree of branching affects the strength of the intermolecular forces in the substance, namely the London dispersion forces (LDF). London dispersion force is a temporary attractive force that results when the electrons in two adjacent atoms occupy positions that make the atoms form temporary dipoles. These forces are stronger in molecules that are able to come closer together, meaning they are based on the shape of the molecule. When there are more branches on the molecules, they can’t fit together and pack as efficiently, leading to more space between the molecules. This means that the London dispersion forces would be weaker, as these forces increase with the closeness of molecules and the surface area interaction. When these forces are weaker, it's easier to break the intermolecular bonds, so the boiling point is lower. So if Eric removes these branching isomers from the solution, the ones left in the solution will all be non-branching (or less branched) isomers. These non-branching isomers can pack more tightly together and interact strongly with one another. This would increase the strength of the London dispersion forces, so more energy (in the form of heat) would be required to break those bonds and make the solution boil. Hence, the boiling point of the solution, from which branching isomers have been removed, will be higher."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Rico is a dog who lives in Germany . His owners trained him from a young age to find his toys. When they say the name of a certain toy, Rico can find it. In fact, he seems to know the names of 200 toys! Some researchers in Germany wanted to test Rico. They put his toys in a room and then told him to go in the room and find a certain toy. Since nobody was in the room with Rico, he had no help from anyone finding the right toy. The researchers did this test forty times. Rico found the right toy thirty-seven times! Then the researchers tried something else. They put seven of Rico's toys in the room together with one new toy that Rico had never seen before.

Summarize the following: Remove the rubber mats from your home or vehicle. Take them outside and shake them to remove loose debris. Clap mats together or hit them against a wall or railing to more thoroughly remove dirt, dust, stones, and more. Alternatively, you can use a pressure washer to blast away dirtiness from rubber mats. Turn on the water supply and spray all parts of the mats with water. Rubber mats are usually designed to be durable. Mats that are flimsy, delicate, or that have a finished surface may be damaged by power washers. Power washers may spray water hard enough to blow away the mat. If this happens to you, use a clean, heavy item to weigh the mat down. Remember to clean under the item as well. Add a moderate amount of dish soap to a bucket of warm water. Mix the water until bubbles form. Wet the bristles of a stiff bristle brush with the cleaning solution. Scrub the mats firmly to remove stubborn buildup, spots, and so on. While cleaning, pay close attention to nooks, crannies, and corners. Dirt and debris often collect in these places. Rubber that has a finished surface or is fragile may be damaged by brushes that are too stiff. Clean an out of sight area of the mat with the brush first to determine whether it’ll harm the rubber. Use your hose or power washer to rinse the mats entirely. Look over your mats one more time. Target remaining dirtiness with your scrub brush and cleaning solution. Then rinse away the cleaning solution one more time. Take a dry towel and wipe down your mats to remove water. When the mats are dry, return them to your car. If you don’t have a suitable towel available, air dry your mats. Refrain from drying your mats in the sun, as this can cause the rubber to weaken.

Both help in the process of turning food into nutrients. The digestive system also eliminates solid food waste. The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste. After reading the above, is \\"Via the esophagus all the way to the large intestine\\" the correct answer to the question \\"How is food digested?\\"? Select from the following. [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"Imagine you are eating your favorite food. You take a bite and chew it with your teeth. This is where digestion begins! Your mouth helps break down the food into smaller pieces. When you swallow, the food goes down a tube called the esophagus. It's like a slide for your food! Now, the food reaches a sack called the stomach. Your stomach helps mush the food even more and adds some special stuff to help break it down. This is called chemical digestion. The food then goes into a long wiggly tube called the small intestine. Here, the food gets broken down even more so that your body can use the good parts, like vitamins and energy. We call this \\"absorbing nutrients.\\" Next, the food moves to the large intestine. This is like a big sponge that soaks up water. Finally, whatever your body doesn’t need from the food comes out as waste when you go to the bathroom. So, is it correct to say food is digested \\"via the esophagus all the way to the large intestine\\"? The answer is [2]. yes.

Question: Information: - The northern hawk-owl (\\"Surnia ulula\\") is a non-migratory owl that usually stays within its breeding range, though it sometimes irrupts southward. It is one of the few owls that is neither nocturnal nor crepuscular, being active only during the day. This is the only living species in the genus \\"Surnia\\" of the family Strigidae, the \\"typical\\" owls (as opposed to barn owls, Tytonidae). The species is sometimes called simply the hawk owl; however, many species of owls in the \\"Ninox\\" genus are also called \\"hawk owls\\". - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Barn - owls ( family Tytonidae ) are one of the two families of owls , the other being the true owls or typical owls , Strigidae . They are medium to large owls with large heads and characteristic heart - shaped faces . They have long , strong legs with powerful talons . They also differ from Strigidae in structural details relating in particular to the sternum and feet . The barn owls comprise two extant sub-families : the Tytoninae or Tyto owls ( including the common barn owl ) and the Phodilinae or bay - owls . The Sibley - Ahlquist taxonomy unites the Caprimulgiformes with the owl order ; here , the barn - owls are a subfamily Tytoninae . This is unsupported by more recent research ( see Cypselomorphae ) , but the relationships of the owls in general are still unresolved . The barn owls are a wide ranging family , although they are absent from northern North America , Saharan Africa and large areas of Asia . They live in a wide range of habitats from deserts to forests , and from temperate latitudes to the tropics . The majority of the 16 living species of barn owls are poorly known . Some , like the red owl , have barely been seen or studied since their discovery , in contrast to the common barn owl , which is one of the best known owl species in the world . However , some sub-species of the common barn owl possibly deserve to be separate species , but are very poorly known . Five species of barn - owl are threatened , and some island species have gone extinct during the Holocene or earlier ( e.g. Tyto pollens , known from the fossil record of Andros Island in the Bahamas , and possibly the basis for the mythical Chickcharnie ) . The barn - owls are mostly nocturnal , and generally non-migratory , living in pairs or singly . - Owls are birds from the order Strigiformes, which includes about 200 species of mostly solitary and nocturnal birds of prey typified by an upright stance, a large, broad head, binocular vision, binaural hearing, sharp talons, and feathers adapted for silent flight. Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl. - The genus Tyto includes all barn owls (family Tytonidae) except for the bay owls (subfamily Phodilinae, genus \\"Phodilus\\") that is, the true barn owls, the grass owls and the masked owls collectively making up the subfamily Tytoninae. They are darker on the back than the front, usually an orange-brown colour, the front being a paler version of the back or mottled, although there is considerable variation even amongst species. \\"Tyto\\" owls have a divided, heart-shaped facial disc, and lack the ear-like tufts of feathers found in many other owls. \\"Tyto\\" owls tend to be larger than Bay-owls. The name \\"tyto ()\\" is onomatopeic Greek for owl. - The burrowing owl (\\"Athene cunicularia\\") is a small, long-legged owl found throughout open landscapes of North and South America. Burrowing owls can be found in grasslands, rangelands, agricultural areas, deserts, or any other open dry area with low vegetation. They nest and roost in burrows, such as those excavated by prairie dogs (\\"Cynomys\\" spp.). Unlike most owls, burrowing owls are often active during the day, although they tend to avoid the midday heat. Like many other kinds of owls, though, burrowing owls do most of their hunting from dusk until dawn, when they can use their night vision and hearing to their advantage. Living in open grasslands as opposed to forests, the burrowing owl has developed longer legs that enable it to sprint, as well as fly, when hunting. - Hawks are a group of medium-sized diurnal birds of prey of the family Accipitridae which are widely distributed and varying greatly in size. What object entity has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'barn-owl'? Choices: - accipitridae - athene - cynomys - ostrich - strigidae - strigiformes - surnia - tyto - tytonidae Answer:","completion":"The object entity that has the relation of 'parent taxon' with the subject 'barn-owl' is Tytonidae."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Modern history However, the crisis did not exist in a void; it came after a long series of diplomatic clashes between the Great Powers over European and colonial issues in the decade prior to 1914 which had left tensions high. The diplomatic clashes can be traced to changes in the balance of power in Europe since 1870. An example is the Baghdad Railway which was planned to connect the Ottoman Empire cities of Konya and Baghdad with a line through modern-day Turkey, Syria and Iraq. The railway became a source of international disputes during the years immediately preceding World War I. Although it has been argued that they were resolved in 1914 before the war began, it has also been argued that the railroad was a cause of the First World War. Fundamentally the war was sparked by tensions over territory in the Balkans. Austria-Hungary competed with Serbia and Russia for territory and influence in the region and they pulled the rest of the great powers into the conflict through their various alliances and treaties. The Balkan Wars were two wars in South-eastern Europe in 1912–1913 in the course of which the Balkan League (Bulgaria, Montenegro, Greece, and Serbia) first captured Ottoman-held remaining part of Thessaly, Macedonia, Epirus, Albania and most of Thrace and then fell out over the division of the spoils, with incorporation of Romania this time.

Homes look different in different countries.They also have different things inside.For example,in cold northern Europe,there's a fire in the living room or kitchen and all the chairs face it.In the south,where the sun shines a lot and it's more important to keep the heat out,there are small windows and cool stone floors.

A tablet is generally more portable and lightweight than a computer, which could be beneficial in a medical setting where the doctor may need to move around frequently.

Neff deduces she is contemplating murder, and makes it clear he wants no part of it. However, he cannot get her out of his mind, and when Phyllis shows up at his own home, he cannot resist her any longer. Neff knows all the tricks of his trade and devises a plan to make the murder of her husband appear to be an accidental fall from a train that will trigger the \\"double indemnity\\" clause and pay out twice the policy's face value.

Obviously being pursued, the man Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) runs into a junkyard to try to hide or find help. Then we see his pursuers coming down the road in a car and enter the junkyard. The man tries to hide, to no avail; a well-dressed man who is stronger than he looks confronts him and begins choking him. The resourceful man saves himself by pulling a chock out from under a junked car, which rolls forward and pins his attacker against another car, allowing him to break free. Another well-dressed man (Dick Warlock) gets out of the car, but the pursued man flees across the junkyard on foot to dubious safety.A short distance away, as a storm begins to pass through, a gas station attendant named Walter Jones (Essex Smith) is passing time watching a news report about Stonehenge. The reporter is talking about an unsolved theft from some nine months earlier; someone had stolen a stone weighing several tons from Stonehenge in England and the local police are baffled. The TV cuts to a commercial for Silver Shamrock masks before the storm knocks out the power. Just then, the man from the junkyard bursts into the gas station, clutching a Silver Shamrock Halloween mask, begging for help.

Short movie review: feminist empowerment tale thinly Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"From the brief statement provided, it appears that the critic has a somewhat negative view of the movie. The choice of words, specifically \\"thinly,\\" suggests that the critic believes the movie's feminist empowerment tale is not adequately developed or perhaps superficial in its approach. While it is clear that the movie is based on feminist themes and empowerment, the critic does not seem to be impressed by the way these concepts are portrayed in the film. This could mean that the movie lacks depth or fails to address important issues related to feminism and women's empowerment in a meaningful way. Additionally, the use of the word \\"thinly\\" may indicate that the movie relies too heavily on clichés or lacks originality in its storytelling. However, keep in mind that this is just a brief statement, and it is essential to read a more comprehensive review to gauge the critic's complete thoughts and feelings about the film. Different aspects of the movie, such as the acting, directing, cinematography, and screenplay, could have varying levels of quality, either contributing to or detracting from the overall impression. In conclusion, based on this short movie review statement, the critic seems to have a negative opinion of the movie's portrayal of feminist empowerment.

Both sentences emphasize that the Harana is a musical tradition which is based on the rhythmic patterns of the Habanera, and that it emerged from the cultural interchange between Mexico and Spain. The only difference in the sentence structure is the order in which \\"Mexican\\" and \\"Spanish\\" are placed. To provide a comprehensive understanding of the similarities and differences between the two sentences, let's examine their components: 1. \\"The Harana is rooted in the Mexican-Spanish tradition and based on the rhythmic patterns of the habanera.\\" In this sentence, \\"The Harana\\" is the subject, and two main points are made about it: a. It is \\"rooted in the Mexican-Spanish tradition,\\" which means that it originated from a cultural blend of Mexican and Spanish elements. b. It is \\"based on the rhythmic patterns of the habanera,\\" indicating that habanera rhythms serve as a foundation for the Harana style. 2. \\"The Harana is rooted in the Spanish-Mexican tradition and is based on the rhythmic patterns of the Habanera.\\" Similar to the first sentence, \\"The Harana\\" is the subject in this sentence, and the same two points are made: a. It is \\"rooted in the Spanish-Mexican tradition,\\" conveying the same information as the previous sentence, only with \\"Spanish\\" and \\"Mexican\\" switched in order. The meaning remains the same: the Harana arises from a mixture of Spanish and Mexican cultural elements. b. The Harana \\"is based on the rhythmic patterns of the Habanera,\\" which is identical in meaning to the information provided in the first sentence.

Sean Cononie bounded out of the back of an ambulance ahead of most of the other volunteers. A bullhorn in his hand, he was, in a sense, the pied piper. \\"If there's anybody out here, that wants the swine flu vaccine, please come over here,\\" he said. And come they did. Outside Fort Lauderdale's main library, a crowd started to build, and soon about a dozen homeless people were rolling up their shirt sleeves -- in the middle of the street -- for the H1N1 vaccination. \\"You stop spreading the germs,\\" Cononie said. \\"Because if a homeless person gets positive for the swine flu, they get sick, they go into a gas station and use the bathroom, transfer those germs to a public bathroom, [then] mom and dad come in with little ones, use that bathroom -- boom. Bingo. Contagious. Swine flu.\\" The volunteers are with the Homeless Voice -- a nonprofit homeless advocacy center that also runs a shelter in Hollywood, Florida. They've hit the streets for about three weeks to vaccinate the homeless population in Broward County. They requested the vaccine through the Florida Department of Health to help part of a population that the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calls an at risk group. Many homeless people often have untreated medical conditions, and the lack of sanitary conditions makes it easier for them to catch the virus. So far, the group has vaccinated about 300 homeless people. \\"Some have high blood pressure, some are alcoholics and are more susceptible to the flu, the seasonal flu, and the swine flu,\\" said Dr. Chad Frank, a family practice physician who is a volunteer. \\"We're protecting them, and we're also saving the emergency rooms here as well from being overloaded with potential patients, swine flu patients.\\" Wearing a yellow reflective T-shirt, Frank spends his nights on the street during the vaccination effort. \\"I think it's needed,\\" he said. \\"And believe it or not, it's fun. That's why I'm a doctor.\\" Russell Ahamed was one of the first people in line. He lives in the park next to the library in downtown Fort Lauderdale. The volunteers took his temperature to make sure he wasn't running a fever and took his name down so he could be entered into a Department of Health database. \\"I appreciate this. There's not a whole lot of people that come by and do something like this,\\" Ahamed said. \\"I know people can die from [the flu].\\" But on this night, not everyone was able to get the shot. William -- the only name he gave to volunteers -- was ready and willing but not able. Alcohol had gotten the best of him, and he could no longer stand. Fearing a possible bad reaction to the vaccine, the volunteers would not give it to him. Calmly, Cononie leaned down to talk to William, who was sitting on the grass, and explained why they couldn't vaccinate him then. \\"William, I'm gonna put something in your bag. It's a piece of paper,\\" Cononie said. \\"When you wake up in the morning, promise me you're going to look for this piece of paper, OK? It says our phone number. Call us in the morning.

Choices: - particles fuse together - particles range together - particles pipe together - particles closer together A: The answer is:","completion":"\\"particles closer together.\\" The speed at which waves travel through a medium is determined by the properties of the medium itself. In the case of solids, liquids, and gases, the different phases of matter, the speed of wave propagation varies greatly. In solid objects, particles are arranged in a tightly bound manner. They're much closer together compared to those in liquids and gases. The proximity of these particles in solids leads to quicker transfer of energy from one particle to the next. Essentially, when a wave (energy) hits the first particle in a solid, it quickly passes the energy on to the next particle because of the close distance, and this continues in a domino effect, allowing the wave to travel at a faster speed. This phenomenon can be easily observed in everyday life. For example, if you knock one end of a solid metal rod, the sound (which is a wave) will reach the other end almost instantaneously. However, if you were to try the same with air or water (knocking one end of a column of air or water), the sound would travel much slower. The incorrect choices hinted at various ways particles might interact ('fuse', 'range', 'pipe'), but these doesn't accurately describe the reasons behind the speed of wave propagation in solids. 'Fusing' suggests a chemical reaction or change of state, neither of which are the reasons for waves traveling faster in solids. 'Ranging together' and 'piping together' do not appropriately represent any principle or mechanism in physics known to increase wave speed. In conclusion, waves travel faster through solids because the particles are closer together. This allows for quicker energy transfer and propagation of the wave through the medium."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

It is still in regular use. It's adorable, but I hate that my kids have such a hard time turning it on. The music and lights are activated by these tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer. The felt moves around occasionally, so the button is hard to find. Forget using the ignition key to turn on the music. It took two years for us to realize that the horn actually makes noise. Our son managed to hit the button by mistake. It is virtually impossible to press the button through the stuffed bear on the steering wheel. I would really like this car if I wasn't obligated to sit down and press the button for my kids every fifteen seconds when they want to play with it. In my opinion, if I have to own an electronic noisy toy, it had better occupy my kids while I am in another room where I don't have to listen to it.It does work well as a support for a soon-to-be sitting child, but I personally prefer a boppy pillow.

Although the reviewer mentions some positive aspects of the product such as its durability (it's still in regular use after a few years) and its support for soon-to-be sitting children, the negatives seem to outweigh the positives. The reviewer critically points out design flaws that might affect functionality and user experience. For instance, the music and lights are activated by tiny buttons hidden under a felt layer, making it difficult for kids to turn it on. The keys of the product are also virtually hard to press. These negatives affect the convenience of the product and need for regular adult involvement, which contravenes the purpose of an enjoyable and autonomous kids' toy.

On to the Twentieth Century: The British extended their control over the peninsula by putting together the whole panoply of colonial administration — civil service, public works, judiciary force, police force, post office, education, and land regulation — with teams of British administrators, teachers, engineers, and doctors to go with it. At the same time, the tin industry, dominated by Chinese using labor-intensive methods in the 19th century, passed increasingly into Western hands, who employed the modern technology of gravel pumps and mining dredges. Petroleum had been found in northern Borneo, at Miri, and in Brunei, and the Anglo-Dutch Shell company used Singapore as its regional depot for its oil supplies and exports. But the major breakthrough for the Malay economy was the triumph of rubber, when Singapore's new garden director, Henry Ridle (\\"Rubber Ridley\\" to his friends, \\"Mad Ridley\\" to all doubting Thomases) had developed new planting and tapping methods and painstakingly spread his faith in rubber around the peninsula. World demand increased with the growth of the motor-car and electrical industries, and sky-rocketed during World War I. By 1920, Malaya was producing 53 percent of the world's rubber, which had overtaken tin as its main source of income. The Malay ruling class again took a back seat. Together with effective control of the rubber and tin industries, the British now firmly held the reins of government. The sultans were left in charge of local and religious affairs, content with their prestige, prosperity, and security. The census of 1931 served as an alarm signal for the Malay national consciousness. Bolstered by a new influx of immigrants to meet the rubber and tin booms of the 1920s, non-Malays now slightly outnumbered the indigenous population. The Great Depression of 1929 stepped up ethnic competition in the shrinking job market, and nationalism developed to safeguard Malay interests against the Chinese and Indians rather than the British imperial authority. Though hampered by the peninsula's division into the States and the Straits Settlements, relatively conservative Muslim intellectuals and community leaders came together at the Pan-Malayan Malay Congress in Kuala Lumpur in 1939. In Singapore the following year, they were joined by representatives from Sarawak and Brunei. Teachers and journalists urged the revival of the common Malay-Indonesian consciousness, split by the Anglo-Dutch dismemberment of the region in the 19th century. This spirit became a factor in the gathering clouds of war.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"These two questions are related but inquire about different concepts in the field of data processing and analysis. Let me break down the differences in each question. Question 1: What is the difference between data analytics and machine learning? 1. Define data analytics: Data analytics refers to the process of examining, cleaning, transforming, and modeling raw data with the goal of extracting useful information, drawing conclusions, and supporting decision-making. 2. Define machine learning: Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that involves teaching computers to learn from and adapt to data inputs, allowing them to make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed to do so. 3. Identify the difference: The primary difference between data analytics and machine learning is the approach they take to achieve their goals. Data analytics involves manual analysis and exploration of data, while machine learning relies on algorithms and statistical models that allow machines to automatically learn from the data and improve their performance over time. Question 2: What is the difference between data warehousing, data mining, and big data analytics? 1. Define data warehousing: A data warehouse is a large, centralized repository of data collected from various sources, used for reporting and data analysis. It stores historical and current data in a structured format to support efficient querying and retrieval. 2. Define data mining: Data mining is the process of discovering patterns, relationships, and hidden insights in large datasets using statistical methods, machine learning, and artificial intelligence techniques. 3. Define big data analytics: Big data analytics refers to the analysis and processing of massive, diverse datasets (big data) that traditional data processing tools cannot handle effectively. Big data analytics often includes various techniques like machine learning, data mining, and predictive analytics to extract meaningful information and support decision-making. 4. Identify the differences: Data warehousing is concerned with storing and managing large volumes of structured data, while data mining focuses on extracting useful knowledge and patterns from the data. Big data analytics, on the other hand, deals with the analysis of huge, complex datasets using advanced techniques and tools. In conclusion, while these two questions are related, they inquire about distinct aspects within the broader spectrum of data processing and analysis.

(CNN) -- If there is one clear emotion emerging before November's U.S. congressional elections, it is that citizens across the political spectrum are worried about government spending and a perceived lack of government accountability regarding where tax dollars are spent. Oddly, the government's approach to the illegal drug problem -- which has cost U.S. taxpayers more than 2.5 trillion since former President Richard Nixon first declared America's \\"war on drugs\\" -- has been largely immune from this concern. CNN iReport: You tell us whether it's time to legalize pot One dramatic exception is California, where Proposition 19, which proposes to \\"regulate, control and tax cannabis,\\" will be on the statewide ballot on November 2. In California alone, the illegal market for cannabis, or marijuana, has been estimated to be worth about 14 billion per year, and the legalization initiative aims to redirect the flow of these massive profits from violent drug cartels toward government coffers. While some U.S. economists predict that rates of cannabis use could increase in","completion":"the short term following legalization, proponents of Proposition 19 argue that the long-term benefits of regulation and taxation would outweigh any initial negative consequences. They contend that the proposal could help alleviate California's budget crisis by generating much-needed tax revenue from cannabis sales and freeing up law enforcement resources to focus on more serious criminal activities. Opponents of Proposition 19, however, warn that legalizing cannabis would not achieve the desired outcomes. They assert that legalization would lead to increased drug use among minors, workplace safety issues, and a rise in traffic accidents caused by drug-impaired drivers. Furthermore, some critics believe that the potential tax revenue generated by cannabis sales is overstated and that the black market for cannabis would continue to thrive regardless of legalization. On election day, the fate of Proposition 19 is uncertain, as polls show the electorate divided on the issue. As the debate rages on, the nation turns its attention to California, with many seeing the state's decision as a potential harbinger of the future direction the U.S. may take with regard to drug policy. In the end, voters narrowly reject Proposition 19, with 53% against and 47% in favor. While this marks a setback for cannabis legalization advocates, the close results signal that public opinion is shifting, and the conversation surrounding drug policy reform will continue. Over the next decade, a growing number of states begin to reconsider their cannabis laws, with increased support for legalization and decriminalization efforts. Ultimately, the U.S. government recognizes the need for a comprehensive approach to drug policy, addressing both demand and supply and incorporating prevention, treatment, and harm reduction strategies. While change is slow and not without its challenges, the failing war on drugs gradually gives way to a more pragmatic and evidence-based approach that strives to promote public health and safety, reduce the power of drug cartels, and ensure more efficient use of taxpayer dollars."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Madame White Snake: East Asian Femme Fatale of Old The Chinese legend of Madame White Snake, the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man, has exerted a lasting influence over East Asian folktales and fiction for centuries. Two quintessential novellas, \\"The Lust of the White Serpant\\" from Ugetsu Monogatari by the Japanese author Ueda Akinari and \\"Eternal Prisoner under Thunder Peak Pagoda\\" a traditional Chinese story, are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the White Snake figure to become a more believable human, but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal. While both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale, the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatale's transgressive behavior, not her eventual punishment for it. Early tales of Madame White Snake appeared in China as early as the Song Dynasty, and initially her portrayal was fairly direct, as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband. But over time, characterizations of her became more complex, and the persona of Madame White Snake became more sympathetic, and perhaps even a model of the ideal Confucian wife, particularly in \\"Pagoda\\". Whalen Lai notes, \\"She was a loving wife, a caring mother, rescuer of her family from the first flood, and, at that point, a general benefactor of man. She took on the virtues of a traditional Chinese female, particularly forbearance\\". But if she were really an ideal wife, why could she not live happily with her human mate? Her dangerous sexuality is the key. Femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from pre-modern Chinese and Japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal Confucian wife, since it is primarily associated with film characters, particularly those of the film noir genre. But this term, which is relatively speaking, a neologism (The earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century After reading the above, is \\"Beginning of the 1st century\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Around what time was the term Femme Fatale begun to be used?\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer is not \\"Beginning of the 1st century.\\" According to the text, the term \\"femme fatale\\" began to be used around the beginning of the 20th century."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

A: Answer:","completion":"Two of the most well-known and extensively studied structures found on Mars are the Olympus Mons and the Valles Marineris. 1. Olympus Mons: Olympus Mons is the tallest volcano and the largest mountain in our solar system. It is a massive shield volcano located in the Tharsis Montes region of Mars, which is the planet's western hemisphere. Olympus Mons was shaped by the slow and constant flow of lava that built up over millions of years. The immense size of Olympus Mons can be attributed to the fact that the Martian surface does not have tectonic plate movement like Earth, meaning that volcanic activity can occur in the same place for an extended period, allowing for the formation and growth of the volcano. Measuring 13.6 miles (22 kilometers) high, Olympus Mons is nearly three times taller than Earth's Mount Everest. The base of Olympus Mons is approximately 370 miles (600 kilometers) in diameter, large enough to cover the entire state of New Mexico. It features a circular caldera that spans about 50 miles (80 kilometers) in diameter at the summit, which is believed to have formed due to the collapse of the magma chamber when it emptied out during eruptions. 2. Valles Marineris: Valles Marineris is a massive canyon system on Mars that stretches over 2,500 miles (4,000 kilometers) along the equatorial region. Its width ranges from 75 to 370 miles (120 to 600 kilometers) and reaches depths of up to 6 miles (10 kilometers), making it one of the largest canyons in the solar system. Valles Marineris is a prominent feature on Mars and is often compared to the Grand Canyon on Earth, although it is significantly larger and deeper. The canyon system is made up of individual chasms that vary in size and geological features, such as tectonic fractures, volcanic activity, and erosional processes. The formation of Valles Marineris remains a subject of debate among scientists, but it is widely believed that the canyon system was shaped by several geological processes. It is thought that the initial fissures were formed due to the expansion of the Martian crust caused by the rising of the Tharsis bulge, a prominent volcanic plateau in the western hemisphere of Mars. Over time, these cracks widened and deepened due to erosion, landslides, and volcanic activity. Both Olympus Mons and Valles Marineris are essential structures on Mars that provide valuable insight into the planet's geological history, its volcanic activity, and the possible existence of water in the past. These structures also present potential future challenges and benefits to human exploration and the potential colonization of Mars."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Movie title: Under Siege 2: Dark Territory Movie plot: Casey Ryback has retired from the United States Navy and is a chef at the Mile High Cafe in Denver, Colorado. Casey is taking his estranged niece Sarah to Los Angeles to visit the grave of Sarah's father. Sarah and Casey board the Grand Continental, a train traveling from Denver to Los Angeles through the Rocky Mountains. Armed mercenaries, led by former U.S. government computer hacker and computer genius Travis Dane and mercenary leader Marcus Penn, hijack the train. Dane worked on Grazer One, a top-secret military satellite particle weapon designed to destroy underground targets. The military fired Dane because of his mental instability; Dane later faked his suicide. The mercenaries take the train's passengers and staff hostage, herding them into the last two cars. Casey kills one mercenary, then slips away. Among the hostages are two former Department of Defense colleagues who worked with Dane. Dane threatens them with torture unless they reveal the codes to take over Grazer. Despite giving up the codes, they are thrown from the train into a deep valley and killed. Middle Eastern terrorists have offered Dane 1 billion to destroy the Eastern seaboard by using Grazer to target a nuclear reactor located under the Pentagon. Dane demonstrates Grazer to investors by destroying a Chinese chemical weapons plant. After one investor offers an additional 100 million, Dane destroys an airliner carrying the investor's ex-wife. The U.S. government has difficulty locating Dane or Grazer. When officials destroy what they think is Grazer, Dane explains the NSA's premier intelligence satellite was destroyed instead. As long as the train keeps moving, his location cannot be determined. However, Casey faxes a message to the owner of the Mile High Cafe, who contacts Admiral Bates.

Answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: One interesting thing that has been found in plants that are consistently exposed to drought, is their ability to form a sort of \\"memory\\". In a study by Tombesi et al., they found plants who had previously been exposed to drought were able to come up with a sort of strategy to minimize water loss and decrease water use. They found that plants who were exposed to drought conditions actually changed they way the regulated their stomates and what they called \\"hydraulic safety margin\\" so as to decrease the venerability of the plant. By changing the regulation of stomata and subsequently the transpiration, plants were able to function better in situations where the availability of water decreased. I am facing a new situation today: Austria had two distinct climactic regions. The eastern region was exposed to a wet climate and had thriving vegetation, while the western region was exposed to drought. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which region had fewer plants with an ability to change the way the regulated their stomates? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the information provided about the two climactic regions in Austria, we can make an educated assumption about which region had fewer plants with the ability to change the way they regulated their stomates. The study by Tombesi et al. demonstrates that plants exposed to drought conditions are capable of adapting and developing strategies to minimize water loss and decrease water use through altering their stomatal regulation and hydraulic safety margin. In the case of Austria, the eastern region is characterized by a wet climate with thriving vegetation. In this region, plants are not likely to experience water scarcity as precipitation is abundant. Therefore, it is not crucial for them to develop the ability to manage their stomatal regulation for water conservation purposes. On the other hand, the western region is exposed to drought conditions, making water scarcity a prevalent issue. Plants in this region would be more likely to develop adaptive strategies, such as the ones mentioned in the Tombesi et al. article, in order to survive in the harsh environment. Given this information, we can conclude that the eastern region in Austria, which has a wet climate and thriving vegetation, is likely to have fewer plants with the ability to change the way they regulate their stomates as compared to the western region that is exposed to drought conditions. This is due to the fact that plants in the eastern region do not experience the same level of water scarcity and stress, and therefore, are less likely to develop the specific adaptive mechanisms related to stomatal regulation and water conservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Olivia Answer:","completion":"Title: The Shadows of Rosewood Lane Genre: Mystery/Thriller Plot Summary: In the small, seemingly perfect town of Rosewood, nothing is as it seems. When Olivia is killed before Jill and Kirby's eyes, they find themselves thrown into an unexpected web of secrets, lies, and hidden motives. As their quiet lives unravel, they race against time to unveil the killer before they become the next victims. Act I: Jill and Kirby are two best friends living in the idyllic town of Rosewood. They have known each other since childhood and share a unique bond, always supporting one another and remaining inseparable despite life's challenges. The story begins with them attending a charity event for a local hospital at the Rosewood Town Hall. The event is organized by the town's socialite, Olivia Devereaux, who is well-known for hosting extravagant and exclusive parties. Olivia's mysterious charm creates a magnetic allure, which raises curiosity about her personal life. Unbeknownst to everyone, Jill and Kirby had been investigating strange occurrences around town for months and suspect that Olivia may be involved. They manage to attend her events to get closer to her and find answers. Act II: During Olivia's party, Jill and Kirby uncover a hidden room filled with cryptic symbols, old journals, a vintage camera with undeveloped film rolls, and a mysterious key. As they explore the room, they hear a terrifying scream and rush to find its source. To their horror, they discover Olivia's lifeless body in the garden, murdered by an unknown assailant. Haunted by Olivia's death, Jill and Kirby cannot forget what they had seen in that hidden room. The two friends resolve to uncover the motive behind the murder and bring the killer to justice. During their investigation, they learn that the seemingly perfect town of Rosewood hides darkness and corruption at its core. For every new clue that unfolds, more questions emerge. They discover that Olivia was involved in a secret society called \\"The Shadows,\\" which held immense power and influence over the town's residents. Furthermore, the cryptic symbols are from an ancient text that holds dark prophecies and secrets that can change the course of history. Act III: As they delve deeper, Jill and Kirby stumble upon a conspiracy involving prominent members of the community, including the mayor and the police chief. It turns out that Olivia was about to expose the existence of \\"The Shadows\\" and their sinister plans to the world. Fighting against time, Jill and Kirby try to decipher the ancient text and prophecies, hoping to unearth enough information to put an end to \\"The Shadows\\" and their malevolent grip on Rosewood. Along their journey, they are betrayed, hunted down, and nearly overwhelmed by the dark forces conspiring against them. Act IV: In an explosive climax, Jill and Kirby confront the members of \\"The Shadows\\" and reveal their true identities. They have successfully gathered enough evidence to expose the corrupt individuals involved in the conspiracy, ensuring that justice is served. As the truth is revealed, the town of Rosewood is forced to face its dark side and begin the process of healing. Jill and Kirby, forever changed by their experiences, continue to support one another as they navigate through life with a newfound sense of purpose and understanding of the world around them. The Shadows of Rosewood Lane is an edge-of-the-seat mystery thriller, with emotional and psychological depth, exploring the unraveling of a small town's secrets and the strength of friendship amidst chaos and tragedy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was always evil and usually foolish, but in the past the human race managed to live with it. Modern skill has changed this. Either man will stop war, or war will stop man. For the present, it is nuclear weapons that cause the greatest danger, but bacteriological( ) or chemical weapons may, before long, offer an even greater threat. If we succeeded in stopping war, there would be no danger for us. To do this, we need to persuade mankind to look upon international questions in a new way, not by contests of force, in which the victory goes to the side which is most skillful in massacre ( ),but by judging in accordance with agreed rules of law. It is not easy to change old mental habits, but this is what must be attempted. There are those who say that the adoption of this or that ideology would prevent war. I believe this to be a complete error. All ideologies are based upon beliefs without proof which are, at best, doubtful, and at worst, totally false. Those people who believe them are willing to go to war in support of them. The movement of world opinion during the past two years has changed very largely such as we can welcome. It has become a common belief that nuclear war must be avoided. Of course, very difficult problems remain in the international world, but the spirit in which they are being approached is a better one than it was some years ago. It has begun to be thought, even by the powerful men who decide whether we shall live or die, that agreements should be reached even if both sides do not find these agreements wholly satisfactory. It has begun to be understood that the important conflict nowadays is not between East and West, but between Man and the bomb. The author believes that the only way to stop war is to _ . A) take possession of stronger weapons B) let the stronger side take over the world C) settle international issues through agreements D) destroy bacteriological and chemical weapons","completion":"C) settle international issues through agreements"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choose from: 1). negative 2). positive","completion":"Based on the given review, \\"how about surprising us by trying something new?\\", it is difficult to definitively categorize the reviewer's opinion of the movie as either positive or negative. The statement does not explicitly convey satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the movie. However, the review suggests that the movie may not be offering anything new or groundbreaking. This could indicate that the reviewer has a slightly negative opinion of the movie's lack of originality. It is crucial to consider the context of the review to fully understand the reviewer's opinion. For example, if the comment was made in response to a film that received significant praise for its innovation, it could carry more negative weight. Conversely, if the film was part of a long-standing franchise known for its repetitive nature, it could convey a more neutral sentiment, implying that the movie was just as expected. To accurately assess whether the opinion expressed in this review is positive or negative, additional information, context, and other reviews would be necessary. Nevertheless, the statement seems to lean more towards the negative side of the spectrum due to its implication that the film lacks originality, but it is not strongly negative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of each choice Now, we examine each choice based on their relation to a police officer in their sixties: - Retire: A police officer in their sixties may choose to retire as they near or have reached the typical retirement age. - Direct traffic: A police officer in their sixties could still direct traffic, but age isn't the main factor in this task. - Case: This choice is not clear but seems to imply investigating a case. A police officer in their sixties could still investigate cases, but again age is not the main factor. - Fine person for speeding: Similar to directing traffic, a police officer in their sixties could still issue fines for traffic violations. However, age isn't the main factor in this task. - Order to stop running: This seems to refer to a police officer ordering someone to stop running, possibly during a pursuit or after witnessing a crime. A police officer in their sixties could still do this, but age is not the main factor. Step 3: Choose the most relevant option After evaluating each choice, we can conclude that \\"retire\\" is the most relevant answer to the question, \\"What does a police officer in their sixties [do]?\\" The rationale for this choice is that a police officer in their sixties might be nearing, or already reached, the typical retirement age, leading to retirement being a more likely choice for someone in that age group than the other options provided. The other choices might also be valid tasks for a police officer but are not primarily associated with their age."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The photographer was subjected to much darkness. The photographer had to use special equipment for the shoot because the location was extremely dark, which required longer exposure times (around 30 seconds) and a larger depth of field in order to capture enough light and detail in the images. Shooting at f/8 aperture allowed for a wider depth of field, as opposed to the typical f/2.8, which wasn't suitable for the situation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

As water seeps into rocks, it fills the pores and small cracks within. When the water freezes, it expands, causing pressure on the rocks and widening the cracks. As the water thaws, it contracts, which allows more water to enter the cracks. This freeze-thaw cycle weakens the rocks over time. In addition to the freeze-thaw process, heating of rocks due to sunlight or changing temperatures can cause them to expand and contract, forming more cracks. Over time, both of these processes cause the rocks to become increasingly fragmented and eventually break apart into smaller pieces.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Red Scorpion Context: Nikolai Petrovitch Rachenko, a Soviet Spetsnaz operative is sent to an African country where Soviet, Czechoslovakian and Cuban forces are helping the government fight an anti-communist rebel movement. He is tasked with the mission to assassinate the rebel leader. In order to infiltrate the rebel movement and get within striking distance of his target, he stirs up trouble in the local bar and gets arrested for disorderly conduct. He is put in the same cell as a captured resistance commander and gains his trust in facilitating the escape. Upon finally reaching the rebel encampment he is met with distrust by the rebels. During the night he attempts to assassinate his target but does not succeed when the distrustful rebels anticipate his actions. Disgraced and tortured by his commanding officers for failing his mission, he breaks out of the interrogation chamber and escapes to the desert, later to be found by native bushmen. He soon learns about them and their culture, and after receiving a ceremonial burn scar in the form of a scorpion (hence the title), he rejoins the freedom fighters and leads an attack against the Soviet camp after a previous attack on the peaceful bushmen. Nikolai obtains an AO-63 from the armory, confronts his corrupt officers and hunts down General Vortek, who attempts to escape in a Mil-24 Hind only to be shot down after takeoff. Nikolai defeats and kills Vortek, as the freedom fighters finally defeat the Soviet oppression. A:","completion":"Nikolai Petrovitch Rachenko is a fictional character and the main protagonist in the 1988 action film \\"Red Scorpion.\\" The character, portrayed by Dolph Lundgren, is a formidable Soviet Spetsnaz operative who is sent on a crucial mission to assassinate the leader of an anti-communist rebel movement in an African country where Soviet, Czechoslovakian, and Cuban forces are assisting the government. Rachenko begins his mission by causing a disturbance in a local bar, which leads to his arrest for disorderly conduct. This strategy allows him to be placed in the same cell as a captured resistance commander, with whom he forms a bond by helping orchestrate their escape. As they reach the rebel encampment, Rachenko faces distrust from the other rebels. Although his initial assassination attempt fails, a disgraced Rachenko faces torture by his commanding officers for not completing the mission. He eventually breaks free and escapes into the desert, where he encounters a group of native bushmen. Through interacting with these peaceful people and learning about their culture, Rachenko experiences a transformation. He receives a ceremonial burn scar in the form of a scorpion, symbolizing his newfound allegiance to the cause of the freedom fighters. Motivated by his experiences with the bushmen, Rachenko takes up arms with the rebels and leads a successful attack against the Soviet camp. During this battle, he retrieves an AO-63, confronts his treacherous commanding officers, and pursues the main antagonist, General Vortek. The climax sees Rachenko shooting down Vortek's Mil-24 Hind helicopter, resulting in the villain's defeat and the liberation of the freedom fighters from Soviet oppression. In summary, Nikolai Petrovitch Rachenko is a complex character who undergoes a significant transformation throughout the film \\"Red Scorpion.\\" Initially operating as a cold and efficient Soviet operative, he ultimately finds redemption and a new purpose in fighting for freedom and justice alongside the very people he was initially tasked with eliminating."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

It seems that Alex is trying to weigh the consequences of this action, as well as consider the girl's performance, reliability, and impact on the team.

This will help to create a balanced view of her strengths and weaknesses. 2. Document incidents: Alex should keep a record of the girl's late arrivals, including the dates, times, and any relevant circumstances. This will help establish a pattern of behavior and determine if there is a justifiable reason for her tardiness. 3. Communicate: Alex should sit down with the girl to discuss her recurring tardiness, providing specific examples and explaining the impact it has on the team and the company. This can give her an opportunity to express any concerns, difficulties, or personal issues that may be affecting her punctuality. 4. Set expectations and consequences: If Alex decides to give the girl a chance to improve her punctuality, they should establish clear expectations for attendance, and outline the consequences for failing to meet those expectations (including possible termination). 5. Follow-up and monitor: Alex should follow-up with the girl on her progress and continue to monitor her punctuality. If improvements are not made within an agreed-upon time frame, Alex would then need to consider more serious consequences, such as termination.

The sentiment behind a statement points towards the emotion or attitude expressed by the author. Sentiments can range from positive, neutral, to negative, and can carry different levels of intensity. 1. Content: The content of this tweet is a request for the recipient (or readers) to initiate communication via text or phone call. The author seems to express a strong desire for the other person to make contact, possibly suggesting a sense of urgency or significant importance behind the need for this interaction. 2. Language: The language used in the tweet is informal and colloquial, as often seen on social media platforms. The phrase \\"text/call me\\" is a common expression used to invite someone to make contact with the sender. The second part of the tweet, \\"you idiot,\\" includes a derogatory term that may be interpreted as harsh or insulting. 3. Tone: The tone of the tweet, especially given the presence of the term \\"idiot,\\" is more negative or aggressive than neutral or positive. It is possible that the author is expressing frustration or impatience with the recipient, as they feel the need to resort to name-calling. This sentiment might be perceived as either hostile or condescending, depending on how the reader interprets the word \\"idiot.\\" However, it is also possible that the author is using the term in a playful or sarcastic way, attempting to mimic the tone of a friendly banter between close friends, in which case, the sentiment could be more light-hearted and humorous. In summary, the sentiment of the tweet \\"text/call me, you idiot\\" can be described as predominantly negative with an aggressive or impatient tone due to the derogatory language used. However, there is the possibility that the author intended an alternative, more playful or friendly sentiment by engaging in a form of teasing or sarcasm.

I looked forward to hearing an American Idol prodouce a country album, but this is just pop... Answer:","completion":"The given product review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. There are several reasons for this conclusion: 1. The reviewer clearly states that the album is not a country album, which is contrary to the expectations of the product. If I were looking for a country album, this review would inform me that this product may not meet my expectations. 2. The review suggests that the album is more of a pop album, which may not align with my preferences if I were searching specifically for a country album. This mismatch in genre expectations could discourage me from purchasing the product. 3. The reviewer highlights the cliché and unoriginal lyrics of the album. This critique may indicate that the content of the album could be repetitive or uninspired, reducing my interest in buying it. 4. Although the reviewer does not completely discredit the artist, they imply that Carrie has potential but has not lived up to it with this particular album. This statement suggests that there might be better options available in terms of the artist's discography or within the country music genre. 5. The reviewer also touches upon the idea that the record company may have influenced the album, causing it to stray from the artist's authentic country roots. This information might make me question the integrity of the artist or the album itself and could decrease my interest in purchasing it. Given these reasons, the review would decrease the chances of me buying the product.

He answers a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with a special talent in long-distance shooting, using just four words, \\"M. Quigley 900 yards,\\" written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by several closely spaced bullet holes. When he arrives in Australia, he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him, who are trying to force \\"Crazy Cora\\" (Laura San Giacomo) onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive Aborigines. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his house. The aborigine manservant knocks Quigley over the head and Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the outback with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas.

Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the work whose core approaches a five-movement symphony with the chorale finale? ? A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum.

In a recent test drive, I found the acceleration quick from a standing start with plenty of power for highway passing from the 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine.

What is the most logical completion of this news story?. (CNN) -- It is a surprising scene -- a picnic-like atmosphere with children playing in the pool under the tropical sun. The adults are also in celebration mode. The crowd is listening to a couple of rappers and some people dance to the beat. But this is not a park or a recreational facility. It's not somebody's backyard either. This is pavilion 1234 at one of the largest correctional facilities in Venezuela: San Antonio Prison. The prison is located on Venezuela's Margarita Island, also home to a popular beach resort that attracts international tourists. Carlos Nieto Palma, a Venezuelan human rights advocate, says San Antonio, located in Nueva Esparta state, has become a recreational facility where you can find anything from weapons to drugs and alcohol. Inmates allegedly even have access to cockfighting rings and prostitutes, but that's not the most shocking part.

According to reports, the prison, which was meant to house and rehabilitate criminals, now boasts of facilities such as swimming pools, bars, and even cockfighting rings. In addition, inmates allegedly enjoy access to narcotics, alcohol, and prostitutes, thanks in part to lax security and administration within the prison. Local human rights advocate Carlos Nieto Palma has been vocal in bringing attention to the situation, describing the overcrowded San Antonio as a \\"recreational facility\\" where criminals continue to thrive and engage in illegal activities. The transformation of the prison has been attributed to poor oversight, insufficient funding for genuine rehabilitation programs, and rampant corruption within the Venezuelan government and prison system. Authorities in Venezuela have yet to issue a statement addressing the situation at San Antonio Prison, but the news has sparked outrage and concern among human rights organizations and the general public, who are calling for an investigation into the matter. Critics argue that this blatant disregard for the rule of law within a supposedly controlled environment undermines the credibility of Venezuela's justice system and further perpetuates the existing cycle of crime and impunity in the country. As international pressure mounts, it remains to be seen whether the Venezuelan government will take concrete steps to address the systemic issues that have allowed San Antonio Prison to devolve into an incongruous celebration of criminality, or if its inmates will continue to revel in an environment that has all but abandoned the concept of punitive justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Negative Movie Review: Title: Disappointing Depths - A Review of \\"The Ocean's Abyss\\" \\"The Ocean's Abyss,\\" directed by Samuel L. Marsh, promised an ambitious journey into the unexplored depths of the sea, and on this particular voyage, I find myself wishing they had never set sail. With a talented cast including some big names like Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth, the potential for a gripping and awe-inspiring experience was certainly there. Unfortunately, this deep-sea adventure is overshadowed by shallow writing, weak characterization, and questionable decision-making. Firstly, the plot of \\"The Ocean's Abyss\\" is littered with overly convenient coincidences and contrivances which strain credulity to the breaking point. The story follows an intrepid team of marine biologists and thrill-seekers as they journey to the deepest parts of the ocean, uncovering hidden ecosystems and creatures never before seen. The poorly conceived narrative only serves to highlight the film's glaring lack of character development. The lack of depth and nuance in the principal characters is another critical misstep. Jennifer Lopez's portrayal of Dr. Annabelle Pierce, the fiercely intelligent oceanographer, feels hollow and one-dimensional. Chris Hemsworth's character, adventurous diver Jake Thompson, is riddled with clichés and tired tropes that render him a mere caricature. Both Lopez and Hemsworth are wasted in their roles, and it's hard to invest in their characters or care about their goals. Visually, there are brief moments of jaw-dropping beauty that remind us of the vast and mysterious world beneath the waves. However, these moments are few and far between, and the poor CGI ultimately detracts from the overall experience. It's disappointing that the filmmakers were unable to consistently maintain the high standard of visual excellence the premise deserved. In conclusion, \\"The Ocean's Abyss\\" is a disappointing attempt at bringing the mysterious deep-sea world to life. Neither the visuals nor the performances are enough to save it from its lackluster script and one-dimensional characters, leaving the audience as lost as the characters navigating the depths of the ocean. B). Positive Movie Review: Title: A Brilliant Dive - A Review of \\"The Ocean's Odyssey\\" \\"The Ocean's Odyssey,\\" directed by the visionary Samuel L. Marsh, plunges us into the thrilling depths of the ocean as we follow a team of daring explorers and pioneering scientists on their gripping journey into Earth's last frontier. With standout performances from Jennifer Lopez and Chris Hemsworth, this deep-sea adventure captivates and astounds from start to finish, delivering a breathtakingly immersive experience that truly raises the bar for oceanic adventures. The story of \\"The Ocean's Odyssey\\" deftly balances awe-inspiring discoveries with an undercurrent of human drama and emotion, making the audience care as much about the characters as they do the underwater world they explore. The film's daring narrative weaves together compelling personal stories with eye-opening revelations about the vast, alien world beneath our oceans. The performances are nothing short of mesmerizing, with Jennifer Lopez brilliantly embodying the role of Dr. Annabelle Pierce, the fiercely intelligent oceanographer who is equal parts headstrong and vulnerable. Chris Hemsworth delivers a captivating performance as the courageous and charismatic diver Jake Thompson, expertly navigating the spectrum of human experience from joy to despair. Their on-screen chemistry is undeniable, fueling both tension and camaraderie throughout the film. Visually, \\"The Ocean's Odyssey\\" is nothing short of a masterpiece. From the opening scene to the final frame, the audience is treated to a breathtaking tour of the uncharted depths of the ocean. The cinematography and art direction are top-notch, and the brilliantly executed CGI breathes life into the unknown creatures that call these remote depths home. In conclusion, \\"The Ocean's Odyssey\\" is an absolute triumph of storytelling, filmmaking, and acting. It successfully takes the audience on a journey to the unexplored corners of the ocean, introducing us to the wonders that lie beneath the waves while never losing sight of the human element that anchors the expedition.

Write highlights for this article: When Amazon released its Fire TV system this month, it propelled the company into the increasingly competitive marketplace of devices that stream Web content into the living room. The set-top box now competes with Apple, Google and Samsung, as well as early innovator Roku and even the gaming world's top consoles for the eyeballs of people who stream services like Netflix, Hulu and YouTube onto their televisions. These devices are relatively new innovations: Roku first announced a simple Netflix-streaming box in 2008. But in recent years, more and more people have begun using devices that harness the Internet's bountiful offerings and send them, usually via Wi-Fi, to a TV set. According to Experian, almost half of all U.S. adults and 67% of young adults now watch streamed or downloaded video at least once a week. And 7.6 million households in the United States have \\"cut the cord,\\" using Web streaming and downloading exclusively instead of cable, satellite or broadcast, for their television viewing, the company said in a report this week. But it's still a new concept for a lot of folks. And with so many players in the game, not to mention a new wave of \\"smart TVs\\" that hook up to the Web on their own, it can be hard to pick a favorite. If you own a smart TV, you may not need a separate device for streaming. But the software on many smart TVs is still clunky, and most Web-streaming gadgets offer a larger menu of apps and channels.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Favreau full of gratitude By Scott Bowles, USA TODAY SAN DIEGO  The prodigal son has returned. Jon Favreau, who showed footage from Iron Man here two years ago and became an immediate Comic-Con icon, is back. His new movie, Cowboys & Aliens, has barely begun production, so he doesn't have much to bring here. But he does have gratitude. \\"I wanted to come back and say thanks to the fans,\\" says Favreau, director of both Iron Man movies and the sci-fi fantasy Zathura. \\"You don't want to be forgotten by these guys.\\" That's not likely to happen anytime soon, at least at Comic-Con. Favreau's introduction of Iron Man in 2008 has become the gold standard for convention panels. \\"I still think about that day,\\" Favreau says of the panel discussion, in which he unspooled the first footage of his movie to Black Sabbath's Iron Man. By the time Favreau walked off the stage, Comic-Con was on its feet, bloggers were on his side and his two Iron Man films would gross more than 1.1 billion worldwide. \\"That (panel) changed everything,\\" Favreau says. \\"I think it's important to let them know what they did for me.\\" And to let them know what he's got coming up. Favreau's next film is a story about Western settlers and Apache warriors who band together in the late 1800s to battle marauding aliens. Far-fetched? Sure. But so is a story about a playboy who flies around in a metal suit. The secret to making the unusual seem ordinary, Favreau says, is to take your milieu seriously. \\"The Western was a very compelling genre until the 1970s,\\" he says. \\"It deals with loss, fear, the unknown.\\" But over time, he says, it lost touch with audiences, who were turning to the more street-savvy stories of Martin Scorsese, Francis Ford Coppola and John Cassavetes. \\"The Vietnam War changed the paradigm,\\" Favreau says. \\"When (Westerns) were no longer the go-to genre for profitability, it faded.\\" So he's got his own heavyweight to resuscitate the genre: producer Steven Spielberg. Spielberg held a private screening for Favreau and his cast — which includes Harrison Ford, Daniel Craig and Olivia Wilde —- of a restored version of John Wayne's classic Western The Searchers. \\"He gave us a running commentary, really broke it down,\\" Favreau says. \\"And he's the guy that essentially invented the alien movie. So he knew\\" both genres. The screening inspired the 43-year-old director, who decided not to update either genre, or create a fantastic twist that ties the genres together. \\"We weren't going to do a Jonah Hex or a Wild, Wild, West ,\\" Favreau says of those much maligned movies. \\"We're going to play both sides straight.\\" On the alien side, \\"we wanted that to have that feel of other sci-fi movies before the CGI boom, like Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Alien, Predators We want to be true to both genres and apologize for neither.\\" He may not have to apologize, but Favreau knows he still has to impress. Comic-Con fans, he says, are the quickest to turn on a director who doesn't have the goods. \\"They don't care about back story, they don't care about the politics it took to get your movie made,\\" he says. \\"They only care about what they see on the screen.\\" And what will they see on the screen? As usual, Favreau is saving his secrets for Comic-Con. But he does add: \\"Westerns and alien movies are a better combination than I thought they'd. The themes do intersect. And it's pretty wild to see a gunfighter, on horseback, running from an alien ship. I'm excited to be back.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

Question: Who was feared with increasing popularity of the site? Movie plot title: Untraceable Movie plot: Jennifer Marsh (Diane Lane) is a widowed single parent living in a suburban Portland home with her daughter Annie Haskins (Perla Haney-Jardine). By night, she works in the FBI's cybercrime division with Griffin Dowd (Colin Hanks), fighting identity theft and similar crimes. One night, an anonymous tip leads them to a website called killwithme.com. The site features a streaming video of a kitten being tortured and killed.After the kitten's death, KillWithMe's webmaster (Joseph Cross) 'graduates' to human victims and makes their deaths correlate directly with the number of hits the site receives. At a press conference, the public is urged to avoid killwithme but, as Marsh feared, this only increases the site's popularity. The videos are recorded in the killer's basement and his various victims include a helicopter pilot (who is bled to death by injections of anticoagulant), a newscaster (burnt by heat lamps) and Dowd (killed by slowly increasing the concentration of sulfuric acid solution in which he is submerged).At first it seems the victims were randomly chosen, but this is not the case. The first two victims were chosen because they were part of filming or presenting the suicide of a junior college teacher. The teacher's unstable, techno-prodigy son, Owen Reilly, broke down and was admitted to a psychiatric hospital. When released, he decided to prove a point (that the public is insatiable for the suffering of others), as well as wreak vengeance on those he felt had exploited his father's tragedy. Dowd was killed because he came close to the truth of who the murderer was. Marsh, who figures this out, is soon targeted as well.Captured by Reilly, Marsh escapes her death-by-mulcher by swinging out of the way while dangling from the ceiling.

Question: Many years ago there was a beach Called Coast Brigs where many coral and other life lived. A refinery that burned coal was built nearby and over time the water nearby became very acidic. The coral and marine life died because of this but a few miles north on another beach named Greendale the same creatures are surviving just fine. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Will building a refinery at Greendale cause the acidity of the water to increase or decrease? Hint: Ocean acidification occurs when excess carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes the oceans to become acidic. Burning fossil fuels has led to an increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. This carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water. Ocean acidification can kill corals and shellfish. It may also cause marine organisms to reproduce less, which could harm other organisms in the food chain. As a result, there also may be fewer marine organisms for humans to consume. Answer:","completion":"Building a refinery at Greendale is likely to cause the acidity of the water to increase. This is because the burning of fossil fuels, such as coal, at the refinery will release excess carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide is then absorbed by the oceans, which lowers the pH of the water, making it more acidic. As mentioned in the hint, ocean acidification can kill corals, shellfish, and harm other organisms in the food chain, which could ultimately affect humans and the ecosystem as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Massoud Barzani said if Kurds were \\"under threat of death and terrorism\\" then Iraqi Kurdistan would be \\"prepared to defend them\\". Recent fighting between Kurds and Islamist anti-government forces has left dozens dead in northern Syria. Kurds make up about 10% of the Syrian population. They are largely concentrated in the north-east, towards the Turkish border. The areas have been run by Kurdish local councils and militia since President Bashar al-Assad's forces withdrew last year. More than 100,000 people have been killed in the 28-month conflict in Syria, with a further 1.7 million Syrians forced to seek shelter in neighbouring countries, according to UN estimates. Syrian Kurdish militia have been engaged in fierce fighting recently with the jihadists of the anti-Assad al-Nusra Front. Mr Barzani called for a delegation to visit the Kurdish areas in Syria. He said if the delegation found evidence of \\"terrorists\\" killing Kurds, then Iraqi Kurdistan would \\"make use of all its capabilities to defend the Kurdish women, children and citizens in western Kurdistan\\". Mr Barzani gave no details of what form any intervention might take. Iraqi Kurdistan comprises three provinces in northern Iraq. It has its own military and police force. Syria's ethnic Kurdish minority has faced decades of discrimination and marginalisation under Assad rule, with Syrian Kurds staging their own anti-government protests after the Syria conflict began in March 2011. But most of the fighting recently has been against Islamist rebels. Last month a prominent Syrian Kurdish politician, Isa Huso, was killed by a car bomb in the north-eastern town of Qamishli. Kurdish militiamen responded with a call to arms to fight jihadists. This article was about:","completion":"This article is primarily about the conflict in Syria involving the Kurds, a prominent ethnic group, and the increasing tension with Islamist anti-government forces leading to escalating violence which has left dozens dead in northern Syria. The focus is on the statement made by Massoud Barzani, the President of the Iraqi Kurdistan, about the safety and rights of Kurdish people living in the volatile regions. He expressed concerns over the imminent threat of death and terrorism being faced by these people and affirmed that Iraqi Kurdistan, an autonomous region with its own military and police force, would be prepared to defend the Kurdish population if needed. The article gives a context of the recent events leading to this situation. It outlines that Kurds comprise around 10% of the Syrian population, and their concentration is strongest in the north-east region, towards the Turkish border. Since President Bashar al-Assad's forces withdrew last year, these areas have been managed by Kurdish local councils and their militia. The conflict in Syria has led to over 100,000 deaths in the past 28 months, as per UN estimates, with an additional 1.7 million Syrians compelled to seek refuge in neighbouring nations. The Syrian Kurdish militia has been locked in fierce combat situations recently with the al-Nusra Front, a jihadist group opposing Assad. Barzani urged for a delegation to visit the Kurdish areas in Syria to acquire a first-hand account of the situation. He expressed that if there was substantial evidence of \\"terrorists\\" attacking Kurds, Iraqi Kurdistan would utilise all its resources to protect its people in western Kurdistan. The exact form of this potential intervention, however, was not elaborated upon. The article informs us that Syrian Kurds have faced substantial discrimination and marginalisation under Assad's rule, which has been intensified in recent times with the upsurge in violent incidents against Islamist rebels. A notable occurrence was the death of Isa Huso, a prominent Syrian Kurdish politician, due to a car bomb attack, which led to Kurdish militiamen calling for armed resistance against jihadists."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Music is made up of a multitude of genres. Rock, blues, hip hop, pop, and country are just touching the surface of what those genres are. Figure out which sound best defines the band you hope to be in. Ask yourself what genres you enjoy playing the most and who you hope your target audience will be. Will your audience rock out while doing mosh pits? Will your audience be mellow and sway to your songs as you play in tiny coffee shops? Decide on the instruments you will have to use. A good start: lead guitar, rhythm guitar, bass, and drums. You may want a keyboardist, sax, or brass, depending on what sort of music you'll be wanting to play. How many people will it take for your vision of your band to come to life? Allow the sound you’re hoping to create act as your guide. There are ways to get into contact with the right people even if you are unfamiliar with your local music scene. You can begin auditions as soon as you find people you think could fit the bill. Go to school talent shows or open mic nights to get into contact with local artists in their environment. This will help you get a taste of what they have to offer musically by listening to some of their original stuff. A quicker, more technologically-savvy alternative is posting an ad on Facebook, Twitter, or even Instagram. Say something simple like: “Musician looking for an all female band to play with professionally. DM me for more details.” It's not important to do your own material at first. Start playing together and find out if you have good chemistry as a band. Plan on a time when all members can attend rehearsals. Plan to have rehearsals at least one time per week. If you can squeeze out one or two more times, that would be perfect. It might sound counterproductive to start with covers, or playing other people’s material, but it’s a great way to see what you gravitate towards collectively and as a group. This will help give you a direction of the kind of music you hope to be doing moving forward as a band. Encourage everyone who wants to write to write songs instead of delegating that task to one person. Over time, you will begin to agree who should do the biggest part of your band’s songwriting. Keep your ego in check always. Nobody wants to be your backup band - if it's an ensemble, let it remain a collaborative effort. When you first start creating, think of your message and the things you’re trying to say when you put your music out there to the world. Use guitar tab websites and other tutorials to help you push yourself musically with instruments and get better ideas of how to put music together as you arrange and develop your lyrics. Constantly push yourself. What is a summary?","completion":"Summary: Forming a band involves deciding on the genre and sound that defines your vision and identifying your target audience.

Before being burned at the stake, Asa vows revenge and puts a curse on her brother's descendants. A metal mask with sharp spikes on the inside is placed over the witch's face and hammered into her flesh.

Q:I can use this background: Fish reproduce sexually. They lay eggs that can be fertilized either inside or outside of the body. In most fish, the eggs develop outside of the mother's body. In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization. Now, I have a new situation: Two students read about reproduction for biology class. Vic read more about reptile reproduction, while Fox read more about fish reproduction. Answer this question please: Which student learned less about female fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water? A:","completion":"Based on the situation provided, Vic learned less about female fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water. This is because Vic focused on reading about reptile reproduction, whereas Fox read more about fish reproduction. In the background provided, we understand that female fish typically release their gametes into the surrounding water for fertilization. This is an essential aspect of fish reproduction, and it is likely that Fox gained more knowledge about this process by specifically studying fish reproduction. On the other hand, Vic studied reptile reproduction. Reptiles have different reproductive processes than fish, and since the information provided does not mention if any crossover between the topics occurred, it's safe to assume that Vic would have gained less knowledge about fish reproduction, including the fact about female fish releasing their gametes into the surrounding water.

Although it is deeply rooted in Indonesian culture, Bakso also has ties to Chinese cuisine, suggesting that its origin or influences may be a mix of both culinary backgrounds. The core ingredients of Bakso revolve around a savory and aromatic ground beef mixture, which is combined with tapioca to form the eponymous meatballs. It is important to note that noodles are a central element of this dish, making it a hearty and satisfying meal. Within the Bakso dish, there are several other key components that contribute to its unique taste and presentation. Rice vermicelli, a delicate and thin rice noodle, adds another layer of texture to the dish. The dish also boasts a rich and flavorsome beef broth, serving as the base in which all the ingredients come together and simmer. Incorporating fresh and crunchy vegetables into Bakso, such as kailan (also known as Chinese broccoli) and celery, provides a balanced contrast to the tender meatballs and silky noodles. Salted vegetables contribute a subtle yet complex dimension to the overall taste, enhancing the depth of the dish's flavors. To finish, Bakso is often garnished with a sprinkling of crispy fried shallots, which adds a touch of sweetness along with a delightful crunch that contrasts with the dish's other soft textures.

Martin was born on June 7, 1917, in Steubenville, Ohio, to an Italian father, Gaetano Alfonso Crocetti (1894-1967), and an Italian-American mother, Angela Crocetti (nee Barra; 1899-1966). They were married in 1914. His father, who was a barber, was originally from Montesilvano, in Abruzzo, and his maternal grandparents' origins are believed to be also from Abruzzo, although they are not clearly known. Martin attracted the attention of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Columbia Pictures, but a Hollywood contract was not forthcoming. He met comic Jerry Lewis at the Glass Hat Club in New York, where both were performing. Martin and Lewis formed a fast friendship which led to their participation in each other's acts and the formation of a music-comedy team. Martin and Lewis's debut together occurred at Atlantic City's 500 Club on July 24, 1946, and they were not well received. The owner, Skinny D'Amato, warned them that if they did not come up with a better act for their second show that night, they would be fired. Huddling in the alley behind the club, Lewis and Martin agreed to \\"go for broke\\", they divided their act between songs, skits, and ad-libbed material. Martin sang and Lewis dressed as a busboy, dropping plates and making a shambles of Martin's performance and the club's decorum until Lewis was chased from the room as Martin pelted him with breadrolls. They did slapstick, reeled off old vaudeville jokes, and did whatever else popped into their heads. The audience laughed. This success led to a series of well-paying engagements on the Eastern seaboard, culminating in a run at New York's Copacabana. The act consisted of Lewis interrupting and heckling Martin while he was trying to sing, with the two ultimately chasing each other around the stage. The secret, both said, is that they ignored the audience and played to each other. The team made its TV debut on the first broadcast of CBS-TV network's The Ed Sullivan Show (then called \\"The Toast Of The Town) on June 20, 1948, with composers Rodgers and Hammerstein also appearing. Hoping to improve their act, the two hired young comedy writers Norman Lear and Ed Simmons to write their bits. With the assistance of both Lear and Simmons, the two would take their act beyond nightclubs. A radio series began in 1949, the year Martin and Lewis signed with Paramount producer Hal B. Wallis as comedy relief for the movie My Friend Irma. Their agent, Abby Greshler, negotiated one of Hollywood's best deals: although they received only 75,000 between them for their films with Wallis, Martin and Lewis were free to do one outside film a year, which they would co-produce through their own York Productions. They also controlled their club, record, radio, and television appearances, and through these they earned millions of dollars. In Dean & Me, Lewis calls Martin one of the great comic geniuses of all time. They were friends, as well, with Lewis acting as best man when Martin remarried in 1949. But harsh comments from critics, as well as frustration with the similarity of Martin and Lewis movies, which producer Hal Wallis refused to change, led to Martin's dissatisfaction. He put less enthusiasm into the work, leading to escalating arguments with Lewis. Martin told his partner he was \\"nothing to me but a dollar sign\\". The act broke up in 1956, 10 years to the day from the first teaming.

Perry faces accusations of coercion of a public servant and abuse of his official capacity in connection with the threat and veto. Right to veto?

Article: Several years ago, I taught teenagers with feeling troubles in a group home. These very tough kids often came directly from prison to my classroom. They often wanted to escape from the group home. They were society's \\"throwaway\\" kids--youngsters without families to love and care for them. They desperately needed to receive love. Then I found one thing more important for them. So, when a friend suggested an idea, I thought it would be a great program for my students. The plan was simple. We arranged that every Wednesday morning, I'd bring over my little crew, and they were supposed to clean the runs, wash dog and cat bowls, and feed the animals at our local animal shelter. Then came the risky part of the program. After doing their chores, the youngsters would earn the freedom to walk one of the dogs in the wooded area behind the shelter, where I couldn't even see them. We began the project. Each week, I carefully went over the list of students who had met the requirements. All that week, students worked hard to control their tempers and be cooperative. I emphasized how much the animals needed their love and care. As they served the animals, the youngsters were transforming before our eyes. Never before had they been considered contributing members of society. Yet now these kids begged to volunteer at the shelter. As we had planned, my students walked the dogs, unwatched, in the woods for up to half an hour. I impressed on each of them my trust and respect that they'd bring back the animal in their care safely and on time. Remarkably, I never lost a student or an animal. The world might not have needed or might have forgotten about my kids, but the animals didn't. these shining animals showed some very needy kids the way back home from heartbreak and abuse.

Team A studied East Antarctica, while team B studied West Antarctica. They published their findings in a peer reviewed publication. and a hint : Some of Antarctica has been warming up; particularly strong warming has been noted on the Antarctic Peninsula. A study by Eric Steig published in 2009 noted for the first time that the continent-wide average surface temperature trend of Antarctica is slightly positive at >0.05 °C (0.09 °F) per decade from 1957 to 2006. This study also noted that West Antarctica has warmed by more than 0.1 °C (0.2 °F) per decade in the last 50 years, and this warming is strongest in winter and spring. This is partly offset by autumn cooling in East Antarctica. There is evidence from one study that Antarctica is warming as a result of human carbon dioxide emissions, but this remains ambiguous. The amount of surface warming in West Antarctica, while large, has not led to appreciable melting at the surface, and is not directly affecting the West Antarctic Ice Sheet's contribution to sea level. Instead the recent increases in glacier outflow are believed to be due to an inflow of warm water from the deep ocean, just off the continental shelf. The net contribution to sea level from the Antarctic Peninsula is more likely to be a direct result of the much greater atmospheric warming there.In 2002 the Antarctic Peninsula's Larsen-B ice shelf collapsed. Between 28 February and 8 March 2008, about 570 km2 (220 sq mi) of ice from the Wilkins Ice Shelf on the southwest part of the peninsula collapsed, putting the remaining 15,000 km2 (5,800 sq mi) of the ice shelf at risk. The ice was being held back by a \\"thread\\" of ice about 6 km (4 mi) wide, prior to its collapse on 5 April 2009. According to NASA, the most widespread Antarctic surface melting of the past 30 years occurred in 2005, when an area of ice comparable in size to California briefly melted and refroze; this may have resulted from temperatures rising to as high as 5 °C (41 °F).A study published in Nature Geoscience in 2013 (online in December 2012) identified central West Antarctica as one of the fastest-warming regions on Earth.

Translate to German: But opening those markets to foreign investors, which has been the dominant strategy for developing them, was a mixed blessing.","completion":"To translate the sentence \\"But opening those markets to foreign investors, which has been the dominant strategy for developing them, was a mixed blessing.\\" to German, I'd need to remember three crucial factors. First, German sentence structure often deviates from English. Second, idiomatic expressions need careful conversion to maintain meaning. Third, the translation should maintain the original sentence's tone and style. The German translation of the sentence would be: \\"Aber die Öffnung dieser Märkte für ausländische Investoren, die die dominante Strategie für ihre Entwicklung war, war ein zweischneidiges Schwert.\\" Breaking down every step: 1. \\"But opening those markets to foreign investors\\" translates to \\"Aber die Öffnung dieser Märkte für ausländische Investoren\\". The conjunction \\"but\\" is translated to \\"aber\\". The phrase \\"opening those markets\\" is translated to \\"die Öffnung dieser Märkte\\", since in German, \\"these markets\\" would be \\"dieser Märkte\\". \\"Foreign investors\\" translates to \\"ausländische Investoren\\", maintaining the word order as is in English. 2. \\"which has been the dominant strategy for developing them\\" translates to \\"die die dominante Strategie für ihre Entwicklung war\\". The relative pronoun structure is slightly different in German, as the gender and number of the noun it refers to, \\"markets\\" in this case, changes the pronoun form to \\"die\\". Also, the verb comes at the end of a relative clause in German translating \\"has been\\" to \\"war\\" (was). 3. \\"was a mixed blessing\\" translates to \\"war ein zweischneidiges Schwert\\". The phrase \\"mixed blessing\\" doesn't translate directly into German; instead, the idiomatic phrase \\"zweischneidiges Schwert\\" (\\"double-edged sword\\") is used, carrying the same idea of something having both advantages and disadvantages. The verb \\"was\\" is translated to \\"war\\", put at the start of the phrase following German sentence structure rules. Through this step-by-step process, I have faithfully translated the given English sentence to German, considering all linguistic, idiomatic, and structural nuances of the target language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: Let's Go to Prison Movie plot: John Lyshitski (Dax Shepard) has spent most of his life being a slimeball, thanks to Judge Nelson Biederman III, who has been giving him hard sentences ever since he stole a car at the age of eight. Now he wants revenge, but finds that the judge died an all too peaceful death three days previous to Johns release from prison.He turns his attention to Nelson Biederman IIIs obnoxious son, Nelson Biederman IV (Will Arnett). At a dedication ceremony for Nelson III, John hops into Nelson's BMW, steals his change, spits in his coffee and uses up his inhaler. In the BMW after the ceremony, Nelson IV yells at his attorney (who has the speakerphone on in the fully occupied board room), starts to sing, and when he goes for the inhaler, finds it empty. He stops at a pharmacy, panicked, and starts knocking items off the shelf in an attempt to find a replacement inhaler. The pharmacy owners think he's another junkie robber, and that the inhaler he finally finds is a tiny pistol, and call the police. Nelson ends up convicted on that robbery and demands that the Biederman foundation call the governor to dismiss his charges. Even though the governor owes the foundation a favor, the board of directors decide to let Nelson go to prison as they have grown tired of his asinine deportment. John is not satisfied with Nelson just going to prison, however, so John decides to join him in prison by selling marijuana to undercover police officers. At his sentencing he pleads guilty to the same judge Nelson IV had, and asks for the same sentence (3-5) at the same prison. After negotiating with the judge and bribing a few guards, he ends up as Nelsons cellmate, and here he pretends to be his friend, all in an attempt to give him the wrong advice on surviving life in prison.Somehow, Nelson gets himself out of a numerous array of jams, even discovering that he's gay and meeting the love of his life, gang leader Barry (Chi McBride), a hulking, burly gay caballero with the heart of a dashing romantic hero beating within his massive, hairy...

A:","completion":"Lu Ji (Gongji), born in 188 AD, was a prominent official, strategists, and scholar who served in the eastern Wu Kingdom under the rule of Sun Quan during the turbulent era of the Three Kingdoms in ancient China. With a birth name of Lu Ji and a courtesy name of Gongji, Lu Chi (as known in the Wade-Giles Romanization of his name) was a well-respected figure and a talented scholar known for his sharp wit, diplomatic skills, and keen understanding of politics and military strategy. Lu Ji was born into a distinguished family with a long history of serving the government in various capacities, providing him with an excellent foundation and opportunities to pursue a career in the realm of politics, administration, and military strategy. With his incredible intellectual abilities, he delved into the study of classic literature, law, and military texts, emerging as a man of great learning and an accomplished scholar in his own right. He began his career in the bureaucratic system of the Eastern Wu by joining the officialdom under Sun Quan, the founding emperor of the Eastern Wu Kingdom and a powerful warlord at the time. It was during this period that Lu Ji proved his diplomatic skills while dealing with emissaries and envoys from rival kingdoms as well as tribes and neighboring nations. His expertise in politics and diplomacy played a critical role in shaping the relations between Eastern Wu Kingdom and its neighbors. Due to his exceptional military strategic acumen, he was assigned key positions in managing the armed forces and devising battlefield tactics. He was instrumental in planning and executing crucial campaigns and offensives against opponents of the Eastern Wu, primarily the rival kingdoms of Shu Han and Cao Wei. Drawing from the ancient art of war, his theoretical and practical knowledge enabled him to develop innovative strategies to outwit and overpower enemies on the field. In 219 AD, Lu Ji passed away while still serving as an official in the Kingdom of Sun Quan, leaving behind a legacy of his substantial contributions to the establishment, administration, and military success of the Eastern Wu Kingdom. His keen intellect, astute diplomatic skills, and talent for military strategizing had a profound impact on the kingdom's fortunes. Apart from his notable career, Lu Ji's exceptional talent as a scholar and a writer have also earned him recognition in the annals of Chinese history. He authored and contributed to several works on history, literature, and military strategy, with some of his written works regarded as significant contributions to Chinese literature. His life and achievements have been documented in various historical texts and records, including his notable biography in the monumental historical text, \\"Records of the Three Kingdoms\\" by the historian Chen Shou. In conclusion, Lu Ji (Gongji) has left an indelible mark in the history of the Eastern Wu Kingdom and ancient China in general. Rising through the bureaucratic ranks and serving with great distinction, he exemplified outstanding leadership and intellectual abilities. His life and legacy serve as a testament to the incredible impact that one individual can make on the complex political, administrative, and military landscape of an era plagued by conflicts and strife."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

The modern Republic of Turkey dates only from 1923, but the history of the land within its borders stretches back to the dawn of humanity. Widespread finds of Stone Age implements in cave excavations show that Anatolia was already inhabited during the Middle of the Palaeolithic period (about 200,000 to 40,000 years ago). By Neolithic times, organized communities had arisen, such as the one at Çatalhöyük, near Konya, Turkey's most important prehistoric site. This town, which flourished between 6500 and 5500 b.c. , had flat-roofed houses of mud and timber decorated with wall-paintings, some of which show patterns that still appear on Anatolian kilims. The advent of the Bronze Age (about 3200 b.c. ), and the spread of city-states ruled by kings, is marked by the appearance of royal tombs containing bronze objects in such places as Troy in the west, and Alacahöyük near Ankara. Around this time the Sumerian civilization living in Mesopotamia (the region between the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in present-day Iraq) founded and developed the cuneiform script, the world's oldest form of writing on record. The technique was introduced by Assyrian traders 1,000 years later in­to Anatolia, where it was qui­ck­ly adopted by the indigenous Hatti people, who, at this point, had already reached an ad­­vanced state of civilization. The Hittites: The capital of the Hatti was Kanesh (modern Kültepe, near Kayseri). Cuneiform tablets found here record the arrival in Anatolia of warlike invaders around the second mill­ennium b.c. Their origins remain a my­s­tery (their written language was finally deciphered in 1915), but they came from the direction of the Caucasus moun­tains, spreading destruction and disorder throughout Anatolia. It was two hundred years before they were firmly entrenched in their newly conquered empire. The newcomers were the Hittites, and their domination of Anatolia can be divided into three distinct periods: the Old Kingdom (c. 1600–1450 b.c. ), then the New or Empire Period (c. 1450–1200 b.c. ), and the Late Hittite Period (c.

Bugs and Captain Sam battle each other in a fierce duel. Bugs first manages to find and shoot Sam first time (\\"Blast, ya rabbit! Two can play that game!\\"), and when Sam tries to himself, he ends up being shot again. When Sam is filling his cannons and firing them, Bugs wanders onto Sam's ship and shoots Sam as he is filling one, turning Sam into a pile of rubble. Later, Sam tries the same method on Bugs but this time, the cannon instead launches backwards into Sam, shooting himself out of the ship's side. Sam then tries to swing aboard Bugs' ship. However, there is another cannon in Sam's path resulting in Sam landing in the cannon. The cannon fires as Sam tries to retreat. Sam then makes a model sailship using a barrel of dynamite. He lights it and blows air to push the ship at Bugs' ship. Bugs tries to blow the explosive model ship back to no avail. Bugs then uses an electric fan to blow the ship back at Sam's ship; when Sam tries to blow it back it explodes when it reaches his face. Then Sam dresses up in a diving suit.

My question: Why didn't Bugs abandoned ship? A:","completion":"Bugs Bunny didn't abandon ship for several reasons: 1. Personality and resilience: Bugs Bunny is known for his clever, resourceful, and witty personality. He has a knack for outsmarting his adversaries, and often enjoys the challenge of overcoming obstacles and turning the tables on them. In this case, facing the pirate Captain Yosemite Sam provided Bugs Bunny with an opportunity to showcase his wits and abilities. Abandoning the ship would mean giving up this opportunity and backing down from a challenge, which is not typical of Bugs' character. 2. Protection of the trading sailship: Bugs Bunny, being on board the trading sailship, might have felt a sense of responsibility to protect the ship and its cargo, possibly consisting of his beloved carrots. If he were to abandon the ship, Captain Yosemite Sam would easily take control of the ship and its cargo, which would not be ideal for Bugs or the crew that surrendered earlier. 3. Confidence in his skills: Bugs Bunny has exhibited remarkable problem-solving skills and resourcefulness throughout the movie. He was able to outsmart Captain Yosemite Sam with various tricks, tactics, and traps, as demonstrated in their fierce duel and succeeding encounters. Bugs Bunny's confidence in his skills and abilities probably led him to believe that he could handle the situation without resorting to abandoning the ship. 4. Entertainment and humor: From a storytelling perspective, Bugs Bunny not abandoning the ship allows the movie to explore humorous and entertaining situations and interactions between him and Captain Yosemite Sam. The showdown between Bugs and Sam provides ample opportunity to showcase their respective personalities and their classic rival dynamic. Bugs Bunny's decision to stay on the ship and fight Sam contributes to the movie's overall enjoyment, presenting a rollercoaster of amusing and thrilling events that end up elevating the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lanza began studying to be a professional singer at the age of 16. After appearing at the Hollywood Bowl in 1947, Lanza signed a seven-year film contract with Louis B. Mayer, the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, who saw his performance and was impressed by his singing. Lanza was the first RCA Victor Red Seal artist to win a gold disc and the first artist to sell 2 1/2 million albums Lanza was referred to by some sources as the \\"new Caruso\\" after his \\"instant success\\" in Hollywood films, while MGM hoped he would become the movie studio's \\"singing Clark Gable\\" for his good looks and powerful voice. In 1994, outstanding tenor Jose Carreras paid tribute to Lanza during a worldwide concert tour, saying of him, \\"If I'm an opera singer, it's thanks to Mario Lanza.\\" His equally outstanding colleague Placido Domingo echoed these comments in a 2009 CBS interview with, \\"Lanza's passion and the way his voice sounds are what made me sing opera.

His films, especially The Great Caruso, influenced numerous future opera stars, including Joseph Calleja, Jose Carreras, Placido Domingo and Luciano Pavarotti.

Process: - The bat sends out sound waves from their mouth or nose - The sound waves hit an object - Echoes are produced - The echo returns to the bat&#x27;s ears - The bat hears the echo - The bat can figure out where the object is located. Question: suppose less sound waves hit the mouth happens, how will it affect more echoes are produced. - A: more - B: less - C: no effect","completion":"When the number of emitted sound waves is reduced, the bat will likely encounter fewer echoes being produced as a direct result. This is due to the underlying principles associated with echolocation, the process through which the bat navigates and locates objects in its environment. Consequently, the correct answer would be B: less. To provide a more detailed explanation, let's discuss the process of echolocation and how reducing sound waves could impact the number of echoes produced. Echolocation, also known as bio sonar, is a physiological and adaptive process used by bats to navigate and hunt in darkness. These small mammals emit ultrasonic sound waves from their mouth or nose, which travels outward in various directions. The sound waves then contact objects within the environment, causing an echo to be reflected back towards the bat. The duration and specific reception of these echoes allow bats to accurately perceive the location, distance, size, and even texture of the objects present within their environment. As the number of sound waves emitted by the bat decreases, there will be fewer chances for the sound waves to encounter objects and return as echoes. This reduction in echoes will likely hinder the bat's ability to locate and identify objects within its environment effectively. The relationship between the number of emitted sound waves and produced echoes can be summarized as follows: a higher number of sound waves typically results in more echoes, while a lower number of sound waves tends to yield fewer echoes. Therefore, in the given scenario where fewer sound waves hit the object, it will result in fewer echoes being produced, leading to a lesser amount of information available for the bat to accurately locate and identify objects in its surroundings. The bat's overall ability to navigate and hunt will be impacted negatively, with diminished echolocation efficiency and accuracy."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

They differ to a degree from spin-offs in that shows may air simultaneously, rather than being derived from, and replacing, another. The popularity of most shows is limited to a few seasons, and sister shows allow expanding the immediate audience and ratings share. This is accomplished by using mostly different actors and production facilities. Sister shows often shift styles or target audience slightly, for a larger overall market. Thus \\"The Beverly Hillbillies\\" emphasizes slapstick, while \\"Green Acres\\" emphasizes surreal humor. - Drama is the specific mode of fiction represented in performance.

With the extension of Turkish dominion into the Balkans, the strategic conquest of Constantinople became a crucial objective. The empire had managed to control nearly all former Byzantine lands surrounding the city, but in 1402 the Byzantines were temporarily relieved when the Turco-Mongol leader Timur, founder of the Timurid Empire, invaded Anatolia from the east. In the Battle of Ankara in 1402, Timur defeated the Ottoman forces and took Sultan Bayezid I as a prisoner, throwing the empire into disorder. The ensuing civil war lasted from 1402 to 1413 as Bayezid's sons fought over succession. It ended when Mehmed I emerged as the sultan and restored Ottoman power, bringing an end to the Interregnum, also known as the Fetret Devri.

It provides a firefighter with a small camera that attaches to existing masks and allows them to see thermal images on a micro-screen in real time. Traditionally, handheld equipment has been used which limits movement and means only one is used per crew. The new device was developed by Flint-based Taylor Dowding Innovation (TDI) in partnership with Scott Safety, a leading manufacturer of personal safety equipment. TDI argues that it can help save lives by giving firefighters more information in smoke filled environments. The company is part of the growing Welsh technology sector which employs 39,000 people. TDI started four years ago as a specialist in video and hazardous environments. Most of the key parts were developed over the last nine months. Nick Taylor, chief technology officer, said: \\"Hand-held thermal imagers can be quite a bit more costly so there is an opportunity for more fire fighters to have them and this is also completely hands-free, which is also beneficial.\\" \\"A lot of this is down to the miniaturisation possible with electronics, while thermal-imaging sensor elements are more integrated and the development of small displays and better technology has improved, driven by mobile phone developments.\\" According to the technology network, Estnet, there are 3,100 companies operating in the \\"chips to clicks\\" sector which contributes Â£8.3bn to the Welsh economy. Estnet managing director Avril Lewis said the rate of technological development meant ideas could come to market very quickly. \\"The technology industry is crucial to Wales and the Welsh economy, because we underpin other key economic sectors, the public sector and the social environment,\\" she said. \\"We're employing nearly 39,000 people and forecasting 7% growth over the next three years. We're a high-value industry and, as a result, we need to attract high-value people - and it's a well-paid, interesting industry. \\"Another part of Estnet is ensuring we have the right skills coming through and we're working very hard with universities to ensure graduates have good-employability skills so they can help our businesses hit the ground running faster.\\" Summary:","completion":"The Scott Sight technology, which has been used in the USA for six months, provides firefighters with a small thermal-imaging camera that attaches to their masks, allowing them to view real-time thermal images on a micro-screen.

Now thanks to trainer Ashleigh Kinsley--Alida and Mr Gibbs love nothing more than playing and running around together with the dog acting as Alida's life saver. How did Alida keep alive? A) By training her dog. B) By staying with her parents. C) By playing with her fellows. D) By breathing through a tube. Answer:","completion":"Alida, a three-year-old little girl diagnosed with neuroendocrine hyperplasia of infancy (NEHI), is kept alive primarily by breathing through a tube. This condition, of which there are only eight hundred documented worldwide, causes diseased pieces of her lungs to filter oxygen through extra layers of cells, making it very difficult for her to breathe. Therefore, breathing equipment, specifically an oxygen tank, is essential for her survival. However, due to the weighty nature of the oxygen equipment, it poses a challenge for young Alida to carry the tank around by herself, especially during activities like playing or bike riding. This was a significant problem because it hindered Alida's movement, limiting her ability to engage in natural and healthy activities of a child her age, such as walk in the park or even play in the family's ten-acre land in Louisville. For aid with this complex situation, Alida's parents sought the help of a service dog, having learned about their potential benefits from a TV program. They discovered that service animals, commonly trained to assist visually impaired individuals, could potentially be trained to help Alida carry her oxygen tank. With this resolution in mind, Alida's family sought the assistance of Ashleigh Kinsley, a dog trainer. A Golden Doodle dog named Mr Gibbs, a breed derived from crossing a retriever with a poodle, was trained specifically to aid Alida. Mr Gibbs was trained to carry Alida's oxygen tank on his back, allowing Alida to move more freely and engage in age-appropriate activities. Thanks to Mr Gibbs and the specialized training provided by Ashleigh Kinsley, Alida was able to lead a more manageable and playful life despite her condition. The exceptional relationship and bond between Alida and Mr Gibbs not only allowed Alida to stay alive, but also facilitated a significant improvement in her quality of life. So, while she is kept alive by breathing through a tube (option D), it is through the support of her trained dog, Mr Gibbs, that she can carry her oxygen tank and live a more normal, playful life. Hence, in more than one way, it could be said that Alida was kept alive by training her dog (option A), but the essential mechanism keeping her alive is breathing through a tube (option D)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

However, upon a closer look, one realizes that the implication is not quite so straightforward. The claim being made is indeed suggesting that the speaker had previously believed this to be the case. This statement implies their belief about how Slate.com operates, but the additional comment in parentheses -- typically used in writing to add an afterthought or a sidebar -- indicates some level of surprise or realization. Therefore, it can be inferred that the speaker's initial assumption was incorrect or has been challenged. As such, the premise does not categorically confirm the hypothesis \\"People have to be physically present at Slate.com to write for it.\\" On the contrary, it seems to oppose it. In context, the phrase \\"And all this time, I thought you actually had to be physically present at Slate.com in order to write for it\\" suggests that the speaker has recently learned that it is not true that one must be physically present at Slate.com to write for it. This is a testament to the changing landscape of work and contribution in the increasingly digital world. Many writers today work remotely, using digital technology and the internet to collaborate with editors, submit pieces for consideration, and ultimately have their work published on platforms like Slate.com. When evaluating a sentence or statement to ascertain whether it provides unwavering support for a hypothesis or assumption, it's important to differentiate what is explicitly being said from what is merely implied or suggested. In this case, careful analysis of the premise reveals that it likely contradicts the given hypothesis. So, in a nutshell, the premise does not entail the hypothesis.

Summarize the following: If you’re calling her or approaching her in person, you need to introduce yourself. While she might remember you, there is a good chance she might not remember your name. Take the opportunity to briefly introduce yourself. In addition, remind her of how you know each other. Say something like “Hey, Ann! I’m John – we know each other through Andy.” Don’t be offended if she doesn’t know your name or forgets it later. Whatever way you decide to contact her, you should consider using humor. Humor will make a potentially awkward situation funny, and help remind her of your virtues. There are many ways you can do this: Start with a light-hearted joke about something you might think is funny. For example, if you remember she really likes Oreo cookies, you can joke about those. Joke about fashion. For instance, say “I was just in the mall and saw someone that looks exactly like you wearing crocs.” Use self-deprecating humor. For example, say, “Hey, do you remember me? The guy who wears the absurd cowboy boots.” Contact her and start up a conversation about how she’s doing in life. If you’re interested in a romantic relationship with her, this is a good way to find out if she is available. In addition, this is a very honest and straightforward way of reinitiating contact. Generally, you can say something like “It’s been a while since we spoke. How are you doing?” If you knew her from work, and one of you has moved on, ask her “So, what’s going on with work these days?” In the case you knew each other through a mutual friend, you could simply ask about whether she’s spoken to that person recently. While it may seem disingenuous, send her a text in which you’re talking to someone else, like a friend or a romantic interest. Make sure the text is simple, but somewhat intriguing. She may respond telling you that you’re texting the wrong person, or she might pretend to be the person you’re supposed to be texting. Whatever happens, use it as an opportunity to talk to her. You should eventually let her know that you knew that it was her you were texting or calling. Chances are, though, she will already know.

Please briefly summarize this news article: ABC News’ Amy Robach Reveals Breast Cancer Diagnosis By ABC News’ Amy Robach I remember exactly where I was when I got the call from a “Good Morning America” producer. I was about to interview Marie Monville, the wife of the Amish school shooter, in the bucolic setting of Lancaster, Pa. She was speaking out about the senseless horror that happened in the most unlikely of places. I was focused on what was about to be an emotional interview regarding life after tragedy, when our producer asked me if she could make a sensitive request: “Amy, next week we’d like you to do the first ever live television mammogram for ‘GMA’ Goes Pink day. You’re 40, the age women should start getting mammograms. Would you even consider it?” It felt like a strange thing to consider given where I was and what I was about to do, but oddly now, it all feels connected. For the past 20 years, sadly, a large part of my job deals in tragedy — other peoples’ tragedies — but never my own. That day, when I was asked to do something I really didn’t want to do, something I had put off for more than a year, I had no way of knowing that I was in a life-or-death situation. Sitting in that kitchen with Marie Monville, I had cancer and didn’t know it. In fact, I would have considered it virtually impossible that I would have cancer. I work out, I eat right, I take care of myself and I have very little family history; in fact, all of my grandparents are still alive. So in the days to follow, if several producers and even Robin Roberts herself hadn’t convinced me that doing this on live television would save lives, I would never have been able to save my own. So on Oct. 1, I had my first mammogram, in front of millions of people. After breathing a big sigh of relief once it was done, my breath was taken away only a few weeks later. I thought I was going back in for a few follow-up images, only to find out in a matter of hours that I had breast cancer. I was alone that afternoon, never thinking to bring anyone with me, never thinking that day would be life-altering. My husband was on a business trip and my parents live across the country, but that night everyone flew into New York City and we started gearing up for a fight. On Thursday, Nov. 14, I will go into surgery where my doctors will perform a bilateral mastectomy followed by reconstructive surgery. Only then will I know more about what that fight will fully entail, but I am mentally and physically as prepared as anyone can be in this situation. And while everyone who gets cancer is clearly unlucky, I got lucky by catching it early, and there are so many people to thank for making sure I did. Every producer, every person who urged me to do this, changed my trajectory. The doctors told me bluntly: “That mammogram just saved your life.” I was also told this, for every person who has cancer, at least 15 lives are saved because people around them become vigilant. They go to their doctors, they get checked. I can only hope my story will do the same and inspire every woman who hears it to get a mammogram, to take a self exam. No excuses. It is the difference between life and death. ABC News correspondent Amy Robach. Summary:","completion":"ABC News correspondent Amy Robach revealed her breast cancer diagnosis after being asked to undergo a live television mammogram for \\"GMA Goes Pink\\" day. Robach, who initially didn't want to participate, agreed after being convinced by producers and colleagues that it would save lives. Following her first mammogram, she later discovered she had breast cancer. Robach emphasizes the importance of early detection and hopes her story will inspire women to get mammograms and conduct self-exams."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Drink the water that has not been boiled. Many people think boiled water is safe and good to people's health. In fact, it is not true. The boiling point of water is 100degC. By boiling it, most bacteria in water can be killed. In the past, the water was less polluted. So boiling was a good way to make clean water. But heavy metals and other dangerous things in today's water are much more terrible than bacteria. Boiling doesn't fix that problem. And boiling water may give us more of the dangerous things in our glass. 4. Never use soft drinks to take the place of water. 5. Water is also needed in winter. 6. Drink water at the right time. 1) After getting up in the morning, you have less water in your body, because you weren't drinking for the whole night. So you should drink some water to keep your health after getting up in the morning. That can prevent high blood pressure, cerebral hemorrhages and so on. 2) Drinking water at about 10 am helps your body keep enough water. 3) Drinking water at about 3 pm can clean out the wastes in your body. 4) About eight o'clock in the evening is the best time to drink water.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: Where does the painting that not get distribution of reproductions reside today? Candaules, King of Lydia, Shews his Wife by Stealth to Gyges, One of his Ministers, as She Goes to Bed, occasionally formerly known as The Imprudence of Candaules, is a 45.1 by 55.9 cm (17.8 by 22.0 in) oil painting on canvas by English artist William Etty, first exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1830. It shows a scene from the Histories by Herodotus, in which Candaules, king of Lydia, invites his bodyguard Gyges to hide in the couple's bedroom and watch his wife Nyssia undress, to prove to him her beauty. Nyssia notices Gyges spying and challenges him to either accept his own execution or to kill Candaules as a punishment. Gyges chooses to kill Candaules and take his place as king. The painting shows the moment at which Nyssia, still unaware that she is being watched by anyone other than her husband, removes the last of her clothes. Etty hoped that his audience would take from the painting the moral lesson that women are not chattels and that men infringing on their rights should justly be punished, but he made little effort to explain this to audiences. The painting was immediately controversial and perceived as a cynical combination of a pornographic image and a violent and unpleasant narrative, and it was condemned as an immoral piece of the type one would expect from a foreign, not a British, artist. It was bought by Robert Vernon on its exhibition, and in 1847 was one of a number of paintings given by Vernon to the nation. The work retained its controversial reputation in later years, and when The Art Journal bought the reproduction rights to Vernon's former collection in 1849 they did not distribute reproductions of Candaules. In 1929 it was among several paintings transferred to the newly expanded Tate Gallery, where as of 2018 it remains.","completion":"The painting that did not get distribution of reproductions resides today in the Tate Gallery, as of 2018."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In it he found \\"a new concept not only of how melody might be organized, but of what the implications were for the development of a mature artistic language\\". Holst did not found or lead a school of composition; nevertheless, he exercised influences over both contemporaries and successors. According to Short, Vaughan Williams described Holst as \\"the greatest influence on my music\\", although Matthews asserts that each influenced the other equally. Among later composers, Michael Tippett is acknowledged by Short as Holst's \\"most significant artistic successor\\", both in terms of compositional style and because Tippett, who succeeded Holst as director of music at Morley College, maintained the spirit of Holst's music there. Of an early encounter with Holst, Tippett later wrote: \\"Holst seemed to look right inside me, with an acute spiritual vision\\". Kennedy observes that \\"a new generation of listeners ... recognized in Holst the fount of much that they admired in the music of Britten and Tippett\\". Holst's pupil Edmund Rubbra acknowledged how he and other younger English composers had adopted Holst's economy of style: \\"With what enthusiasm did we pare down our music to the very bone\\".Short cites other English composers who are in debt to Holst, in particular William Walton and Benjamin Britten, and suggests that Holst's influence may have been felt further afield. Above all, Short recognises Holst as a composer for the people, who believed it was a composer's duty to provide music for practical purposes—festivals, celebrations, ceremonies, Christmas carols or simple hymn tunes. Thus, says Short, \\"many people who may never have heard any of [Holst's] major works ... have nevertheless derived great pleasure from hearing or singing such small masterpieces as the carol 'In the Bleak Midwinter'\\".On 27 September 2009, after a weekend of concerts at Chichester Cathedral in memory of Holst, a new memorial was unveiled to mark the 75th anniversary of the composer's death. It is inscribed with words from the text of The Hymn of Jesus: \\"The heavenly spheres make music for us\\". In April 2011 a BBC television documentary, Holst: In the Bleak Midwinter, charted Holst's life with particular reference to his support for socialism and the cause of working people.

Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: A firm handshake could be a sign of a longer life expectancy , according to British researchers. Scientists at the Medical Research Council found that elderly people who could still give a firm handshake and walk at a quick pace were likely to outlive their slower peers. They found simple measures of physical capability like shaking hands, walking, getting up from a chair and balancing on one leg were related to the life expectancy, even after accounting for age, sex and body size. The study is the first to provide a comprehensive view of the existing data from 33 studies. \\"These measures have been used in population-based research for quite a long time,\\" said Rachel Cooper of the Medical Research Council's Unit for Lifelong Health and Aging. \\"They may be useful indicators for subsequent health.\\" Cooper, whose study appears in the British Medical Journal, said more studies are needed to clarify whether the measures would be helpful to doctors as a screening tool. \\"I wouldn't suggest that we roll them out into clinical practice tomorrow, but it is possible that they could be used in the future,\\" she told the media. The researchers examined 33 studies involving tens of thousands of people, most of whom were aged over 60 but living in the community rather than in hospital or care homes. The researchers found that those with the strongest hand grasps tended to live longer than those with weak grips. The death rate over the period of the studies for people with weak handshakes was 67 percent higher than for people with a firm grip. The slowest walkers were nearly three times more likely to die during the study period than swifter walkers. The people who were slowest to get up from a chair had about double the death rate compared to the quick risers. \\"Those people in the general population who have higher physical capability levels are likely to live longer,\\" Cooper said. Question: What does Cooper think about the measures of physical capability? - They are of little help to doctors. - They can't be used as a screening tool. - They can be applied to medical practice. - They are potentially beneficial to people.

Step 2: Analyze the impact of vomiting on blood sugar regulation Vomiting causes a loss of ingested nutrients, including carbohydrates, which are a primary source of glucose for the body. When food is thrown up, the body's blood sugar levels do not increase as expected since the glucose from digested food is not absorbed. Step 3: Relate vomiting to the given process of blood sugar regulation Based on the given process, the body would have a decreased need for regulating blood sugar levels after vomiting because the anticipated increase in blood sugar does not occur, and the body has less demand for counteracting that increase.

First, let's add up the \\"d\\" terms on the right side of the equation: 1299*d + 242*d = (1299 + 242) * d = 1541*d Now our equation looks like this: -418*d - 20993 = 1541*d - 224729. Next, we want to move all the \\"d\\" terms to one side of the equation. We can do this by adding 418*d to both sides. (-418*d + 418*d) - 20993 = 1541*d + 418*d - 224729 -20993 = 1959*d - 224729 Now let's move the number term on the left side to the right side by adding 20993 to both sides of the equation: -20993 + 20993 = 1959*d - 224729 + 20993 0 = 1959*d - 203736 Now we just need to find \\"d\\" by dividing both sides by 1959: 0 / 1959 = (1959*d - 203736) / 1959 0 = d - 104 Last step, we add 104 to both sides to get the value of \\"d\\": 0 + 104 = d - 104 + 104 So, d = 104 And there you have it!

Why may the narrator be experiencing sunburns ?","completion":"The narrator might be experiencing sunburns due to several reasons. Here's my step-by-step justification of the potential reasons: 1. Sun exposure: The narrator might be spending a significant amount of time outdoors, without sufficient protection from the sun. Prolonged exposure to the sun's ultraviolet (UV) rays can cause damage to the skin and lead to sunburn. 2. Fair skin: Individuals with fair or sensitive skin tend to be more susceptible to sunburn due to the lower amount of melanin, which is a skin pigment that provides some protection from the sun. 3. Inadequate sun protection: The narrator may not be using enough sunscreen, not reapplying it frequently enough, or not using a high enough SPF. Additionally, they might not be wearing protective clothing, such as hats, long-sleeved shirts, and sunglasses, or seeking shade when outdoors. 4. Sunburn history: If the narrator has had sunburns before, their skin might be more sensitive to sun exposure, increasing the likelihood of getting sunburned again. 5. Geography and climate: The narrator might be in a geographical location with intense sun or at higher altitudes, which exposes them to stronger UV radiation. Some places have stronger sun exposure throughout the year, making it easier to get sunburned. 6. Water and reflection: The narrator might be spending time near water, such as at the beach, pool, or a lake, where the sun's rays can reflect, intensifying their exposure to UV radiation and increasing the risk of sunburn. By analyzing these potential factors, it is apparent that the narrator may be experiencing sunburns due to a combination of sun exposure, skin type, inadequate protection, sunburn history, geographical location, and activities involving water and reflection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Act I: Three sisters, Sarah, an uptight businesswoman, Emily, a free-spirited artist, and Lily, a shy writer, gather at the old family farmhouse for their father's funeral. Family lawyer Mr. Thomas reveals their father's will, stating that the sisters will equally inherit a large sum of money and the family property – but only if the sisters live together in the farmhouse for one full year. Act II: Sarah, Emily, and Lily reluctantly agree to the terms, setting aside their vastly different lifestyles and personal conflicts. They move into the farmhouse, eager to claim their shares but soon struggling to adapt while under the same roof. They set house rules, create boundaries, and attempt to communicate. Emily, who feels restricted by their structured lives, and Sarah, who disapproves of Emily's carefree ways, clash the most. Lily, caught in the middle, is forced out of her comfort zone to mediate her sisters' disagreements. Their unresolved feelings from the past surface as perspectives and expectations come to light. While rebuilding the house, the trio stumbles upon a box containing mementos from their childhood, including a diary their mother wrote before passing away. This intimate side of their parents softens their hearts and helps them to empathize with each other.

To combine them, simply add their coefficients (i.e., 28 and 25): (28 + 25)*v = 53*v The equation now becomes: 53*v = 0 Step 2: Resolve for the variable In order to isolate \\"v\\" and find its value, you need to divide both sides of the equation by the coefficient of v, which is 53: 53*v / 53 = 0 / 53 The division of 53*v by 53 results in: v = 0 / 53 Now, since any number divided by zero is zero, we have: v = 0 Step 3: Verify the solution You might want to verify your solution by plugging it back into the original equation and checking if the equation holds true. By substituting the calculated value of v (v = 0) into the original equation: 28*v + 25*v = 0 28*(0) + 25*(0) = 0 0 + 0 = 0 0 = 0 The equation holds true; therefore, the solution v = 0 is valid and correct.

Article: Jurors will now decide whether the Aurora movie theater gunman should be given the death penalty CENTENNIAL — James Holmes is guilty of murder for killing 12 people in an Aurora movie theater three years ago, a jury decided Thursday, ending the legal limbo for one of the worst mass shootings in American history. In count after emphatic count, jurors rejected the defense's argument that what happened at the Century Aurora 16 theater on July 20, 2012, was a tragic act of insanity. It was a deliberate crime, jurors said. Holmes now faces possible execution as punishment. The jury of nine women and three men found Holmes guilty of 24 counts of first-degree murder — two for each victim slain — as well as 134 counts of first-degree attempted murder, six counts of attempted second-degree murder and one count of explosives possession. In the wood-paneled courtroom before the verdict was read, tension pulled the spectators taut. Parents who lost their children in the attack held hands with clenched grips. Holmes' parents leaned stiffly against one another, a box of tissues resting on Robert Holmes' lap. Then, over a single, unrelenting hour in Arapahoe County courtroom 201, Judge Carlos Samour Jr. called out the word \\"guilty\\" 165 times — all but one time attaching to the verdict the name of someone whose life was irrevocably altered during the shooting. Count 1. Murder in the first degree after deliberation — Jonathan Blunk. \\"We the jury,\\" Samour read from the verdict form, \\"find the defendant, James Eagan Holmes, guilty.\\" Advertisement And in the audience, family members of the victims pressed their hands over their mouths to stifle outcries of relief because — after a wait of nearly three years — they finally knew the man who killed their loved ones would never go free again. Emotions pinged across the courtroom as Samour continued reading. Count 4. Guilty. Brooke Cowden softly closed her eyes at the recognition of justice for her father, Gordon, who took her to the movies that night and whose body she had to step over to escape the gunfire. Count 5. Guilty. Sandy Phillips pressed to her lips the green scarf she wore every day during the trial, the one that belonged to her slain daughter, Jessica Ghawi. The scarf made her feel like Jessi was giving her a hug, Phillips said. Count 6. Guilty. Kathleen Larimer crumpled forward in her chair, then leaned back and let the tears for her son, John, wash over her cheeks. At long last, she exhaled. Count 11. Guilty. Tom Teves held his wife's hand tightly and glared forward at the man who took his son, Alex, from him. Aurora shooting victim Caleb Medley, in wheelchair and his wife Katie, middle, with their baby boy Hugo arrive at the Arapahoe County Justice Center in Centennial, Colorado on July 16, 2015. (Helen H. Richardson, The Denver Post) Samour just kept reading. Count 12. \\"We the jury...\\" Count 35. \\" ... find the defendant ... \\" Count 98. \\" ... James Eagan Holmes ... \\" Count 165. \\" ... guilty.\\" Shooting survivor Joshua Nowlan, wearing a short-sleeve shirt that revealed the bullet scar on his right arm, waited 50 counts to hear the first of the charges pertaining to him. Guilty. He closed his eyes and nodded his head in stoic approval. At the judge's command, the defendant stood for the length of the verdict's reading. Holmes — now 27, bearded and several pounds heavier than the red-haired wisp who shuffled into the same courtroom for his first appearance — put his hands in his pockets and appeared to show little emotion. In the second row of chairs behind him, his parents stared blankly at the seatbacks in front of them. Tom Sullivan, father Aurora theater shooting victim Alex Sullivan reacts to the theater trial verdict. (Andy Cross, The Denver Post) Throughout the trial, prosecutors argued that the shooting, planned for months in advance, was a calculated act by a selfish man who wanted to kill others to make himself feel better. Holmes, a former neuroscience graduate student at the University of Colorado, had recently broken up with his girlfriend, failed a crucial exam and dropped out of school. The defense countered that the shooting was the result of a delusional belief by Holmes — who has been diagnosed repeatedly with some form of schizophrenia — that killing would boost his \\"human capital.\\" They painted him as a man controlled by his thoughts. It took jurors less than 13 hours of deliberating over two days to make up their minds. At least part of that time was spent filling out paperwork, as the foreman — a survivor of the Columbine High School shooting — had to sign his name 329 times on the 659 pages of verdict forms. When the jury gathered in the courtroom around 4 p.m., the foreman delivered the verdict to Samour in five manila envelopes. One juror appeared to wipe tears from her eyes. Another looked out into the victims' side of the courtroom gallery. For each of the 12 slain victims and the 70 wounded victims, Holmes was found guilty of two counts. One count alleged first-degree murder or attempted murder after deliberation. The other alleged first-degree murder or attempted murder with extreme indifference. The only variation in the jury's verdict came from three survivors who were sitting in an adjacent theater to Theater No. 9, where the shooting took place. Jurors found them the victims of attempted second-degree murder after they were wounded by bullets that burst through the wall. Jurors also convicted Holmes of possessing explosives, which he rigged with gunpowder and gasoline and homemade napalm for what he later told authorities was intended to be a fire that would divert authorities away from the theater. The case now moves to a death penalty sentencing phase. On Monday, the third anniversary of the shooting, prosecutors and defense attorneys will return to court to debate legal issues surrounding Colorado's death penalty procedures — which haven't been used at trial since 2009, when a jury in Arapahoe County sentenced Robert Ray to death. Jurors will return again to the courtroom on Wednesday for the start of the sentencing phase, which could last several weeks and will likely include a new deluge of emotional testimony — from victims, from survivors, from the parents of the convicted, all hoping for a ray of justice. On Thursday, as Samour read the verdict, rain began falling outside the courthouse — one of those Colorado storms where it pours and the sun shines at the same moment. Then it cleared, and a rainbow bloomed just out of reach in the distance. \\"I think it's a relief, but it's sad,\\" said Katie Medley, standing outside the courthouse after the verdict. She was wounded during the shooting; her husband, Caleb, was paralyzed. \\"We were in a room full of people that lost their sons and daughters.\\" John Ingold: 303-954-1068, jingold@denverpost.com or twitter.com/johningold Staff writers Jesse Paul, Noelle Phillips and John Aguilar contributed to this report. ||||| CENTENNIAL, Colo.

The verdict means the 27-year-old former neuroscience graduate student could get the death penalty for the 2012 shooting. Jurors reached their decision Thursday after deliberating for about 13 hours over two days. They must now decide whether Holmes should be executed or sent to prison for life without the possibility of parole. Holmes pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity, and his attorneys argued he was so addled by mental illness that he was unable to tell right from wrong at the time of the shootings.

Father k. eventually left the sacristy, leaving myself and the other boy alone with Father. D. who was the associate pastor and the priest who was in charge of the altar boys. Father D. accused me and the other boy of stealing altar wine, which was not true. He told us we had two options: we could be thrown off the altar boys and expelled from school. Or he could punish us himself. Both of us chose the former, but the priest had already decided on the later. He led us to a walk in closet, located behind the sacristy where he had us both remove all of our clothes. He locked us in the closet while he went around and locked all the doors to the Church so he would not be disturbed. When he returned, we were led out to the sacristy completely naked. Since I was the youngest, he chose me to be punished first. He had me lay across his lap while he proceeded to spank my bare bottom.","completion":"Output: sexual-explicit Justification: The comment includes explicit descriptions of a situation involving nudity and punishment.

To elaborate further, the evaporation of sweat plays a vital role in regulating our body temperature. When the moisture on the skin's surface evaporates, it removes a considerable amount of excess heat from the body, thus effectively cooling it down. It's essential for proper functioning that our body maintains a stable temperature, usually around 98.6°F or 37°C. This optimal temperature may vary slightly from person to person. Once the body has achieved its optimal temperature through the evaporation process, the thermoregulatory center in the hypothalamus of the brain will detect the change. This center continuously monitors the body's internal and external conditions to maintain balance, also known as homeostasis. When the body has cooled sufficiently, the hypothalamus sends signals to the blood vessels and sweat glands to constrict and deactivate, respectively. As a result, blood flow to the skin is reduced, thereby conserving heat. The sweat glands stop producing and releasing sweat, limiting further moisture evaporation, and moisture on the skin's surface. If the body's temperature rises again or external conditions change, the hypothalamus will reinitiate the heat loss process by signaling the dilation of blood vessels and the activation of sweat glands accordingly. In summary, the final step after moisture evaporation is the body achieving thermoregulation and homeostasis, leading to a state of balance and, if necessary, the deactivation of sweat glands to conserve heat and energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where normal voice transitions to falsetto, there will be a break or voiceless gap in your tone. You’ll have to vocally jump back-and-forth across this break when yodeling. Your normal voice will vibrate your chest and have a mellow sound. The break occurs where your normal voice transitions up to breathier, shriller, non-chest vibrating tone, which is your falsetto. This might sound painful, but it won’t hurt your voice at all. Pick a vowel sound, such as \\"oh,\\" and move your voice from a low rumble to as high as you can. Try that in reverse now. At some point between your chest voice and falsetto, you’ll hear the break. The point at which your voice breaks will be unique to you. If you're having trouble finding yours, slowly descend from a high-pitched siren-like “Aow” until you feel the tone vibrate in your chest. You might be surprised at how much this works out your vocal chords. Keep relaxed and take frequent breaks, especially if your voice feels tired or overworked. Practice moving from low to high notes, making sure to emphasize the break. Since yodeling alternates between consonants and vowel sounds, you might practice by singing a mid-range note in your chest as \\"Yoh,\\" then jump up to a high note in falsetto using \\"Dee.\\" Emphasize the break between chest voice and falsetto when you practice. Unlike other styles, where singers try to move smoothly from one note to the next, the break is essential for yodeling. Once you get the hang of it, the alternating consonant/vowel pattern of yodeling will come second nature. But until that day comes, you can use the following knock-knock joke when practicing: Knock-knock. Who's there? Little old lady. Little-old-lady-WHO! Practice your yodel by singing \\"little-old-lady-WHO.\\" Jump from chest voice to falsetto between \\"lady\\" and \\"who.\\" Most styles of yodeling are founded around three notes: the triad. Try singing the notes middle A, E, then D to form a triad yodel. The A should be sung in your chest voice, while the E and D notes should be sung in your head voice. You can listen to a reference to the tones for middle A, E, and D online, on an instrument tuner, a pitch pipe, or on instruments that hold tone well (like a piano). Once you've mastered the triad, try putting the word \\"yodel\\" in front of it to sing \\"yodel - A (Ay) - E (Ee) - D (Dee)!\\" Try singing the same \\"yodel-A-E-D\\" pattern you did previously for each note on an eight-note scale. Sing your triad on middle C, then move up to middle D. Continue to scale up until you transition to high C, eight notes above where you started. This may be easiest to do with an instrument playing the root note (starting note) of the triad as you sing it. What is a summary?","completion":"Yodeling is a way of singing where you switch between your normal voice (chest voice) and a high voice (falsetto). You need to find the break between these two voices and practice jumping from low to high notes. You can try a knock-knock joke or sing a pattern of three notes, called a triad, to practice yodeling. An example of triad yodel is singing A, E, and D notes while switching between chest voice and falsetto. Keep practicing and listen to instruments or tools to find the right tones for each note."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Many songs, poems, and books have been written on love's strong effect on people. The state of being in love has even been compared to being sick or mad. A study by Professor Semir Zeki of University College London has found that love does affect people's brains by making them feel great. Zeki studied young men and women who had recently fallen in love. He found that, when they were looking at photos of their loved ones, there was heightened activity in four areas of their brains. These areas deal with emotions, and one of them, in particular, is known to respond to drugs that cause feelings of great joy and excitement. Interestingly, the study also found a lack of activity in two other areas of the brain when the volunteers looked at their lovers' photographs. One of these areas is linked to feelings of sadness, while the other is often active in people suffering from depression. It seems love really can be _ . The state of being in love, according to some scientists, may actually be good for your health. Although scientists know that being in love can make a person feel great, the exact influence of love on a person's health is harder to determine. However, scientists say that people do need love in order to live healthy lives. According to Dr. Thomas Lewis, people need to be in relationships because that is how we are designed. He says the brain can only maintain the overall stability of a person's immune system, bodily rhythms, and heart if it receives input from outside the body in the form of emotional connections with others. Professor Antonio Damasio has a similar view. He says that love enriches a person's imagination and creativity, and makes a person's body work better. He also believes that love can even improve the body's ability to fight against disease. Damasio's wise words of advice are \\" Choose love and you will live longer.\\" Question: The main idea of this passage is _ . - love can really cause people active - love has effect on songs and books - love is linked with emotion - love is what we need Answer:","completion":"love is what we need"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Braves closer Craig Kimbrel, who had not surrendered a single earned run in July or August, carried a 4.76 ERA in September with three blown saves. After being dominant in his role for much of the season, Braves setup man Jonny Venters posted a 5.11 September ERA.

Summarize: Words are great, but pictures say much more. Include as many pictures, graphs, tables, charts, diagrams, etc., as possible. Keep your backgrounds (i.e., whatever is behind your graphics and text) simple and subtle. Reading the text that is on top of a colourful or complex background can be difficult and distracting. Try to print as many of your graphics in colour as possible, especially graphs and charts where the colour distinguishes between different items or variables. If you don't have access to a colour printer, you can use markers or crayons to add color to things like graphs and charts. Each visual item (graph, chart, table, diagram, picture, etc.) should have its own number (or letter), plus a descriptive caption. When the main text refers to a specific visual item, that number or letter should be used. The caption should accurately and quickly describe what is contained in the visual item, and can be printed in slightly smaller font (less than 16 pt). Your main text and captions should include the technical or scientific names, terms and jargon for the discipline your project is based on. If necessary, you can also include a glossary of terms on your display board or in your project report. Using the proper terms is especially important if your project is being displayed in a science fair or event that is being judged by professionals. If your project is really complex, you can also include a 'layman's summary' as part of your display which sums up your project in language anyone can understand. This is particularly useful if your display board is also being viewed by fellow students, parents, or non-professionals. It can be tempting to get really creative and eccentric when creating a project display board, but try to avoid the temptation! A good project display board is one that is uncluttered, has easy-to-read and clear material, contains graphics that effectively explain your project, and colours that don't overwhelm the viewer. Search the web for example display boards to get an idea of what works well, and what doesn't. Ask your teacher for advice on what to do and not to do, and for examples of project boards that previously received awesome grades. Display boards come in a standard size of 36” tall and 48” wide. You can buy or make larger (or smaller) boards, but make sure the size is not only appropriate for your display but also allowed by the event (if such rules exist). These display boards have three panels - the middle panel which is half the width of the whole board, and the two outside panels that are a quarter of the width each. The two outside panels can fold over the middle panel to close the board for transport. And the outside panels can be used to stand the whole display board upright on a table. You can find display boards at online retailers like Amazon.com or at your local school supply store. Bigger is not always better. Boards that are really tall or really wide may be difficult to read and/or contain too much information.","completion":"To create an effective project display board, include many visual elements like pictures, graphs, tables, and charts.

Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: Some people really loved beer, they call it what gold? Possible A: alcohol in, intoxicating, liquid, hair of the dog, harmful Why is \\"liquid\\" an answer aligned with human common sense?","completion":"Step 1: Understand the context of the question The question is asking why \\"liquid\\" is a sensible answer to a question about a term used by people who really love beer. The provided possible answers are related to beer but vary in their relevance to the \\"gold\\" term. Step 2: Examine the possible answers - alcohol in: This answer seems incomplete and doesn't correspond with the term \\"gold.\\" - intoxicating: Although beer can be intoxicating, this does not directly align with the term \\"gold.\\" - liquid: This answer acknowledges the physical state of beer, but we need to assess its relevance to the term \\"gold.\\" - hair of the dog: This phrase refers to consuming more alcohol in an attempt to reduce a hangover, but it doesn't refer to beer as a type of gold. - harmful: While excessive alcohol consumption can be harmful, this doesn't directly correlate with the term \\"gold.\\" Step 3: Assess \\"liquid\\" in comparison to other possible answers \\"Liquid\\" is a common-sense answer because it directly relates to the properties of beer as a consumable beverage. When people mention \\"liquid gold,\\" it is a metaphor for the appreciation and value that they assign to beer, knowing that it is a liquid by nature. Step 4: Justify the selection of \\"liquid\\" as a common-sense answer Comparatively, \\"liquid\\" is the most straightforward and sensible response to the question of what gold-like term people who really love beer might use due to its direct reference to the properties of beer. Other answers might touch on aspects related to beer or alcohol consumption, but \\"liquid\\" clearly and appropriately connects the term \\"gold\\" to the actual state of beer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"To be able to answer this question accurately, we need to gather relevant information about both Rocky Shades and Coko, and then evaluate their origins based on that information. Rocky Shades is an English singer who was a member of the bands Wrathchild and The Wildhearts during the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was born on January 5, 1960, in the West Midlands, a densely populated region in England, United Kingdom. Over the years, he gained fame as the lead singer of Wrathchild, which was a popular British glam rock band. Later on, he joined The Wildhearts, another British rock band, but his stint in the group was short-lived, as he eventually went on to pursue a solo career. On the other hand, Coko, whose real name is Cheryl Elizabeth Gamble, is an American singer. She is best known as the lead vocalist for the popular R&B group Sisters With Voices (SWV), which was formed in 1990. Coko was born on June 13, 1970, in The Bronx, New York City, in the United States. Throughout her career, she has released solo projects, singles, and has collaborated with other artists. SWV has gained international success, and their vocal talents have garnered critical acclaim. Now, to combine our gathered facts and answer the question: Are Rocky Shades and Coko both from the United States? The answer is no, they are not both from the United States. Rocky Shades is from the West Midlands, England, United Kingdom, while Coko is from The Bronx, New York City, United States.

I was under full custody of my father living in a trailer in very rural Tennessee (Wayne County) with no electricity and a wood burning stove for heat.

The lineup remained largely the same from the Self-Destruct tour, featuring Finck, Clouser, and Lohner. To replace long-time member Vrenna, Reznor held open auditions to find a new drummer, eventually picking then-unknown Jerome Dillon. Dillon would remain a member of the live band until 2005. Nine Inch Nails' record label at the time, Interscope Records, reportedly refused to fund the promotional tour following The Fragile's lukewarm sales.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What is probably true about the author? Options: - He/she is a chef - He/she works out vigorously - He/she is very health conscious - not enough information Answer:","completion":"He/she is very health conscious"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you type or get the standard deviation symbol in MS Word? How do I get a spiral or coil type text in MS Word? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Your questions are notably different as each pertains to distinct features in Microsoft Word. 1. Typing or getting the standard deviation symbol (sigma, σ or Σ, depending on lowercase or uppercase and whether it's population or sample standard deviation) in Microsoft Word There are several methods to inserting the sigma symbol. Here's a comprehensive guide: (a) Using the Symbol Dialog Box Microsoft Word features a large library of symbols, including the sigma symbol. Follow the steps below: i. Open Microsoft Word. ii. Click on the location where you'd like the sigma symbol to be inserted. iii. Go to the 'Insert' tab on the ribbon. iv. Click on 'Symbol' in the 'Symbols' group. v. In the drop-down box, select 'More Symbols'. vi. In the 'Symbol' dialog box, select 'Greek and Coptic' as the subset. vii. Find the sigma symbol (either lowercase 'σ' or uppercase 'Σ'). viii. Click on the 'Insert' button. ix. Once done, click the 'Close' button to close the dialog box. The sigma symbol should now be inserted into your Word document. (b) Using Unicode Values Each symbol in Word has a unique code. You can use this \\"Alt code\\" to insert the symbol. For lowercase sigma (σ), it is, '03C3' and for uppercase sigma (Σ), it is '03A3': i. Click where you want to insert the sigma symbol. ii. Type '03C3' (for a lower-case sigma) or '03A3' (for an upper-case sigma). iii. Press Alt+X on your keyboard just after the code. The code will convert to the sigma symbol. (c) Using Keyboard Shortcuts There's a keyboard shortcut for the sigma symbol: i. Click where you want to insert the sigma symbol. ii. Press the following: - For uppercase sigma (Σ), press Shift+Ctrl+Y - For lowercase sigma (σ), press Ctrl+Shift+Q 2. Creating a spiral or coil type text in MS Word Creating a spiral or coil type text isn’t a standard feature of MS Word, but you can create it using WordArt combined with Text Effects. Here's how: i. Open Microsoft Word. ii. Click on the 'Insert' tab on the ribbon. iii. Click on 'WordArt' in the 'Text' group. Select any text style that suits you. iv. Write the text that you want to turn into spiral or coil shape. v. With the text box selected, go to the 'Format' tab. vi. In the 'WordArt Styles' group, click on 'Text Effects'. vii. Point to 'Transform', and then select any of the 'Follow Path' transformations that are close to spiral or coil form. You'll notice there isn't a perfect spiral shape; the one that closest matches a spiral condition is the 'Circle' under 'Follow Path'. viii. You can rotate, resize and reposition the WordArt object to your liking. In summary, the questions you asked are different. The first concerns inserting a mathematical symbol, the standard deviation, while the second describes creating a text style, specifically spiral or coil-shaped text."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The hosts of the Kumite are rehearsing pageantry and preparing the arena for proper use.Frank Dux (Jean-Claude Van Damme), an army captain at his base, is summoned to a meeting with his colonel before going on furlough. The colonel has found out he plans to travel to Hong Kong while on furlough, and Dux's superiors want to stop him from entering the Kumite, in part because the Kumite is an illegal, underground fight. It is not sanctioned by world martial arts organizations, due to its particularly violent nature. Fatalities, though uncommon and frowned on, are considered part of the risk. Dux stages a daring escape from his base, going AWOL to travel to Hong Kong. The Army dispatches two MPs, Helmer (Norman Burton) and Rawlins (Forest Whitaker) to find Dux and bring him back.Dux first visits the home of his mentor and teacher, Senzo Tanaka (Roy Chiao). He is greeted warmly by Mrs. Tanaka (Lily Leung), who goes to tell her husband that Dux has arrived. Waiting in the living room, Dux becomes lost in thought looking at Tanaka's katana (samurai sword). He begins reminiscing about his long relationship with Tanaka: As a youth, Frank fell in with two unruly boys who made him come with them to try and steal the sword. The boys ran at the sound of people approaching, but Frank started to put the sword back on its stand when he was found by Tanaka and his son, Shingo. Tanaka admonished Dux for stealing, and Dux protested he wasn't going to steal it. Tanaka slices the visor off of Dux's baseball cap and is impressed that Dux didn't even flinch. Meeting with Dux's parents, he convinces them to let him train Frank in martial arts. At first, the young Dux becomes frustrated that he is only learning some of Tanaka's knowledge while Shingo is being trained far more intensively. Shingo is being groomed to represent his family...

It might be a little erroneous to open a review by describing a film in terms of other films, but I think it's the best way to give an approximation of the place Election occupies in the gangster genre arena. It works somewhere in between The Godfather and Kinji Fukasaku's yakuza opus The Yakuza Papers (AKA Battles Without Honour and Humanity), in that it is simultaneously both romanticized and realistic, dark and gritty. But it's also a Johnnie To film, and as such it carries the distinct touch of the Hong Kong auteur. Every two years the HK Triad elects a new boss. Only this time one of the candidates is not overly happy with the result so he decides to take matters into his own hands much to the dismay of the rest of the Triads and the police. That's the story in a nutshell but rest assured it has a lot more going for it than that. As in The Yakuza Papers, there's a great deal of scheming, back-stabbing and forming and switching of allegiances (sometimes all it takes is a phone call - in one of the most memorable scenes I've seen in recent time) which might not necessarily make for deep drama but makes for an interesting plot and good character conflict. Fans of the gangster genre are likely to appreciate it in that aspect. Election is not as action-oriented as one might expect; although it IS violent. And I'm not talking about the glossy, glamour version of Hollywood violence. This is dark and grim. To's camera lingers in the scenes of people being brutalized in ways that reveal both the humanity and inhumanity of the perpetrators and victims; after all violence IS an integral part of us whether we like it or not. If you're familiar with To's style, then you should know what to expect. The pacing is relatively slow and deliberate. The cinematography is great, slick and dark in equal measures, utilizing dark hues (brown, dark green and orange) while the smooth tracking shots add a vibrant quality to it. In the end, Election occupies a peculiar place. It's not exactly a character study and it's not an action-oriented gangster film. It explores a situation (the election and its aftermath), but does so in style, and is both realistic and romanticized (the Triad ceremonies in particular echo of an oriental Godfather).

Stay as close to the actual cap size as possible, because you will eventually place your vodka bottle inside the hole that you’ve carved, and you want the fit to be snug so there are no leaks. Take the vodka cap off the watermelon, and use the knife to cut and follow the traced circle you just made. Place the knife point down on the edge of the circle and insert the knife about halfway. Cut out this piece as if you were carving a pumpkin.Continue cutting around the traced circle until the entire circle is carved around. Use the knife to pry at the plug by inserting the knife at the cut edges, and bringing the knife down, underneath the plug, to create a 45-degree angle. This will create a wedge that can pop the watermelon plug out of the carved hole. Refrigerate the watermelon plug in a re-sealable plastic bag so that you can reinsert it later. Save the vodka bottle cap to seal the vodka later. Scoop out enough watermelon flesh with a spoon or melon scooper to create a hole deep enough that the vodka bottle neck can fit fully into the watermelon. Be careful of watermelon juice and pulp splashing. This can make your workspace wet and sticky. Stand the watermelon upright so it’s length is perpendicular to the surface space you are working on. Carefully tilt the watermelon on its side to meet the opened vodka bottle, and insert the bottle into the hole in the watermelon. The entire bottle neck should be able to fit in the watermelon hole. If you have a friend nearby, they can hold the watermelon up and in the air a little bit and guide it to meet you, holding the opened vodka bottle. Your vodka bottle will be at about a 90 degree angle to you, and parallel to your work space when you insert the bottle. Rotate the watermelon until it is back on a resting position on your work space, with the vodka bottle now upright and centered. Leave the watermelon to absorb the vodka for at least 12 hours.The vodka should absorb about half, to the whole bottle of vodka. Remove the bottle of vodka once the watermelon has absorbed all the alcohol. Insert the watermelon plug back into the hole and place in the refrigerator (with the vodka hole facing upward), if you are not planning on cutting and serving the water immediately. If you are planning on using the watermelon immediately, cut up the watermelon, and serve. You can cut the watermelon into wedges, or peel it and cut it into cubes. Summary:","completion":"Create a vodka-infused watermelon by carving a hole in its center, inserting a vodka bottle, allowing the fruit to absorb the alcohol for 12 hours, and serving chilled."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Barbara Hulanicki founded which chain of fashion shops, famous in the 1960s????","completion":"Barbara Hulanicki founded the iconic chain of fashion shops known as \\"Biba,\\" which rose to fame in the 1960s. Born in Poland, Hulanicki eventually moved to England, where she began her career as a fashion illustrator. In 1964, she launched Biba, which started as a small mail-order clothing business operated out of the flat she shared with her husband, Stephen Fitz-Simon. The name \\"Biba\\" emerged from Hulanicki's nickname for her younger sister, Biruta, with whom she was very close. More than just a fashion store, Biba aimed to create a complete lifestyle experience for customers. The fashion boutique grew into a brand that embodied the essence of London's youth culture and the unique style of the \\"swinging sixties.\\" The first brick-and-mortar Biba store opened in Abingdon Road, Kensington, in 1964. Hulanicki's fashionable designs were an instant hit among young women, who flocked to the store for diverse, unconventional, and affordable clothing. The store's interior was visually striking, with art nouveau-inspired architecture, dark interiors, rich fabrics, and whimsical décor. Over time, Biba expanded to various locations, ultimately taking over a seven-story building on Kensington High Street known as \\"Big Biba.\\" This flagship store opened in 1973 and was a shopping extravaganza that offered everything a customer could desire, including clothing, accessories, cosmetics, homeware, furniture, and even food. It even featured pet flamingos named Odile and Odette, who were there to enthrall customers. Moreover, Biba was frequented by celebrities, including Mick Jagger, Marianne Faithfull, Twiggy, and David Bowie, which further amplified the brand's global recognition. The fashion label was known for its earthy, rich colors, unique prints, and stylish detailing. At the height of its popularity, Biba helped define the overall look of London in that era, with mini skirts, maxi dresses, and flared trousers becoming staples of the time. Unfortunately, Biba faced several business challenges, including financial difficulties and disputes among the shareholders. As a result, the brand closed its doors in 1975. However, its influence on the world of fashion and popular culture remains undeniable. Even after the original Biba shuttered, Barbara Hulanicki continued working as a successful fashion designer and consultant for several well-known brands and retailers around the world, such as Fiorucci, Cacharel, and Topshop. Despite its relatively short-lived lifespan, Biba's legendary status as a symbol of 1960's fashion and London's youth culture endures to this day."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Hundreds of thousands of years before China was to become the world's longest-running civilization, the prologue was enacted by means of the flicker of a carefully tended fire. Peking Man, a forebear of Homo sapiens, achieved a mastery of fire. We might call it the first Chinese invention. Not that he devised flint and steel, matches, or any other way of creating fire. Peking Man simply learned how to capture flame, perhaps from a forest fire, and keep it alight. He thus enjoyed two revolutionary luxuries: light and heat. Technologically and sociologically, it was a phenomenal breakthrough: with fire, communities could live year 'round in one cave, in which cooking and even smelting could be pursued. And so, by 600,000 b.c., about 50 km (31 miles) southwest of present-day Beijing, the ancestors of mankind were ready to settle down. Several hundred thousand years later, when Marco Polo reached the capital of China, he was astonished by a further development in fire technology. The Chinese, he announced, used black stones dug out of mountains as fuel. Europeans did not yet have a word for \\"coal,\\" nor had they discovered a use for it. The First Dynasty The confluence of mythology and history in China took place around 4,000 years ago during what is referred to as the Xia (Hsia) Dynasty. This was still the Stone Age, but the people are thought to have made silk from thread produced by the worms they cultivated on the leaves of their mulberry trees. And written language (which evolved as early as 4,500 to 5,000 years ago) was already in use, originally by oracles and then by official scribes — China's first scholars. During the second of the quasi-legendary dynasties, the Shang (from about the 16th to 11th centuries b.c.), the Chinese developed an interest in art. Careful geometric designs as well as dragon and bird motifs adorned bowls and implements. And with the arrival of the Bronze Age, the Chinese created bronze vessels of such beauty and originality that, until modern times, archaeologists refused to believe they were cast 3,000 years ago. The Shang Dynasty gave rise to the concept of one Chinese nation under one government. After reading the above, is \\"Light and heat\\" the correct answer to the question \\"Where did man get fire and what luxuries did it provide?\\"?","completion":"Yes, you are correct! According to the text, Peking Man, an ancestor of Homo sapiens and a part of the early civilization in what is now China, learned how to capture and maintain fire. This fire provided several benefits, the most important of which were light and heat. These two advantages from fire were revolutionary at the time because they allowed communities to live all year round in one cave, carry on activities like cooking, and even made early attempts at smelting. So, when asked about the luxuries fire provided, saying \\"light and heat\\" would be absolutely right!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The synthesis of urea by Friedrich Wöhler opened a new research field, organic chemistry, and by the end of the 19th century, scientists were able to synthesize hundreds of organic compounds. The later part of the 19th century saw the exploitation of the Earth's petrochemicals, after the exhaustion of the oil supply from whaling. By the 20th century, systematic production of refined materials provided a ready supply of products which provided not only energy, but also synthetic materials for clothing, medicine, and everyday disposable resources. Application of the techniques of organic chemistry to living organisms resulted in physiological chemistry, the precursor to biochemistry. The 20th century also saw the integration of physics and chemistry, with chemical properties explained as the result of the electronic structure of the atom. Linus Pauling's book on The Nature of the Chemical Bond used the principles of quantum mechanics to deduce bond angles in ever-more complicated molecules. Pauling's work culminated in the physical modelling of DNA, the secret of life (in the words of Francis Crick, 1953). In the same year, the Miller–Urey experiment demonstrated in a simulation of primordial processes, that basic constituents of proteins, simple amino acids, could themselves be built up from simpler molecules.

Voc: / Cornetto / 3 Trombon. / 2 Violini / 2 Viole / con / Continuo / Di Sign. Joh.Seb.Bach\\", In this late version, Bach scored the work for four vocal parts (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T), and bass (B)), and a Baroque instrumental ensemble consisting of strings, brass and continuo. The brass parts, a choir of cornetto (Ct) and three trombones (Tb) playing colla parte with the voices at times, may have been added in the 1720s. They may also possibly represent the original scoring, in the style of the 17th-century polychoral tradition.The scoring of the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden has been described as \\"archaic\\" and its style \\"medieval\\": The string section consists of two violin parts (Vl) and two viola parts (VA); this indicates an older practice as for instance found in 17th-century church cantatas by Bach's ancestors (see Altbachisches Archiv), and in Jesus Christus ist um unsrer Missetat willen verwundet, a Passion setting from the early 18th century (or older) which Bach had performed a few years after composing the cantata Christ lag in Todes Banden. In the first half of the 18th century the standard for a string section soon evolved to two violin parts, one viola part and continuo. The cornett used in the cantata was an instrument that belonged to an earlier age: by the second quarter of the 18th century it had almost entirely disappeared from Bach's compositions. The brass instruments were only used for the 1 April 1725 version of the work. The other performances (24 April 1707, 8 April 1708, and 9 April 1724) were performed without brass instruments (i.e., Cornetto and three Trombones).

Wendy Purcell, pictured, was suspended on full pay last summer after she commissioned seven custom-made chairs costing £95,000. A university chief accused of wasteful spending has been allowed to return to work on her full £250,000 salary despite having her role drastically downgraded. Professor Wendy Purcell was suspended as vice-chancellor of Plymouth University after commissioning seven custom-made chairs costing £95,000. She was also criticised over a three-day trip to Miami, when she stayed in a luxury boutique hotel and spent £3,500 on business-class flights. Another report claimed she ran up a £15,000 expenses bill for first-class train travel. Miss Purcell was suspended on full pay last summer but returned to work as Plymouth’s vice-chancellor and president in November. However, she did not resume her duties running the university and it was announced last week that she is now president only, with her former deputy now the interim vice-chancellor. Despite her much reduced responsibilities, Freedom of Information requests from the Times Higher Education journal have revealed that Miss Purcell has returned to work on full pay. The university said: ‘The vice-chancellor’s present salary is £250,000, the same as in 2013/14.’ It refused to say whether Miss Purcell’s pay would be cut now she will not be vice-chancellor. Disclosures also show that the university has run up a £270,000 legal bill over the matter. The university did not reply to requests for a comment. The news will pile further pressure on Plymouth over its handling of several months of crisis. A second leading figure, retired judge William Taylor, resigned as university chairman last year amid allegations that he sexually harassed female colleagues. He denies the claims. The controversy over Miss Purcell includes claims she was responsible for initiating a project to commission seven hand-crafted ceremonial chairs – costing £13,500 each – to be used at graduation ceremonies. Prof Purcell is no longer the vice-chancellor of Plymouth University, pictured, but remains college president. She was part of a panel that selected designer John Makepeace to lead the project. But news of the £95,000 commission sparked anger among students and staff – despite the university’s insistence that the cost of the furniture would be met through fundraising. The university then said that ‘approval of the project was not sought from the University Executive nor the University Board’. It later said the vice-chancellor decided she wanted no further involvement with the project but ‘did not advise cancellation’. The Plymouth Herald newspaper reported that the university also spent £24,000 sending six staff, including Miss Purcell, on a three-day conference in Miami. It further reported that she had taken a first-class train journey on average once every eight days for three years on expenses. What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"1.

Make the switch from wild play to calming activities like reading a book or singing songs. Shut off the TV just before dinner and don't turn it on until after your toddler has gone to bed. Give your child a warm bath after dinner to help calm both their mind and body. Try adding some lavender soap or use a lavender-infused shampoo, which has calming properties. Decide on a bedtime and make sure you start your nightly routine at the same time each night. After just a week of going to bed at the same time, most children will adjust to this schedule and come to expect it each night. Signal to your child that bedtime is approaching to get them mentally prepared. Give them a bath, brush their teeth, and get out that security blanket or stuffed animal they love. Your child might experience anxiety because they feel they have no control over their bedtime routine. Give them some choices to alleviate this. Limit their options to keep their choices simple. For instance, let them decide which story to read at bedtime. Lay out two sets of pajamas on the bed and allow your toddler to choose which pair to wear each night. During bath time, ask which songs they would like to sing. Before they get into bed, be sure they don’t need anything. Give them a few sips of water so they aren’t thirsty and make sure they’ve used the bathroom. You might also give them a nighttime snack like an apple so they aren’t hungry. Don’t give them too much water if they are potty training. You don’t want to wake up to an accident! If they keep making demands before bed, your toddler may be “fake” crying to get attention because they don't feel like going to sleep. Spending more time together before bed can help your child feel less needy as lights out approaches. Read them a story, talk about their day, and talk about what you’re looking forward to for tomorrow. This can help your two year old feel secure while transitioning to sleeping on their own. Do this for a week, and then begin leaving the room as soon as they are in bed. Stay in the room and perform some simple, silent tasks while they lie in their crib or bed. Fold laundry, balance a checkbook, go through the mail or read a book. Explain to your toddler that you will remain in the room until they fall asleep, but that it's bedtime and not time to play or talk. Your child might not want to be alone because they are afraid of the dark, but this is a simple fix. Get them a night light for their room and leave it on for them so they aren’t scared.","completion":"To establish a calming bedtime routine for your child, begin by easing them into a tranquil atmosphere about an hour before dinner.

Create a consistent bedtime schedule by starting the nightly routine at the same time each day. After a week, most children will adapt and anticipate the schedule. Signal to them that bedtime is near by giving them a bath, brushing their teeth, and providing a comforting item like a stuffed animal. To ease bedtime anxiety and encourage your child's sense of control, offer choices within their nightly routine. Keep these choices simple by limiting the options available. Examples of choices include selecting which bedtime story to read or choosing between two sets of pajamas. During bath time, let your child pick which songs to sing. Before tucking your child in, ensure they are comfortable by addressing any potential needs. Provide a few sips of water (avoiding too much if potty training), ensure they've used the bathroom, and offer a light snack like an apple. If your child seems to be attention-seeking before bedtime, try spending more quality time with them during the evening. Read a story, discuss the day, and talk about tomorrow's plans. After about a week, transition to leaving the room once they are in bed and begin performing small, silent tasks while they fall asleep. Assure your child you will stay nearby until they are asleep, but reinforce that it is bedtime, not playtime or chat time. For children who may be afraid of the dark, consider using a night light in their room to alleviate their fear.

This means that the plant has changed something in its \\"body\\" or \\"habits\\" to make it easier to survive in difficult conditions. There are several conditions they have had to adapted to. First, the soil of the forest floor is shallow. Also, the soil of the rainforest is not very rich, or easy to grow in. Next is the problem of very heavy rain which continues over a large part of the year. Finally, many plants of the rainforest are food for animals that live there. The biggest problem that rainforest plants have to adapt to is the lack of sunlight in the rainforest's lower levels. Plants have adapted to this problem in several ways. Many plants have very large leaves. The large leaf is helpful because it has a bigger surface area. The bigger surface area a leaf has, the more sunlight it can absorb. The canopy trees adapt by growing to be 100 feet tall so that their leaves can grab all available sunlight. Other plants called lianas have adapted by rooting themselves in the soil of the forest floor and growing up the trees until they reach the canopy layer. Still other plants, such as epiphytes, have adapted by growing directly on the trees' trunks and branches in the canopy and understory layers of the rainforest. An adaptation to the large amounts of rainfall that many rainforest plants have is called \\"drip tips\\". Their leaves are tapered to a sharp point at the end. This allows water to run off the leaf quickly. There are many other adaptations that rainforest plants have made to their environment. These will be discussed in detail, as we investigate the plants of the rainforest! How do lianas adapt to the environment in the rainforest? A) They rely on other plants to reach the canopy layer.

Article: According to the US Geological Survey, about seven million earthquakes strike worldwide every year--but fortunately, only about 1500 of these are of a magnitude of 5 or greater on the Richter scale. Certain areas, such as California and Japan, are more _ earthquakes than others. Although the chance of being caught in \\"The Big one\\" is remote, it's wise to be prepared if you live in a region where earthquakes are common. Educate your family about earthquakes before a big one strikes. For example, they need to know to take shelter in a doorway or under a strong object if indoors, and never to run outdoors if they are inside. If outside, they need to know to stay away from power lines and buildings where objects could fall. Teach family members how to turn off gas or water lines or electrical power that may need to be shut off after a quake if severe damage occurs. Develop a plan. Where will your family meet in the event of a disaster? What if some people are at work or school? How will you know if they are safe? Where will you all meet up? Pack a preparedness kit and keep it in a safe location. In a major earthquake, it's possible that you won't be able to get into your house. Keep supplies in your car trunk or an outside storage shed if possible. Pack whatever your family is likely to need, enough for three days to a week, including food, water, medication, first aid and personal hygiene supplies, flashlights, a portable radio, blankets, clothes and shoes, cash, or camp stove, candles, matches or lighters, and a whistle. Consider earthquake insurance for your home if you live in an earthquake-prone area. Regular homeowner's insurance doesn't cover earthquake damage.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: The Order Movie plot: This section's plot summary may be too long or excessively detailed. Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (July 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The film's premise is that there is another way to heaven than adherence to the practices of the Roman Catholic Church. A secular Sin Eater can remove all taint of sin, no matter how foul, from the soul just before death. The purified soul can then ascend into heaven. The Roman Catholic Church, according to the film, considers this heresy. Heath Ledger plays an unhappy and disillusioned priest, Alex Bernier, a member of a fictitious religious order The Carolingians which specializes in fighting demons and other hell spawn. Father Dominic, the head of the Carolingians, has died in Rome under suspicious circumstances and Alex leaves the United States to investigate. In Rome, Alex visits the morgue and sees strange markings on Dominic's corpse. After some investigation, he comes across a book that explains the markings as being the sign of a Sin Eater's work. He heads to the Vatican, where an official tells him that Sin Eaters don't exist and that Dominic may not be buried on sacred ground because he had been excommunicated for his beliefs. Alex, moving ever farther from his vocation, defies his superiors and secretly reads a holy service over the body and buries Dominic in the Carolingian cemetery (the service takes place off screen but is referred to later). Thomas Garrett, another Carolingian (there seem to have only been a total of three including Dominic), arrives in Rome to help investigate Dominic's death. Early in the film we meet Mara Williams, an artist Alex once exorcised, who has escaped from a mental hospital and come to Alex at his church in the USA because she has a feeling that something terrible is going to happen to him. The police come looking for her, but Alex lies and denies that he's seen her and through this exchange we learn that Mara was in the hospital because she had tried... My question: Who wanted Alex to take his place and become the next sin-eater? Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"The Order\\", it is William Eden who wanted Alex to take his place and become the next sin-eater. William Eden is the Sin Eater himself, a man who has been performing the forbidden act of cleaning souls from their sins for centuries. He has been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church for his heresies, so he lives outside of its jurisdiction, in the secular world. Despite his disconnection from the church, he still possesses a deep understanding of its doctrines and rituals, particularly those associated with the act of sin eating. Toward the middle of the movie, Alex Bernier and Thomas Garrett encounter Eden, who reveals that Father Dominic had turned to him in his last days seeking purification from what he felt were unforgivable sins. Eden, who is old and weary, sees something in Alex that makes him believe the Carolingian priest can become his successor. The ultimate catalyst for Eden's decision is his ennui from the centuries of sin-eating and his desire to finally ascend to heaven. He has been living a very long life due to the ability he acquired from the sin-eating process, that grants the Sin Eater extended life. Eden sees potential in Alex, as they share a similar disillusionment with the church and a desire to save souls, although through different means. In a dramatic clash towards the end of the movie, Eden succeeds in transferring his powers to Alex. He cleanses Eden's soul, allowing him to die and potentially ascend to heaven, free from the sins he had consumed over the lifetime. Thus, Alex unwillingly becomes the new Sin Eater. To answer your question, it was William Eden who saw in Alex Bernier his successor, and ultimately manipulated the sequence of events to ensure Alex becomes the next Sin Eater, providing a unique and unexpected twist in the film's narrative."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I had arranged for a paid assistant to help me since the height of the ceiling and the weight of the wallboard was more than I could handle. When the time came, the assistant didn't show up and did not even call. I was pissed as hell. After my messages were not returned, I had what can only be called a “rage” of determination. Using a six foot ladder, three 2x4s and my head(literally) I hefted the heavy wallboard, Using leverage I placed them one by one on the overhead rafters, held and braced them with my head, glued and nailed them there all by myself. About a half hour after I finished, I was standing there smugly trying to figure how I did it so easily when there was a knock at the door. Of course it was the assistant with a lot of excuses.

David Moyes has backed Real Madrid to become the first team ever to retain the Champions League after Carlo Ancelotti's side mauled Real Sociedad 4-1 despite missing Cristiano Ronaldo. It was Moyes' first defeat to Ancelotti in their seventh meeting and asked if he thought they could retain the European Cup they won last May, he said: 'From what I've seen I think that they can. They have so much variety in the way they attack you. 'They've got different types of players and always with an incredibly strong bench. It's not been done before and that shows you how hard it is but with a bit of luck I think they might have what it takes.' Karim Benzema slots home Real Madrid's fourth of the afternoon during their 4-1 win against Real Sociedad. Benzema gestures towards the supporters as he is congratulated by his team-mates at the Bernabeu. Sociedad boss David Moyes believes Real Madrid are good enough to retain the Champions League. Asked about Ronaldo's absence Moyes added: 'Big clubs don't rely on one player, big clubs rely on their team and their squad.' Gareth Bale assisted for Karim Benzema in the win but was also booed by a small section of supporters for missing a string of chances including one he appeared to take off the boot of team-mate James Rodriguez. But Moyes said: 'I didn't hear the booing but if Bale keeps on getting the opportunities he's going to score a lot of goals because he's a top player.' The former Everton and Manchester United manager would love to have the options open to his rival Ancelotti. Real Sociedad bought no one in the transfer window and could now be without top scorer Carlos Vela for a month with a knee injury. Goalscorer Aritz Elustondo (left) celebrates with Ruben Prado after shocking Real Madrid in the first minute. James Rodriguez equalises for Real Madrid as Carlo Ancelotti's side recovered from going a goal down. James is mobbed by his team-mates after Real Madrid come up with an instant reply against David Moyes's side at the Bernabeu. Moyes bemoned the way the Spanish transfer window closed on Friday a full three days before most other big leagues in Europe. He said: 'There are only 31 days in January and Spain actually gives you fewer days, because we closed on Friday night. 'Of nearly all the transfers in January, a big percentage of them will be done on the last day. I don't think it's good for La Liga that you can move people out of Spain but you cannot move people in. 'I could have done with an extra day in the end especially now knowing that Carlos Vela has an injury.' Mangers Moyes and Carlo Ancelotti share a warm embrace before the match at the Bernabeu. Gareth Bale, who missed a great chance to score in the first half, takes control of the ball. Benzema wheels away in celebration after scoring Real Madrid's third goal against Sociedad. Despite the hammering there are signs that Moyes is developing Real Sociedad's younger players. Rookie right-back Aritz Elustondo who is only 21 scored the goal that put them 1-0 after just 48 seconds. Goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli who is only 22 was outstanding saving at point blank from Bale and of 22-year-old midfielder Ruben Pardo, Moyes said: 'I thought he was excellent he could have been wearing a Real Madrid shirt and he wouldn't have been out of place.'

Independence with Partition: The British began to see India's independence as inevitable; however, only a few seemed to understand the vital role of the religious groups. Britain prepared a parliamentary democracy with majority rule, but the majority were Hindus — and Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs had been killing each other in war for many centuries. Nehru's Congress Party, largely Hindu with a socialist leadership, wanted a parliamentary democracy. As counterweight, British legislation reserved parliamentary seats for religious minorities, but the Punjab and Bengal had such a complicated mixture of Hindus, Muslims, and Sikhs that it was not possible to avoid fights over how separate constituencies were to be formed. The seeds of future trouble were sown. The legislation on reserving seats gave the Muslims the basis for an alternative to an India in which they were only a quarter of the population: Partition. In 1930, the poet Muhammad Iqbal proposed a separate Muslim homeland in the northwest of India. A small group of Indian Muslims at Cambridge came up with the name Pakistan, using the initials of the Punjab, Afghania (N.W. Frontier Province), Kashmir, and Sind (at the same time producing the word pak, meaning \\"pure\\"), and adding \\"stan,\\" the Persian suffix for the word \\"country. \\" The Muslim campaign for Partition was led by London-trained Bombay lawyer, Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Meanwhile, Gandhi vehemently opposed any dismemberment of the country, and tried to keep people united by fasting to uphold the spirit of love, and by focussing on the common adversary: the British. Advocating civil disobedience, he led his famous Salt March to the sea, to scoop up salt and circumvent the hated British salt tax. This put more than 60,000 in jail. Against this militancy, World War II did not elicit the solidarity of the first. Indians courageously fought alongside the British troops, in Burma, the Middle East, and Europe, but Gandhi saw the British as a provocation for Japanese invasion and was jailed yet again, for launching a \\"Quit India\\" campaign in the year 1942. Some anti-British extremists saw the Japanese as an Asian liberator. Winston Churchill didn't want any Indian independence and so it was probably as well for India that he was defeated by Attlee's Labor Party in 1945. With riots growing ever more bloody in Bengal, Bihar, and the Punjab, India's last viceroy, Lord Mountbatten, kept a mandate to make the British departure as quick and as smooth as possible.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What was the first name of the person who calculated critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper?, using the article: At Birmingham, Oliphant's team had reached a different conclusion. Oliphant had delegated the task to two German refugee scientists, Rudolf Peierls and Otto Frisch, who could not work on Oliphant's radar project because they were enemy aliens and therefore lacked the necessary security clearance. Francis Perrin had calculated the critical mass of uranium to be about 40 tonnes (39 long tons; 44 short tons). He reckoned that if a neutron reflector were placed around it, this might be reduced to 12 tonnes (12 long tons; 13 short tons). Peierls attempted to simplify the problem by using the fast neutrons produced by fission, thus omitting consideration of moderator. He too calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper written in 1939 to be \\"of the order of tons\\".Peierls knew the importance of the size of the critical mass that would allow a chain reaction to take place and its practical significance. In the interior of a critical mass sphere, neutrons are spontaneously produced by the fissionable material. A very small portion of these neutrons are colliding with other nuclei, while a larger portion of the neutrons are escaping through the surface of the sphere. Peierls calculated the equilibrium of the system, where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping.Niels Bohr had theorised that the rare uranium-235 isotope, which makes up only about 0.7% of natural uranium, was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons, although this was not yet universally accepted. Frisch and Peierls were thus able to revise their initial estimate of critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to be substantially less than previously assumed. They estimated a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) could suffice. This amount represented approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235. These results led to the Frisch–Peierls memorandum, which was the initial step in the development of the nuclear arms programme in Britain. This..., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Rudolf. Based on the article provided, the first name of the person who calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium in a theoretical paper is Rudolf. This is in reference to Rudolf Peierls, a German refugee scientist. He, along with Otto Frisch, had been delegated the task by Oliphant at Birmingham. While they had limitations in working on Oliphant's radar project due to their status as enemy aliens, they were able to conduct theoretical research regarding the critical mass of uranium. The process of their research involved simplification of the problem by focusing on the fast neutrons produced by fission and leaving out the consideration of a moderator. Rudolf Peierls calculated the critical mass of a sphere of uranium to be \\"of the order of tons\\". He understood the importance of determining the size of the critical mass that would enable a chain reaction to occur, leading him to calculate the equilibrium of a system where the number of neutrons being produced equalled the number escaping. Peierls incorporated the theory suggested by Niels Bohr which stated that the rare uranium-235 isotope was primarily responsible for fission with fast neutrons. Despite this theory not being universally accepted at the time, Peierls and Frisch used it to revise their initial estimate of the critical mass needed for nuclear fission in uranium to a substantially lower amount. According to their calculations, a metallic sphere of uranium-235 with a radius of 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in), which represents approximately 1 kilogram (2.2 lb) of uranium-235, could suffice.

A hero American diver who helped in the search for the body of a senior government minister killed in a plane crash in the Philippines last year has been murdered with a shotgun blast in the face. Matthew Caldwell, 59, who had joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo was hit at point blank range with a 12-gauge shotgun, said Senior Superintendent Adolfo Samala of Las Pinas police. Mr Caldwell, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. Deep sea diver: Matthew Caldwell, 59, who was living in the Philippines, was a member of the Philippine Coast Guard Auxilliary and was widely recognised for his courage. He was among the first to be called upon in August last year when a Piper Seneca plane carrying Mr Robredo crashed in the waters off Masbate. Because of the great depth at which the aircraft was believed to be lying, Mr Caldwell's skills, along with those of two unidentified British divers, were required to search for the wreckage. Local hero: Caldwell joined two British divers in the search and recovery of the body of Interior Secretary Jessie Robredo (pictured), who died when his plane crashed in the waters of Masbate. He had attended a meeting of the coast guard on Thursday night when shortly afterwards he became involved in an argument with a security guard as he and his live-in partner, Miss Jeanelyn Flora, 36, were heading to their home in Las Pinas, five miles south of Manila. According to police the security guard, named as Ericson Elacquio, prevented Mr Caldwell from entering his road because he said the American had not paid monthly dues to the homeowners' association. When the guard continued to refuse to raise a wooden beam blocking the road, Mr Caldwell got out of his Toyota Corolla and tried to raise the barrier himself. It was then, as tempers flared, said Superintendent Samala, that the security guard raised his shotgun and fired it straight into Mr Caldwell's face, killing him instantly. The guard and a companion commandeered a motor cycle and spend off into the night. 'We have launched a major search for him,' said Superintendent Samala. 'We are confident we will find him.' As well as helping to locate the wreckage of the aircraft carrying Mr Robredo, Mr Caldwell had previously been involved in recovering bodies from a sunken wood-hulled passenger ship, the Catalyn B., which collied with a steel-hulled fishing vessel on Christmas Even, 2009.

Pyótr Ilʹyích Chaykóvskiy, IPA: [pʲɵtr ɪlʲˈjitɕ tɕɪjˈkofskʲɪj] (listen); 7 May 1840 [O.S. 25 April] – 6 November [O.S. 25 October] 1893), was a Russian composer of the romantic period, whose works are among the most popular music in the classical repertoire. He was the first Russian composer whose music made a lasting impression internationally, bolstered by his appearances as a guest conductor in Europe and the United States. He was honored in 1884 by Emperor Alexander III, and awarded a lifetime pension. Although musically precocious, Tchaikovsky was educated for a career as a civil servant. There was scant opportunity for a musical career in Russia at that time and no system of public music education. When an opportunity for such an education arose, he entered the nascent Saint Petersburg Conservatory, from which he graduated in 1865. The formal Western-oriented teaching he received there set him apart from composers of the contemporary nationalist movement embodied by the Russian composers of The Five, with whom his professional relationship was mixed. Tchaikovsky's training set him on a path to reconcile what he had learned with the native musical practices to which he had been exposed from childhood. From this reconciliation he forged a personal but unmistakably Russian style—a task that did not prove easy. The principles that governed melody, harmony and other fundamentals of Russian music ran completely counter to those that governed Western European music; this seemed to defeat the potential for using Russian music in large-scale Western composition or for forming a composite style, and it caused personal antipathies that dented Tchaikovsky's self-confidence. Russian culture exhibited a split personality, with its native and adopted elements having drifted apart increasingly since the time of Peter the Great. This resulted in uncertainty among the intelligentsia about the country's national identity—an ambiguity... Answer:","completion":"Tchaikovsky"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: In his lifetime, Ray had done a number of things for which he was not proud, things he'd like to see just as well stuffed down a dark hole. Everybody had things of which they were ashamed. Everybody has committed their share of sins that they wish they could take back. But this wasn't one of them, and he resented the implication that it was -- the implication that someone would dare to judge him for something they did not fully understand. It was a good thing, a right thing, like the time he had given emergency CPR to the woman already ten minutes dead and gone, the woman whose mouth tasted of chocolate death and scrambled eggs, just to spare her horrified children the sense of helplessness while waiting for the ambulance to arrive. That had been a noble thing like this one was. Should have been. Perhaps it was always less difficult to have things fail here, with the living, than it was with the dead. The dead had no opinions, no agendas. They weren't sensitive. The dead did what you fucking told them to do and didn't complain. Right? The living simply did not understand that there were rules. They didn't want to understand something so banal. Someone who didn't take the time to understand the rules had no right to pass judgment on him.

Summarize this article: This indicates that rather than being a tiny, long-dead planet, as scientists had assumed, Mercury was volcanically active for much of its \\"life\\". The researchers say it also sheds light on how other planets in our Solar System evolved. The findings are described in the journal Science. The new data have emerged from Messenger's recent third flyby of Mercury, ahead of the craft going into orbit around the planet in 2011. This flyby revealed a basin that had been formed by a relatively recent impact. The basin has been named \\"Rachmaninoff\\". \\"With the first flyby, we found evidence of volcanism all over the planet, which was pretty exciting,\\" said Dr Louise Prockter, from Johns Hopkins Applied Physics Laboratory in Maryland, who led the research. \\"But now we've done some age dating on this particular impact basin; it's one of the youngest on the planet and there are signs of volcanic activity [in it] that happened after the basin formed.\\" The age of this volcanic activity can be estimated only very approximately by examining the texture of the surface; the more overlaid impact craters, the older the surface structures are estimated to be. Dr Prockter said: \\"This volcano is about two billion years younger than we would have expected. And it's possible that when Messenger gets into orbit, we'll find younger areas of volcanism. \\"We want to know: was this a last gasp? Or is this more common than we thought?\\" Dr David Rothery, an Earth scientist from the UK's Open University in Milton Keynes, said the findings could reveal clues about the evolution of our own planet, and even of those outside our Solar System. He told BBC News: \\"Mercury is very close to the Sun, and when we're looking for planets around other stars - exoplanets - those that are closest to their stars are the easiest to see. \\"So similar processes to those on Mercury might occur on exoplanets.\\" Dr Prockter explained that, because Mercury is such a small planet, scientists would have expected it to \\"kick out\\" all of its heat very early on in its life. The surface area of the planet is relatively large in relation to its volume, so all the heat generated underneath the surface should have escaped quickly. Dr Rothery said: \\"We want to know what has kept Mercury going; it's clearly a much more dynamic planet that we expected.\\" In the same issue of Science, James Slavin, a space physicist at Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Maryland, and colleagues, described evidence of very intense \\"magnetic substorms\\" on Mercury. These occur on other planets, including Earth, bceause of the planet's magnetic field. This protects our planet from the hot, charged gas particles that flow away from the Sun as a \\"solar wind\\". When the solar wind reaches the Earth it is deflected by the field. As a result, Dr Slavin explained, \\"part of the Earth's magnetic field gets pulled downstream by the solar wind to form a very long comet-like magnetic tail\\". When conditions are just right, the solar wind can sometimes \\"load\\" that tail with many more lines of magnetic force to a point where it becomes unstable. At Earth this loading goes on for about an hour before the tail's magnetic lines suddenly \\"break-off\\" - a portion return to Earth, while the rest are carried off by the solar wind. \\"The energy given up during this unloading drives the heating and acceleration of charged particles in the tail,\\" explained Dr Slavin. \\"This process produces the majestic auroras that can be seen in the high latitudes, as some of the charged particles rain down into the upper atmosphere.\\" The combined loading and unloading process is referred to as a magnetospheric substorm - it is a form of space weather that can even affect satellite communications. Messenger flew through Mercury's magnetic tail in September 2009. \\"During this third flyby, over a period of 30 minutes, we saw its magnetic tail load, and then - boom - it unloaded, a total of four times,\\" said Dr Slavin. \\"But these magnetospheric substorms at Mercury are a great surprise in that they last only about two minutes - 30 times quicker than at Earth.\\" Messenger's principal investigator Sean Solomon, of Carnegie's Department of Terrestrial Magnetism in the US, said: \\"Every time we've encountered Mercury, we've discovered new phenomena. \\"Once Messenger has been safely inserted into orbit about Mercury next March, we'll be in for a terrific show.\\" Dr Prockter said: \\"The Solar System is like this giant laboratory where Earth is the control, and all the planets are different. \\"Missions like this help us to understand how the whole Solar System evolved.\\" Summary:","completion":"Data from Messenger's third flyby of Mercury has revealed evidence of relatively recent volcanic activity on the planet. The discovery challenges previous assumptions that Mercury was a small, long-dead planet. The volcanic activity is estimated to be about two billion years younger than expected. The findings provide insights into the evolution of planets in our solar system and may have implications for understanding exoplanets. The data also showed intense magnetic substorms on Mercury, which were previously only known to occur on Earth. These discoveries highlight Mercury as a more dynamic and active planet than previously thought."},{"prompt":"Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: Sir Nicholas Winton, rescuer of children, died on July 1st,2015,aged 106. When the letters and the honor came knocking on the door of his house in Maidenhead, and the filmmakers came calling, Nicholas Winton always protested that he was no hero. Heroes faced danger; he never had. They put their lives on the line; he had just worked at home in Hampstead, after a day being a stockbroker in the City. They avoided bullets and the secret police; he wrote letters, made telephone calls,and composed lists. The fact that he had rescued 669 children from Czechoslovakia just as the Nazis invaded did not, in his mind, constitute heroism. He hadn't gone out there in 1938 with any burning urge to do good; just for a holiday, in fact. Nor had he gone looking for children to rescue. Instead they and their parents had come to him, as soon as word got round that he might be able to help them leave Prague and get to the West. From 6.00 a.m. the knocks would come at the door of his room in the Europa Hotel, and he would open it to find some shivering, starving, desperate figure. When faced with a problem, his instinct was to solve it. So he made lists of the children, took their photographs, got them Home Office entry permits, found them foster families and organised their departure on trains, via the Netherlands, to Liverpool Street. After just three weeks in Prague, he went back to Britain and carried on the work from there. The British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia gave him almost no help, so he took sole charge himself. The Home Office was slow with entry permits, so he copied some illegally. In search of foster-parents for the children he put their photos in Picture Post; in the hope of farther havens for them he wrote to governors and senators in America and even to President Roosevelt, to no avail. He could have rescued at least 2,000 more, he said later, if America had been willing to take any. A hero might have got involved in the stress and distress of individual cases. He avoided that by treating them...

Q:Choose between \\"Pat\\" and \\"Brenda\\". Question: Brenda and Pat enjoy a day at the gym. Pat doesn't exercise as much as Brenda does, though. Because of this (A) Pat is sweating more than Brenda (B) Pat is sweating less than Brenda A:","completion":"It is plausible that during a day at the gym, both Brenda and Pat will be sweating due to the physical exertion associated with exercise. However, given the information provided, we can make some assessments about each individual's potential sweating levels. Pat does not exercise as much as Brenda does, which could mean that Pat might not be as physically fit or accustomed to exercising as Brenda. Physiologically, sweating is a natural process by which the body regulates its temperature during times of increased heat or exertion, such as during exercise. When a person exercises, their body produces heat, and as a response, the body cools down through evaporation of sweat from the skin. Considering that both individuals are enjoying a day at the gym, we can assume they engage in similar activities during their workout sessions. However, given that Pat is not as physically fit or used to exercise as Brenda, it is more likely that (A) Pat is sweating more than Brenda during their workout. The reason behind this conclusion has to do with how the body copes with heat stress and becomes efficient in dissipating heat. As a person consistently exercises and becomes more physically fit, their body adapts by becoming more efficient in regulating body temperature, thus improving their ability to dissipate heat. This is done through various mechanisms, including: 1. Increased blood flow to the skin - When a person is physically fit, their circulatory system is better able to deliver blood to the skin, which helps dissipate heat. 2. Improved sweat response - A fit individual's body may produce more sweat or begin sweating sooner into a workout as an adaptive response to heat stress. This allows their body to cool down more effectively. 3. Sweat composition - Regular exercisers tend to have a lower concentration of electrolytes and minerals in their sweat, resulting in less dehydration and a more efficient cooling process. As a result, Brenda, who exercises more frequently, may have better heat regulation due to these adaptations, leading to potentially less sweating compared to Pat during the same intensity of workouts. It is crucial to note that several factors can influence an individual's sweating rate, such as genetics, fitness level, workout intensity, environmental conditions, and clothing worn during the workout. Although we can infer that Pat might be sweating more than Brenda based on their exercise habits, it is essential to recognize that the sweating rate can vary significantly among individuals and differing circumstances."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"In this regard, enterprises should be encouraged to develop age management strategies, which would enhance competitiveness by harnessing the experience and specific qualities of older workers. The importance of age management strategies in modern businesses cannot be overstated. With an aging population and an imminent shortage of skilled workers, companies need to find ways to make the most out of the existing untapped potential of older workers. These strategies not only address the challenges that arise from an aging workforce but also are essential in creating an inclusive work environment where older workers can contribute effectively to overall business growth. A comprehensive age management strategy would involve several aspects including: 1. Recruitment and retention: To attract and retain older workers, employers should adopt fair recruitment practices that don't discriminate based on age. They can also offer flexible working arrangements, such as part-time work, job-sharing or reduced hours, to accommodate the needs and preferences of older employees. 2. Training and development: Continuous learning and skill development are crucial for all workers, irrespective of their age. Employers should provide ample opportunities for older employees to update their skills through regular training programs, workshops, and mentorship opportunities. 3. Health and well-being: To maintain good overall health and productivity among older workers, companies should implement measures such as ergonomic workstation designs, workplace wellness programs, and access to health services. Additionally, proactive measures to reduce age-related stressors, such as caregiving responsibilities and financial concerns, should be considered. 4. Intergenerational collaboration: Encouraging collaboration and knowledge transfer between different generations of workers is an essential part of an age management strategy. This can be achieved through setting up mentorship programs, intergenerational teamwork, and creating a work culture that fosters respect for everyone's experiences and knowledge. 5. Performance management and career progression: Employers should establish clear guidelines and performance standards that apply to all employees, regardless of age. They should also provide clear opportunities for career progression, even for older workers who may not seek promotions or advancement. 6. Legislation and policies: It is important for businesses to stay up-to-date on age-related regulations and policies to ensure compliance. They must be aware of any legal requirements related to age discrimination and diversity, and implement practices that promote age inclusiveness. 7. Leadership and organizational culture: The top management of a company is responsible for setting the tone when it comes to embracing age diversity. They should exemplify the benefits of a multigenerational workforce and demonstrate a commitment to nurturing talent throughout their employees' careers. In summary, incorporating age management strategies in business operations is crucial for harnessing the experience and unique qualities of older workers. It will not only address the challenges arising from an aging workforce but also help in building a more inclusive and competitive work environment that values contributions from workers of all ages."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Jane Movie plot: A Senate Armed Services Committee interviews a candidate for the position of Secretary of the Navy. Senator Lillian DeHaven (Anne Bancroft) from Texas criticizes the Navy for not being gender-neutral. Behind the curtains, a deal is struck: If women compare favorably with men in a series of test cases, the military will integrate women fully into all branches of the Navy. The first test is the training course of the (fictional) U.S. Navy Combined Reconnaissance Team (similar to U.S. Navy SEAL BUD/S). Senator DeHaven hand-picks topographical analyst Lieutenant Jordan O'Neil (Demi Moore), because she is physically more feminine than the other candidates. To make the grade, O'Neil must survive a grueling selection program in which almost 60 percent of all candidates wash out, most before the fourth week, with the third week being particularly intensive (\\"hell week\\"). The enigmatic Command Master Chief John James Urgayle (Viggo Mortensen) runs the brutal training program that involves 20-hour days of tasks designed to wear down recruits' physical and mental strength, including pushing giant ship fenders up beach dunes, working through obstacle courses, and hauling landing rafts. Given a 30-second time allowance in an obstacle course, O'Neil demands to be held to the same standards as the male trainees. Eight weeks into the program, during SERE training, the Master Chief ties her to a chair with her hands behind her back, grabs hold of her and slams her through the door, then picking her up off the floor he repeatedly dunks her head in ice cold water in front of the other crew members. O'Neil fights back, and is successful in causing him some injury despite her immobilized arms. In so doing, she acquires respect from him, as well as from the other trainees. Navy leaders, confident that a woman would quickly drop out, become concerned. Civilian media learn of O'Neil's involvement, and she becomes a sensation known as \\"G.I.

Let me preface this review by saying that I MAY try this office again just with a different doctor. Dr. Drewitz (and a few others) got pretty awesome reviews elsewhere online and was a peer-voted TOP DOC in the Phoenix Magazine. While that's not the patients voting, Yelpers, I suggest you do your own research. Note: I will update my review if I need to go back. Now to my experience. I called with digestive stress thinking it was a pretty serious episode that I was having. They got me in quickly but with a young doctor that hadn't received very good online reviews. They were quick to assign this one to me and although i was leery, I decided to just give this guy the benefit of the doubt. As another Yelper just before me mentioned, although I don't know if we had the same doc, the bedside manner was virtually non-existent. While he may just have a laid back personality, professionally, I prefer my docs to act like they give a shit. So then after asking me a few perfunctory questions about my current symptoms, he does the \\"stethoscope to the heart and back\\" routine and sends me to a kind woman to schedule my CT scan at a local Imaging place. Again, they got me in pretty quickly. Here's where it went awry for me. I went in for the scan on a Friday and the CT techs said the drs. office would receive results in 2 to 3 bus. days. I called Digestive Health Center - Coronado in 4. They had the results but the dr. had to sign off so someone could tell me my results and hadn't. Meanwhile, I'm beginning to panic cause NO NEWS IS BAD NEWS when you're a patient with a condition. EIGHT BUSINESS DAYS LATER, I call back like WTF? The assistant was apologetic but noted he STILL hadn't signed off on my results. Now remember , that this is simply so they can tell me something IS or ISNT wrong with me. Jeez!!!!! So I said I need another doctor then. An hour or two later another doctor calls back to tell me all is fine. For this frustrating episode, I receive a dang near 200 bill (after insurance pays their part and note how quickly THAT arrived vs. how slow the follow up was) and after paying 350 out of pocket for a CT scan. So 550 of my hard-earned- and- not- easily- come- by savings later, I am ok but seriously do not feel the service I received was worth it! Is this review positive or negative?

Q: Question: How many years had King George V and Queen Mary ruled at the end of World War I? Passage:The programme explores the lives of King George V and Queen Mary, and their attempts at modernising the British Monarchy in response to the massive social changes during and following World War I. The first episode recalls how, fearing anti-German sentiment, the royal house name was changed by King George from the House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to the House of Windsor. The series also examines the personal lives of the couple, delving into their relationships with their children, and with each other. The marriage between George and Mary was an arranged marriage, occurring only because Prince Albert Victor, George's brother and Mary's original fiancé, died from influenza. George V is presented in the series as a disciplinarian, who strictly punished his children, but was known to be much more loving to his granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Links: a. Influenza pandemic b. Elizabeth II c. George V d. Monarchy of the United Kingdom A:","completion":"To complete this task, follow these simple steps: 1. Read the context passage carefully. 2. Identify the question: \\"How many years had King George V and Queen Mary ruled at the end of World War I?\\" 3. Look for any information in the passage that is relevant to the question, such as mention of the time period or any specific years. In this case, the passage does not directly provide the answer to the question. 4. Review the four options provided, which are terms from the passage: a. Influenza pandemic, b. Elizabeth II, c. George V, d. Monarchy of the United Kingdom. 5. Since the question is asking about King George V and Queen Mary's rule, the most relevant term to search and read further information would be 'c. George V'. 6. Research 'George V' to find the relevant information about his rule during and until the end of World War I. 7. Choose the option 'c' as your answer. After doing the research, you will find that King George V ruled from 1910 to 1936, and World War I ended in 1918.

A:","completion":"Based on the context \\"Sydney was looking pale and going to shuffle off this mortal coil\\", it suggests that Sydney's health is deteriorating or she's not feeling well.

He had to produce a report for the coming annual meeting. This year he is thinking about a report with some lifestyle suggestions for middle adulthood population. To make it easier to understand the needs of middle adulthood population he would compare it with a group who are in their twenties. He labeled the first group as group A; and the latter group as group B. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would group B have faster or slower reaction time than group A? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, group A consists of individuals in middle adulthood, while group B consists of individuals in their twenties. To determine whether group B would have a faster or slower reaction time comparing to group A, we need to consider the general trends in reaction time across different age groups. Reaction time is known to be affected by age. Research has shown that it tends to be the fastest in young adults, and as individuals progress through adulthood, their reaction time typically slows down. This decline in reaction time can be attributed to various factors, such as changes in the nervous system, cognitive processing, and physical health, that occur as people age. It is generally observed that individuals in their twenties (group B) have relatively faster reaction times compared to people in middle adulthood (group A). The reason behind this is that people in their twenties are still in the prime of their youth, and their cognitive and physical abilities are typically at their peak. Their neural connections and processing are faster, leading to quicker reaction times. In contrast, individuals in middle adulthood (group A) may start experiencing age-related declines in cognitive and physical functions, which can contribute to a slower reaction time. Although these declines vary from person to person and may not be drastic, it is generally accepted that there is a trend towards slower reaction times as age increases. In conclusion, based on the age differences between the two groups, it is likely that group B (those in their twenties) would have a faster reaction time than group A (middle adulthood population). It is essential to note that this comparison is made based on general trends and individual differences in reaction time might still occur within each group."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In geology, areas of continental crust include regions covered with water. - Water is a transparent and nearly colorless chemical substance that is the main constituent of Earth's streams, lakes, and oceans, and the fluids of most living organisms. Its chemical formula is HO, meaning that its molecule contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, that are connected by covalent bonds. Water strictly refers to the liquid state of that substance, that prevails at standard ambient temperature and pressure; but it often refers also to its solid state (ice) or its gaseous state (steam or water vapor). It also occurs in nature as snow, glaciers, ice packs and icebergs, clouds, fog, dew, aquifers, and atmospheric humidity. - Eton Wick is a village currently in the English ceremonial county of Berkshire, but traditionally in Buckinghamshire, on the River Thames.

Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe.

The word \\"archipelago\\" is derived from the Greek \\"- arkhi-\\" (\\"chief\\") and \\" pélagos\\" (\\"sea\\") through the Italian \\"arcipelago\\". In Italian, possibly following a tradition of antiquity, the Archipelago (from medieval Greek \\"*\\" and Latin \\"archipelagus\\") was the proper name for the Aegean Sea and, later, usage shifted to refer to the Aegean Islands (since the sea is remarkable for its large number of islands). It is now used to refer to any island group or, sometimes, to a sea containing a small number of scattered islands. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys.

Bathroom battle heads to the state Capitol PHOENIX -- Several weeks after the city of Phoenix voted to extend legal protections to transgender people, a new proposal at the state Capitol could make it a crime for them to go into the bathroom in which they identify. The proposal is scheduled for debate Wednesday in the House Committee on Appropriations and would make it a Class 1 misdemeanor for someone to enter a public restroom that is designated for the opposite sex. It would be punishable by up to six months in jail and a 2,500 fine. In a hotly debated move last month, the Phoenix City Council voted to give legal protections to transgender people under the city's anti-discrimination law. A divided council approved a proposal (5-3), which added gays, lesbians, bisexuals and transgender people from being discriminated against in city contracts, housing, employment, and public restaurants. Opponents named it the \\"Bathroom Bill\\" because they claimed it would let transgender people use bathrooms for the opposite sex. Opponents, such as the conservative Center for Arizona Policy, opposed it because they feared it could be abused. Officials with CAP were not immediately available for an interview. The bill's sponsor, Sen. Nancy Barto, a Republican from Phoenix, did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment for this story. ||||| Amended bill could reverse Phoenix anti-bias laws Posted: Wednesday, March 20, 2013 12:18 AM EDT Updated: Wednesday, April 3, 2013 12:31 AM EDT A newly amended bill making its way through the Senate could overturn part of Phoenix City Council's newly strengthened anti-discrimination laws. \\"If you're a male, you stick to the men's room. If you're a female, stick to the ladies room,\\" said Rep. John Kavanagh, who amended Senate Bill 1432. The bill would restrict the use of restrooms, dressing rooms or lockers exclusively to those whose birth certificate matches what's written on the door. \\"What about the woman that are waiting in line to use the women's restroom? There is a long line. They go into the men's restroom. That's against this law, isn't it?\\" asked CBS 5's Greg Argos. \\"Technically it is, but look, police use discretion every day,\\" Kavanagh responded. \\"This is designed to protect young children from being exposed to the other gender in their fullness in inappropriate situations. I'm just restoring sanity, because the Phoenix bill turned gender upside down,\\" he continued. Kavanagh is referring to the strengthened anti-discrimination laws Phoenix City Council passed in February. That law allows transgendered people to use the restroom of the gender with which they identify. However the bill Kavanagh amended started as something entirely different. The representative removed all the wording and replaced it with the new rules on bathroom use. \\"Was this a fair way about going about introducing this bill?\\" Argos asked. \\"It was the only way. Phoenix did this unexpected vote after the deadline for submitting new bills has passed. So I was stuck with either waiting until next year, when all sorts of harm would occur, or finding a bill that was no longer needed by one of the other reps that I could attach this to,\\" Kavanagh explained. Those in the transgendered community say this bill is discriminatory. \\"It made me feel like someone had just hit me in the head with a two by four and kicked me in the stomach,\\" said Antonia D'orsay, a member of the transgendered community. Because SB 1432 Heads to the Arizona Senate Appropriations Committe Wedensday, those against the bill held an emergency meeting in central Phoenix, and planned to make their voices heard. \\"It's been about trying to speak to the community that is supportive of us to let them know what we need. Because transgendered people in general aren't enough to speak out. We're the one in 10 of the one in 10,\\" D'orsay said. If passed, the law would make it a class 6 felony to use the wrong restroom.

You might want to make sure you can lay your hands on your birth certificate. A House panel will consider legislation today which would make it a crime to enter a public restroom designated for one gender or the other if you are \\"not legally classified\\" on your birth certificate as a member of that sex. The measure, SB1432, also would apply to showers, baths, dressing rooms or locker rooms marked \\"men\\" or \\"women.\\" The move comes a month after the Phoenix City Council voted 5-3 to extend its anti-discrimination laws to those who are gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender. But foes quickly dubbed it the \\"bathroom bill,\\" saying the provisions about public accommodations could result in businesses being prosecuted for refusing to let transgender men use the women's restroom. Rep. John Kavanagh, R-Fountain Hills, said the state needs to step in. Otherwise, he said, any man who simply \\"thinks of himself\\" as a woman could be free to go into a women's locker room and disrobe. \\"That's unacceptable behavior,\\" he said. Tucson has had a similar ordinance since 1999. And Liana Perez, that city's director of equal opportunity programs, said she has never seen anyone raise an issue or file a complaint about who gets to use which bathroom. \\"It just doesn't come up,\\" Perez said. But Sen. Nancy Barto, R-Phoenix, said state action is necessary. \\"How far does the Phoenix City Council have to go in infringing upon people's fundamental rights to run their businesses as they see fit without succumbing to a small minority's wishes?\\" she said. \\"It puts at risk every business and church for frivolous lawsuits.\\" Kavanagh said which facility someone uses should be based on what has been the practice: what's on your birth certificate. But he insisted it will not be necessary for people to carry that around, any more than it's necessary for someone entering a men's room or women's room now has to produce documentation. \\"But if you go into a public shower and you're a male and it's a female public shower, and the police are called, well, you'd better be able to prove that you're a female and not a male,\\" Kavanagh said. \\"Otherwise you're going to go to jail, which is where you belong.\\" The Arizona Department of Health Services already has considered the question of gender, with state law setting up procedures for amending a birth certificate of someone born in this state. In essence, it requires a letter from a doctor, dated and signed, that the person has had a sex-change operation. But the law appears to have some wiggle room in terms of the plumbing. It also says that the change can be based on a \\"chromosomal count that establishes the sex of the person as different than in the registered birth certificate.\\" Getting a name change, though, requires going to court. In a press release Tuesday, Equality Arizona called the measure \\"a disgusting invasion of privacy and civil liberties for all of us.\\" They said it even could make criminals of women who, facing a long line at a restroom in a public facility, duck into the men's room. Kavanagh dismissed that possibility. \\"Police use discretion in unusual circumstances,\\" he said. \\"But the problem is Phoenix has turned the law upside down.\\" The legislation does have an exception for those who enter a gender-specific restroom or other areas who do so as part of their job responsibilities. Also exempt would be those who enter to give aid or assistance to another person, help a child who needs assistance, and the physically disabled. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The state Capitol in Phoenix is debating a proposal that could make it a crime for transgender people to use the bathroom with which they identify, following the city of Phoenix's vote to extend legal protections to the transgender community.

And I hope she gets well soon. No satisfaction, believe me, whatsoever,” Trump said. Trump also said it was “interesting” that Clinton’s doctor said she diagnosed the Democratic presidential nominee with pneumonia on Friday even though Trump said Clinton “was coughing very, very badly a week ago and even before that, if you remember.” “It’s interesting to see what is going on,” he said. “I want her to get better and I want her to get out there.” On “Fox and Friends,” Trump was asked if he has a plan to take on Tim Kaine or Joe Biden if Clinton is replaced. “No, I don’t think they’ll replace her. We have to see what’s wrong,” he said. “But whatever it is, it is, I’m ready. Whatever it is.” On Sunday, after Clinton was seen leaving the 9/11 memorial event at ground zero early and seen stumbling, Clinton’s campaign revealed that she had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday by her doctor. Her campaign has since canceled a two-day fundraising trip to California that also included a speech on the economy. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Story Continued Below She went on to take a shot at Donald Trump. \\"In contrast to HRC, Trump has been less transparent than any nominee in modern history,\\" she said in a subsequent tweet. Clinton on Sunday left a 9/11 memorial service early, with the campaign saying that she was “overheated.” After footage emerged of a woozy-looking Clinton being helped into a van, the campaign disclosed that the nominee had been diagnosed with pneumonia on Friday. Reporters and pundits jumped on the late response and questioned why the campaign hadn’t revealed the diagnosis earlier. Axelrod, President Barack Obama’s former chief campaign strategist, had taken to Twitter on Monday morning to blast the campaign for an \\"unhealthy obsession with privacy.\\" \\"Antibiotics can take care of pneumonia. What's the cure for an unhealthy penchant for privacy that repeatedly creates unnecessary problems?\\" he tweeted. Axelrod, who is now a commentator for CNN, took heat for his comments from Center for American Progress President and longtime Clinton ally Neera Tanden, who tweeted, \\"I'm old enough to remember certain WH advisors decrying the cable commentariat peanut gallery.\\" Former White House press secretary Robert Gibbs also chimed in. \\"Protective pool isn't always easy for either candidate or press but there comes a point for each nominee when it must be part of daily life,\\" he tweeted. The Trump campaign, which has been largely restrained when talking about Clinton's health incident over the weekend, pounced on Palmieri's Tweet. \\"Jen has a point: they know enough about Hillary that they don't like her, don't trust her,\\" tweeted Kellyanne Conway, Trump's campaign manager. ||||| Summary:","completion":"This article discusses how Hillary Clinton's campaign could have better managed communications around her diagnosis with pneumonia.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How do you do this: How can I remove an oil-based paint stain from my clothes?","completion":"Removing an oil-based paint stain from clothes can be a bit challenging, but it's definitely possible with the right approach and materials. The key to success is acting fast – the sooner you treat the stain, the better your chances of complete removal. Here's a detailed step-by-step guide on how to remove an oil-based paint stain from your clothes: 1. Act quickly: As soon as you notice the paint stain, act immediately. The longer it sits, the harder it will be to remove. 2. Remove excess paint: Using a butter knife, spoon, or other blunt-edged tool, carefully scrape off as much of the excess paint as you can without rubbing it into the fabric. The goal is to remove bulk paint, not to push it deeper into the fibers. 3. Pre-treat the stain: Dampen a clean, white cloth or paper towel with a small amount of mineral spirits, turpentine, or paint thinner. Blot the stain gently, working from the outside edges towards the center, to dissolve the paint. Be cautious – these solvents are strong and might damage delicate fabrics. As you work, rotate the cloth to a clean section when it becomes saturated with paint. Keep doing this until no more paint is transferring onto the cloth. 4. Test for colorfastness: Before proceeding, test a small, inconspicuous area of the fabric to ensure that the solvents don't cause damage or discoloration. Apply a small amount of the solvent to the test area, let it sit for a minute, then dab with a clean cloth. If there's no damage, you can continue treating the stain. 5. Rinse with isopropyl alcohol: Moisten another clean cloth with isopropyl (rubbing) alcohol, and blot the stain gently to remove any remaining solvent residue. Rinse the stained area under cold water to flush out any remaining alcohol. 6. Apply a pre-wash stain remover: Apply a pre-wash stain treatment, such as a liquid laundry detergent, stain removing spray, or paste made of powdered detergent and water, to the stained area. Gently rub the pre-wash into the stain with your fingers or a soft brush, following the product's instructions. 7. Check the care label: Before washing, make sure to check the garment's care label for specific washing guidelines, including water temperature and drying instructions. 8. Wash the garment: Wash the clothing in the warmest water that's safe for the fabric, and use a heavy-duty detergent. It's best to wash the stained clothing separately from your other laundry to avoid cross-contamination. 9. Inspect the stain after washing: Before placing the garment in the dryer, carefully inspect the stained area. If the stain is still visible, do not dry the garment, as the heat will set the stain permanently. 10. Repeat if necessary: If the stain hasn't come out completely during the first wash cycle, repeat the pre-treatment and washing process. Sometimes, multiple treatments will be necessary to fully remove an oil-based paint stain. 11. Dry the garment: Once the stain is gone, dry the garment according to the care label instructions. You can air-dry or use a dryer, depending on the fabric. Throughout the process, be patient and persistent. Oil-based paint stains can be tough to remove, but with the right combination of solvents, pre-treatment, and washing, you can restore your garment to its original condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an ordered list of reviews about \\"truth about charlie\\".","completion":"To write an ordered list of reviews about \\"The Truth About Charlie\\", I will first research the movie, gather key points and opinions from various sources, and then summarize the general consensus about the film. After that, I'll organize the reviews in a coherent manner to provide a thorough representation of the movie's reception. Here is the ordered list of reviews: 1. Plot and Storyline: The Truth About Charlie is a mix of various elements - mystery, thriller, and romance. With a complex plot that may leave some viewers confused, the storyline keeps you engaged but admits to being far from perfect. Fans of the original movie, Charade, might find it hard to embrace this updated version. 2. Acting and Character Development: Thandie Newton delivers an incredible performance as Regina, bringing her unique charm and energy to the character. Mark Wahlberg, as Charlie, also gives a decent portrayal, although his chemistry with Newton is not as strong as the original lead pair in Charade. The supporting characters add intrigue to the plot, but some viewers feel they're left underdeveloped. 3. Direction and Visuals: Jonathan Demme's direction is bold and experimental, with excellent use of handheld cameras and vibrant colors that give the movie an edgy feel. However, some viewers find the rapid, erratic editing and an abundance of close-ups disorienting and detracting from the story. 4. Pacing and Suspense: The movie is fast-paced and full of twists that keep the audience guessing, adding to the thriller experience. However, some critics argue that the story's complexity and speed make it difficult to keep up with, and the revelations may not be as satisfying as expected. 5. Soundtrack and Music: The soundtrack is a standout feature of The Truth About Charlie. Using French and African music sources, the eclectic mix of songs adds an exotic and delightful touch that enhances every scene, applying a unique atmosphere that distinguishes the movie from other thrillers. 6. Comparison to the Original: The Truth About Charlie is often compared to its original inspiration, Charade, and while it is ambitious in attempting to modernize and spin the classic story, it falls short in some aspects. Critics argue that noticeable differences, especially the cast and some plot changes, make it hard to beat the charm of the original. 7. Overall Rating: The Truth About Charlie is a visually striking and experimental thriller with engaging performances by Thandie Newton and Mark Wahlberg. While not surpassing the original, it maintains a unique style and atmosphere that make it worth watching. However, problems in pacing, editing, and character development may leave some viewers unsatisfied. Overall, moviegoers should approach this film with an open mind."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: - This mass creates high core temperatures - The mass decreases - The red giant can no longer fuse the carbon and oxygen in its center - The gravity of the star can no longer hold the outside layers - The layers break away - Only the inner core remains - This inner core is known as a white dwarf. What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process leading to the formation of a white dwarf is the exhaustion of nuclear fuel in a star's core. In order to better understand this process, let us delve deeper into the various stages leading up to the formation of a white dwarf. 1. Nuclear fuel exhaustion in the core: A star's life begins with the fusion of hydrogen atoms into helium due to the intense pressures and temperatures at its core. This nuclear fusion generates an outward pressure that counterbalances the inward force exerted by the star's gravity, thereby maintaining its stability. Over time, however, the hydrogen fuel in the core gradually diminishes, causing the core to contract. 2. Expansion into a red giant: Simultaneously, nuclear fusion continues to occur in a shell surrounding the core, which, in turn, releases more energy and consequently causes the outer layers of the star to expand. The star then transforms into a red giant, characterized by an increased size and a relatively cooler surface temperature that imparts a reddish hue. 3. Fusion of helium to carbon and oxygen: Eventually, the core temperature reaches a critical threshold that allows for helium fusion to occur. This new fusion process converts helium into heavier elements such as carbon and oxygen. However, as the mass of the star decreases, there comes a point when the core temperature can no longer support the fusion of carbon and oxygen. 4. Ejection of outer layers: Deprived of the outward pressure generated by nuclear fusion, the outer layers of the star become susceptible to the star's gravity. Moreover, the forces of radiation pressure from the core and strong stellar winds cause the outer layers to be expelled, often resulting in the formation of a planetary nebula. 5. Formation of a white dwarf: Following the ejection of the outer layers, only the inner core of the star remains. Consisting primarily of carbon and oxygen, this compact and extremely hot object is known as a white dwarf. No longer capable of sustaining fusion reactions, the white dwarf cools down over time, steadily emitting its residual energy as it does so. Ultimately, it may become a black dwarf—a cool, dark celestial body that no longer emits radiation—though such objects have not yet been observed because the Universe is not old enough for a white dwarf to have cooled down to this state."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: A new study suggests that the way to weight loss may be clear.A couple of glasses of water before meals help dieters lose about 5 pounds more than those who do not drink water.While drinking water before a meal may fill a person up,the contents of their meal are important as well.Should a person be eating a low-fat diet or a lowcarbohydrate diet? Or does it matter at all? Recent research suggests that one diet isn't any better than the other.A few weeks before the water study,another concluded that lowfat and lowcarbohydrate diets tied in weight loss.While the lowcarbohydrate dieters did show a slight increase in good cholesterol and a reduction in blood pressure,there was not much difference in the dieters'weight loss.The point here is that the person had to stick to the diet.What helps a person see a diet through? It could be body type. A study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association,as reported byTimemagazine,found that body shape is the key to which diet a person will be able to stick with.Apples are people who carry most of their weight above the belt,while pears carry their weight around their hips .Apple types were more likely to be highinsulin secretors who respond more strongly to carbohydrates in their bodies.They lost the most weight on a lowcarbohydrate diet.Pears were lowinsulin secretors who lost the same amount of weight on both diets.Unstable insulin levels can create stronger hunger senses,causing the apple types to go off their diet plans. All of these studies again come down to choosing the diet that helps you eat less.The bodytype diet does make some sense as men are more likely to be apple types,with larger stomachs,and tend to do well on higherprotein diets,while women,who tend to carry weight around their hips,find themselves drawn to the lowfat diets.The reality is if a diet is failing you try another one.A plan you can't,or won't,stick to will never work,no matter what the research says. In the author's opinion, _ . A) men don't get hungry as easily as women B) apple types work better than pear types in weight loss C) the result of the recent research is not of much value D) strong will as well as proper methods is the key to weight loss Answer:","completion":"D) strong will as well as proper methods is the key to weight loss"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: Fredric Michael Lynn (born February 3, 1952) is an American former professional baseball player who played in Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1974 through 1990 as a center fielder with the Boston Red Sox, California Angels, Baltimore Orioles, Detroit Tigers and San Diego Padres. He is best known for being the first player to win MLB's Rookie of the Year Award and Most Valuable Player Award in the same year, which he accomplished in 1975 with the Red Sox. Lynn was inducted into the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame in 2002 and to the College Baseball Hall of Fame in 2007. Context: In his 17-year career, Lynn batted .283 with 1,111 RBIs, 1,960 hits, 1,063 runs, 306 home runs, 388 doubles, 43 triples, and 72 stolen bases in 1969 games. From 1982 to 1988, he had seven consecutive seasons of hitting more than twenty home runs (his totals were 21-22-23-23-23-23-25). His 306 career home runs place him, through the end of the 2017 seasons, in 13th place among center fielders. Defensively, Lynn recorded a career .988 fielding percentage at centerfield, his primary position. In 15 career postseason games, Lynn batted 22-for-54 (.407) with two home runs and 13 RBIs. Lynn was a nine-time All-Star, batting an overall 6-for-20 (.300) in All-Star Games with four home runs and ten RBIs, including the first (and to date, only) grand slam in All-Star Game history, which he hit in the 1983 game. His four home runs in All-Star Games is second only to Stan Musial with six. Lynn's career was hampered by some injuries caused by fearless play, such as a broken rib from crashing into an outfield wall, or knee injuries from breaking up double plays, and playing all-out defensively. He never played more than 150 games in a season, and only topped 140 games four times. Lynn played for five different teams, but considers himself a member of the Red Sox family. \\"I'm a Red Sock. I didn't want to leave the Red Sox.\\", said Lynn, further noting, \\"I came up with them and from 1973 to 1980 I was their property. I thought I'd end up spending my entire career in Boston. It was tough, even though I was going to a great team [the Angels] and playing for a great owner in Gene Autry.\\" Question: Did he beat any records with his stats?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Fredric Michael Lynn did not break any all-time MLB records with his career stats. However, he achieved several notable accomplishments: 1.

He hit the first and, to date, the only grand slam in All-Star Game history in the 1983 game. 3. He ranks 13th among center fielders in career home runs (306) through the end of the 2017 season. 4. Lynn was a nine-time All-Star and had a .300 batting average in All-Star games, with four home runs, putting him second only to Stan Musial, who had six.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Instructions: In this task, you are given a set of context paragraphs, some supporting facts and an answer of a question. Your task is to generate question for given answer based on set of context paragraphs, supporting facts and an answer. Input: Context_1 : Aalborghus Castle (Danish: \\"Aalborghus Slot\\" ) is a castle in Aalborg, Denmark. It is a half-timbered (bindingsværk) castle built by King Christian III from 1539 to around 1555 initially as a fortification. Soon it became the seat of the king's provincial governors in Northern Jutland, and after the introduction of absolutism, became used by the State County of Northern Jutland for taxes. Context_2 : Christian III (12 August 1503 – 1 January 1559) reigned as king of Denmark from 1534 until his death and Norway from 1537 until his death. During his reign, Christian established Lutheranism as the state religion within his realms as part of the Protestant Reformation. Context_3 : The Count's Feud (Danish: \\"Grevens Fejde\\" ), also called the \\"Count's War\\", was a civil war that raged in Denmark in 1534–36 and brought about the Reformation in Denmark. The Count's Feud takes its name from the Protestant Count Christopher of Oldenburg, who supported the Catholic King Christian II, deposed in 1523, over the election of Christian III. Context_4 : The Icelandic Reformation took place in the middle of the 16th century. Iceland was at this time a territory ruled by Denmark, and Lutheran religious reform was imposed on the Icelanders by King Christian III of Denmark. The Icelandic Reformation ended with the execution of Jón Arason, Catholic bishop of Hólar, and his two sons, in 1550, after which the country adopted Lutheranism. Context_5 : The Treaty of Speyer or Peace of Speyer was signed on May 23, 1544 between Denmark and the Holy Roman Empire during an Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire in Speyer, Germany. Danish king Christian III had imposed heavy tolls on the Sound and two other channels between the North Sea and the Baltic sea, in an effort to end the Dutch dominance of trade in the Baltic region. Under pressure from Holy Roman Emperor Charles V, he agreed to exempt the Dutch ships from these tolls and give them free and unfettered access to the Baltic. In the treaty, Charles V also recognized Christian III as the rightful king of Denmark, and promised not to provide military support to his rival Christian II. The Treaty of Speyer dictated Christian III's foreign policy for the rest of his life. He kept Denmark at peace, refusing to involve the country in Protestant-Catholic conflicts such as the Schmalkaldic War of 1546. The Dutch would continue to dominate Baltic trade for another two centuries. Context_6 : Josquin Baston (c. 1515 – c. 1576) was a Dutch composer of the first half of the 16th century. From the 1550s, he worked as kapellmeister at the court of Christian III. After Christian III's death, he found work at a Swedish court. A number of his pieces were published in Sigismund Salblinger's \\"Concentus\\" (1545), and in the \\"Leuven Collection\\" (1554). Context_7 : Hesselagergård (or Hesselager Manor), located near Gudme in the southeast of the Danish island Funen, is the oldest Renaissance building in Denmark. It was built by Johan Friis, one of the most powerful men in Denmark during the reigns of Christian III and Frederick II. Context_8 : Cornelis Altenan (died 19 September 1558) was a Danish-German builder. He was employed by Christian III of Denmark as a bricklayer and carpenter, and was responsible for building the King's fortress in Holstein. Context_9 : The election of Christian III as king of Denmark and Norway on 4 July 1534 was a landmark event for all of Denmark and Norway. It took place in the church in the town of Rye, eastern Jutland, where the Jutlandic nobility elected Prince Christian, son of King Frederick I and Duke of Schleswig and Holsten, as king. This brought about the Count's Feud (\\"Grevens Fejde\\") and later also led to the implementation of the Protestant Reformation in Denmark and Norway. Context_10 : Christian III generally refers to Christian III of Denmark. It may also refer to: fact_1 : Christian III generally refers to Christian III of Denmark. fact_2 : Christian III (12 August 1503 – 1 January 1559) reigned as king of Denmark from 1534 until his death and Norway from 1537 until his death.

Summarize: This was how Charles Bartram, a 23-year-old former colliery worker from Doncaster, described his experience of the first day of the Battle of the Somme in 1916. It is one of more than 500 remarkable first-hand accounts of the World War One battle donated to the Imperial War Museum, the \\"vast majority\\" of which have never been seen before. Anthony Richards, head of documents and sound at the museum, says it is \\"quite amazing\\" to have come across so much previously unseen material about a battle that ended 100 years ago this week. What makes these testimonies \\"incredibly unusual\\" he says, is that they talk so candidly about killing in hand-to-hand fighting - and often the remorse felt afterwards. \\"It's very unusual for people from World War One to talk about the actual act of killing. It's usually skirted around.\\" It was an \\"uncomfortable\\" subject for returning soldiers, he says, and memoirs and letters tended to avoid it. But these accounts have some graphic details. John Kirkham of the Manchester Battalion described how he could not shake off the memory of striking a German soldier with a club with metal spikes. \\"It sank deep into his forehead. In the scuffle, his helmet flew off, and I saw that he was a bald-headed old man. I have never forgotten that bald bead, and I don't suppose I ever will, poor devil.\\" The accounts were gathered more than 40 years ago for a classic history of the Somme, written by Martin Middlebrook. But much of the material was never published and only this summer was given to the museum. This might have been the only time that soldiers recorded their feelings. \\"You ask me to tell you about things I saw, you will be the only person I have ever told this to. The reason, they would never believe me,\\" recorded Robert Payne of the Royal Garrison Artillery. This soldier won the Military Medal, but his account includes stories of \\"self-inflicted wounds, several cases of madness\\" and a \\"poor chap\\" who threw down his gun and refused to move. There are other accounts of an officer with shell shock having to be physically restrained by his \\"burly batman\\". Despite the violence of the conflict, these stories are deeply humane and lacking in any self-glorification. George Mayne, a 19-year-old Royal Fusilier describes a sense of \\"bewilderment\\" and feeling \\"woolly headed\\" as he went over the top and charged across no man's land. When he stormed into the opposing trench he found a dying German soldier, calling for his mother and for water. \\"I am glad to this day that I gave him a drink from my precious water,\\" he wrote. There were moments of bleak humour too. Tom Short, a 19-year-old with the London Rifle Brigade, had charged a trench spotted by aerial reconnaissance, to find that the \\"trench\\" was only two feet deep. Horribly exposed, Tom faced a German bayonet charge and thought that it was all over. \\"In a split second before the moment of connecting my stomach with a bayonet, at which I was nearly passed out in terror, a terrific shout of \\"halt\\" came from somewhere and knowing how disciplined the German soldier is, the bod coming at me slid flat on his back, his rifle shot straight up in the air and his legs shot between mine. It appears a German officer gave this order.\\" These were young men - and some were younger than they should have been. George Rudge was only 17 at the Battle of the Somme and had given a false age when he enlisted. \\"It seemed to me that everyone around me had been killed or wounded for I was the only one of my regiment I could see,\\" he wrote, describing the advance. He recalled his feelings about shooting the enemy. \\"This was the first time I had killed anybody, as far as I know, and when things quieted I went and looked at a German I knew I had shot, and I remember thinking that he looked old enough to have a family and I felt very sorry.\\" He was in no doubt \\"we were just meant to be sacrificed, as we ran into a wall of steel\\" and talks of advancing with a \\"chap who had the bottom of his jaw blown off and still kept going forward till he dropped\\". None of this was known to the soldier's own family. His grandson, George Ward, who lives in St Ives in Cambridgeshire, says they knew their grandfather had fought in World War One, but not that he had served on the first day of the Somme. \\"He was very private when it came to that,\\" said Mr Ward. \\"All he said was: 'I was in a battleâ€¦ Change the subject.' He wouldn't talk about it.\\" \\"It was just too horrific to talk about. They just tried to forget it. But it was there in their mind all the time.\\" Mr Ward says his grandfather's health suffered after the war from being gassed and he also had a breakdown. Looking for the first time at his grandfather's account, he says \\"it's very emotional\\". It's difficult not to be struck by the immense courage of these youngsters. Frank Graves describes the machine guns and watching lines of men being \\"cut down like grass from a scythe\\". But there was compassion for those overcome by fear. John Kirkham, who had had his arm shattered by a bullet and returned to his own lines, reported seeing \\"two unfortunate boys\\" who had been \\"terrified\\" and who he was convinced had been summarily shot for cowardice. It was also physically and mentally exhausting. Reginald Moore of the Northamptonshire Regiment, who had gone over the top at 07:30 and had been engaged in the battle all day, describes how it \\"caught up with me\\" when night fell. \\"I started to shake and tremble and they had to put another fellow with me until I was calm again. \\"That sir was 1 July, I was 18 years.\\" Do you have any family memories of the Somme?

Plot title: Aliens Movie plot: Ellen Ripley is rescued after drifting through space in stasis for 57 years. She is debriefed by her employers at the Weyland-Yutani Corporation over the destruction of her ship, the USCSS Nostromo; they are skeptical of her claims that an Alien killed the ship's crew and forced her to destroy the ship. The exomoon LV-426, where the Nostromo encountered the alien eggs, is now home to the terraforming colony Hadleys Hope. When contact is lost with Hadleys Hope, Weyland-Yutani representative Carter Burke and Colonial Marine Lieutenant Gorman ask Ripley to accompany Burke and a Colonial Marine unit to investigate the disturbance. Traumatized by her encounter with the Alien, Ripley initially refuses, but she relents after experiencing recurring nightmares about the creature; she makes Burke promise to destroy, and not capture, the Aliens. Aboard the spaceship USS Sulaco, she is introduced to the Colonial Marines, their commanding officer Lieutenant Gorman, and the android Bishop, toward whom Ripley is initially hostile following her experience with the traitorous android Ash aboard the Nostromo. A dropship delivers the expedition to the surface of LV-426, where they find the colony deserted. Inside, they find makeshift barricades and signs of a struggle, but no bodies; two live facehuggers in containment tanks in the medical lab; and a survivor, a traumatized young girl nicknamed Newt who used the ventilation system to evade capture or death. The crew uses the colony's computer to locate the colonists grouped beneath the fusion powered atmosphere processing station. They head to the location, descending into corridors covered in Alien secretions. At the center of the station, the marines find the colonists cocooned, serving as incubators for the Aliens' offspring. When the marines kill a newborn Alien, the Aliens are roused and ambush the marines, killing and capturing several. When the inexperienced Gorman panics, Ripley takes control of their vehicle and rams it through the nest to rescue marines Hicks, Hudson,... My question: Who threatens to expose Burke?

European higher education took place for hundreds of years in Christian cathedral schools or monastic schools (scholae monasticae), in which monks and nuns taught classes; evidence of these immediate forerunners of the later university at many places dates back to the 6th century. The earliest universities were developed under the aegis of the Latin Church by papal bull as studia generalia and perhaps from cathedral schools. It is possible, however, that the development of cathedral schools into universities was quite rare, with the University of Paris being an exception. Later they were also founded by Kings (University of Naples Federico II, Charles University in Prague, Jagiellonian University in Kraków) or municipal administrations (University of Cologne, University of Erfurt). In the early medieval period, most new universities were founded from pre-existing schools, usually when these schools were deemed to have become primarily sites of higher education. Many historians state that universities and cathedral schools were a continuation of the interest in learning promoted by monasteries. Try to answer this question if possible (otherwise reply \\"unanswerable\\"): Who presided over universities?","completion":"Okay, imagine you are in a big school where you and your friends learn new things every day.

Now, who was in charge of these universities? There was a person who made sure everything in the school was going well, just like a principal in your school.

They were a noble family that ruled the Duchy of Mantua in Northern Italy, and members of this family held various positions of power, including becoming bishops, cardinals, and even a saint. Luigi Gonzaga, also known as St. Aloysius Gonzaga, is remembered for his pious life, compassionate nature, and dedicated service to the sick and needy. He renounced his noble title and joined the Society of Jesus (Jesuits) at the age of 18 to lead an austere and religious life. Throughout his short life, he provided spiritual and material aid to the victims of the plague, which ultimately led to his own death in 1591 at the age of 23.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: The premiere, originally planned for 14 September 1863, was postponed to the 30th because of the illness of the soprano lead, Léontine de Maësen. The first-night audience at the Théâtre Lyrique received the work well, and called for Bizet at the conclusion. The writer Louis Gallet, who later would provide several librettos for Bizet, described the composer on this occasion as \\"a little dazed ... a forest of thick curly hair above a round, still rather childish face, enlivened by the quick brown eyes...\\" The audience's appreciation was not reflected in the majority of the press reviews, which generally castigated both the work and what they considered Bizet's lack of modesty in appearing on stage. Gustave Bertrand in Le Ménestrel wrote that \\"this sort of exhibition is admissible only for a most extraordinary success, and even then we prefer to have the composer dragged on in spite of himself, or at least pretending to be\\". Another critic surmised that the calls for the composer had been orchestrated by a \\"claque\\" of Bizet's friends, strategically distributed.Of the opera itself, Benjamin Jouvin of Le Figaro wrote: \\"There were neither fishermen in the libretto nor pearls in the music\\". He considered that on every page the score displayed \\"the bias of the school to which [Bizet] belongs, that of Richard Wagner\\". Bertrand compared the work unfavourably with those of contemporary French composers such as Charles Gounod and Félicien David. \\"Nevertheless\\", he wrote, \\"there is a talent floating in the midst of all these regrettable imitations\\". Hector Berlioz was a voice apart in the general critical hostility; his review of the work in Journal des Débats praised the music's originality and subtlety: \\"The score of Les pêcheurs de perles does M. Bizet the greatest honour\\", he wrote.

No The right answer to the question \\"what does a mirror reflect?\\" is not \\"watershred\\". A mirror reflects light in a way that preserves much of its original quality and allows us to see the image formed on its surface.

A watershred (or more commonly referred to as a watershed) is a different concept, unrelated to mirrors. A watershed is an area of land that catches and drains precipitation through a system of rivers, streams, and groundwater flow.

While some activists squarely place the blame on the police, others are still attempting to piece together the circumstances that led to these tragic deaths. As details emerge, the polarization around this issue reflects the larger divisions within Egyptian society, making the anniversary of the revolution a bittersweet recollection. With social media as a central stage for discourse and engagement, conversations about the past ten years since Egypt's revolution have become a focal point for citizens, activists, and intellectuals alike. As the dust settles, the country, and the world at large, must grapple with these tragic events and what they signify for the ongoing struggle for democracy, justice, and human rights in Egypt. With the truth remaining elusive and different accounts emerging, Egypt's revolution anniversary will forever be marred by the sorrow and loss experienced during these protests. Despite these recent tragedies, the spirit of the revolution lives on in the hearts of those who continue to fight for their dreams of a better future for Egypt and the world. As social media continues to play a crucial role in sharing the stories of ordinary people, the collective power of individuals to influence change remains a beacon of hope amid the darkness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this sentence, the user is stating that \\"Draw my thing\\" is a game inspired by the iSketch game, which, in turn, is also based on the well-known classic game Pictionary. To give you more insight into these three games: 1. \\"Draw my thing\\": This is an online drawing and guessing game where players take turns sketching their chosen word while others try to guess the word being drawn. It was a popular game on the OMGPOP platform, which gained massive attention around the years 2012-2013. The concept of the game is similar to that of iSketch and Pictionary. 2. iSketch: iSketch is another online multiplayer drawing and guessing game that was launched in the late 90s. It is played in multiple rounds, with each player having an opportunity to draw within a limited time frame. Other players try to guess the word and points are awarded to both the drawer and the guessers. This game is also a clone of Pictionary, replicating its core concept. 3. Pictionary: Pictionary is a classic drawing and word-guessing game developed in the 1980s. It is usually played by multiple players in teams, with one player drawing and the others guessing. The goal of the game is to guess the word that is being drawn within a set time frame, and points are awarded to the team that guessed correctly. Over the years, Pictionary has gained immense popularity and has inspired many online and offline games using similar drawing and guessing concepts, such as iSketch and \\"Draw my thing\\". In conclusion, the statement highlights the relationship between the three drawing and guessing games: \\"Draw my thing\\" was inspired by iSketch, and both games are clones of the original Pictionary concept."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analyses from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World. An extension pack to the popular party game Cards Against Humanity has drawn the ire of customers, and the Target US retail chain said it was pulling it from its shelves. The original game, which has been around since 2011, is designed specifically to be offensive. Players match cards to different categories and questions, to create shocking and humorous combinations. A variety of specialty themed extension packs are available on all sorts of topics, including science, food and weed. But the extension designed for Jewish audiences made waves on Twitter on Thursday for some questionable content. We are aware of this extended card pack of the game Cards Against Humanity and are in the process of removing it from our stores. We apologize for any disappointment as it is never our intention to offend our guests with the products we carry. Thank you! — AskTarget (@AskTarget) December 28, 2017 A user on Twitter posted images of the cards, including ones that say “torturing Jews until they say they’re not Jews anymore”; “the part of Anne Frank’s diary where she talks about her vagina”; and “Can’t you see, the Jews are behind everything – the banks, the media, even ____.”Other users who have shared images and video of the cards showed ones that said “suddenly remembering the Holocaust happened”; “hiding from the Nazis”; “some kind of concentrated encampment for people”; “demolishing that ass like a Palestinian village”; and “the blood of Christian babies.”The extension pack sold in Target was labeled “Chosen People,” but the “Jewish Pack” on the Cards of Humanity website has the same content. The extension pack isn’t new – in fact it has been around for two years. In January 2016, Tablet magazine shared some of the cards and called it “Good stuff.” More than 200 reviews for the product on Amazon.com gave it an average of 4.5 stars.The Twitter user who flagged the item, Mike Lieber, tagged Target, the store where he bought the game, in his tweet. In response, the chain said on Thursday: “We are aware of this extended card pack of the game Cards Against Humanity and are in the process of removing it from our stores. We apologize for any disappointment as it is never our intention to offend our guests with the products we carry.”Cards Against Humanity did not respond to a request for comment.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative (see options at the end)? chillingly Options are: * negative * positive","completion":"The sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" in the given sentence is negative. Now let's examine why this is the case. \\"Chillingly\\" is an adverb that is derived from the adjective \\"chilling,\\" which in turn comes from the verb \\"chill.\\" \\"Chill\\" has several meanings, but in the context of describing a feeling or atmosphere, it usually conveys a sense of coldness, both literally and metaphorically. When something is described as \\"chilling\\" or \\"chillingly,\\" it implies that it causes a feeling of fear, apprehension, or discomfort. In a literal sense, \\"chilling\\" might be used to describe cold weather, a freezing breeze, or a frigid environment. For example, you might say \\"The wind was chilling to the bone\\" when talking about a particularly cold day. In a metaphorical sense, \\"chilling\\" or \\"chillingly\\" is often used to describe a situation, experience, or atmosphere that evokes a feeling of unease, discomfort, or even horror. For instance, you might describe a scary book, movie, or real-life event as \\"chilling\\" if it makes you feel afraid, shocked, or disturbed. Examples of this might include \\"The book had a chillingly realistic portrayal of a dystopian society\\" or \\"The details of the crime were chilling.\\" Given that negative emotions of fear, unease, and discomfort are usually associated with \\"chillingly,\\" it's evident that the sentiment of this word is negative. Please note that without a specific sentence or context, we can only analyze the sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" itself. The sentiment of the entire sentence would depend on the surrounding context and the subject matter. However, based on the information provided, the sentiment of the word \\"chillingly\\" is negative."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Given the question: Given the background: Greenhouse Effect: The solar energy reaching the surface of the Earth is concentrated in short wavelengths, which can easily penetrate the greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide and methane. The Earth, however, is cooler than the sun and it radiates its heat in the form of energy in the far infrared range. These longer wavelengths are partially absorbed by the greenhouse gases and some of the solar heat is returned to Earth. At a certain temperature these processes are in equilibrium and the surface temperature of the Earth is stable. However, if more greenhouse gases are put in the atmosphere the amount of trapped terrestrial radiation increases, leading to an increase in global temperature. and the situation: David was visiting the natural history museum. He noticed two charts that showed the climatic conditions of the earth in two time periods, time A and time B. Time A showed earth's overall climate in the sixteenth century when there were less greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. And time B showed earth's overall climate in the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. David found some interesting differences between these two charts. Answer the following question: In which time global temperature would less likey be in equilibrium, time A or time B? The answer is:","completion":"Time B would be less likely to have global temperature in equilibrium compared to Time A. This conclusion can be drawn based on the information provided in the background and the situation described. In Time A, which represents the sixteenth century, there were fewer greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. During this period, the concentration of gases such as carbon dioxide and methane was lower than today. This implies that the absorption and trapping of the Earth's infrared radiation by the greenhouse gases would have been less pronounced, allowing more heat to escape back into space, keeping the Earth's temperature relatively stable and closer to a state of equilibrium. However, in Time B, which represents the present century, the situation is different. The levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere have significantly increased due to human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes, among others. The higher concentration of these gases leads to a more effective absorption and trapping of the Earth's infrared radiation, resulting in less heat being able to escape back into space. This increased heat trapping disrupts the equilibrium between the incoming solar energy and the outgoing terrestrial energy. Consequently, global temperatures rise, leading to climate change and a host of related consequences such as more frequent extreme weather events, melting ice caps, and rising sea levels, among others. Therefore, Time B, represented by the present century with more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, would be less likely to have a global temperature in equilibrium compared to Time A, the sixteenth century when greenhouse gases were comparatively lower in the atmosphere. This divergence from equilibrium highlights the urgent need for actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the impacts of climate change on the Earth's ecosystems and human societies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Why did Kenny fall asleep holding George's gun? Movie title: A Single Man Movie plot: Taking place over the course of a single day, November 30, 1962, a month after the Cuban missile crisis, A Single Man is the story of George Falconer (Colin Firth), a middle-aged English college professor living in Los Angeles. George dreams that he encounters the body of his longtime partner, Jim (Matthew Goode), at the scene of the car accident that took Jim's life eight months earlier. After awakening, George delivers a voiceover discussing the pain and depression he has endured since Jim's death and his intention to commit suicide that evening. George receives a phone call from his dearest friend, Charley (Julianne Moore), who projects lightheartedness despite her being equally miserable. George goes about his day putting his affairs in order and focusing on the beauty of isolated events, believing he is seeing things for the last time. Throughout, there are flashbacks to George and Jim's sixteen-year-long relationship. During the school day George comes into contact with a student, Kenny Potter (Nicholas Hoult), who shows interest in George and disregards conventional boundaries of student-professor discussion. George also forms an unexpected connection with a Spanish male prostitute, Carlos (Jon Kortajarena). That evening George meets Charley for dinner. Though they initially reminisce and amuse themselves by dancing, Charley's desire for a deeper relationship with George and her failure to understand his relationship with Jim angers George. George goes to a bar and discovers that Kenny has followed him. They get a round of drinks, go skinny dipping, and then return to George's house and continue drinking. George passes out and wakes up alone in bed with Kenny asleep in another room. George gets up and while watching Kenny discovers that he had fallen asleep holding George's gun, taken from the desktop, to keep George from committing suicide. George locks the gun away, burns his suicide notes and in a closing voiceover explains how he has rediscovered the ability \\"to feel, rather than think\\". As he... Answer:","completion":"Kenny fell asleep holding George's gun because he discovered George's intention to commit suicide. Throughout the movie, Kenny has shown interest in George and has overstepped the conventional boundaries of their student-professor relationship, symbolising a closeness, concern or need to protect George. After their night together, Kenny found George's gun on the desktop and took it, falling asleep with it in his possession. His likely intent was to ensure George couldn't access it in his depressive and suicidal state.

Help as much as you can. Given the question: Read the article and select the best answer. Article: Even kids know that we should wait for the traffic light to turn green before crossing a road, but not everybody follows this basic rule. \\"Chinese style road crossing\\" has become a hot expression recently. Chinese people \\"cross roads without thinking about traffic lights, so long as they are part of a crowd\\", said a post on Sina Weibo. A CCTV news program showed that in only an hour, more than 600 people ran red lights when crossing a road in Shijiazhuang, Hebei. Many people say that they jaywalk because the red light lasts too long. Such an opinion is supported by a research team at Tongji University. The team did research on people's waiting times at different road crossings from 2008 to 2010. They found that Chinese people would wait for 70 to 90 seconds before they lost their patience. \\"People are likely to run the red light when the waiting time is longer than they can bear ,\\"said Ni Ying, a member of the research team. However, a survey on Sina Weibo shows that nearly half of respondents believe that people jaywalk mainly because they disregard rules. \\"I always obey traffic rules. Time is important but safety should come first,\\"wrote \\"Qixiaoe\\"on Weibo. Many countries give out punishments to jaywalkers. In Singapore, the maximum can be three months in prison. Some Chinese cities have started taking some actions, too. For example, the first three people in a jaywalking group will be fined 50 yuan in Shijiazhuang. But calling on people to respect rules is more important. \\"To completely solve the problem, everyone should realize the importance of obeying the traffic rules,\\"Wang Jianping, a professor at Sichuan University, said to Huaxi Metropolis Daily.

Given the question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Water seeps into the remains - Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals - Crystalized minerals cause the remains to harden - The minerals form a fossil. The answer is:","completion":"The missing first step of the given process of fossil formation is: 1. Organism dies and becomes buried in sediment. To provide a comprehensive understanding, below is the entire process, including the missing first step and the provided steps, with detailed explanations: 1. Organism dies and becomes buried in sediment: This is the initial crucial stage of fossilization. When an organism dies, it can either decompose entirely or be preserved, leading to the possibility of fossil formation. For fossilization to occur, rapid burial in sediment is necessary, such as in environments like riverbanks, ocean floors, or lake beds. The sediment protects the remains from oxygen and other decomposers, thereby slowing down the decay process. 2. Water seeps into the remains: Following the burial, water that is rich in dissolved minerals and ions starts to seep into the remains of the organism. This groundwater permeates the porous spaces of the bones, shells, or other hard parts of the organism's remains. 3. Minerals dissolved in the water form crystals: As the mineral-rich water seeps into the organism's remains, the dissolved minerals gradually start to precipitate and form crystals within the gaps or empty spaces of the remains. This crystallization process is called permineralization. Common minerals that are involved in this process include quartz, calcite, and pyrite. 4. Crystallized minerals cause the remains to harden: Over time, the minerals in the form of crystals continue to accumulate and eventually replace the organic material of the remains. As more and more minerals infiltrate the remains, the process of petrification takes place, wherein the original structure of the organism's remains hardens due to the presence of the mineral crystals, preserving the original shape and form of the organism. 5. The minerals form a fossil: After the entire fossilization process has taken place, and all the organic material has been replaced by minerals, a fossil is formed. The hardened remains now serve as a permanent record of the organism's existence in the geologic past, providing valuable information about its morphology and history in the evolutionary timeline. This entire process can take thousands to millions of years, depending on the geological conditions and type of organism that is being fossilized. Through the study of fossils, scientists can better understand the Earth's history and the evolution of various species over time."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Choices: - kaleidoscope - rainbow - spots - spectrum A: Answer:","completion":"A: If you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum. When light passes through a prism, it is refracted or bent, which causes the various wavelengths of light to spread out and display a range of colors. This is known as dispersion. A star, like our Sun, emits light across a wide range of wavelengths, including visible light, ultraviolet, and infrared radiation. When the starlight passes through a prism, these wavelengths are further separated, creating a spectrum. The spectrum you would observe from looking at a star through a prism is composed of a series of colors, typically spanning from red to violet, which is the range of visible light. These colors represent the electromagnetic radiation emitted by the star at different energies. Each color corresponds to a specific wavelength, and the distribution of colors will depend on the star's temperature, composition, and other factors. This visible spectrum is often referred to as a continuous spectrum because it consists of a continuous range of colors without any gaps. However, the star spectrum might also exhibit dark lines or bands known as absorption lines, which are the result of certain elements present in the star's outer layers absorbing specific wavelengths of light. These dark lines are key to understanding the chemical composition of a star, as each element creates a unique pattern of absorption lines. For instance, the presence of hydrogen in a star absorbs light at specific wavelengths, leading to the formation of hydrogen lines or the Balmer series in the visible spectrum. Analyzing these spectral lines allows astronomers to determine the chemical makeup of a star, its temperature, and other physical properties. To sum up, when you look at a star through a prism, you will see a spectrum rather than a kaleidoscope, rainbow, or spots. This spectrum is a representation of the star's emitted light, which is dispersed by the prism into its various wavelengths. Studying this spectrum gives astronomers valuable information about the properties and elements present in the star."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Like nothing you've ever seen,' said David Joseph, who lives across from where the incident occurred. Scroll down for videos. Accused: Hyphernkemberly Dorvilier has been charged with murdering her newborn baby. Her bail has been set at 50,000. Neighbor Joseph, 45, initially thought he had caught someone dumping garbage when she stepped out of her Land Rover - such was her calm demeanor. 'We saw the fire and we thought someone was over there burning trash,' he said. Joseph's wife then notice what was really going on and screamed. The woman then tried to flee but he managed to restrain her until police arrived. A makeshift memorial now stands where the baby was killed. Scene: Witnesses say 22-year-old mother got out of her car and stopped in the middle of Simontown Road in Pemberton Township, New Jersey, on Friday night and burned the child alive. 'It was just mind-boggling. It was a nightmare even if you have a strong heart. Hopefully she'll pay for it,' said Joseph. Dorvilier was arrested at the scene. She is being held on 500,000 bail, prosecutors said. Medics rushed to the scene and airlifted the young child, which was still alive and breathing when they arrived, to St Christopher's Hospital in Philadelphia with severe burns. However the baby succumbed to its injuries a short time later. Emergency services were called to the scene after residents described a 'commotion' inside a nearby home before the horrific act. The woman, who witnesses say lit the child on fire, was taken to Deborah Hospital, in Brown Mills, New Jersey according to NBC Philadelphia. She was then arrested after her condition stabilized.

Article: Cartoon Network’s satirical, smart Rick and Morty is huge among millennials, but an attempt by fast-food giant McDonald’s to capitalize on one of the show’s running gags appears to be backfiring. The backstory here is appropriately absurd. Rick and Morty, co-created by Community mastermind Dan Harmon, chronicles the adventures of an alcoholic superscientist and his mostly inept grandson, mixing absurd catchphrases, fantastic alien worlds, and extremely sharp storytelling into a cocktail that’s ripe for the internet age. One of the show’s gags had Rick obsessively questing for McDonald’s Szechuan nugget sauce, a promotional flavor briefly offered in conjunction with the Disney film Mulan 20 years ago. The show’s cultish fanbase responded en masse, starting a petition to bring back the sauce and talking it up endlessly online. McDonald’s execs hinted they might do just that, and made it official this week, saying the sauce would be available for just one day – today, October 7th – as part of a promotion for the chain’s new Buttermilk Crispy Tenders. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. But there are signs that the promotion is going south, with fans and news outlets reporting that supplies of the ironically prized sauce are running out almost instantly at the select locations where it was supposed to be available. On Twitter, some customers are claiming stores reported receiving only 20 cups of the prized sauce. Other customers are claiming stores haven’t received promised supplies at all. Though the fast-food chain was clear that supplies would be limited, fans on social media are nonetheless extremely frustrated with the situation. . @McDonalds I’m at the Merrimack,NH location for the Szechuan Sauce! I was told they didn’t get them! WTF!! pic.twitter.com/DKkRwAqV0l — chris macdonald (@cmacdonald) October 7, 2017 Really cool of @McDonalds to have a website telling people where they are giving out Szechuan sauce, only to find out some actually aren't — Spoopy Cripp💀🎃👻♿ (@YungCripp) October 7, 2017 The bigger problem is you lied about locations getting it, people went where you said to go, and employees had no clue. — Kyle Grantham (@kylegrantham) October 7, 2017 hey @McDonalds, when y'all said you would have limited supplies of szechuan sauce today, you weren't kidding. 20 cups per store? smh, c'mon. — Ryan Mathews (@Ryan_POD) October 7, 2017 mcdonalds really ruined the szechuan sauce promotion — ego (@EvgeniMaIkinEgo) October 7, 2017 One reason for the problems can be deduced from a quick search of eBay, where cups of the sauce are already being offered for hundreds of dollars each. McDonald’s has acknowledged customers’ frustration, but without offering any real remedy. Fortune has reached out for further comment. The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today. We hear you & we're sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan. — McDonald's (@McDonalds) October 7, 2017 A relaunch of an old McDonald’s nugget sauce might not seem like a big deal to most people, but this could turn into something serious for McDonald’s. Fans of Rick and Morty are passionate, and some mimic the show’s more acerbic elements by displaying a mean streak so broad it has included harassing the show’s own female writers. Mix that with internet savvy and a target as big as the Golden Arches, and you’ve got a recipe for spicy disaster. ||||| “I want that Mulan McNugget sauce, Morty,” says Rick at the end of season premiere. “That’s my series arc, Morty! If it takes nine seasons!” So last week, after fans petitioned and pressured the chain, McDonald’s finally gave in. Unfortunately the event was mostly a letdown, and “Rick and Morty” fans let everyone know how angry they were on Twitter. ||||| McDonald's is receiving major backlash after a failed attempt at bringing back a cult-favorite sauce. As previously reported, McDonald’s had agreed to bring back the discontinued Szechuan sauce following pleas from Cartoon Network’s adult cartoon, “Rick and Morty.” McDonald’s announced last week that for one-day only, the fast food restaurant would carry the Szechuan sauce for customers at participating locations. BURGER KING ITEM HITS GROCERY STORES That one day – Saturday, October 7 – “Rick and Morty” and Szechuan sauce fans gathered outside McDonald’s restaurants nationwide. Thousands lined up hours before the packets were allowed to be sold, all clamoring for the sweet plum sauce. However, McDonald’s failed to mention in any of their widespread promos that only 20 packets of the highly anticipated sauce would be available at the stores. The Huffington Post reported that some locations listed online as participating stores didn’t actually have the sauce packets at all or some had sold out before the authorized selling time. Once the fans realized that the sauce had been sold out after waiting in line for hours, they were outraged. So much so that the police had to be called to disband an angry crowd surrounding a Wellington, Fl. McDonald’s. At another McDonald’s, a mob chanting, “we want sauce,” formed, and the police had to push them back. Other locations, adults left angry and kids left crying. The disgruntled customers took to Twitter to vent their frustrations at the chain, claiming false advertising and calling for both a “class action lawsuit” and a “boycott.” The latter became a trending hashtag for the day, #boycottMcDonalds. FOLLOW US ON FACEBOOK FOR MORE FOX LIFESTYLE NEWS McDonald’s responded to the outrage, issuing a public apology on their Twitter account. “The best fans in the multiverse showed us what they got today,” McDonald’s tweeted. “We hear you & we’re sorry not everyone could get some super-limited Szechuan.” Fans weren’t buying it, and accused the hamburger joint of just wanting the publicity. The fast-food giant later released a second apology on Facebook, and promised that there would be more sauce on the horizon. \\"...Our super limited batch, though well-intentioned, clearly wasn't enough to meet that demand,\\" reads the statement. \\"...So, we are going to make this right. ... Szechuan Sauce is coming back again this winter.\\" ||||| Image copyright Twitter Image caption McDonalds sent the out-of production sauce to the show's creators before announcing its return A McDonald's PR stunt to bring back a rare dipping sauce left thousands of fans disappointed, with police called to some US restaurants on Saturday. The Szechuan sauce, which was only made in 1998 to promote the film Mulan, has become well known after featuring in the popular cartoon Rick and Morty. In July the chain sent a large bottle of the sauce to the show's creators. They then announced it would come back for one day on 7 October, but fans were left disappointed after stores ran out. In one video, police can be seen holding back people chanting \\"we want sauce\\". Officers also attended other stores because hundreds of people turned up. The sauce became a meme among fans of the adult animated science-fiction series after it was featured in the third series. McDonald's announced the Szechuan's return last week, describing it as a \\"really, really limited release\\" to special locations in the US. But fans online said some restaurants claimed they were only given 20 pots of the sauce per venue, while others received none. Fans took to social media to vent their frustrations after being unable to get their hands on the out-of-production dip. One couple posted that they had driven for four hours to a restaurant stocking the sauce, but were left disappointed. The global fast food chain apologised to fans on social media but repeated their warning that the release was going to be \\"super limited\\". Pots of the sauce are now listed for sale on online auction websites for hundreds of dollars. Angry customers posted pictures of breaded chicken and dipping sauces from other fast-food chains in protest at the stunt. Others posted pictures of large bowls of the sauce they had made for themselves at home. ||||| Tweet with a location You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

Article:The Foxes, who are now level on points with leaders Arsenal, looked like they were heading for a fourth league game without a goal until unmarked Huth headed home Christian Fuchs' corner. Harry Kane had Spurs' best chance when his effort was touched on to the bar by keeper Kasper Schmeichel. Foxes striker Jamie Vardy returned from groin surgery but had a quiet game. It was the second of three meetings between the clubs in 10 days, following Sunday's 2-2 FA Cup draw - with their replay to be shown on BBC One, next Wednesday. Relive Leicester's win over Tottenham. Listen: 'Leicester would be devastated not to make Champions League now' Football Daily podcast - Does anyone want to win the league? Media playback is not supported on this device There had been fears Leicester's slide was beginning after three games without scoring - and they looked like making that four in a row before Huth's late goal. But this win - which takes them seven points above fourth-placed Spurs and eight clear of West Ham in fifth - will give them real hope of finishing in the Champions League places, if not higher. They were characteristically short of possession with only 39% - their average of 40.62% is the third lowest in the league - but they have shown they are far from a two-man team with Riyad Mahrez and Vardy, their two stars of the campaign, subdued throughout. Maybe, but it was wasteful finishing rather than the lack of a second striker that cost Spurs against the Foxes. Manager Mauricio Pochettino has continually insisted it is not urgent they sign a new striker to partner Kane, who is their top scorer with 11 league goals. The England international was their sole striker against Leicester but Spurs' formation meant Erik Lamela, Christian Eriksen and Dele Alli got forward to support him regularly. Those four had a combined 18 shots, although Kane's effort which Schmeichel touched on to the bar was one of only five shots on target the team managed. Former England captain Alan Shearer on Match of the Day: \\"It's a remarkable story for Leicester. Only Manchester City have scored more goals than them. \\"It was a good old-fashioned proper plant your feet, arch your back and get your neck muscles going header from Huth. Look at the power. Boof.\\" Ex-Germany midfielder Dietmar Hamann: \\"It's a blip for Spurs. They're still in a good position and favourites to reach the Champions League. The worry is the lack of form from Christian Eriksen, who hasn't scored in the league since October. They are over-reliant on Harry Kane. If he gets injured they'll be in trouble.\\" Leicester boss Claudio Ranieri told BBC Match of the Day: \\"We wanted to win but we knew it was a difficult match. Tottenham started very well and put us under pressure but we didn't lose our confidence or shape and it was difficult for them. \\"In the second half it was an open match. We both had chances and we scored the goal. Unfortunately it's January, not May. There's so much work to do. We have to remain calm and believe in what we're doing.\\" Media playback is not supported on this device Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino: \\"I'm disappointed. We created the better chances. You need to score. We need to keep calm and try to improve. \\"All the stats are positive for us. It's difficult to explain - we deserved more and to win the game.

Solve -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r.","completion":"To solve the equation -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r, we will follow these steps: Step 1: Simplify both sides of the equation On the left side of the equation, we have -10*r + 629. On the right side of the equation, we can simplify the expression 326 + 343 by summing those numbers: 326 + 343 = 669 So, the equation now looks like this: -10*r + 629 = 669 Step 2: Isolate the term with the variable (r) Now, we want to isolate the term with the variable r on one side of the equation. To do this, let's subtract 629 from both sides of the equation: -10*r + 629 - 629 = 669 - 629 This simplifies to: -10*r = 40 Step 3: Solve for the variable (r) Now we have an equation with just one term containing the variable r. To solve for r, we simply need to divide both sides of the equation by -10: (-10*r) / -10 = 40 / -10 This simplifies to: r = -4 So, the solution to the equation -10*r + 629 = 326 + 343 for r is: r = -4"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: - Acid rain leaches aluminum from clay particles in soil - Aluminum flows into streams and lakes - Acid rain dissolves minerals and nutrients in soil - Washes them away so plants can&#x27;t benefit from them - PH in soil and water gets affected which can kill plants and animals What might be the last step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The last step of the process could be the disruption of entire ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and adverse impact on human activities and well-being. When the pH in the soil and water is altered due to acid rain, it can have fatal consequences for plants and aquatic organisms. This imbalance in pH levels affects the overall health of these living organisms, making them more susceptible to diseases, limiting their growth, and potentially causing their demise. As a result, there is a decline in the populations of affected species, leading to an imbalance in the food chain. The food chain is an interconnected web of organisms, where each species relies on another for sustenance. The disruption of one species can have further reaching implications on other dependent species, leading to a cascade effect that negatively impacts the entire ecosystem. The loss of biodiversity can lead to reduced ecosystem resilience, as fewer species are available to perform essential roles such as pollination, regulation of pests, and nutrient cycling. The impacts of acid rain are not limited to natural ecosystems but can extend to human activities as well. The leaching of essential minerals and nutrients from the soil can reduce agricultural productivity, leading to decreased crop yields and food supply. This can have detrimental social and economic consequences, particularly for communities that heavily rely on agriculture as their primary source of income and sustenance. Furthermore, the contamination of freshwater resources due to the influx of aluminum and other pollutants can result in the deterioration of water quality. This can make the water unsafe for human consumption, posing health risks and necessitating expensive water treatment processes. Moreover, it can impact other human activities such as industries, power generation, and recreational activities, all of which rely on clean water. In conclusion, the last step of the process initiated by acid rain leaching aluminum from clay particles in the soil can be the disruption of entire ecosystems, biodiversity loss, and adverse impact on human activities and well-being. To mitigate these effects and preserve the balance of our natural environment, it is crucial to address the primary sources of acid rain, such as the emission of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides from power plants, industries, and transportation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Jewish community had challenged the ban, introduced in 2013, saying that it was discriminatory. The Constitutional Court had previously ruled that it was against Polish law to allow animals to be killed without first being stunned. But to produce kosher and halal meat, animals must be uninjured before death. The ban had been challenged by the Union of Jewish Religious Communities on the grounds that it impacted on their constitutional right to practise their religion and prevented minority communities from following their traditions. The court ruled that the ritual slaughter of animals should be allowed on the grounds of religious freedom. The ritual slaughter of animals had been practised in Poland for centuries by both Jews and Muslims, the court's judge said. Under Jewish and Islamic law, animals must be healthy and uninjured at the time of death, which usually rules out normal stunning methods that involve electrocution or shooting the animal with a metal bolt. Animals are traditionally slaughtered with a single, rapid cut to the throat in Muslim and Jewish communities. Before the ban, Poland had been a major exporter of kosher and halal meat and poultry to the Middle East. The reversal of the ban also allows for a resumption of exports, Jewish leaders say. Animal rights groups had welcomed the ban, saying the practice caused animals unnecessary suffering. Israel, however, criticised it, noting that the Nazis had done the same thing during their occupation of Poland during World War Two. What was that article about?","completion":"The article is about the challenge and reversal of a ban on ritual slaughter of animals in Poland for producing kosher and halal meat.

Q:Given the following context: Metallica opted for extensive touring instead of releasing a single or video to promote the album. Metallica spent March to August 1986 touring as the opening act for Ozzy Osbourne in the United States, the first tour Metallica played to arena-sized audiences. During sound checks, the group played riffs from Osbourne's previous band Black Sabbath, which Osbourne perceived as a mockery toward him. Referring to that occasion, Ulrich stated that Metallica was honored to play with Osbourne, who treated the band well on the tour. Metallica was noted by the media for its excessive drinking habit while touring and earned the nickname \\"Alcoholica\\". The band members occasionally wore satirical T-shirts reading \\"Alcoholica/Drank 'Em All\\". The band usually played a 45-minute set often followed by an encore. According to Ulrich, the audiences in bigger cities were already familiar with Metallica's music, unlike in the smaller towns they've visited. \\"In the B-markets, people really don't know what we're all about.

Title: The Amazing Mr Blunden Movie plot: The film begins in 1918,[2] where a war widow, Mrs. Allen (Dorothy Alison) and her children, Lucy (Lynne Frederick), Jamie (Garry Miller) and baby Benjamin are reduced to living in a squalid, Camden Town flat. Just before Christmas, a mysterious old man, Mr. Frederick Percival Blunden (Laurence Naismith) visits the family, introducing himself as a representative of a firm of solicitors.[2] The family are told there is an opportunity to become the caretakers of a derelict country mansion in the Home Counties named Langley Park, which was gutted by fire years before, and is now in the charge of the solicitors. Mrs. Allen takes the post despite rumours that the house is haunted, her instructions to care for the property until such time as the heirs to the estate can be traced. The air of mystery deepens when the children see a portrait at the solicitors office of a man they believe to be Mr Blunden. The solicitor confirms this, but reveals that the portrait is of a man called Mr Blunden, but who has been dead for a hundred years.[6] After they have settled into the new post, Lucy and Jamie see two ghostly figures in the grounds of the house: a teenage girl, Sara Latimer (Rosalyn Landor), and her younger brother, Georgie (Marc Granger). They are two children who lived in the house a century earlier.[7] Sara tells them that she and her brother are orphans, under the care of their dissolute and hapless Uncle Bertie (James Villiers) and the solicitor Mr. Blunden, until Georgie comes of age. Bertie marries a music hall performer, Bella Wickens[8] and her parents then move into Langley Park, ostensibly as the housekeeper and game keeper.[8] The children come to suspect that Mrs. Wickens (Diana Dors) and her disturbed (and often violent) husband are plotting to kill them to get hold of Georgie's inheritance.

What might be the first step of the process? Answer:","completion":"The first step of the process is when the star, specifically a red giant, begins to run out of fuel in its core. Due to the lack of fuel, the star cannot generate enough energy through nuclear fusion to maintain a balance against the force of gravity, which is constantly trying to compress the star. The core's decreased mass and increased gravitational pressure trigger hydrogen fusion in a shell outside the core, and this causes the star's outer layers to expand and heat up.

Question: Who does Catherine start a relationship with? Movie title: Jules and Jim Movie plot: The film is set before, during and after the Great War in several different parts of France, Austria, and Germany. Jules (Oskar Werner) is a shy writer from Austria who forges a friendship with the more extroverted Frenchman Jim (Henri Serre). They share an interest in the world of the arts and the Bohemian lifestyle. At a slide show, they become entranced with a bust of a goddess and her serene smile, and travel to see the ancient statue on an island in the Adriatic Sea. After encounters with several women, they meet the free-spirited, capricious Catherine (Jeanne Moreau), a doppelgÃ¤nger for the statue with the serene smile. The three hang out together. Although she begins a relationship with Jules, both men are affected by her presence and her attitude toward life. Jim continues to be involved with Gilberte, usually seeing her apart from the others. A few days before war is declared, Jules and Catherine move to Austria to get married. Both men serve during the war, on the opposing sides; each fears throughout the conflict the potential for facing the other or learning that he might have killed his friend. After the wartime separation, Jim visits, and later stays with, Jules and Catherine in their house in the Black Forest. Jules and Catherine by then have a young daughter, Sabine.

She flirts with and attempts to seduce Jim, who has never forgotten her. Jules, desperate that Catherine might leave him forever, gives his blessing for Jim to marry Catherine so that he may continue to visit them and see her.

It seems that the reviewer had some expectations and anticipated a higher quality, better value, or superior service, given the price they paid. However, it implies that the product or service did not meet these expectations, leaving the reviewer disappointed and possibly dissatisfied. The negative sentiment in this review is primarily driven by the word \\"better,\\" which in this case highlights the discrepancy between what was expected and what was actually received. Moreover, the mention of \\"price\\" implies that the expense might have been a major factor in the formation of these expectations, as higher-priced items or services often come with the assumption of superior quality, performance, or convenience. Additionally, the use of a comparison term \\"better\\" suggests that the reviewer might have previous experiences or knowledge regarding similar products or services. The fact that they are comparing the quality to their prior expectations or experiences further emphasizes the dissatisfaction expressed in their statement. While the review is not overly critical or scathing, it does give other potential buyers or clients an indication that they might want to reconsider or look for alternatives before investing their money into this particular product or service.

Answer the following question: Two coastal communities on two neighboring gulfs took different approaches to bringing more money into the local economy. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, while the village of Forx decided to mine sand from the nearby dunes, because it was very profitable. They did not think about the effect it would have on the environment. Which village was less thoughtful about the environment? Answer:","completion":"The village of Forx was less thoughtful about the environment in comparison to Davin village. While both communities aimed to bring more money into the local economy, they adopted different approaches that had contrasting impacts on the environment. Davin village continued with commercial fishing and agriculture, which are traditional and sustainable economic activities that usually have minimal impacts on the environment when practiced responsibly and with proper management systems in place. For example, maintaining appropriate fishing limits helps maintain fish populations, and utilizing eco-friendly agricultural practices supports soil health and reduces water pollution from nutrient run-off. In contrast, the village of Forx opted to mine sand from the nearby dunes, which they found to be very profitable. However, they did not consider the potential environmental consequences of their actions. Sand mining, particularly when carried out irresponsibly and without proper environmental safeguards, can cause significant environmental problems such as: 1. Disruption of local ecosystems: Sand mining can lead to the loss of habitat for various plant and animal species, reducing biodiversity and damaging ecosystems that play vital roles in maintaining environmental balance. 2. Soil erosion and sedimentation: Mining sand can cause the removal of the protective topsoil layer, which can lead to increased erosion and sedimentation in nearby water bodies. As a result, water quality declines, and the sediment can smother aquatic life, leading to long-term changes in the composition and structure of these ecosystems. 3. Groundwater depletion: Extensive sand mining can lead to the depletion of local groundwater resources, particularly when it lowers the water table. This can, in turn, affect the availability of water for human consumption, agriculture, and other uses. 4. Coastal changes: The removal of sand from dunes can lead to changes in the coastal landscape, increasing susceptibility to erosion, flooding, and storm surges. These changes can have adverse consequences not only for the environment but also for local economies, infrastructure, and the safety of the residents. Considering the outlined environmental consequences of sand mining and the more sustainable approach taken by Davin village through commercial fishing and agriculture, it becomes clear that the village of Forx was less thoughtful about the environment in their pursuit of economic growth. If Forx had considered the long-term consequences and externalities of their actions, they might have implemented more eco-friendly strategies or regulations to minimize the negative impacts of their sand mining activities. Therefore, this case highlights the importance of considering not only economic gains but also the environmental consequences when making decisions for the development of local economies."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Would the following phrase be considered positive or negative? flavorful performances","completion":"To determine whether the phrase \\"flavorful performances\\" is positive or negative, let's break it down and analyze it step by step. Step 1: Identify the individual words in the phrase - flavorful - performances Step 2: Analyze the meaning and connotation of each word - Flavorful: Having a strong or pleasant taste or aroma. The word typically has a positive connotation as it indicates something being rich and enjoyable in terms of taste or experience. - Performances: A presentation of an artistic work such as acting, dancing, singing, or playing music. The word itself is neutral since it doesn't inherently suggest a positive or negative evaluation of the presentation. Step 3: Analyze the phrase as a whole The phrase \\"flavorful performances\\" combines a positive adjective (flavorful) with a neutral noun (performances). As the adjective color the perception of the noun, in this case, 'flavorful' may imply that the performances are rich, enjoyable, and/or engaging. Based on this analysis, I would consider the phrase \\"flavorful performances\\" to have a positive connotation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Maelgwn Gwynedd (Latin: Maglocunus; died c. 547) was king of Gwynedd during the early 6th century. Surviving records suggest he held a pre-eminent position among the Brythonic kings in Wales and their allies in the \\"Old North\\" along the Scottish coast. Maelgwn was a generous supporter of Christianity, funding the foundation of churches throughout Wales and even far beyond the bounds of his own kingdom. Nonetheless, his principal legacy today is the scathing account of his behavior recorded in De excidio In his work On the Ruin and Conquest of Britain written c. 540, Gildas makes an allegorical condemnation of 5 British kings by likening them to the beasts of the Book of Revelation, 13-2: the lion, leopard, bear, and dragon, with the dragon supreme among them. He says that Maelgwn is the \\"dragon of the island\\", and goes on with a litany of moral accusations, in the process describing him almost as a regional high king over the other kings (the power-giving dragon of the Apocalypse). The Isle of Anglesey was the base of power of the kings of Gwynedd, so describing Maelgwn as the \\"dragon of the island\\" is appropriate. Gildas restricts his attention to the kings of Gwynedd (Maelgwn), Dyfed (Vortiporius), Penllyn (probable, as its king Cuneglasus/Cynlas appears in royal genealogies associated with the region), Damnonia/Alt Clud (Constantine), and the unknown region associated with Caninus. The Welsh kingdoms are all associated with the conquest of the Gaels by Cunedda, while Alt Clud had a long and ongoing relationship with Gwynedd and its kings. In the course of his condemnations, Gildas makes passing reference to the other beasts mentioned in the Apocalypse, such as the eagle, serpent, calf, and wolf. The reason for Gildas' disaffection for these individuals is unknown. He was selective in his choice of kings, as he had no comments concerning the kings of the other British kingdoms that were thriving at the time, such as Rheged, Gododdin, Elmet, Pengwern/Powys, or the kingdoms of modern-day southern England. That he chose only the kings associated with one king's pre-eminence (Maelgwn, the \\"dragon\\") suggests a reason other than his claim of moral outrage over personal depravity. Neither outrage nor a doctrinal dispute would seem to justify beginning the condemnation of the five kings with a personal attack against the mother of one of the kings, calling her an \\"unclean lioness\\".Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What suggests this?","completion":"Maelgwn Gwynedd was a king in Wales a long, long time ago, around the early 6th century. He was very important and helped other kings in nearby areas. He also really liked the Christian religion and gave a lot of money to build churches. A man named Gildas wrote a book, and in the book, he compared Maelgwn to a dragon from a story in the Bible. Gildas said Maelgwn was the strongest and most important king, like the dragon. He also talked about other kings, but he didn't like some of them and said mean things about their families. This helps us understand that Maelgwn was an important king and that Gildas thought he was powerful, like a dragon in a storybook."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Movie plot title: The Hunchback of Notre Dame Movie plot: Quasimodo being offered water by Esmeralda. The story is set in Paris in 1482. Quasimodo is a deaf, half-blind, hunchbacked bell-ringer of the famous Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris. His master Jehan, the evil brother of Notre Dame's saintly archdeacon Don Claudio, prevails upon the hunchback to kidnap the fair Esmeralda, a dancing gypsy girl (and the adopted daughter of Clopin, the king of the oppressed beggars of Paris' underworld). The dashing Captain Phoebus rescues Esmeralda from Quasimodo, while Jehan abandons him and flees. At first seeking a casual romance, Phoebus becomes entranced by Esmeralda, and takes her under his wing. Quasimodo is sentenced to be lashed in the public square. After being whipped, he begs for water. Esmeralda pities him, and brings him some. To their dismay, Jehan and Clopin both learn that Phoebus hopes to marry Esmeralda, despite being engaged to Fleur de Lys. Phoebus persuades Esmeralda to accompany him to a ball celebrating his appointment as Captain of the Guard by King Louis XI. He provides her with rich garments and introduces her to their hostess, Madame de Gondelaurier, as a Princess of Egypt. Clopin, accompanied by his beggars, crashes the festivities and demands Esmeralda be returned. To avoid bloodshed, Esmeralda says that she does not belong with the aristocracy. Later, however, Esmeralda sends the street poet Pierre Gringoire to give Phoebus a note, arranging a rendezvous at Notre Dame to say goodbye to him. Before Phoebus arrives, he is stabbed in the back by Jehan. After Esmeralda is falsely sentenced to death for the crime, she is rescued from the gallows by Quasimodo and carried inside the cathedral, where he and Don Claudio grants her sanctuary. Don Claudio restrains Quasimodo from violence. Later that night, Clopin leads the whole of the underworld to storm the cathedral, and Jehan attempts to take Esmeralda, first by guile (telling her that Phoebus's dying wish was for him to take care of her), then by force.

The undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt because the Available choices: (1). undershirt is thick.; (2). shirt is thick.;","completion":"The undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt because the undershirt is thick. To understand why this is the case, let's explore the significant role undershirts play in a baby's wardrobe and how the thickness of the undershirt can affect the appearance of the baby when worn under a shirt. Undershirts, also known as vests or singlets, are the innermost layers of clothing worn by babies, providing comfort, warmth, and protection. They serve as the barrier between their sensitive skin and any possible irritants, such as zippers or buttons from their outer clothes like shirts, rompers, or dresses. Moreover, they absorb any excess sweat, preventing moisture from coming into contact with the baby's delicate skin. Babies can wear undershirts made of varying thickness, depending on factors such as the weather, the baby's activity level, and personal preference. A thicker undershirt provides additional warmth and insulation, making it suitable for colder climates, winter months, or babies who tend to feel cold easily. On the other hand, when a baby wears a thick undershirt under a shirt, it creates a fuller and bulkier appearance. This is because the thick material adds extra volume to the baby's silhouette, especially around the chest, shoulders, and arms. Consequently, it can give the illusion that the baby is bigger when wearing the undershirt, even if the shirt is also thick. In contrast, if a baby were to wear a thin undershirt under a thick shirt, the overall bulkiness would be primarily attributed to the shirt (option 2). However, since we are discussing that the undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt, it is evident that the undershirt is predominantly thick in this case (option 1). Moreover, a thick undershirt can often result in a snugger fit for the baby, especially when worn under clothes that are sized appropriately. This tight fit can cause the baby's features to be more pronounced, making the baby appear bigger. In contrast, a thin undershirt might lay flatter against the baby's body, producing a sleeker appearance, regardless of the shirt's thickness. In conclusion, the reason why the undershirt makes the baby look bigger and not the shirt is that the undershirt is thick. A thick undershirt adds extra volume and warmth to a baby's attire, creating a bulkier appearance when used as the innermost layer. This can give the illusion of a bigger-sized baby, regardless of whether the shirt worn over it is thick or not."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Article: Zhejiang's main manufacturing sectors are electromechanical industries, textiles, chemical industries, food, and construction materials. In recent years Zhejiang has followed its own development model, dubbed the \\"Zhejiang model\\", which is based on prioritizing and encouraging entrepreneurship, an emphasis on small businesses responsive to the whims of the market, large public investments into infrastructure, and the production of low-cost goods in bulk for both domestic consumption and export. As a result, Zhejiang has made itself one of the richest provinces, and the \\"Zhejiang spirit\\" has become something of a legend within China. However, some economists now worry that this model is not sustainable, in that it is inefficient and places unreasonable demands on raw materials and public utilities, and also a dead end, in that the myriad small businesses in Zhejiang producing cheap goods in bulk are unable to move to more sophisticated or technologically more advanced industries. The economic heart of Zhejiang is moving from North Zhejiang, centered on Hangzhou, southeastward to the region centered on Wenzhou and Taizhou. The per capita disposable income of urbanites in Zhejiang reached 24,611 yuan (US3,603) in 2009, an annual real growth of 8.3%. The per capita pure income of rural residents stood at 10,007 yuan (US1,465), a real growth of 8.1% year-on-year. Zhejiang's nominal GDP for 2011 was 3.20 trillion yuan (US506 billion) with a per capita GDP of 44,335 yuan (US6,490). In 2009, Zhejiang's primary, secondary, and tertiary industries were worth 116.2 billion yuan (US17 billion), 1.1843 trillion yuan (US173.4 billion), and 982.7 billion yuan (US143.9 billion) respectively.

The sentence \\"In those 2 years, awards totaling 17\\" tells us that the money from the awards added up to 17 in two years. Now, to understand if 17 is a very small amount, we have to compare it with other amounts or what we can buy with it. Let's say you want to buy a toy, and the toy costs 10. With 17, you can buy that toy and still have 7 left. In this case, 17 might not be a very small amount. However, if you want to buy a bicycle that costs 100, 17 is not enough, and we can consider it a small amount. So, it depends on what we compare it with or what we want to do with the 17. But generally speaking, when we talk about awards, usually the amounts are bigger.

Premise: \\"The rules are judgmental, not probabilistic.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The rules are more probabilistic than they are judgemental.\\"?","completion":"1. First, let's analyze the given premise: \\"The rules are judgmental, not probabilistic.\\" This statement asserts that the nature of the rules is based on judgment or evaluation, as opposed to being based on probabilities or likelihoods. 2. Now, let's look at the hypothesis we are investigating: \\"The rules are more probabilistic than they are judgmental.\\" This statement suggests that the rules favor a probabilistic approach over a judgmental one. 3. To determine if the premise entails the hypothesis, we must evaluate whether accepting the premise as true would necessarily lead to the truth of the hypothesis. In this case, we must examine if the premise confirming that rules are judgmental and not probabilistic would lead to the conclusion that rules are more probabilistic than judgmental. 4. Analyzing the relationship between the two statements, we can see that they are conflicting in nature. The premise asserts the rules are judgmental, not probabilistic, while the hypothesis proposes that the rules are more probabilistic than judgmental. 5. Since accepting the premise as true means that the rules are fundamentally based on judgment rather than probabilities, this directly contradicts the hypothesis, which claims the opposite: that the rules are more probabilistic. 6. Therefore, the given premise does not entail the hypothesis.

Jackson had 13 number-one singles in the US in his solo career—more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era—and estimated sales of over 350 million records worldwide making him one of the best-selling artists in music history. In 1989, Jackson's annual earnings from album sales, endorsements, and concerts were estimated at 125 million. Forbes placed Jackson's annual income at 35 million in 1996 and 20 million in 1997. In the year after his death, more than 8.2 million of Jackson's albums sold in the US, and 35 million albums worldwide, more than any other artist in 2009. In 2014, Jackson became the first artist to have a top ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. He became the first artist to sell one million music downloads in a week, with 2.6 million song downloads. Thriller, Number Ones and The Essential Michael Jackson became the first catalog albums to outsell any new album. Jackson also became the first artist to have four of the top 20 best-selling albums in a single year in the US.Forbes reported in August 2018 that Jackson's total career pretax earnings in life and death were 4.2 billion. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated 300 million in royalties. He may have earned another 400 million from concerts, music publishing (including his share of the Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos.Estimates of Jackson's net worth during his life range from negative 285 million to positive 350 million for 2002, 2003 and 2007.

Use the following highlights to write an article: Aquariums in Plymouth, Hull and Cheshire all received letters from PETA. Condemned popular attractions for serving seafood dishes to visitors. Compared the decision to offer fish to 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo' Aquariums have hit back, claiming food they serve is responsibly sourced.","completion":"Title: PETA Criticizes UK Aquariums for Serving Seafood Dishes – The Ethical Debate Introduction: Animal rights organization PETA has recently denounced three popular UK aquariums in Plymouth, Hull, and Cheshire for serving seafood dishes to their visitors. The group has accused these attractions of hypocritically claiming to educate the public about marine life while indirectly causing harm to fish species by contributing to their consumption. The Controversy: In the letters sent to the aquariums, PETA equated their decision to serve fish with the idea of 'serving monkey nuggets at a zoo,' highlighting the contradiction between promoting conservation and offering seafood to visitors. The organization believes that serving fish at these educational centers undermines their conservation message by supporting an industry linked to overfishing and environmental damage. Aquariums Respond: In response to PETA's criticism, the targeted aquariums have defended their position by asserting that the seafood they serve is responsibly sourced. They argue that their food suppliers adhere to strict sustainability standards, minimizing any potential harm to marine life and ecosystems. These establishments emphasize that by using responsible practices, they play a small and cautious role in fish consumption, promoting sustainable methods of harvesting marine life that are crucial for the planet's well-being. The Bigger Picture: While the aquariums involved in this dispute may claim to source their seafood responsibly, the overall global seafood industry does face significant ethical and environmental challenges. Overfishing, bycatch, and habitat destruction are just some of the issues that need to be addressed to ensure a more sustainable aquatic ecosystem for future generations. The PETA aquarium controversy shines a light on a broader issue faced by many conservatories, zoos, and other organizations dedicated to animal welfare and environmental stewardship. Can these institutions maintain the balance between fulfilling their educational and conservation goals while meeting the demands of visitors and observing ethical practices in every aspect of their operations? Conclusion: As the PETA-aquarium dispute continues to prompt discussion, it highlights the need for greater transparency and enforcement of ethical practices in the seafood industry. At the same time, it serves as a reminder to all organizations involved in the preservation of wildlife and natural habitats that their actions must align with the values they purport to uphold. Ultimately, this controversy should encourage further collaboration between animal rights organizations, the seafood industry, and public attractions to promote a more sustainable and ethically-conscious approach to protecting and preserving our planet's diverse and fragile ecosystems."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called for calm during a surprise visit to Jerusalem on Tuesday ahead of meetings with Israeli and Palestinian leaders, in a high-profile gambit to bring an end to a monthlong wave of violence. The visit comes amid unrest that erupted a month ago over tensions surrounding a Jerusalem holy site sacred to Jews and Muslims. It soon spread to Arab neighborhoods of east Jerusalem and then to the West Bank, Gaza and Israel. A spate of Palestinian attacks, most of which have involved stabbings, has caused panic across Israel and raised fears that the region is on the cusp of a new round of bloodshed. The violence continued in the West Bank on Tuesday. A Palestinian attacker rammed his car into a group of Israelis waiting at a bus stop at a junction on the outskirts of Jerusalem in the West Bank, the Israeli military said. He then attempted to stab bystanders. A civilian and a soldier were injured in the attack before the attacker was shot and killed, it said. Earlier, a 24-year-old Palestinian was shot dead by Israeli forces after he stabbed an Israeli military officer and lightly wounded him, the Israeli military and Palestinian health officials said. The military said it happened during a “violent riot” of Palestinian demonstrators. In a separate incident in the West Bank, an Israeli man was killed after being run over during a clash with Palestinians. The man exited his car after Palestinian demonstrators threw stones at it and he began to hit passing Palestinian cars with a large stick, according to an Associated Press photographer who witnessed the incident. The man hit a passing truck with the stick, and the truck ran the man over. The Israeli military confirmed his death. The truck driver turned himself in, saying he hit the Israeli by accident while trying to swerve out of the way, according to a Palestinian security official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the media. Ban arrived from Europe Tuesday afternoon and is set to meet with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in the West Bank and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. He called for calm during a press conference with Israeli President Reuven Rivlin and said “no society should live in fear.” “My visit reflects the sense of global alarm at the dangerous escalation in violence between Israelis and Palestinians,” he said. “I am here to encourage and support all efforts to lower tensions and prevent the situation from spinning out of control.” Ban added, “It’s not too late to avoid a broader crisis.” Prior to the visit, Ban issued a video message late Monday calling for calm on both sides. He said he understood the Palestinians’ frustrations, but that violence would only harm their legitimate aspirations. “I know your hopes for peace have been dashed countless times. You are angry at the continued occupation and expansion of settlements,” he said. “I am not asking you to be passive, but you must put down the weapons of despair.” Addressing Israelis, he said he understood their fears due to the security deterioration, but said there was no military solution. “When children are afraid to go to school, when anyone on the street is a potential victim, security is rightly your immediate priority,” he said. “But walls, checkpoints, harsh responses by the security forces and house demolitions cannot sustain the peace and safety that you need and must have.” Over the past month, 10 Israelis have been killed in Palestinian attacks, most of them stabbings. In that time, 43 Palestinians were killed by Israeli fire, including 21 labeled by Israel as attackers, and the rest in clashes with Israeli troops. An Eritrean migrant died after being shot by a security guard and beaten by a mob that mistakenly believed he was a Palestinian attacker. The initial outbreak of violence was fueled by rumors that Israel was plotting to take over Jerusalem’s most sensitive holy site, a hilltop compound revered by Jews as the Temple Mount and home to the Al-Aqsa Mosque, Islam’s third-holiest shrine and a key national symbol for the Palestinians. Israel has adamantly denied the allegations, saying it has no plans to change the status quo at the site, where Jews are allowed to visit but not pray. Israel has accused Palestinian leaders of incitement to violence over the site. But Jewish visits to the site have doubled since 2010 and senior members of Netanyahu’s government have called for Jewish prayer rights, fueling Palestinian concerns about the site. Israel has struggled to contain the attacks. Authorities have blocked roads and placed checkpoints at the entrances of Palestinian neighborhoods in east Jerusalem. Other security measures include ID checks and requiring some Palestinian residents to lift their shirts and roll up pant legs as they exit their neighborhoods to prove they are not carrying knives. Soldiers have been deployed in Jerusalem and cities across Israel. On Tuesday, the Israeli military arrested top Hamas official Hassan Yousef in the West Bank, saying he had been “actively instigating and inciting terrorism” by encouraging attacks against Israelis. “Hamas’ leaders cannot expect to propagate violence and terror from the comfort of their living rooms and pulpits of their mosques,” said Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, a military spokesman. Yousef is a co-founder of Hamas, the Islamic militant group that rules the Gaza Strip. His son, Mosab, spied for Israel between 1997 and 2007 and wrote a book about his experiences. Also Tuesday, the Israeli military demolished the home of a Palestinian who killed an Israeli woman last year. Maher Hashlamoun rammed his car into 25-year-old Dalia Lemkus in the West Bank last year and stabbed her several times before being shot and killed. His wife told Palestinian radio that soldiers evacuated their three-story building in Hebron and demolished the third floor apartment where her family lived. Lerner said the demolition “sends a clear message that there is a personal price to pay when you are involved in terror.” Summary:","completion":"The United Nations (UN) Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, made a surprise visit to Jerusalem on a mission to encourage peace between Israelis and Palestinians.

This article: Dr. Jan Żabiński is director of the Warsaw Zoo, one of the largest in 1930s Europe, assisted by his wife, Antonina. On September 1, 1939, the aerial bombardment of Warsaw and Invasion of Poland commences. Antonina and her son Ryszard (Timothy Radford and later, Val Maloku) barely survive. As Polish resistance collapses, Dr. Lutz Heck, head of the Berlin Zoo and Adolf Hitler's chief zoologist and Jan's professional rival, visits the zoo while Jan is away. He offers to house the prized animals until after the war, later returning with Nazi soldiers to shoot the rest. He develops a romantic interest in Antonina. The Jews of Warsaw are forced into the Ghetto. The Żabińskis' Jewish friends, Maurycy Fraenkel and his partner Magda Gross, seek a safe place for a friend's insect collection. Antonina offers to shelter Magda. Knowing they can be executed for helping Jews, Jan and Antonina decide to use the zoo to save more lives. They seek out Heck to propose turning the abandoned zoo into a pig farm to feed the German occupying forces, secretly hoping to bring food to the Ghetto. Heck, in need of a new site for his experiments in recreating Aurochs as a symbol of the Reich, agrees. Jan collects garbage from the Ghetto for the pigs and sees Jews starving. He begins working with the Underground Army to transport Jews to safehouses throughout the country. Jews are hidden in the zoo's cages, tunnels, and inside the Żabińskis' house. After some trepidation, Antonina agrees to help. The Żabińskis continue smuggling Jews out of the Ghetto. In 1942, the Germans begin deporting Jews to death camps. Jan has no choice but to help load them into cattle cars under the Germans' watch. contains an answer for the question: What Zoos are mentioned in the passage?, what is it ?","completion":"The zoos mentioned in the passage are the Warsaw Zoo and the Berlin Zoo."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The first iron-cased and metal-cylinder rocket artillery were developed by Tipu Sultan and his father Hyder Ali, in the 1780s. He successfully used these metal-cylinder rockets against the larger forces of the British East India Company during the Anglo-Mysore Wars. The Mysore rockets of this period were much more advanced than what the British had seen, chiefly because of the use of iron tubes for holding the propellant; this enabled higher thrust and longer range for the missile (up to 2 km (1 mi) range). After Tipu's eventual defeat in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War and the capture of the Mysore iron rockets, they were influential in British rocket development, inspiring the Congreve rocket, which was soon put into use in the Napoleonic Wars.According to Stephen Oliver Fought and John F. Guilmartin, Jr. in Encyclopædia Britannica (2008): Hyder Ali, prince of Mysore, developed war rockets with an important change: the use of metal cylinders to contain the combustion powder. Although the hammered soft iron he used was crude, the bursting strength of the container of black powder was much higher than the earlier paper construction. Thus a greater internal pressure was possible, with a resultant greater thrust of the propulsive jet. The rocket body was lashed with leather thongs to a long bamboo stick. Range was perhaps up to three-quarters of a mile (more than a kilometre). Although individually these rockets were not accurate, dispersion error became less important when large numbers were fired rapidly in mass attacks. They were particularly effective against cavalry and were hurled into the air, after lighting, or skimmed along the hard dry ground. Tipu Sultan, continued to develop and expand the use of rocket weapons, reportedly increasing the number of rocket troops from 1,200 to a corps of 5,000. In battles at Seringapatam in 1792 and 1799 these rockets were used with considerable effect against the British.\\" A:","completion":"The last name of the person who was defeated in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War is Sultan, as the person in question is Tipu Sultan."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What happened to Rochester during the siege that was made worse by heat and flies? ? It was probably William the Conqueror who gave the city and its castle to Bishop Odo of Bayeux, the king's half brother. On William's death in September 1087 his territories were divided between his two sons. Robert, the elder, inherited the title of Duke of Normandy and William Rufus became King of England. A significant number of Norman barons objected to dividing Normandy and England, and Bishop Odo supported Robert's claim to the English throne. Several others, including the earls of Northumberland and Shrewsbury and the Bishop of Coutances came out in support of Robert. Odo prepared Rochester Castle for war and it became one of the headquarters of the rebellion. Its position in Kent made it a suitable base for raids on London and its garrison could harry William's forces in the county. William set off from London and marched towards Rochester to deal with the threat. Before he arrived, news reached the king that Odo had gone to Pevensey Castle, which was under the control of Robert, Count of Mortain. William turned away from Rochester and seized Pevensey. The captured Odo was forced to swear to hand over Rochester to William's men. The king despatched a force with Odo in tow to demand Rochester's surrender. Instead of yielding, the garrison sallied and captured the entire party. In response William laid siege to the city and castle. Contemporary chronicler Orderic Vitalis recorded that the siege began in May 1088. Two siege-castles were built to cut off the city's supply lines and to protect the besiegers from sorties. Conditions within the city were dire: disease was rampant, exacerbated by the heat and flies. The garrison ultimately capitulated and terms were agreed. Odo, Eustace, Count of Boulogne, and Robert de Belleme, son of the Earl of Shrewsbury, were allowed to march away with their weapons and horses but their estates in England were confiscated. This marked the end of the castle's role in the rebellion, and the fortification was probably abandoned shortly afterwards. The siege-castles were... A:","completion":"During the siege of Rochester, the city and castle experienced dire conditions, which were made worse by heat and flies. Disease was rampant within the city, likely due to the unsanitary conditions that arose as a result of the ongoing assault and the large number of people confined in close quarters. The heat and the presence of flies further exacerbated the spread and intensity of the disease. These difficult circumstances contributed to the ultimate capitulation of the garrison and the surrender of the city to King William."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Eleven seconds into the descent, the FAA's air traffic control center in Cleveland received the first of two radio transmissions from the aircraft. During the first broadcast, the captain or first officer could be heard declaring \\"Mayday\\" amid the sounds of a physical struggle in the cockpit. The second radio transmission, 35 seconds later, indicated that the fight was continuing. The captain or first officer could be heard shouting:\\" Hey get out of here-get out of here-get out of here.\\" On the morning of 9/11, there were only 37 passengers on United 93-33 in addition to the 4 hijackers. This was below the norm for Tuesday mornings during the summer of 2001. But there is no evidence that the hijackers manipulated passenger levels or purchased additional seats to facilitate their operation. The terrorists who hijacked three other commercial flights on 9/11 operated in five-man teams. They initiated their cockpit takeover within 30 minutes of takeoff. On Flight 93, however, the takeover took place 46 minutes after takeoff and there were only four hijackers. The operative likely intended to round out the team for this flight, Mohamed al Kahtani, had been refused entry by a suspicious immigration inspector at Florida's Orlando International Airport in August. Because several passengers on United 93 described three hijackers on the plane, not four, some have wondered whether one of the hijackers had been able to use the cockpit jump seat from the outset of the flight. FAA rules allow use of this seat by documented and approved individuals, usually air carrier or FAA personnel. We have found no evidence indicating that one of the hijackers, or anyone else, sat there on this flight. All the hijackers had assigned seats in first class, and they seem to have used them. We believe it is more likely that Jarrah, the crucial pilot-trained member of their team, remained seated and inconspicuous until after the cockpit was seized; and once inside, he would not have been visible to the passengers.

Movie title: Cellular Movie plot: Jessica Martin (Kim Basinger), a high school biology teacher, takes her son Ricky to the school bus. After she returns home, several men kidnap her and confine her in the attic of their safe house. Ethan Greer (Jason Statham), the group leader, smashes the attic's telephone. Jessica uses the wires of the broken phone and randomly dials a number. She reaches the cell phone of Ryan (Chris Evans), a carefree young man who has just been dumped by his girlfriend, Chloe (Jessica Biel). Jessica persuades Ryan to go to the police station, where he briefly reports to Mooney, but has to leave to avoid losing connection. Ethan asks Jessica about something, which she denies knowing, and leaves to get Ricky. Overhearing them, Ryan gets to Ricky's school, only to see the boy kidnapped. He hijacks a security officer's car and gives chase. When his phone battery runs out, he takes the gun in the car, cuts in line at a shop and buys a charger. Deciding to check on Ryan's kidnapping claim, Mooney goes to Jessica's house. At the house, he finds Dana Bayback (Valerie Cruz), the kidnappers' accomplice, posing as Jessica. Believing the claim is a false alarm, Mooney leaves. With Ricky in tow, Ethan returns and asks Jessica about a place her husband Craig mentioned, \\"The Left Field\\", and learns that it is a bar at the Los Angeles International Airport. A cross-connection between phone lines causes Ryan to rob a nearby lawyer's cell phone and car. At the airport, Ryan plants the gun on one of the kidnappers, which trips the alarm. When security intervenes, the kidnappers flash police badges and apprehend Craig. After viewing a news report of a man holding up a store for a charger, Mooney identifies Ryan and calls Jessica's home. He notices the voice on the answering machine is different from that of the woman he met. The kidnappers learns that Craig put a videotape in a bank safe deposit box. One guards Jessica and Ricky, while the rest go to the bank. Ryan finds the box first and leaves with the video camera, but loses the lawyer's... Answer:","completion":"In the movie Cellular, Ryan (played by Chris Evans) is a carefree young man who becomes inadvertently involved in a kidnapping situation when Jessica Martin (played by Kim Basinger), a high school biology teacher, reaches his cell phone after being kidnapped and confined to an attic by a group of men led by Ethan Greer (portrayed by Jason Statham). As the story unfolds, Ryan deals with various individuals and situations in his attempt to help Jessica and rescue her and her son Ricky from their kidnappers. He first goes to the police station, where he reports the situation to Officer Mooney, but he has to leave quickly to avoid losing the phone connection with Jessica. Throughout the movie, Ryan encounters some challenges including his phone battery running out, having to hijack a security officer's car, and dealing with cross-connections between phone lines. Apart from dealing with Jessica, the kidnapping victim, and communicating with her throughout the film, Ryan also interacts with the kidnappers. Ethan, the group leader, searches for specific information that Jessica and her husband possess. Meanwhile, Ryan tries to prevent the kidnappers from hurting Jessica and her family by intercepting their plans and attempting to rescue Ricky from being kidnapped. In a crucial scene, Ryan goes to the Los Angeles International Airport, where he plants a gun on one of the kidnappers to trip the security alarm. However, the kidnappers manage to flash fake police badges, apprehending Jessica's husband, Craig. Officer Mooney plays an essential role in the movie, as he first disregards Ryan's claims. Later, he realizes something is amiss after recognizing that the voice on Jessica's home answering machine is different from the woman (Dana Bayback, portrayed by Valerie Cruz) he met at the house, who is the kidnappers' accomplice. This realization leads Mooney to become more invested in the case, ultimately assisting Ryan in the investigation. To summarize, Ryan predominantly deals with Jessica, the kidnapping victim, who he communicates with throughout the story. He also interacts with the kidnappers (Ethan, their leader, and their accomplices) as he tries to save Jessica and her family from their dangerous predicament. Additionally, Ryan deals with Officer Mooney, who, despite initial skepticism, later becomes a helpful ally in the investigation of the kidnapping as he comes to rely on Ryan's information and instincts. Therefore, as the protagonist, Ryan interacts with different characters, both allies and antagonists, throughout the film to achieve his ultimate goal of rescuing Jessica and her family from the dangerous situation they are in."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What site of battles taking place was suggested by Evans to not have been developed independently among the local population? ? In a 1946 paper, the folklorist John H. Evans recorded the existence of a local folk belief that a battle was fought at the site of the Coldrum Stones, and that a \\"Black Prince\\" was buried within its chamber. He suggested that the tales of battles taking place at this site and at other Medway Megaliths had not developed independently among the local population but had \\"percolated down from the theories of antiquaries\\" who believed that the fifth-century Battle of Aylesford, which was recorded in the ninth-century Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, took place in the area. Evans also recorded a local folk belief applied to all of the Medway Megaliths and which had been widespread \\"up to the last generation\\"; this was that it was impossible for anyone to successfully count the number of stones in the monuments. This \\"countless stones\\" motif is not unique to the Medway region, and can be found at various other megalithic monuments in Britain. The earliest textual evidence for it is found in an early 16th-century document, where it applies to the stone circle of Stonehenge in Wiltshire, although in an early 17th-century document it was applied to The Hurlers, a set of three stone circles in Cornwall. Later records reveal that it had gained widespread distribution in England, as well as a single occurrence each in Wales and Ireland. The folklorist S. P. Menefee suggested that it could be attributed to an animistic understanding that these megaliths had lives of their own.Several modern Pagan religions are practiced at the Medway Megaliths, with Pagan activity having taken place at the Coldrum Stones from at least the late 1980s. These Pagans commonly associated the sites both with a concept of ancestry and of them being a source of \\"earth energy\\". The scholar of religion Ethan Doyle White argued that these sites in particular were interpreted as having connections to the ancestors both because they were created by Neolithic peoples whom modern Pagans view as their \\"own spiritual ancestors\\" and because the sites were once...

Article: After entering World War II in December 1941 following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, Hawaii, the U.S. began to halt Japan’s aggressive expansion in the Pacific with important battle victories at Midway Island (June 1942) and Guadalcanal (August 1942-February 1943) in the South Pacific. American commanders next set their sights on an island-hopping campaign across the central Pacific. They intended to take the Marshall Islands followed by the Mariana Islands, then advance on Japan. Did You Know? In the 76-hour Battle of Tarawa, U.S. Marines suffered almost as many killed-in-action casualties as U.S. troops suffered in the six-month campaign at Guadalcanal Island. The Gilbert Islands, a group of 16 atolls near the equator, were viewed by the U.S. as a stepping stone to the Marshalls and became the first target of the Central Pacific Campaign. In November 1943, the U.S. launched an offensive code-named Operation Galvanic, in which the prime target was the tiny island of Betio in the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands. (As part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. would also send a smaller force to the Gilberts’ Makin Atoll, some 100 miles north of Tarawa. Compared with the taking of Tarawa, the U.S. faced far less Japanese resistance at Makin and the Americans secured the atoll by November 23, 1943.) In late December 1941, Tarawa, a coral atoll located some 2,500 miles southwest of Hawaii, had been seized by the Japanese, who heavily fortified Betio, Tarawa’s largest island. By November 19, 1943, American warships had arrived near Tarawa. Naval and air bombardments were planned for the next morning with the goal of weakening Japan’s defenses and clearing the way for 18,000 U.S. Marines to seize the island. However, the taking of Tarawa would prove to be more difficult than the Americans had anticipated. ||||| Alexander “Sandy” Bonnyman Jr. had grown up in Knoxville before serving in the Marine Corps during World War II and receiving the Medal of Honor posthumously for heroism on the island of Tarawa in 1943. Later this year, he will finally receive a hero’s welcome, too, when his recently found body is returned to Knoxville for burial. Clay Bonnyman Evans of Colorado, the Marine’s grandson, confirmed over the telephone Monday that he and a team of researchers from History Flight had found Bonnyman’s remains in a grave with a few dozen other Marines in late May. “It was amazing,” said Evans, who was serving as a volunteer with the non-profit group that works with the Defense POW/MIA Accounting Agency to recover remains of missing military personnel. “I didn’t count on this happening. When it did, I was shocked. I dropped my video camera and had tears in my eyes.” He said researchers were able to identify his grandfather’s body through dental records that revealed his distinctive dental work. A cigarette lighter and a piece of metal that Evans is hoping is his grandfather’s dog tag were also recovered. DNA verification is also being done, he said. First Lt. Bonnyman had grown up in Knoxville as the son of Alex Bonnyman Sr., who was the chairman of the Blue Diamond Coal Co. and built a home designed by Charles Barber on Kingston Pike just west of the University of Tennessee campus. After attending J.A. Thackston School in Knoxville and later boarding high school in New Jersey, the younger Bonnyman played on the football team at Princeton University. He was briefly in the Army Air Corps in the early 1930s as a flying cadet, but later married, had three daughters and bought a copper mine in New Mexico before entering military service in World War II in the Marines. According to his Medal of Honor citation, Bonnyman, a combat engineer, was on the South Pacific atoll of Tarawa in November 1943 when he led his demolition team on an assault on a Japanese bomb shelter. He was eventually able to reach the top of the shelter and help flush out several of the enemy. As the Japanese began to fight back, Bonnyman remained in a forward position and was eventually killed, but not before he killed several Japanese troops, his citation said. For his actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor in 1947 by the secretary of the Navy, and his 12-year-old daughter, Frances, accepted the award for the family. Evans added that his grandfather is scheduled to be brought to Knoxville for burial in the family plot at Highland Memorial Park near Kingston Pike in Bearden, probably in September. “I think it is going to be a big deal,” Evans said, adding that he has been in preliminary discussions with the U.S. Marines. ||||| Lost since 1943, remains of Alexander 'Sandy' Bonnyman unearthed on Pacific isle Kristen N. Baker, History Flight's lead archeologist, carefully exposes the remains of 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr. on Betio, part of the Tarawa Atoll, on May 28. Bonnyman was killed on the island in 1943, and his family — members of which now live in Boulder County — has spent decades searching for his remains. ( Courtesy Clay Bonnyman Evans / History Flight ) In Highland Memorial Park in Knoxville, Tenn., a large marble headstone stands in honor of 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., a Marine killed in action Nov. 22, 1943, during World War II's Battle of Tarawa. Etched upon its surface, the only reference to the empty earth beneath it, are the words \\"buried at sea.\\" For nearly 70 years, Bonnyman's family — members of which now live in Boulder County — remembered the handsome, adventurous man they had lost with what few artifacts they had left: his Medal of Honor, awarded posthumously for his efforts to hold back a Japanese counterattack; a large portrait, commissioned from an Italian oil painter; and a few black-and-white photographs taken during the assault on Betio. Clay Bonnyman Evans, a former Daily Camera journalist, holds a picture of his grandfather, 1st Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., at his mother's home in Gunbarrel on Monday. (Ryan Gooding / For the Camera) After his death, the military issued a letter stating that most of the Tarawa war dead were presumed lost at sea near the island. But without conclusive proof that Bonnyman was among them, his family began a decades-long campaign to procure information about their beloved soldier's final resting place. It's a campaign that now, finally, has come to an end. Bonnyman's skeletal remains were unearthed on the island of Betio, in the central Pacific southeast of the Marshall Islands, last month. The remains, along with those of 35 other U.S. Marines, were uncovered by an archaeological team from History Flight, the result of a 10-year, multimillion dollar effort by the Florida nonprofit group to find and recover missing U.S. service members.

I never thought it would,\\" Bonnyman's oldest daughter, Frances Evans, now 81, said Monday from her home in Gunbarrel. \\"My grandfather had written lots of letters ... without any success. It came as a shock. It was a bit of a jolt.\\" Clay Bonnyman Evans, a former Daily Camera reporter and editor who lives in Niwot, was on Betio the day his grandfather's remains were uncovered. First Lt. Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr. is among the U.S. Marines seen in this photo taken during the Battle of Tarawa in November 1943. (WO Obie Newcomb Jr. / National Archives) \\"It feels great,\\" Clay Evans said Monday of the culmination of his family's generation-spanning quest. \\"My great-grandparents really worked hard to get his remains back. They wrote letters, and they just sort of got every story in the book from the military; they thought they would never have his remains.\\" The 'unrecoverable' dead While several hundred remains were exhumed on Betio by an American Graves Registration Service team in June 1946, the search was largely abandoned, and, in 1949, hundreds of war dead on the island were declared \\"unrecoverable\\" by the Quartermaster General's office, according to History Flight. Over the years, letters and calls went unanswered as Bonnyman's family sought answers, and the details of the soldier's death and burial became even further muddied in the memories of his loved ones. A glimmer of hope came in 2010, when a joint team from the Defense POW and MIA Accounting Agency began a recovery mission on the Gilbert Islands in hopes of locating the mass graves in which U.S. and Japanese soldiers were said to have been buried. That was the first time members of Bonnyman's family — some of whom were unaware the remains were still missing — heard that there might be chance of recovery. History Flight's own efforts had begun in 2006. Using magnatomatry, radar scans and cadaver dogs, as well as hundreds of interviews with surviving veterans of the Battle of Tarawa, a map of burial sites began to take shape. Burial markers erected by naval construction crews after the war were nearby the original, temporary markers constructed by Marines that identified the graves' actual locations. \\"The monuments were in the proximity, but not right on top of them,\\" said Mark Noah, founder and director of History Flight. \\"We recreated some of the original burial records and were able to find out how they had accidentally lost the graves by not knowing who was where.\\" Inaccurate records were just one of the many challenges facing Noah and his agency. The massive cost of a dig, from 5,000 to 8,000 per day, is the \\"largest challenge\\" to the donation-funded charity, Noah said. Incredible population density — 25,000 people in the 1 square mile that encompassed the tombs — and urban development on private property meant years of cooperative efforts to gain access. 'An honor and privilege' Cemetery 27, the site from which Bonnyman and 35 others were recovered, was identified in 2011, underneath a parking lot. Excavation began in March of this year, and continued through the end of June. On May 28, Bonnyman's cranium was revealed, gold teeth glinting in the central Pacific sun. Clay Evans said there was \\"no doubt\\" that the skull belonged to his grandfather, one of the few men with such extensive dental work among the battalion. Bonnyman was fully exhumed May 29, and his remains were positively identified June 16 by a forensic dentist. \\"It has been an honor and privilege to lead our recovery team and find these long-missing U.S. servicemen,\\" History Flight archaeologist Kristen N. Baker said in a news release. \\"These brave men made the ultimate sacrifice over 70 years ago, and they deserve the best possible repatriation that we can give them. I hope they will finally receive the heroes' departure and welcome home they truly deserve.\\" With the discovery of Bonnyman's remains, there are only 30 Medal of Honor winners killed in World War II whose final resting places are still unknown, according to Laura Joyey of the Congressional Medal of Honor Society. Bonnyman was the last of four Medal of Honor recipients from the Battle of Tarawa to be located. 'Best possible place for him to go' Bonnyman, born in Atlanta and raised in Knoxville, Tenn., enlisted at the age of 31, leaving a wife and three children at home. Though his age exempted him from the draft, he was deeply moved by the attack on Pearl Harbor, his daughter, Frances Evans, said. It was Frances, at age 12, who later traveled to Washington, D.C., with her mother to receive her father's Medal of Honor. Bonnyman enlisted in April 1942. After training in San Diego, he set sail for New Zealand in October of the same year. He first saw combat in the Battle of Guadalcanal as a combat engineer. On Nov. 13, 1943, he set sail for Tarawa, learning en route where his final destination would be. During the battle, which claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Marines, Bonnyman led a small crew of men in an offensive to claim a concrete blockhouse integral to the Japanese campaign on the island. He was killed on the third day of the assault. Bonnyman's remains will be flown to a military lab in Hawaii in July, and returned to the family by the end of August. He will then be buried at the family plot in Knoxville in late September, in one of the empty plots underneath that large marble monument bearing those false words about his final resting place. \\"I think the irony of it is fantastic,\\" said Clay Evans, who is completing a book about his grandfather's life. \\"But it's extremely meaningful, because if you read the letters (they wrote) ... my great-grandfather, it was brutal for him. He really wanted this, and he died before he knew. And my great-grandmother died before she knew. And my great uncle, who took up the effort, died in 2004. He will lie next to parents, and his two sisters and his brother, right there. \\"This was the best possible place for him to go, to finish the story.\\" Shay Castle: 303-473-1626, castles@dailycamera.com, twitter.com/shayshinecastle ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"In late May 1943, the remains of Alexander \\"Sandy\\" Bonnyman Jr., a World War II Marine who was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor, were found on the island of Betio in the central Pacific southeast of the Marshall Islands.

The Home Rule League Party, campaigning for Home Rule for Ireland in the British Parliament was fundamentally changed by the great Irish political leader Charles Stewart Parnell in the 1880s. In 1882, he changed his party's name to the Irish Parliamentary Party and created a well-organized grass roots structure, introducing membership to replace \\"ad hoc\\" informal groupings. He created a new selection procedure to ensure the professional selection of party candidates committed to taking their seats, and in 1884 he imposed a firm 'party pledge' which obliged MPs to vote as a bloc in parliament on all occasions. The creation of a strict party whip and a formal party structure was unique at the time.

In addition to the knighthood bestowed in 1911, Wood's state honours were his appointments as Companion of Honour in 1944, to the Order of the Crown (Belgium; 1920), and Officer of the Legion of Honour (France; 1926). He received honorary doctorates from five English universities and was a fellow of both the Royal Academy of Music (1920) and the Royal College of Music (1923). Jacobs lists 26 compositions dedicated to Wood, including, in addition to the Vaughan Williams Serenade to Music, works by Elgar, Delius, Bax, Marcel Dupré and Walton. The Poet Laureate, John Masefield, composed a poem of six verses in his honour, entitled \\"Sir Henry Wood\\", often referred to by its first line, \\"Where does the uttered music go?\\". Walton set it to music as an anthem for mixed choir; it received its first performance on 26 April 1946 at St Sepulchre's, on the occasion of a ceremony unveiling a memorial stained-glass window in Wood's honour.Wood is commemorated in the name of the Henry Wood Hall, the deconsecrated Holy Trinity Church in Southwark, which was converted to a rehearsal and recording venue in 1975.

Croatia is the home country for the breed . The name translates into English as the Scenthound From The Sava Valley , but is usually translated as the Posavac Hound . - A carnivore meaning 'meat eater' (Latin, \\"caro\\" meaning 'meat' or 'flesh' and \\"vorare\\" meaning 'to devour') is an organism that derives its energy and nutrient requirements from a diet consisting mainly or exclusively of animal tissue, whether through predation or scavenging. Animals that depend solely on animal flesh for their nutrient requirements are called obligate carnivores while those that also consume non-animal food are called facultative carnivores. Omnivores also consume both animal and non-animal food, and apart from the more general definition, there is no clearly defined ratio of plant to animal material that would distinguish a facultative carnivore from an omnivore. A carnivore that sits at the top of the food chain is termed an apex predator. - A terrier is a dog of any one of many breeds or landraces of terrier type, which are typically small, wiry, very active and fearless dogs. Terrier breeds vary greatly in size from just to over and are usually categorized by size or function. There are five different groups with each group having several different breeds. - The gray wolf or grey wolf (\\"Canis lupus\\"), also known as the timber wolf or western wolf, is a canine native to the wilderness and remote areas of Eurasia and North America. It is the largest extant member of its family, with males averaging , and females . Like the red wolf, it is distinguished from other \\"Canis\\" species by its larger size and less pointed features, particularly on the ears and muzzle. Its winter fur is long and bushy, and predominantly a mottled gray in color, although nearly pure white, red, or brown to black also occur. , 37 subspecies of \\"C. lupus\\" are recognised by MSW3. - Croatia, officially the Republic of Croatia, is a sovereign state between Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean. Its capital city is Zagreb, which forms one of the country's primary subdivisions, along with its twenty counties. Croatia covers and has diverse, mostly continental and Mediterranean climates. Croatia's Adriatic Sea coast contains more than a thousand islands. The country's population is 4.28 million, most of whom are Croats, with the most common religious denomination being Roman Catholicism. - A hunting dog refers to a canine that hunts with or for humans. There are several types of hunting dogs developed for various tasks. The major categories of hunting dogs include hounds, terriers, dachshunds, cur type dogs, and gun dogs. Among these categories further divisions can be made based upon the dogs' skill sets. - The Adriatic Sea is a body of water separating the Italian Peninsula from the Balkan peninsula and the Apennine Mountains from the Dinaric Alps and adjacent ranges. The Adriatic is the northernmost arm of the Mediterranean Sea, extending from the Strait of Otranto (where it connects to the Ionian Sea) to the northwest and the Po Valley. The countries with coasts on the Adriatic are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Croatia, Greece, Italy, Montenegro and Slovenia. The Adriatic contains over 1,300 islands, mostly located along its eastern, Croatian, coast. It is divided into three basins, the northern being the shallowest and the southern being the deepest, with a maximum depth of . The Otranto Sill, an underwater ridge, is located at the border between the Adriatic and Ionian Seas. The prevailing currents flow counterclockwise from the Strait of Otranto, along the eastern coast and back to the strait along the western (Italian) coast. Tidal movements in the Adriatic are slight, although larger amplitudes are known to occur occasionally. The Adriatic's salinity is lower than the Mediterranean's because the Adriatic collects a third of the fresh water flowing into the Mediterranean, acting as a dilution basin. The surface water temperatures generally range from in summer to in winter, significantly moderating the Adriatic Basin's climate. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - Zagreb is the capital and the largest city of Croatia. It is located in the northwest of the country, along the Sava river, at the southern slopes of the Medvednica mountain. Zagreb lies at an elevation of approximately above sea level. In the last official census of 2011 the population of the City of Zagreb was 792,875. The wider Zagreb metropolitan area includes the City of Zagreb and the separate Zagreb County bringing the total metropolitan area population up to 1,237,887. It is the biggest metropolitan area in Croatia, and the only one with a population of over one million. - The dachshund (or or ) is a short-legged, long-bodied, hound-type dog breed. - \\"Hound\\" is a synonym for \\"dog\\", also used in a more specific sense to refer to a type of dog used by hunters to track or chase prey. - Gun dogs, or bird dogs, are types of hunting dogs developed to assist hunters in finding and retrieving game, usually birds. Gun dogs are divided into three primary types: retrievers, flushing dogs, and pointing breeds. Some kennel clubs define a Gundog Group for gun dogs, while other kennel clubs include them in the Sporting Group. - A cur is a type of dog. CUR refers to: - Canis is a genus of canids containing multiple extant species, such as wolves, dogs and coyotes. Species of this genus are distinguished by their moderate to large size, their massive, well developed skulls and dentition, long legs, and comparatively short ears and tails. - The domestic dog (\\"Canis lupus familiaris\\" or \\"Canis familiaris\\") is a member of genus \\"Canis\\" (canines) that forms part of the wolf-like canids, and is the most widely abundant carnivore. The dog and the extant gray wolf are sister taxa, with modern wolves not closely related to the wolves that were first domesticated. The dog was the first domesticated species and has been selectively bred over millennia for various behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes. - A mediterranean climate or dry summer climate is the climate typical of the lands in the Mediterranean Basin. The lands around the Mediterranean Sea form the largest area where this climate type is found, but it also is found in most of coastal California, in parts of Western and South Australia, in southwestern South Africa, sections of Central Asia, and in central Chile. - The domestic cat is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often called house cats when kept as indoor pets or simply cats when there is no need to distinguish them from other felids and felines. Cats are often valued by humans for companionship and for their ability to hunt vermin. There are more than 70 cat breeds, though different associations proclaim different numbers according to their standards. - Croats are a nation and South Slavic ethnic group at the crossroads of Central Europe, Southeast Europe, and the Mediterranean Sea. Croats mainly live in Croatia and Bosnia and Herzegovina, but are an officially recognized minority in Austria, Czech Republic, Hungary, Italy, Montenegro, Romania, Serbia, and Slovakia. Responding to political, social and economic pressure, many Croats have migrated throughout Europe (especially Germany, Austria, Switzerland, France and Italy) and the Americas (particularly the United States, Canada, Argentina, and Chile), establishing a diaspora.

In order to take advantage of the computer underground, Google recently began allowing anonymous participants to hack its Chrome systems with the understanding that they would report all vulnerabilities and collect a prize at the end. This second “Pwnium,” as it’s called, occurred at the Hack in the Box Conference in Kuala Lumpur. Google labeled the discovery “critical” and called it “another beautiful piece of work.” The company promises it will not release details about any of the vulnerabilities discovered during Pwnium unless the majority of users have been patched. Google announced the contest in August, promising up to 2 million in prizes to those with the best exploits. Those who found a “full exploit” win up to 60,000, whereas a “partial exploit” will bring 10,000 less. Google isn’t the only one with a program like this. The first Pwnium only offered 1 million in prizes, although that’s not exactly chump change for hacking into one of the most famous companies in the world.

It is currently spring time where Jonathan lives, and there is a high amount of pollen in the air. When Jonathan goes outside his eyes start to water and become itchy, and he can't stop sneezing. Jonathan's brother, Thomas, was recently invited to a seafood dinner. Thomas decided to eat some shellfish, and a short while later he felt like his throat was closing up and it was becoming difficult to breathe. Hint: Allergy symptoms can range from mild to severe. Mild symptoms might include itchy eyes, sneezing, and a runny nose. Severe symptoms can cause difficulty breathing, which may be life threatening. Keep in mind that it is the immune system and not the allergen that causes the allergy symptoms. Allergy symptoms can be treated with medications such as antihistamines.

Question: what are SATA Power Connector The answer to this question is:","completion":"No, the provided answer does not correctly address the question about SATA Power Connector. A detailed answer for the question is as follows: SATA (Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) is a computer bus interface used for transferring data between the motherboard and storage devices, such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, and optical drives. The SATA Power Connector is a 15-pin connector responsible for providing power to these storage devices. This connector is part of the SATA standard and has replaced PATA (Parallel Advanced Technology Attachment) connectors in modern computers. The SATA power connector is designed to provide more efficient power delivery to SATA devices and offers better scalability, reduced cable bulk, and easier cable management compared to the PATA power connector. The 15-pin connector carries three different voltage lines: +3.3V, +5V, and +12V, which are used to supply power to various components of the storage devices. These voltages are distributed across the pins as follows: - Pins 1-3: +3.3V (Orange) - Pins 4-6: Ground (Black) - Pins 7-9: +5V (Red) - Pins 10-12: Ground (Black) - Pins 13-15: +12V (Yellow) While PATA-based technologies like CompactFlash (CF) and the newer CFast standard (SATA-based) are still in use, especially in industrial and embedded applications, the question about the SATA Power Connector focuses on the electrical connectivity aspect of SATA devices rather than on the specific storage technologies mentioned."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Maybe he was seeing himself in her so he was punishing himself for being in such a crap ! *For the milliard time : This one could've been better (or less worse !).

She was out of Mango, okay, well Taro. Taro they had... (I would hope so). They were also out of Boba and I had to wait 15 minutes for a fresh batch to finish cooking. Really? C'mon... well, it's grand opening, gotta get some kinks out... easily forgivable. Well, as I'm 15 minutes into waiting for my drinks... I still hadn't received the calamari I ordered.

However, Su-mi experiences a terrifying nightmare in which a female ghost with blood pouring down her legs climbs on top of her bed.
