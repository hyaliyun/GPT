What might be the first step of the process? A:","completion":"The first step of the process in the context provided involves the functioning of the kidneys, which are essential organs in the human body responsible for filtering blood and removing waste products. This process maintains overall fluid and electrolyte balance, regulates blood pressure, and helps maintain proper pH levels in the body. The detailed first step of the process is described below: 1. Blood Supply and Filtration: The kidneys receive blood from the renal artery, which branches off from the aorta - the body's main artery supplying oxygen-rich blood from the heart. The renal artery further divides into arterioles and then into a network of tiny capillaries called glomeruli, which are surrounded by a complex of small tubules known as nephrons. Each kidney contains approximately one million nephrons that work together to filter waste and perform other crucial functions. In this initial step, filtration occurs when the blood flows through the glomerulus, a network of minuscule blood vessels with tiny pores. The pressure generated within these blood vessels pushes water, electrolytes, glucose, amino acids, and other small molecules out of the blood and into the adjacent capsule called Bowman's capsule, which encapsulates the glomerulus. This process creates a filtrate that lacks large molecules and cells such as proteins, red and white blood cells, and platelets, which are too large to pass through the pores of the glomerulus. This filtration step marks the beginning of blood purification and waste removal within the nephrons. The resulting filtrate is then processed further along the nephrons through a series of reabsorption, secretion, and concentration processes to remove waste, return valuable substances to the body, and maintain optimal levels of electrolytes and water. The intricate functioning of nephrons and the entire renal system underscores the kidneys' essential and complex role in maintaining homeostasis and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Among the shackled slaves is Django Freeman (Jamie Foxx), sold off and separated from his wife, Broomhilda von Shaft (Kerry Washington). The Speck brothers are stopped by Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), a German dentist-turned-bounty hunter from DÃ¼sseldorf, who asks to buy one of the slaves. He questions Django about his knowledge of the Brittle brothers, a group of outlaws for whom Dr. Schultz is carrying a warrant. Dr. Schultz, a superior gunslinger, immediately kills Ace with a Fast draw. Dr. Schultz insists on honorably paying Dicky a fair price for Django before leaving him at the mercy of the newly-freed slaves, who kill him and follow the North Star to freedom. As Django can identify the Brittle brothers, Dr. Schultz offers him his freedom in exchange for help tracking them down. After tracking and killing the Brittles to a plantation owned by Spencer \\"Big Daddy\\" Bennett (Don Johnson), the liberated Django partners with Dr. Schultz through the winter and becomes his apprentice. They are also briefly hunted by Big Daddy but Dr. Schutlz deceives and kills most of his gang with an explosive in their carriage, as Django kills Big Daddy himself, his first kill. Dr. Schultz explains that he feels responsible for Django since Django is the first person he has ever freed, and felt morally obliged to help Django reunite with Broomhilda. Now fully trained, Django collects his first bounty, keeping the handbill for good luck. In 1859, Django and Dr. Schultz travel to Mississippi, where they learn the identity of Broomhilda's owner: Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), the charming but cruel owner of the Candyland plantation, where slaves are forced to fight to the death in brutal wrestling matches called Mandingo fights. Dr. Schultz and Django meet Calvin at his gentleman's club in Greenville and submit their offer to buy one of his best fighters. Intrigued, Calvin invites them to his ranch at Candyland.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The Great Crow Battle of Portage Bay, which pits one family feeding birds against neighbors, has resulted in a 200,000 civil suit. The great neighborhood crow war at Portage Bay has not ended, and not surprisingly, it’s lawsuit time. Say, 200,000? Lisa and Gary Mann, and their young daughter, for a couple of years have been feeding the birds at their home in the 1000 block of East Shelby Street. Says the lawsuit, “As many as six times per day Defendants refilled and continue to refill the emptied troughs of food with peanuts and other bird foods for the seagulls, crows, and pigeons to feast upon.” Neighbors said that anywhere from 30 to 100 crows would hover during the feedings. You bet that they brought up the swarming, attacking avian images from Hitchcock’s 1963 horror film, “The Birds.” The civil lawsuit, filed Monday in King County Superior Court, was brought by Christine Yokan, a pension-fund investment manager who lives on one side of the Manns, and Matt Ashbach, an ear, nose and throat doctor, who lives on the other side of the Manns. Gary Mann is a surgical oncologist. The 200,000 sought in the lawsuit includes claims of property damage exceeding 75,000 for cleaning, painting and replacing permanently damaged property on houses, decks, yard lights, walkways, sheds. Crow facts There are 40 species of crows, and they live everywhere except Antarctica. They have numerous calls. A distress call brings other crows to their defense. Crows will eat practically anything — roadkill, fast food, mice. An adult crow needs nearly ¾ of a pound of food daily. The origin of “eating crow” has been lost. In one version, during the War of 1812, a British officer made an American soldier eat part of a crow he had shot in British territory. It also includes a non-specified amount for loss “of enjoyment of property, inconvenience, and emotional distress.” And attorney’s fees. Back in April, the neighbors had high hopes quiet would be restored. In an email, Lisa Mann wrote that “we are moving to Houston this summer as my husband accepted a faculty surgical position … ” But an online search doesn’t show the Mann residence up for sale, nor having been sold. Lisa Mann did not return voice-mail and email messages for comment. Janice Palm, a psychotherapist who lives across the alley from the Manns, says she gave up putting flowers in her planters because the crows pulled them. She’s not part of the lawsuit. She says about the Manns moving, “Only in our dreams.” Meanwhile, the lawsuit says, “Large numbers of birds swarm the feeding operations daily, leaving behind dirt, feathers, peanut particles and shells, feces, and urine on the surrounding properties … Neighbors with family members who have severe peanut allergies have pled with Defendants … ” That lawsuit describes a litany of illnesses carried by rodents, crows and pigeons. And more, “ … there are also frequent periods of excessive noise from dozens of birds squawking from dawn until dusk. “While some periods of time are quiet, there are periods of time — which sometimes exceed two hours in duration and occur multiple times per day — in which the cawing of crows and the noises from other birds continues unabated and can be heard at a high volume even when one is inside the home.” And more, “Plaintiffs had never before observed a single rat on their properties. After defendants began feeding the wildlife, Plaintiffs observed a noticeable rat population … ” It has been Lisa Mann who has had the most dealings with the neighbors. She also was the one quoted in a BBC News story (then reprinted in Crosscut, an online Seattle publication) that described in glowing terms the feeding of the crows. It was titled, “The girl who gets gifts from birds.” It told how the Manns’ 8-year-old daughter originally began sharing her school lunch with crows, and how that led to the birds leaving her gifts such as an earring or polished rock. Katy Sewall, author of the BBC piece, never mentioned the neighborhood hassles over the crows in the story, which went worldwide. “The neighborhood tensions were never my focus,” she wrote in an email. But the tensions certainly escalated. At one point, Lisa Mann called the cops after an argument with a neighbor up the hill. The previous night, Mann told the cops, she had heard what sounded like rifle shots. The neighbors, meanwhile, contacted the City Council and Public Health — Seattle & King County with a petition signed by 51 of them, asking for help. Public Health did issue a notice of violation to the Manns for bird food accessible to rats. The Manns took the necessary measures, such as raising the feeder above ground and on smooth poles. The confrontations continued. In one email, Lisa Mann said that Matt Ashbach, her neighbor to the east who now is suing, took a dead crow “and illegally hung it in effigy off of his third-floor balcony of his million-dollar mansion.” Ashbach says he did find a dead crow and hung it from his balcony, a method he learned growing up on a farm to warn off other crows. (Not illegal, according to Seattle Animal Shelter.) Anna Johnsen, who represents Ashbach and Yokan, says a trial date has been set for a year from now — Aug. 6, 2016. A long time in crowing time. “My clients hope the feeding will stop before then,” she says. Meanwhile, Johnsen is asking the Manns to not feed the birds more than a quarter-pound of food a day. “My clients don’t want to limit anyone’s freedom,” she says. “We think that’s very reasonable.” Of course, that all depends on what your definition of reasonable is. ||||| By David Ham and KIRO 7 STAFF Earlier this year a story about an 8-year-old Seattle girl’s relationship with crows went viral. Gabi Mann started feeding crows daily two years ago and the birds would leave her trinkets. However, her Portage Bay neighbors said the murder of crows would caw and leave droppings throughout the neighborhood. “The neighbors went to her and said please this is causing a problem,” said neighbor Janice Palm. >> KIRO 7 reported that the neighbors signed a petition to get Gabi’s family to stop feeding the crows. “People are having rat problems in their houses with the waste from the crows and the peanut shells are all over the place,” said Palm On Monday, two of those neighbors filed a lawsuit against Gabi’s parents Lisa and Gary Mann. “The case is against two adults. The scope and scale of the feeding is not the work of a minor child. The mother, Lisa Mann, is responsible for the vast majority of the bird feeding. Gary and Lisa Mann have also constructed extraordinarily large feeding stations and hired employees to help carry out the feedings. The feeding and related activities have run nearly every day, year-round, from the morning hours to as late as midnight,” said Anna Johnsen, attorney for the two homeowners that filed the lawsuit. In the lawsuit, other neighbors tried to talk with and write letters to Lisa and Gary Mann requesting “they stop or seriously downsize their mass wildlife feeding operation.” However the situation escalated. “I can't imagine living in a neighborhood and ignoring what my neighbors are asking me to do, what's very very reasonable that's affecting us so much,” said Palm who is also considering joining the lawsuit. Neighbors contacted city and state officials, stated in the lawsuit. But no significant action was done. According to the lawsuit, neighbors say they're owed 200,000 for damage caused by the birds The Manns have not responded to the lawsuit and a trial date has not been set.

One young girl in Seattle is luckier than most. She feeds the crows in her garden - and they bring her gifts in return. Eight-year-old Gabi Mann sets a bead storage container on the dining room table, and clicks the lid open. This is her most precious collection. \\"You may take a few close looks,\\" she says, \\"but don't touch.\\" It's a warning she's most likely practised on her younger brother. She laughs after saying it though. She is happy for the audience. Inside the box are rows of small objects in clear plastic bags. One label reads: \\"Black table by feeder. 2:30 p.m. 09 Nov 2014.\\" Inside is a broken light bulb. Another bag contains small pieces of brown glass worn smooth by the sea. \\"Beer coloured glass,\\" as Gabi describes it. Each item is individually wrapped and categorised. Gabi pulls a black zip out of a labelled bag and holds it up. \\"We keep it in as good condition as we can,\\" she says, before explaining this object is one of her favourites. There's a miniature silver ball, a black button, a blue paper clip, a yellow bead, a faded black piece of foam, a blue Lego piece, and the list goes on. Many of them are scuffed and dirty. It is an odd assortment of objects for a little girl to treasure, but to Gabi these things are more valuable than gold. Image copyright Katy Sewall Image copyright Katy Sewall She didn't gather this collection. Each item was a gift - given to her by crows. She holds up a pearl coloured heart. It is her most-prized present. \\"It's showing me how much they love me.\\" If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them John Marzluff, Prof of wildlife science Gabi's relationship with the neighbourhood crows began accidentally in 2011. She was four years old, and prone to dropping food. She'd get out of the car, and a chicken nugget would tumble off her lap. A crow would rush in to recover it. Soon, the crows were watching for her, hoping for another bite. As she got older, she rewarded their attention, by sharing her packed lunch on the way to the bus stop. Her brother joined in. Soon, crows were lining up in the afternoon to greet Gabi's bus, hoping for another feeding session. Gabi's mother Lisa didn't mind that crows consumed most of the school lunches she packed. \\"I like that they love the animals and are willing to share,\\" she says, while admitting she never noticed crows until her daughter took an interest in them. \\"It was a kind of transformation. I never thought about birds.\\" In 2013, Gabi and Lisa started offering food as a daily ritual, rather than dropping scraps from time to time. Each morning, they fill the backyard birdbath with fresh water and cover bird-feeder platforms with peanuts. Gabi throws handfuls of dog food into the grass. As they work, crows assemble on the telephone lines, calling loudly to them. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Gabi feeding birds in her garden It was after they adopted this routine that the gifts started appearing. The crows would clear the feeder of peanuts, and leave shiny trinkets on the empty tray; an earring, a hinge, a polished rock. There wasn't a pattern. Gifts showed up sporadically - anything shiny and small enough to fit in a crow's mouth. One time it was a tiny piece of metal with the word \\"best\\" printed on it. \\"I don't know if they still have the part that says 'friend',\\" Gabi laughs, amused by the thought of a crow wearing a matching necklace. When you see Gabi's collection, it's hard not to wish for gift-giving crows of your own. \\"If you want to form a bond with a crow, be consistent in rewarding them,\\" advises John Marzluff, professor of wildlife science at the University of Washington. He specialises in birds, particularly crows and ravens. Image copyright Lisa Mann What food is best? \\"A few peanuts in the shell,\\" he says. \\"It's a high-energy food… and it makes noise when you throw it on the ground, so they hear it and they quickly habituate to your routine.\\" Marzluff, and his colleague Mark Miller, did a study of crows and the people who feed them. They found that crows and people form a very personal relationship. \\"There's definitely a two-way communication going on there,\\" Marzluff says. \\"They understand each other's signals.\\" The birds communicate by how they fly, how close they walk, and where they sit. The human learns their language and the crows learn their feeder's patterns and posture. They start to know and trust each other. Sometimes a crow leaves a gift. But crow gifts are not guaranteed. \\"I can't say they always will (give presents),\\" Marzluff admits, having never received any gifts personally, \\"but I have seen an awful lot of things crows have brought people.\\" Not all crows deliver shiny objects either. Sometimes they give the kind of presents \\"they would give to their mate\\", says Marzluff. \\"Courtship feeding, for example. So some people, their presents are dead baby birds that the crow brings in.\\" Image copyright Lisa Mann Gabi has been given some icky objects. Her mother threw out a rotting crab claw, for example. Gabi points out a heavily rusted screw she prefers not to touch. It's labelled \\"Third Favorite.\\" Asking her why an untouchable object is in the favourites, she answers, \\"You don't' see a crow carrying around a screw that much. Unless it's trying to build its house.\\" Lisa, Gabi's mom, regularly photographs the crows and charts their behaviour and interactions. Her most amazing gift came just a few weeks ago, when she lost a lens cap in a nearby alley while photographing a bald eagle as it circled over the neighbourhood. Image copyright Lisa Mann She didn't even have to look for it. It was sitting on the edge of the birdbath. Had the crows returned it? Lisa logged on to her computer and pulled up their bird-cam. There was the crow she suspected. \\"You can see it bringing it into the yard.

One young girl in Seattle is luckier than most. She feeds the crows in her garden - and they bring her gifts in return. Eight-year-old Gabi Mann sets a bead storage container on the dining room table, and clicks the lid open. This is her most precious collection. \\"You may take a few close looks,\\" she says, \\"but don't touch.\\" It's a warning she's most likely practised on her younger brother. She laughs after saying it though. She is happy for the audience. Inside the box are rows of small objects in clear plastic bags. One label reads: \\"Black table by feeder. 2:30 p.m. 09 Nov 2014.\\" Inside is a broken light bulb. Another bag contains small pieces of brown glass worn smooth by the sea. \\"Beer coloured glass,\\" as Gabi describes it. Each item is individually wrapped and categorised. Gabi pulls a black zip out of a labelled bag and holds it up. \\"We keep it in as good condition as we can,\\" she says, before explaining this object is one of her favourites. There's a miniature silver ball, a black button, a blue paper clip, a yellow bead, a faded black piece of foam, a blue Lego piece, and the list goes on. Many of them are scuffed and dirty. It is an odd assortment of objects for a little girl to treasure, but to Gabi these things are more valuable than gold. .... ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"A family living in Portage Bay has been feeding birds at their home, causing large numbers of crows, seagulls, and pigeons to gather in the area.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: PAN President German Martinez Resigns After Party Loses Lead in Mexico's Lower House Election Hey kids, did you hear the news about Mexico? Let me tell you an interesting story! Once upon a time, there was a man named German Martinez. He was the president of a big team called the PAN political party in Mexico. They all work together to help make decisions for their country. But guess what happened? German decided to resign, or say \\"goodbye\\" to his job as president of the PAN party. This happened right after an important election, where PAN did not do very well. Mexico has a big building called the \\"lower house,\\" where people from different teams come together to make choices for the country. In this election, PAN lost the lead, which means they didn't have the most people from their team in the lower house anymore. They lost to another team, called PRI, with 36.8% of the votes, while PAN only got 27.9% of the votes. Remember Felipe Calderon? He was once the president of the whole Mexico, and he was also part of the PAN team. Some people believe that he is responsible for the PAN team doing poorly in the election because they think he didn't help the country's money situation get better when he was president. In Mexico, when people's lives become harder because of money problems, they may change their minds about which team should make decisions for their country. Now, after the election, many people are talking about the results and what it means for Mexico. Some people who study and think carefully about these things, called analysts, say that the Mexican president is responsible for the country not doing so well with money. This makes it hard for people to trust and vote for the PAN team. That's why the PRI team got more votes, and now they will have more people in the lower house to help make decisions for Mexico. So you see, kids, sometimes people and teams have to face difficulties. But this also means that they may learn, grow and become better in the future.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I can use this background: Temperature is a measure of the average kinetic energy of the particles in matter. In everyday usage, temperature indicates a measure of how hot or cold an object is. Temperature is an important parameter in chemistry. When a substance changes from solid to liquid, it is because there was an increase in the temperature of the material. Chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. Many unstable materials (such as enzymes) will be viable longer at lower temperatures. Now, I have a new situation: Alexander is conducting reactions in his college chemistry class. In his first reaction, reaction A, he uses a high strength burner so the temperature of the reaction is high. In the second reaction, reaction B, he uses a weaker model of burner, so the temperature of the reaction is low. Answer this question please: Which reaction will proceed slower? A:","completion":"In the given situation, reaction B will proceed slower. This is due to the fact that it is being conducted at a lower temperature compared to reaction A. As mentioned in the background information, chemical reactions usually proceed faster if the temperature is increased. This increase in temperature allows the particles in the reacting substances to have more kinetic energy, leading to more frequent and energetic collisions between the particles. This, in turn, increases the rate at which the reaction occurs. In contrast, when the temperature is lowered, the particles in the reacting substances have less kinetic energy, resulting in fewer and weaker collisions between particles. As a consequence, the reaction rate decreases. Therefore, in Alexander's college chemistry class, reaction A will proceed faster due to the higher temperature provided by the high strength burner, while reaction B will proceed slower due to the lower temperature from the weaker model of burner. It is important to note that other factors like the concentration of the reactants and the presence of catalysts can also influence the rate of the reactions, but in this specific example, temperature is the main factor causing the difference in reaction speeds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the first name of the single mother's older son? , can you please find it? A NASA spacecraft lands on an unknown planet and begins to take rock and soil samples. Four aliens discover it and are sucked into the craft through its vacuum tube, after which it makes its way back to Earth. The aliens are able to escape from a government base by using their powers (with which they can destroy or heal anything they touch). During the escape, the youngest one hides in a passing van, occupied by a boy named Eric Cruise who uses a wheelchair, his older brother, Michael, and their single mother, Janet, who are moving to California from Illinois. Shortly after the Cruise family arrives at their new home, Eric becomes suspicious of the alien's presence. The next morning, he finds that the creature has trashed most of the house and learns its identity, but is blamed alongside his brother by their mother for what has happened. After seeing the creature again, Eric tries to catch up to him, but ends up sliding down a hill and falls into a lake, where he nearly drowns, but is rescued by the alien. Eric is not believed at all when he tries to tell his family about the creature's actions. Later that night, he sets a trap with the help of his new friend, Debbie, who had also seen the alien. The two trap him inside a vacuum cleaner, which malfunctions and causes the entire neighborhood to suffer a power surge. After the alien is released, Michael now believes Eric, but it leaves before Janet can be convinced. Eric's behavior towards the alien changes after he fixes all of the damage he caused to the house, and leaves behind several newspaper clippings which Eric believes are an attempt to communicate.

Liam started reading about apex predators, while Fox read about grazers and large herbivores. Which cousin learned less about wildlife management? Hint: An apex predator, also known as an alpha predator or top predator, is a predator at the top of a food chain, with no natural predators.Apex predators are usually defined in terms of trophic dynamics, meaning that they occupy the highest trophic levels. Food chains are often far shorter on land, usually limited to being secondary consumers – for example, wolves prey mostly upon large herbivores (primary consumers), which eat plants (primary producers). The apex predator concept is applied in wildlife management, conservation and ecotourism. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is likely that Fox learned less about wildlife management compared to Liam. The reason behind this is that the apex predator concept is directly applied in wildlife management, conservation, and ecotourism. Since Liam was reading about apex predators, he would naturally learn more about these related topics. On the other hand, Fox was reading about grazers and large herbivores, which are lower down in the food chain. While these animals also play an important role in ecosystems, their study might not encompass wildlife management to the same extent as apex predators.

They played a game against another team, Everton, in something called the \\"fourth-round replay\\". This means the two teams had already played once before, and they needed to play again to find out who's the best. But this time, Chelsea didn't win. Instead, Everton beat them, and they will now move on to the \\"last-16\\" of the competition. This is a group of 16 teams that will play more games against each other until there are only two left, who will then play in the final match. Everton said goodbye to Chelsea after winning an exciting \\"penalty shootout\\" part of the game by getting 4 soccer ball kicks into the goal, while Chelsea only managed to get 3. Another team called Manchester United also had a good day. They played against a \\"non-league side\\" team called Crawley. Don't worry too much about the \\"non-league side\\" part, it just means Crawley is not one of the best teams in England like Manchester United is. Manchester United won the game by scoring just one goal, which was enough for them to reach the \\"quarterfinals\\", meaning they are also moving forward in the big tournament.

Both Birmingham and Stoke were successful, beating their opponents and moving forward to the next stage of the FA Cup.

These examples were pointed out by Carl Gustav Hempel. Hempel came to acknowledge that Logical Positivism's verificationism was untenable, but argued that falsificationism was equally untenable on logical grounds alone. The simplest response to this is that, because Popper describes how theories attain, maintain and lose scientific status, individual consequences of currently accepted scientific theories are scientific in the sense of being part of tentative scientific knowledge, and both of Hempel's examples fall under this category.

Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle. A complete blockage of blood flow to parts of the heart (a heart attack) can cause significant damage due to oxygen deprivation, in some cases leading to death. Now, I have a new situation: Jake and his son Ryan just had their yearly physical examination by the doctor. As part of this year's examination, both men had their arterial walls examined to identify the presence of plaques. The doctor discovered that Jake had a high amount of plaques present on the interior of his arterial wall. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present. Answer this question please: Who will have more restricted blood flow through their arteries? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Jake is likely to have more restricted blood flow through his arteries compared to his son Ryan. The presence of a high amount of plaques in Jake's arterial walls indicates that he has developed atherosclerosis, a condition characterized by the buildup of cholesterol and other materials within the arteries. This buildup can lead to the formation of plaques that can narrow the arteries and restrict blood flow. Ryan, on the other hand, had no plaques present in his arterial walls during the examination. This suggests that he has not yet developed atherosclerosis and, as a result, his blood vessels should be relatively free from obstruction. Consequently, Ryan's blood flow through his arteries is expected to be less restricted compared to his father, Jake. Restricted blood flow through the arteries can have several consequences on the cardiovascular system. In Jake's case, the reduction in blood flow can lead to increased blood pressure, a lower supply of oxygen to the heart muscle, and a heightened risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack. This situation may require Jake to adopt a healthier lifestyle, including better dietary choices and regular exercise, to manage his atherosclerosis and minimize the potential risks associated with restricted blood flow. On the other hand, Ryan's lack of arterial plaques indicates that he currently has a lower risk of developing heart disease or experiencing a heart attack. Nonetheless, engaging in a healthy lifestyle and maintaining periodic check-ups will be essential for Ryan to reduce his long-term risk of developing atherosclerosis and associated cardiovascular complications."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: What is the question to: \\"Metaphor is a type of analogy and is closely related to other rhetorical figures of speech that achieve their effects via association, comparison or resemblance including allegory , hyperbole , and simile .\\"?

Increasing our knowledge of diverse aspects of life such as film, music, television, socio-political movements, and environmental sustainability provides us with a richer and more fulfilling life experience. By understanding these various fields, we become more confident and independent individuals who can contribute more meaningfully to our social circles and society at large. Pop Culture and Art: Affecting Everyday Lives Pop culture and art play a significant role in shaping our perspectives, beliefs, and values. Films, through their focus on diverse topics and unique storytelling techniques, help us navigate complicated emotions, empathize with others, and highlight essential global issues. For instance, films like \\"12 Years a Slave\\" have depicted the horrors of slavery, sparking essential public conversations on race and civil rights. In addition, music transcends linguistic and cultural boundaries, allowing us to connect with the emotions and stories of those from different backgrounds. From Afrobeat rhythms to K-pop anthems, music offers a world of diverse soundscapes that can unite us under a shared appreciation for artistic expression. Television has evolved over the past few decades, shifting from being purely for entertainment purposes to exploring complex characters and narratives in thought-provoking shows. Series like \\"Breaking Bad\\" and \\"House of Cards\\" demonstrate the versatility of television as a medium, keeping audiences engaged and promoting critical thinking about societal issues. Social and Political Movements: Inspiring Change Knowledge of social and political movements in one's area plays a crucial role in promoting awareness, empathy, and active participation in our society. From the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s to the contemporary Black Lives Matter and LGBTQ+ rights movements, understanding social dynamics and historical context helps us appreciate the strides society has made, while also acknowledging the work that remains to be done. Participating in local social and political movements – whether it be attending rallies, volunteering, or engaging in informed conversations – allows us to stay informed and shape the future we wish to see. It demonstrates our commitment to the betterment of our communities and cultivates a sense of responsibility towards the world we live in. Sustainability and Environmental Consciousness: Leaving a Positive Impact With climate change becoming an increasingly pressing concern, knowledge of sustainable practices and environmental friendliness is more critical than ever. Familiarity with concepts like composting, recycling, purchasing from eco-friendly brands, and reducing overall waste can help us contribute to a healthier planet. Moreover, spreading awareness about environmental issues and leading by example can inspire those around us to adopt more earth-conscious habits. Remember, each small act of sustainability can make a tangible difference in the fight against climate change. Confidence and Independence: Benefiting the Self and Others Embracing and expanding our understanding of diverse fields such as pop culture, art, socio-political movements, and environmental sustainability empowers us with unwavering confidence and independence. Through this knowledge, we become active contributors to our social circles and global society, inspiring others to explore and learn about the world's beautiful complexities. In conclusion, nurturing our interest in a wide array of subjects enriches our perspective, promotes empathy, and improves our overall quality of life. As we continue to learn, grow, and evolve, we become more capable of leaving a lasting and positive impact on the world around us.

Given the question: I have a new situation: Two sisters named Mary and Ann went in for a blood test and found out that Mary had sickle cell anemia. Ann was normal. But I can use this background: Another example of incomplete dominance is with sickle cell anemia, a disease in which a blood protein called hemoglobin is produced incorrectly. This causes the red blood cells to have a sickle shape, making it difficult for these misshapen cells to pass through the smallest blood vessels. A person that is homozygous recessive ( ss ) for the sickle cell trait will have red blood cells that all have the incorrect hemoglobin. A person who is homozygous dominant ( SS ) will have normal red blood cells. What is an answer for this question: Which sister had incomplete dominance? The answer is:","completion":"Neither Mary nor Ann displays incomplete dominance in this situation. Incomplete dominance occurs when an individual inherits one dominant allele and one recessive allele (Ss), resulting in an intermediate phenotype. In the case of Mary and Ann: - Mary has sickle cell anemia, which means she is homozygous recessive (ss) for the sickle cell trait. All of her red blood cells have the incorrect hemoglobin, and there is no presence of the dominant allele in her genotype. - Ann is normal, which means she is either homozygous dominant (SS) or heterozygous (Ss). If Ann is homozygous dominant (SS), she has normal red blood cells and does not display incomplete dominance. If Ann is heterozygous (Ss), she carries the sickle cell trait but does not have the disease or any symptoms, as the dominant allele (S) completely masks the effects of the recessive allele (s).

The Armenian Genocide refers to the systematic extermination of around 1.5 million Armenians by the Ottoman Empire during World War I, specifically between 1915 and 1923. Toynbee's report is considered a crucial and influential primary source that shed light on the atrocities committed during this period. The sentence in question indicates that the figure mentioned only accounts for the first year of the Genocide and does not include any additional information on the subsequent years and consequences that followed.

Luis Gutierrez was briefly handcuffed after refusing to leave a meeting with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in Chicago, saying he planned to risk arrest by staying at the agency’s office in The Loop until demands are met. The Democratic congressman led a sit-in following a meeting that began around 10 a.m. Monday with a delegation of activists that included about 22 advocates, attorneys, community leaders and other local elected officials, according to Gutierrez's spokesman Douglas Rivlin. “They were asking about specific cases and about the general conduct of ICE and deportations,” Rivlin said at a news conference Monday afternoon. “The congressman has decided that he did not get the answers he was looking for from the ICE regional director and he’s going to be staying inside until he gets answers, even if that means risking arrest.” Seven others from the meeting refused to leave alongside Gutierrez, who tweeted that he “was arrested, cuffed then cuffs were cut off” around 1:30 p.m. “Waiting for further word on if/when we will be arrested.” Specific immigration cases discussed in the meeting included the pending deportations of Army veteran Miguel Perez Jr., according to Rivlin, as well as Francisca Lino, whose husband and four of her six children are U.S. citizens. \\"The congressman first met with the same ICE regional director in 2008 about this case, about getting a deferral from deportation,\\" Rivlin said. \\"Ms. Lino came in regularly for meetings with ICE every year as a condition for her deferred deportation, and a couple of weeks ago she was told that she would need to get her bags together and has a specific date for when she is going to be deported in July.

The lawmaker said that he stood ready to be arrested when he started the protest late Monday morning, but ended the sit-in more than four hours later without incident. Federal Protective Service officers gave the congressman and seven immigration advocates taking part-in the sit-in three warnings to leave the facility or face arrest, according to Gail Montenegro, an ICE spokeswoman. At one point, Gutierrez posted on social media that he was even placed in handcuffs but agents changed their mind and allowed the sit-in to continue. Montenegro said federal agents removed the flex cuffs within approximately two minutes, after ICE officials relayed to the FPS officers that they no longer wanted the congressman and others removed from the building. \\"They threatened us with arrest. We said 'We're ready to go to jail,'\\" Gutierrez told reporters after ending the protest. \\"We stood up to the bullies here...Unfortunately, tonight and tomorrow they will continue to prey on very vulnerable, defenseless people in their homes in the darkness of the night.\\" The congressman said he decided to start the sit-in after he felt he received unsatisfactory or incomplete answers from ICE officials about whether they would carry out enforcement raids in churches and other sensitive locations. Gutierrez also said he did not receive clear answers on whether the agency would target young undocumented immigrants living in the US under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) policy started under the Obama administration. The agency said in a statement that the sit-in began after the \\"Congressman sought actions and assurances that ICE officials couldn't provide.\\" Last week, ICE wrote on its Twitter that “DACA is not a protected legal status, but active DACA recipients are typically a lower level of enforcement priority.” The program provided hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants—commonly referred to as DREAMers— brought to the U.S. as children certain protections. ICE’s messages on social media have left many immigration advocates concerned that DREAMers could also be targeted. DACA is not a protected legal status, but active DACA recipients are typically a lower level of enforcement priority — ICE (@ICEgov) March 9, 2017 \\"ICE knows deportation policies are egregious, unfair. They have not arrested us because they know policies are morally bankrupt,\\" Gutierrez added. ICE knows deportation policies are egregious, unfair.

Gutierrez (@RepGutierrez) March 13, 2017 The protest comes after the Department of Homeland Security issued a sweeping set of orders last month to increase immigration enforcement, placing the vast majority of the nation's 11 million undocumented immigrants at risk of deportation. Read more: The new policy calls for immigration enforcement — including Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and ICE — to identify, capture and quickly deport every undocumented immigrant they encounter. The Trump administration’s guidance also calls for undocumented immigrants caught entering the country to be placed in detention until their cases are resolved and increases the ability of local police to help in immigration enforcement.The new guidance make undocumented immigrants who have been convicted of a crime the highest priority for enforcement operations. They also make clear that ICE agents should also arrest and initiate deportation proceedings against any other undocumented immigrant they encounter. Gutierrez said he also questioned ICE officials about the scheduled deportations of several immigrants living in the Chicago area. One, Miguel Perez, is a Mexican-born legal permanent resident and Army veteran and is facing deportation after a felony drug conviction. Perez served two tours in Afghanistan. Last month, Gutierrez and several other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus were barred by staffers from House Speaker Paul Ryan's office from attending a meeting in Washington with acting ICE director Thomas Homan. Several Democratic lawmakers, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., were invited to the meeting and attended.

I also assume that you've seen the first movie or at least know the general gist, so if you haven't some of this might not make sense. Plot: This movie beats the audience over the head with tired philosophical ramblings again and again in an attempt to get the theme across. We are bombarded again and again by questions of purpose, and destiny, and choice, and forced to endure the long, torturous platitude sessions that contain them. Neo, awakened from a dream in the last movie, now begins a period of realization about his own existence. There are a lot of revelations in this movie, which I'll be vague about so they won't seem like spoilers. *If you're still worried vague references will spoil the movie, don't read the paragraph below.* The strength and weakness of faith is revealed. The strengths and weaknesses of love, and its temporary nature, are also revealed. The interdependence of humans and technology, and our faith in technology, are also revealed. The importance of choice and experience is revealed. Explaining further things that are revealed would go into too much detail, so I will refrain (as the guidelines for writing a commentary asks). Btw, by \\"revealed\\" I mean pounded through our ears and eyes like nails. Storyline: So how does Neo and the gang get from the end of the last movie to the beginning of the next one? In short, they keep the faith, and use and abuse overly-stylized action and bullet-time like it's going out of style (and after this display, I'm hoping movie-goers and makers alike learn to appreciate subtlety and originality a bit more). More on that later. To not spoil anything, I will say no more than the promo material already did: Neo is still trying to figure out the Matrix, and he is looking for answers while trying to save the humans, and Zion, all while baddies are going after him and his cohorts. The movie pretty much picks up where the last one left off. Action: While martial arts action and gunplay peppered its predecessor in somewhat equal parts, this movie focuses much more on martial arts than gunplay, adding swords, sais, etc. to the mix. Special effects are so often used and waved in the audience's face that it becomes really tiresome. I've discussed this movie with friends and coworkers alike, and nearly all of them found some of the action sequences--especially the \\"Smith fight\\" we all heard would be in the movie--to be too long and tedious. This is a huge red flag for action fans, because the end of an action sequence should either leave you wanting a slight bit more, or completely content with the awesomeness that just occured. These fights scenes do neither. They are over-stylized, over-the-top sequences that are wooden and uninspired. In the first movie, there was a real sense of desperation to some of the action, a sense that fighting was for survival, not just looking good (which I honestly don't think they manage in Reloaded anyway) in black and leather. Go watch Drunken Master or Iron Monkey after this movie to remind yourself of what good fighting sequences are--you won't regret it. In addition, the \\"Matrix abilities\\" people have in Reloaded is not consistent, and what they actually do is not consistent. The first movie had its inconsistencies here, but they weren't too glaring--unlike Reloaded. Special effects are poured on and on and on. Every little thing someone does, be it just jump, somersault, spin, and in many cases just pose, are slow-moed, bullet-timed, or over-accentuated by some sort of destruction. It's evident the W Bros had a ton of money to throw at this movie, and boy did they throw it, with no real restraint. Sharp editors could have really helped this, but the first movie was such a hit that free reign was obviously given, which brings us to. . . Character and dialogue: I have already more or less said the dialogue was tired and full of philosophical platitudes. Actors can't really bring a lot of depth to their character when the script and direction is shoving character progression audience's face, or neglecting it altogether. The audience is at no time given nuance and substance so they can contemplate the character on their own. Keanu's acting performance is stiff at best. Keanu is good at acting confused, and that's about all he does in this film. He makes a decent attempt to show passion between Neo and Trinity, but it falls flat. Lawrence tries to make Morpheus everything from Moses to Henry V, and be as cool as a cat throughout. With the script he is provided, he makes a noble attempt, but it also falls flat. Moss isn't very believable either. Her look of concern is always the same, much like Keanu's, and the chemistry isn't there, although in their very physical scenes they fake it well enough. Hugo once again brought his weird sense of being an Agent program, but he too suffered from the script's hand. I actually find him to be the most interesting character of the bunch, but instead of development they just make him an excuse for a huge, drawn out fight scene. All in all, this movie is beyond disappointing if you had good expectations, and on its own, as a stand-alone movie (which is not how it's supposed to be taken), it's still horrible. I don't see The Matrix as deep, but I at least see it as an enjoyable scifi romp that has some interesting ideas, good action, a few funny lines, and enough restrained symbolism and elusions to amuse the attentive. Reloaded fails on all these counts, and I really hope the W Bros will give us a better experience in the 3rd installment. Granted, I don't have a lot of hope left for that after this film.

Effectiveness: Crushed ice is extremely effective in making your cup of water colder. This is because ice, being a solid form of water, has a lower temperature than liquid water. As you add crushed ice to your cup of water, the ice transfers its cold energy to the water, effectively lowering its temperature. 2. Availability: Crushed ice is readily accessible for most people. Many households have ice trays or ice makers in their refrigerators, making it easy to obtain crushed ice. In contrast, liquid nitrogen requires specialized handling and is not commonly found in homes. 3. Safety: Using crushed ice to cool down a cup of water is a safe method. In contrast, using liquid nitrogen can be dangerous due to its extremely cold temperature (-320°F/-195.8°C). Direct exposure to liquid nitrogen can cause severe frostbite, and it requires specific safety precautions during handling. 4. Simplicity: Adding crushed ice to a cup of water is a simple and straightforward process. Conversely, using a steam room, tidal waves, or an ocean to cool down your water would likely be both impractical and inefficient. In conclusion, the best option for making your cup of water colder is to use crushed ice. Its effectiveness, availability, safety, and simplicity make it the most suitable choice among the options provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A person with understanding is aware of the consequences of their actions and the implications of the decisions they make. As a result, they are able to navigate their life's journey in a straight manner, avoiding any pitfalls or detours that may lead to failure or disappointment. In the Bible, the book of Proverbs contains several references to the importance and benefits of having understanding and wisdom. Proverbs 15:22 underscores the significance of counsel and guidance in one's life. When you have proper guidance, you are able to make informed decisions, which in turn result in success. This verse explains that without counsel, plans are more likely to fail. In other words, if an individual tries to accomplish something on their own, without seeking the advice of others who may have experience or knowledge in the matter, their endeavors may prove unsuccessful. Counsel takes many forms, such as seeking the guidance of trusted friends, consulting experts in a particular area, or even turning to God through prayer and scripture. It is important to remember that wisdom and understanding do not only come from one's own experiences or intelligence. Oftentimes, they can be gained from the insights and perspectives of others. Surrounding oneself with wise, experienced, or knowledgeable people and being open to their advice can significantly increase a person's chances of success. In conclusion, the passage \\"But a man of understanding keeps his way straight. 15:22 Where there is no counsel, plans fail,\\" highlights the importance of having guidance and seeking advice from others to ensure success. By fostering wisdom and understanding in one's life, it becomes easier to navigate the complexities of this world and achieve a straight path toward one's goals and aspirations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie title: The Golden Compass Context: The story takes place in an alternate world dominated by a powerful church called the Magisterium, and where part of the soul resides outside a person as an animal companion called a dÃ¦mon. Lyra Belacqua, an orphan raised in a college in Oxford, England, and her dÃ¦mon Pantalaimon (Pan) witness a Magisterium agent poison her uncle's bottle of Tokay. Lyra then warns her uncle, Lord Asriel, who instructs her to remain in hiding. Lyra watches Asriel give a presentation regarding Dust, a particle that the Magisterium has forbidden the mention of. The college gives Asriel a grant to fund a northern expedition. At dinner, Lyra meets Mrs. Coulter, who insists on taking Lyra north as her assistant. Before Lyra leaves, the Master of the college entrusts her with the only remaining alethiometer, a compass-like artifact that reveals the truth. The Magisterium has destroyed all the others. He instructs her to keep it secret, especially from Mrs. Coulter. At Mrs. Coulter's house in a city that resembles a futuristic London, Lyra mentions 'dust', a type of mysterious particle. This puts Mrs. Coulter on edge and she warns Lyra never to mention it again, and also insists that she leave the bag containing the aleithiometer. Mrs. Coulter's dÃ¦mon (a golden monkey) attacks Pan, causing Lyra to give in. Lyra and Pan discover that Mrs. Coulter is head of the General Oblation Board, the \\"Gobblers\\", who have been kidnapping local children.

If \\"Three men working on building something with bricks.\\", can we conclude \\"A group of men are watching a football game.\\"?","completion":"No, we cannot conclude that \\"A group of men are watching a football game\\" based on the statement \\"Three men working on building something with bricks.\\" These two statements describe completely different scenarios, and there is no direct correlation or connection between them. Let's analyze both statements for better understanding. In the first statement, we have three men who are involved in a construction-related activity. They are working together to build something using bricks as the primary building material. This scenario focuses on a physical task that requires skills and effort related to construction or masonry. On the other hand, the second statement talks about a group of men watching a football game. This scenario involves people gathered together, possibly in a house, stadium, or public venue to enjoy a sporting event. Their primary activity is the passive observation of the game rather than actively working or constructing something. As we can see, these statements describe distinct situations that serve different purposes and involve unique activities. Thus, we cannot conclude that one is true simply based on the other being true. There is no given information or context that allows us to link the two statements or imply causality, relation, or connection between the building activity mentioned in the first statement and the football-watching scenario described in the second statement. In conclusion, while both statements contain groups of people engaging in an activity, the nature of the activities themselves and the given information prevents us from assuming any connection between them. Therefore, the presence of three men working on building something with bricks does not allow us to conclude that a group of men is watching a football game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As you may recall, my previous connection to the morgue was severed after that unfortunate incident during our last procurement attempt. The authorities have tightened security, and even the most skilled hacker would struggle to bypass their updated protocols. It would be too risky, and the resulting fallout would undoubtedly draw attention to our activities - not to mention the severe legal consequences we would face if caught. So, for now, acquiring a body through the morgue is no longer a viable option. Two: morality. Yes, we have been known to bend or break the rules in the pursuit of our goals. However, tampering with the dead is not a path I'm willing to tread lightly. Desecrating a corpse goes against the fundamental understanding of respecting the deceased and their grieving loved ones. Although our intentions may not be malicious, we must always weigh the ethical implications of our actions and strive to maintain a certain standard when it comes to the treatment of the departed. That being said, we must find an alternative solution to secure the body we need. Our most promising possibility is to establish connections with medical research centers and institutions that conduct anatomical studies. By presenting ourselves as legitimate researchers or scientists looking to further our understanding of a specific field, we might be able to obtain a donated cadaver without arousing suspicion. Of course, this approach will require meticulous planning and attention to detail. First, we'll have to create credible backgrounds and credentials for ourselves. This could involve forging degrees, certifications, and even creating a comprehensive online presence that showcases our fake professional histories. We'll also need to establish connections with influential individuals in our target research institutions, which may be achieved through networking events, conferences, or even online forums relevant to our chosen field of study. Once we have successfully infiltrated the medical research community, we'll need to identify a suitable body donor. Ideally, we want someone in relatively good health, with minimal physical abnormalities or injuries. In addition to reviewing the public donor registry, we might also consider contacting oncology wards, palliative care facilities, or organ transplant centers to inquire about potential donors who have recently passed away. Once we've secured a suitable cadaver, we must be cautious in our transportation and handling of the body to avoid any breaches in protocol or biohazard containment. We would have to make arrangements for a sterile and secure environment to carry out our plan, ideally an abandoned warehouse or secluded laboratory. Proper protective measures, such as wearing hazmat suits and employing air filtration systems, will also be essential to ensure our safety and prevent contamination. In conclusion, although obtaining a body from the morgue is no longer possible, we still have options on the table. By meticulously planning our infiltration into the medical research community and securing a legally and ethically sourced cadaver, we will be able to continue on our path without abandoning our principles. Our path may be more difficult, but ultimately it will ensure we maintain our integrity and avoid unnecessary trouble with the law."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: Every year there is the Spring Festival in China.

To cancel out the -71 that is being subtracted from -6c, we'll add 71 to both sides of the equation. -47 + 71 = -6c - 71 + 71 Step 2: Simplify both sides. Now, simplify by doing the math on both sides of the equation: 24 = -6c Step 3: Divide by the coefficient of c.

Q:Information: - The FAL, or Fusil Automatique Léger (\\"Light Automatic Rifle\\"), is a semi-automatic/selective fire battle rifle produced by the Belgian armaments manufacturer Fabrique Nationale de Herstal (FN). During the Cold War it was adopted by many North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) countries, with the notable exception of the United States. It is one of the most widely used rifles in history, having been used by more than 90 countries. - The CAL ( Carabine Automatique Légère ) was a Belgian weapon manufactured by Fabrique Nationale . It was the first 5.56 mm rifle produced by the Fabrique Nationale . It resembled the company 's highly successful FN FAL , but was an original design . Unlike the FAL , it was a market failure , although its development led to the reasonably successful FN FNC . - Fabrique Nationale d'Herstal (French for: National Factory of Herstal) self identified as FN Herstal and often referred to as Fabrique Nationale or simply FN is a leading firearms manufacturer located in Herstal, Belgium, and is owned by the holding company Herstal Group which is owned by the regional government of Wallonia. It is currently the largest exporter of military small arms in Europe. - The Cold War was a state of political and military tension after World War II between powers in the Eastern Bloc (the Soviet Union and its satellite states) and powers in the Western Bloc (the United States, its NATO allies and others). Historians do not fully agree on the dates, but a common timeframe is the period (the second half of the 20th century) between 1947, the year the Truman Doctrine (a U.S. policy pledging to aid nations threatened by Soviet expansionism) was announced, and 1991, the year the Soviet Union collapsed. - The FN FNC (French: \\"Fabrique Nationale Carabine\\") is a 5.56×45mm NATO assault rifle developed by the Belgian arms manufacturer FN Herstal and introduced in the late 1970s. - The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO '), also called the North Atlantic Alliance, is an intergovernmental military alliance based on the North Atlantic Treaty which was signed on 4 April 1949. The organization constitutes a system of collective defence whereby its member states agree to mutual defence in response to an attack by any external party. Three NATO members are permanent members of the United Nations Security Council with the power to veto and are officially nuclear-weapon states: the United States, France and the United Kingdom. NATO's headquarters are located in Haren, Brussels, Belgium, where the Supreme Allied Commander also resides. Belgium is one of the 28 member states across North America and Europe, the newest of which, Albania and Croatia, joined in April 2009. An additional 22 countries participate in NATO's Partnership for Peace program, with 15 other countries involved in institutionalized dialogue programmes. The combined military spending of all NATO members constitutes over 70% of the global total. Members' defence spending is supposed to amount to 2% of GDP. - A battle rifle is a military service rifle that fires a full-power rifle cartridge, such as 7.62×51mm NATO, 7.62×54mmR, 7.92x57mm Mauser, .303 British, or .30-06 Springfield. Compared to assault rifles and their intermediate cartridges, the higher-caliber rounds provide greater power and range, though they have greater weight and produce stronger recoil, making them less than ideal for fully automatic fire.

Question: Who is being initiated into the gang? Movie title: Sin Nombre Movie plot: Willy, nicknamed El Casper, is a member of the Mara Salvatrucha gang and lives in Tapachula, a Mexican town near the border with Guatemala. He introduces a young boy into his gang, and the boy is given the nickname Smiley after a violent initiation. Casper later helps Smiley to complete this initiation by helping him execute a rival gang-member. Casper is romantically involved with a girl, Martha Marlen. Fearing for the girl's safety, he keeps the relationship a secret from his gang, but his double life causes his gang to doubt his loyalty. When Martha follows Casper to a gathering of his gang, the gang leader, Lil Mago, escorts her out, despite Casper's misgivings. Mago attempts to rape Martha and accidentally kills her. Later, he blithely tells Casper that he will find another. Shortly afterward, Mago brings Casper and Smiley to La Bombilla, a location along the train tracks where potential illegal immigrants stow away on passing trains on their way to the United States. Among the immigrants is a Honduran family introduced earlier consisting of the teenage girl Sayra, her father, and her uncle, who are on their way to relatives in New Jersey. Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping....

How do you do this: how do you stay above water in the ocean?","completion":"Staying afloat in the ocean requires a few key elements: 1. Staying Calm: This is crucial for survival in not just ocean situations, but any life-threatening situation. Panicking can cause you to swallow water, struggle unnecessarily, and quickly deplete your stamina. Stay as calm as possible to save vital energy. 2. Float on your back: Lay flat on your back in the water, spread out your arms and legs, and arch your back. With your head tilted back, your body should stay at the water's surface, allowing you to float. Your buoyancy in this position is usually enough to keep your face above water. 3. Treading Water: Develop a good treading water technique. This involves a scissoring motion with your legs and a sweeping motion with your arms to maintain buoyancy and keep your head above water. 4. Regular breathing: Even if you are not a good swimmer, you can still keep afloat by just lying on your back and kicking the water at a slow but regular pace. Remember to breathe regularly so you don't build up carbon dioxide, which could make you want to breathe faster and risk swallowing water. 5. Using a flotation device: If you are on a boat and foresee the chance of ending up in the water, it is always a good idea to have a life-vest on. Even with no experience in swimming, a life vest keeps you afloat. To summarize, the key factors in staying afloat are staying calm, knowing how to float on your back and tread water, and possessing a flotation device if possible. Every person should learn basic swimming and survival skills."},{"prompt":"Definition: You are given a sentence in Hebrew. Your job is to translate the Hebrew sentence into Japanese.

You might be wondering, why is a quarter such a big deal? Well, it's not just Jensen. According to the Institute for Women's Policy Research (IWPR), there was a 21-percent wage gap between full-time male and female workers in 2014. And those numbers are even worse for women of color.

The teen was hired at Pizza Studio in the Legends but was fired an hour later after asking her boss about her wage. Friday night, metro lawyers say she could have a pretty big lawsuit on her hands. Seventeen-year-old Jensen Walcott was excited for her interview at Pizza Studio in the Legends Outlet Mall, especially after hearing one of her good friends, 17-year-old Jake Reed had just been hired the same day. “She sent me a message like omg I have an interview at 3,” Reed said. Jensen was interviewed and hired on the spot. “She said good news, you got the job,” Jensen said. Jensen left immediately and called Jake to share the news, they’d be working together. “We were excited. We were super excited.” But soon, that excitement turned to confusion after Jake told her, he was making 8.25 an hour. She was hired for 8 an hour. The two are the same age, have the same amount of experience and were hired for the same position. Jensen thought for sure it was just a mix up and called her new boss, asking why her wage differed from Jake’s. The manager put her on hold. “I was like maybe when I'm on hold right now, she will just offer me 8.25 and everything is gonna be good but... she didn't do that,” Jensen said. The manager got back on the phone and told Jensen she was fired because discussing wages is against its policy. “She said you're fired. Basically just like a 10 second phone call,” Reed said. Both teens were terminated hours after being hired, for discussing their wages. “At any point did they say to you, do not discuss this, it is our policy?” FOX 4’s Megan Brilley asked. “No. Not once,” the two teens said. “At face value it appears, that the young lady was terminated because she complained about unequal wages. That's illegal,” said attorney David White. White says the National Labor Relations Board has given guidance saying you can discuss wages. White believes Jensen may have a claim for retaliation. “Probably what happened- they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain,” White said. On the contrary. Jensen doesn’t know if she will file any official action. She just wants to know, why she wasn’t given the same pay as her friend. “They should definitely be ashamed of themselves,” she said.

We explained the situation to corporate reps, who said the incident “sounded strange.” The representative said he would get to the bottom of it and call FOX 4 back.

A teen, a hero, a pay-discrimination advocate before even heading off to college. When 17-year-old Jensen Walcott was hired at a pizza spot in her local outlet mall, she was excited to hear that she would be joining her friend Jake Reed on the job, who had been hired on the exact same day. When she and Reed discussed their roles, however, she discovered that Reed had been hired at 8.25 an hour, while Walcott had been hired at 8 an hour. Considering the fact that the pair had the same work experience and are the same age and were hired for the same role, this seemed like a clear case of pay discrimination. So Walcott did something about it. The teen called her new manager to ask why it would be that Reed was given a quarter more than she was. Her manager put her on hold and came back to say that she had been fired because \\"discussing wages is against policy.\\" Reed was given the same treatment. But both teens assert that this policy was never talked about with them before being hired, and it is not illegal to discuss wages. Walcott could technically take legal action in this case, but all she's interested in is some answers. The teens: They're doing okay! ||||| Editor’s note: After publishing this piece, we received the following communication from Ashleigh Siefker, Executive Director of Operations at Pizza Studio: “Pizza Studio has fully investigated the incident and we want to be clear that gender did not play a role in determination of either salary, nor for any Pizza Studio employee. […] After an in-depth review, we are confident this instance was not one of gender-bias but rather a failure to assign the correct salary and a misunderstanding of our company policies by one of our employees; it should be noted the manager in communication with Miss Walcott is also a female. Pizza Studio did not agree however with how the manager handled the situation. We pride ourselves with treating our employees and guests with respect and open communication at all times. We have extended a formal apology to both Miss Walcott and Mr. Reed and have parted ways with the responsible manager in the best interest of all parties involved. We plan to use this experience to better improve our hiring procedures and policies moving forward.” *** Wage inequality between men and women rears its ugly head again, this time for a Kansas teen that discovered her male friend was making more money than she was for the same job. When she questioned what she thought was an innocent mistake, her manager fired her. Jensen Walcott, 17, began her job at Pizza Studio for 8 an hour, excited to finally land a summer job. She was also delighted when she learned that her good friend Jake Reed, also 17, would be working with her. That is, until she learned that even with the exact same experience and skill set, he was hired at 8.25 an hour. When she asked her manager to fix the problem, her manager fired her and Jake for discussing wages, apparently against policy for Pizza Studio. This does not, however, address the question of why they were paid unequal wages in the first place. According to the National Labor Relations Board, it’s entirely appropriate for employees to discuss wages. And despite the passage of the Equal Pay Act of 1963, which requires that men and women in the same work place be given equal pay for equal work, the “gender gap” in pay continues to this day. According to the Institute for Women’s Policy Research (IWPR), there was a 21-percent wage gap between full-time male and female workers in 2014. The pay gap is even greater for African-American and Latina women, with African-American women earning .64 and Latina women earning .56 for every dollar earned by a white non-Hispanic man. Claudia Goldin recently discussed this for a Freakonomics radio session called “The True Story of the Gender Pay Gap.” Goldin is the first woman to get tenure in the Harvard economics department, so I’m going to go out on a limb and say she knows more about this than I do. Goldin cites several factors including “occupational segregation,” which essentially means men and women traditionally apply for jobs in different job sectors (i.e. more women are nurses and more men are doctors, though this gap is shrinking). Though in Jensen’s case, it appears she was simply paid less for having a vagina. Also temporal flexibility, the ability to put in hours when you can, is more important to women because of the “parent penalty,” which Goldin says can also contribute to a difference in wages. What everyone seems to be missing here is women place importance on this because we are required to be the more flexible worker in order to take care of our families. We are not doing less work. In fact, I know many women who work as much as possible in the office; take kids to activities, doctor appointments, make meals, and get them to bed; and THEN sit up until midnight finishing their day jobs. If the work is getting completed, this obligatory flexibility deserves less income why exactly? There is also an inbred belief on the part of most women that they don’t want to seem “difficult” or “spoiled” by asking for more money. When Jennifer Lawrence found out she was being paid less than her male counterparts for American Hustle, she blamed herself because she was a “bad negotiator.” This does not seem to be a problem for men because men are acclimatized from an early age to believe they deserve more. This is not an insult to men, but an observation that the opportunity exists for all of us to instill the same belief in our young girls. The fact that it is 2016 and we are still talking about this is ludicrous. Women make up nearly half of the U.S. labor force and are, in today’s society, more and more becoming the breadwinners for their families. When women are not paid equitably, everyone — including the men in their family — suffers. This is not a gender problem, this is everyone’s problem. h/t: MSN Article Posted 3 years Ago ||||| Jensen Walcott may be the new hero of the equal pay for equal work movement. The 17-year-old Kansas City, Kansas native was fired from her job at a pizza place in an outlet mall after she complained about receiving less pay than her male friend for doing the same job with the same amount of experience, according to New York magazine. Jensen told local news station WDAF that she heard about a job at Pizza Studio in Kansas City from her friend Jake Reed, who had been hired that same day, and when she applied and got the job, she called to tell him how excited she was. “We were super excited,” Jake told the news station. But as the pair compared notes about what Jensen could expect from the new gig, she found out that she had been hired for the same job as her male friend for less money: she was offered 8 an hour, while Jake was offered 8.25 an hour, according to the report. They had the same level of experience. Thinking it must be a mistake, Jensen called the Pizza Studio to ask the manager what was up, and the boss put her on hold. “I was like, maybe when I’m on hold right now she’ll just offer me 8.25 and everything’s going to be good,” Jensen WDAF. But that isn’t what happened. First, the boss fired Jensen, then she called up Jake and told him he was fired, too. Both allegedly violated the company policy of not discussing wages outside of work, which they had never been told, according to the report. It should also be noted that such a policy prohibiting employees from discussing their wages is illegal , and has been since 1935 for exactly this reason. Employees are allowed to discuss matters that pertain to their job \\"for the purpose of collective bargaining or other mutual aid or protection,\\" according to the National Labor Relations Act. “She said you’re fired, basically, it was like a 10-second phone call,” Jake told WDAF. Attorney David White told WDAF that discussing wages is legal, according to the National Labor Relations Board, and that the case seemed to be clear-cut: Jensen was fired for complaining about unequal pay, he said. “Probably what happened — they're teenagers. They didn't think they'd complain,” White said . The incident comes just seven years after President Obama signed the Lily Ledbetter Fair Pay Act into law, which strengthened the options for recourse available to workers who allege that their employers discriminate based on sex when it comes to wages.

They don't expect to make a whole lot of cash at these endeavors, just a little something extra for a few fun outings or to save up for a bigger purchase, like a car. Still, every cent counts, whether you're a teenager or an adult. That's why when a Kansas teenager found out she was making a quarter less an hour than her male co-worker — even though they were the same age with the same amount of experience — she brought it to her boss's attention, thinking he'd want to fix the flub. She ended up getting fired instead, and this is extremely not OK. More: 13 funny graduation cap ideas that deserve an A+ In fact, there's tons of stuff about this story that fall squarely into the category of jacked up, beginning with the fact that the teen, whose name is Jensen Walcott, was being paid 8 an hour while her male co-worker was making 8.25. That's bad enough, because it suggests the trend of women being paid less for doing the same thing as their male co-workers begins as young as 17, which is how old both Walcott and her co-worker are. But when the teen brought the discrepancy to her employer's attention, they fired both her and her male friend, Jake Reed, for discussing wages at work. Prohibiting talk about wages is a popular practice, and it's always been an ethically murky one. Ever since 2014, however, it's also an unenforceable and illegal one thanks to an executive order from President Obama that bars employers from retaliating against employees seeking fair wages. More: I have to be honest: Other parents scare me more than pedophiles Both of those things are equally disturbing, but arguably the worst part of all of this is that we are regularly telling our children to do the right thing. That's what it appears the two friends were doing. Walcott and Reed were already friends, so it's completely natural to assume they would talk about what was going into their paychecks. That Reed was upfront with his friend about how she was getting the short stick is commendable, and it means he did the right thing. Then Walcott did what any employee with a brain would do: She stood up for her best interests and asked them to take the reasonable and ethically correct course and pay both her and her co-worker the same amount of money for exactly the same work. She also did the right thing. They both were punished for it. It doesn't have to stay that way. Pizza Studio, the teens' employer, was definitely in the wrong here, according to a labor attorney who spoke to a local news outlet after Walcott came forward. If she wanted to, she could seek recourse for herself and for her friend, and we hope she does. More: Neighbors called the cops on these parents for their unusual punishment Teaching our kids to do the right thing can sometimes seem like an uphill battle, especially in cases like this, where speaking out against inequality lands them in trouble. But we need to keep sending the message. It is seriously encouraging that Walcott at least recognizes that what her employer did was wrong. When we raise kids who understand inequity and that they're responsible for calling it out when they see it, we make it possible for them to stick up not just for themselves but for others as well. That's important. It's important that the next generation looks out both for their best interests and the interests of those who may not feel safe coming forward for a variety of reasons. It means our kids might be able to accomplish what we might not in our lifetime, which is to do away with this kind of crap. It might feel a little disheartening that the moral compass in this story were not the adults but two teens. But it shouldn't. It means that something we're saying is sticking, and if every kid speaks up the way these two did, we have a whole lot to be thankful for.

To fully address both questions, it is essential to explore the origins and implications of these contractions, as well as the regional differences in language usage. Question 1: \\"Why do Yankees say 'Math' instead of 'Maths' when the term is a contraction of 'Mathematics' (ie NOT 'Mathematic')?\\" Yankees, referring to Americans in this context, generally use \\"Math\\" as a short form for \\"Mathematics\\". The reason for this is rooted in the differences between British and American English. In American English, the contraction \\"Math\\" has been adopted as the standard abbreviation for \\"Mathematics\\". This stems from the use of singular and collective nouns, which varies slightly between the two forms of English. In American English, some collective nouns tend to be treated as singular and thus take singular verbs, while in British English, they are more likely to be treated as plural and take plural verbs. For example, American English would treat \\"Mathematics\\" as a singular noun with a singular verb, resulting in the contraction \\"Math.\\" It's important to note that there doesn't seem to be a universally agreed-upon answer as to why \\"math\\" was adopted in American English over \\"maths.\\" Specific historical and regional factors could have contributed to the pattern of usage, with the differing style gaining popularity across the United States over time. Question 2: \\"When people say 'Maths' instead of 'Math' are they indicating plurality in some way?\\" \\"Maths\\" is the standard contraction for \\"Mathematics\\" in British English, and other dialects, such as Australian English. Although \\"Mathematics\\" is a collective noun that refers to a field of study, it does indeed contain a plural element, as indicated by the \\"s\\" at the end of the word. British English, as mentioned earlier, tends to treat collective nouns as plural and use plural verbs with them. Thus, it is not surprising that \\"Mathematics\\" is contracted to \\"Maths\\" in British English, which retains that plural element.

Here's a short story: Penelope kicks the ball along the grass surface of a soccer field, then later she kicks it with the same force along an artificial turf field. The ball rolls for a longer time on the artificial turf than it does on the grass, which is due to the more smooth surface of the (A) artificial turf (B) grass.. What is the most sensical answer between \\"artificial turf\\" and \\"grass\\"? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The most sensical answer between \\"artificial turf\\" and \\"grass\\" is (A) artificial turf. This is because artificial turf has a smoother surface compared to grass. When Penelope kicks the ball with the same force on both surfaces, a critical factor that determines how long and far the ball will roll is the friction between the ball and the surface it is rolling on. Friction is a force that resists the motion of two surfaces as they rub against each other, and it is affected by the roughness or smoothness of the surfaces involved. Grass, as a natural surface, tends to be more uneven and rougher than artificial turf. Grass blades can create additional resistance against the ball, and the soft, yielding nature of the soil underneath the grass can absorb some of the energy that the ball has, causing the ball to slow down more quickly. Moreover, natural grass fields are often affected by factors such as humidity and changes in weather conditions, which can further increase the inconsistency and roughness of the playing surface. Artificial turf, on the other hand, is made from synthetic fibers designed to mimic the appearance of grass. These fibers are usually more uniform and smoother in texture, and the surface created is less prone to the inconsistencies of natural grass. This translates to lower friction between the ball and the artificial turf, allowing the ball to roll for a longer time and distance when kicked with the same force compared to when it is kicked on a grass field. In conclusion, Penelope's observation that the ball rolls longer on the artificial turf can be attributed to the smoother surface provided by the artificial turf, which results in reduced friction acting on the ball and allows it to cover a greater distance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: Information: - Laura Jane Ballance (born February 22, 1968) is the bassist in the rock band Superchunk and co-founder of Merge Records along with Mac McCaughan. In 2013 she announced that she would no longer be touring with the band due to her worsening hyperacusis. - Indie rock is a genre of alternative rock that originated in the United States and the United Kingdom in the 1980s. Indie rock encapsulates indie pop and lo-fi, among others. Originally used to describe record labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was initially used interchangeably with alternative rock. As grunge and punk revival bands in the US, and then Britpop bands in the UK, broke into the mainstream in the 1990s, it came to be used to identify those acts that retained an outsider and underground perspective. In the 2000s, as a result of changes in the music industry and the growing importance of the Internet, some indie rock acts began to enjoy commercial success, leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term. - Here 's to Shutting Up is the eighth studio album by Superchunk . Brian Paulson , who served as co-producer , previously worked with the band on 1994 's Foolish . On this album , the band continued to develop away from the fuzzy punk - pop of its earlier days to something more textured . Keyboards , strings and acoustic guitars abound , and even a pedal steel makes an appearance on \`\` Phone Sex . '' The band left \`\` Phone Sex '' out of the initial performances of the accompanying tour ; with the 11 September 2001 attacks a painfully fresh memory , the members felt uncomfortable performing a song featuring the lyrics \`\` Plane crash footage on TV / I know , I know that could be me . '' The title of the album is taken from the opening of the song \`\` Out on the Wing . '' - Superchunk is an American indie rock band from Chapel Hill, North Carolina, consisting of singer-guitarist Mac McCaughan, guitarist Jim Wilbur, bassist Laura Ballance, and drummer Jon Wurster. Formed in 1989, they were one of the bands that helped define the Chapel Hill music scene of the 1990s. Their energetic, high-velocity style and do-it-yourself ethics were influenced by punk rock. - Ralph Lee \\"Mac\\" McCaughan (born July 12, 1967) is an American musician and record label owner, based in North Carolina. His main musical projects have been Superchunk since 1989 and Portastatic since the early 1990s. In 1989 he founded the independent record label Merge Records with Superchunk bandmate Laura Ballance. - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels.

New experiments show that may not be true, even within a vacuum. Sometimes, light slows a bit. The new research is\\"very impressive work\\", Robert Boyd toldScienceNews.An optical physicist at the University of Rochester in New York, he did not work on the study. He speaks of the new finding:\\"It's the sort of thing that's so obvious; you wonder why you didn't think of it first.\\" Light travels as particles and as waves. Photons are the name given to those particles that represent the smallest possible amount of light. At their fastest, photons travel nearly 300 million meters (almost 1 billion feet) in a single second. That's fast enough to get to the moon and back in about 2.6 seconds. Scientists had long known, though, that they could slow light photons down by shining them through a material such as glass or water. Still, light moving through a vacuum has usually been assumed to move at a peak speed. That would seem to make sense. After all, a vacuum is a space with nothing in it to slow light down. In a new study, however, scientists show that even racing through a vacuum, light can slow. So the speed of light is more of a universal speed limit than an rule for how fast photons travel, the new data suggest. Miles Padgett led the new study. As an optical physicist, he works at the University of Glasgow in Scotland. He and his colleagues showed that the key to slowing light is to change the shape of a light wave. Padgett described how they did this in a paper published online January 22 inScience. His team raced a pair of photons. One traveled unchanged through a cable made from optical fibers. The other passed through a pair of devices that acted like lenses. A lens changes light: It can focus a spread-out beam of light on a point, for instance. The second photon passed through one device that changed the shape of its waveand another that changed it back to its original form. The first photon won the race. The second photon came in a tiny bit later, several...

The answer to the question: Who does Peter save from the shark? is inside the article: On an island near Antarctica, a male penguin named Peter sees a female named Polly, and attempts to woo her. First he offers her an ice cream made of snow and icicle, which she accepts. Next, he tries catching her a fish, but only succeeds in catching a pufferfish. Polly accepts it graciously, but when she swallows it, she begins inflating and deflating repeatedly until Peter makes her spit out the fish, which then returns to water. Peter shrugs in embarrassment, but, feeling humiliated, Polly slaps him and leaves to swim on a small iceberg. On the shore, Peter kicks himself for letting her get away, but then notices a sharkfin moving towards Polly's iceberg. He squawks a danger warning to her, but Polly ignores him, thinking that he's just begging for forgiveness that he won't get. Soon enough, the shark attacks Polly, who swims away in panic. Needing to act, Peter picks up a stick and charges out to help. The shark chases Polly around the bay for several minutes. When it looks like he has her cornered, Peter arrives and clobbers him on the nose. Enraged, the shark starts chasing after Peter. After several minutes of fighting and swimming away from the shark, Peter tries to escape by climbing up onto a cliff with a boulder on top. Peter unintentionally dislodges the boulder, which falls into the shark's mouth, who then swallows it. Due to the boulder's weight, the shark sinks to the bottom of the bay. The shark struggles until he's too tired to move. Passing fish begin to poke fun at him. Meanwhile, Polly and Peter reconcile and fall in love, thus Peter's wooing succeeded. They cuddle, and their bodies form a heart-shaped silhouette on the horizon., can you guess it ?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, Peter saves Polly from the shark.

However, recent years have seen a surge in competition, giving customers a plethora of options to choose from. It is becoming evident that Apple's exclusive claim on consumer loyalty may no longer endure. This article will discuss the major reasons as to why Apple's free run for our smartphone hearts and minds is over and what challenges lay ahead for the tech giant. The Rise of Competitors One of the primary reasons that Apple enjoyed a significant run for so long was its status as the primary innovator in the smartphone industry. With the launch of the first iPhone back in 2007, Apple changed the world of communication forever. However, as time went on, various brands seized the opportunity to build on and improve upon Apple's innovations. 1. The Android Invasion: Arguably the most prominent challenger for Apple's throne has been Google's Android operating system (OS), which powers a majority of the world's smartphones today. The Android platform has provided Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) with a robust and developer-friendly environment to craft their own unique experiences. This versatility and openness of Android have led to an increase in OEMs and resulted in a diverse array of devices catering to various price ranges and preferences. 2. Quality Devices at Affordable Prices: Companies like Samsung, Huawei, OnePlus, and Xiaomi have significantly raised the bar for smartphone hardware and features. By offering premium-quality devices at competitive prices, they have managed to chip away at Apple's perceived exclusivity and superiority. 3. The Growth of Chinese Smartphone Makers: Chinese companies such as Huawei, Xiaomi, Oppo, and Vivo have managed to rapidly expand their global footprint, often providing feature-packed devices at significantly lower costs than their competitors. Taking Notice of Consumer Needs Listening to customer demand and preferences plays a vital role in maintaining market dominance, and competitors have stepped up their game in this aspect. For instance, Apple's decision to remove the headphone jack in the iPhone 7 faced considerable backlash from users. Brands such as Samsung benefitted from public discontent by including the headphone jack in their flagship devices alongside other innovative features such as expandable storage, which offers flexibility and choice to its users. Software Innovation Apple's iOS has enjoyed a streamlined and cohesive user experience for years, but the Android OS has matured and improved exponentially in terms of performance, design, and overall user experience. As part of Android's evolution, regular feature updates, improved security, and a host of customization choices have narrowed the gap between iOS and Android, providing users more reasons to consider alternatives to Apple's products. Conclusion The days when Apple had a free run for our smartphone hearts and minds are indeed over. While Apple remains a dominant player in the smartphone market, an open battleground has emerged, with a multitude of options and features for customers to choose from. As the competition continues to intensify, it will be interesting to see the strategies adopted by Apple in the coming years in response to these challenges. We can expect innovation and evolution in both hardware and software, ultimately benefiting consumers as they become the driving force in an open and exciting smartphone landscape."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Solubility may increase or decrease with temperature; the magnitude of this temperature dependence varies widely among compounds. Notice in particular the curves for NH4NO3 and CaCl2. The dissolution of ammonium nitrate in water is endothermic (ΔHsoln = +25.7 kJ/mol), whereas the dissolution of calcium chloride is exothermic (ΔHsoln = −68.2 kJ/mol), yet Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\" shows that the solubility of both compounds increases sharply with increasing temperature. In fact, the magnitudes of the changes in both enthalpy and entropy for dissolution are temperature dependent. Because the solubility of a compound is ultimately determined by relatively small differences between large numbers, there is generally no good way to predict how the solubility will vary with temperature. The variation of solubility with temperature has been measured for a wide range of compounds, and the results are published in many standard reference books. Chemists are often able to use this information to separate the components of a mixture byfractional crystallization, the separation of compounds on the basis of their solubilities in a given solvent. For example, if we have a mixture of 150 g of sodium acetate (CH3CO2Na) and 50 g of KBr, we can separate the two compounds by dissolving the mixture in 100 g of water at 80°C and then cooling the solution slowly to 0°C. According to the temperature curves in Figure 13.9 \\"Solubilities of Several Inorganic and Organic Solids in Water as a Function of Temperature\\", both compounds dissolve in water at 80°C, and all 50 g of KBr remains in solution at 0°C. Only about 36 g of CH3CO2Na are soluble in 100 g of water at 0°C, however, so approximately 114 g (150 g − 36 g) of Saylor URL: http://www. saylor. org/books.

Summarize this article: Elon Musk has escalated his baseless attacks against a British diver, claiming without evidence that the man who helped rescue children from a cave in Thailand was a “child rapist” in an email to a reporter. The embattled Tesla CEO faced widespread backlash in July when he first called the diver Vernon Unsworth a “pedo” in a tweet – an unfounded claim against a man who was part of the international team that freed 12 young footballers and their coach from the Tham Luang cave complex. Musk, who had unsuccessfully attempted to assist the rescue mission, eventually apologized to Unsworth. Elon Musk's 'pedo' claim is evidence only of his grossly inflated ego | Zoe Williams Read more On Tuesday, however, BuzzFeed published two new emails from Musk, in which he called a journalist who has written about the dispute a “fucking asshole” and he launched new extraordinary claims against Unsworth, without providing documentation to support the allegations. Musk called Unsworth a “single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years”, alleging that he had moved to Chiang Rai “for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time”. He asserted that the city was “renowned for child sex-trafficking”. Ryan Mac (@RMac18) This was his first email to me after I asked him twice for comment on a legal threat from the rescuer's lawyer. He prefaced the email with \\"off the record\\" though I did not agree to that condition. Off the record is a two-party agreement. pic.twitter.com/szknfOMg0s BuzzFeed reported that it had investigated the allegations and Unsworth’s background, but could not verify any of the claims and said that it was unclear where the allegations originated. Unsworth, who said he was considering legal action after the original insults on Twitter, is now moving forward with a lawsuit, his lawyer said in an email to the Guardian on Tuesday: “Elon Musk’s campaign of publishing vile and false accusations against Mr Unsworth is inexcusable. Musk hopes to be sued and he deserves to be sued. He will be.” Musk’s email to BuzzFeed, which was a response to Unsworth’s latest legal threats, said: “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole … As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me.” Musk also defended his original effort to help the rescue mission in a follow-up email. Musk confirmed to the Guardian on Tuesday that he had sent the emailbut did not immediately comment further. Tesla spokespeople did not respond to a request for comment. BuzzFeed said it could not locate any UK criminal records for Unsworth, 63, and also spoke with his girlfriend, who said she was 40 and had been with him for seven years. The controversy comes at a time when Tesla and Musk continue to battle intense negative publicity and embarrassing controversies. His seemingly impulsive tweets have repeatedly led him into trouble. Notably, Musk recently tweeted that he had “secured” funding to take his electric car company private, which prompted scrutiny from the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and backlash from investors. Earlier this year, Tesla’s credit rating was downgraded to negative, with Moody’s citing a “significant shortfall” in the Model 3 production rate. The CEO also faced criticism after he slammed analysts on an earnings call in the spring, saying they should stop asking “boring, bonehead questions”. After the first attack on Unsworth, some investors demanded an apology and criticized Musk for distracting from Tesla’s mission. Julia Carrie Wong contributed reporting ||||| Elon Musk is apparently renewing his claims that a British diver who assisted in the rescue of a youth soccer team from a Thai cave earlier this year is a child molester. In a July tweetstorm, the Tesla Motors and SpaceX CEO labeled Vernon Unsworth, a diver who helped rescue 12 boys and their soccer coach from a flooded cave, a \\"pedo guy,\\" after Unsworth criticized a submarine rescue plan the billionaire had proposed. The tweet has since been deleted and Musk apologized for the comment. Musk doubled down on the accusation in an email sent last week to BuzzFeed News, calling Unsworth a \\"child rapist\\" who had moved to Thailand to take a child bride. \\"I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what's actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you f**king a**hole,\\" Musk wrote in an email that BuzzFeed published Tuesday. \\"He's an old, single white guy from England who's been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.\\" Musk has offered no evidence to support his claims, and Unsworth attorney L. Lin Wood denied the latest accusation in a statement to BuzzFeed News. \\"Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,\\" Wood wrote in a statement. \\"After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.\\" Musk's feud with Unsworth apparently began when Unsworth called Musk's involvement in the rescue effort a \\"PR stunt,\\" telling CNN his submarine wouldn't have made it 50 meters into the cave and saying Musk could \\"stick his submarine where it hurts.\\" BuzzFeed also interviewed Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, Unsworth's 40-year-old girlfriend, who said they have been dating for seven years but declined to answer questions about their relationship. Unsworth said in July he was considering legal action against Musk. Musk representatives didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. This article originally appeared on CNET. ||||| In an email to BuzzFeed News, Tesla CEO Elon Musk accused a Thai cave rescuer of moving to Thailand to take a child bride. The rescuer denied all the claims. Soe Zeya Tun / Reuters British caver Vernon Unsworth at the Tham Luang cave complex during a search for members of a soccer team and their coach in Thailand in June. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has renewed his attacks against a British man who played a key role in the rescue of a youth soccer team trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand. Musk last month apologized for accusing Vernon Unsworth of pedophilia after the diver questioned the value of Musk’s contribution to the rescue, a small submarine that ultimately went unused. But in a series of emails to BuzzFeed News, Musk repeated his original attacks on Unsworth — and made new and specific claims, lambasting the rescuer as a “child rapist” who had moved to the Southeast Asian country to take a child bride. Unsworth denied Musk's accusations through his attorney. Though Musk prefaced one email with “off the record,” BuzzFeed News did not agree to that condition of the correspondence. (Per common journalistic practice, a conversation is off the record only if both parties agree to the terms. ) BuzzFeed News first emailed Musk last Wednesday to ask for comment regarding a legal threat made by Unsworth’s lawyer in August after the Tesla CEO renewed his apparently evidenceless criticism of the rescuer in a Twitter argument the day before. Musk responded without addressing the substance of the legal threat. BuzzFeed News followed up twice, once on Wednesday and once on Thursday, and Musk responded with two separate emails. “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.” “I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole,” Musk wrote in the first message. “He’s an old, single white guy from England who’s been traveling to or living in Thailand for 30 to 40 years, mostly Pattaya Beach, until moving to Chiang Rai for a child bride who was about 12 years old at the time.” “As for this alleged threat of a lawsuit, which magically appeared when I raised the issue (nothing was sent or raised beforehand), I fucking hope he sues me,” he added. It is unclear why Musk believes the allegations against Unsworth or what evidence he has to support them. Musk did not provide proof of his claims to BuzzFeed News, and BuzzFeed News could not verify any of the claims after reporting on Unsworth’s background. BuzzFeed News The Tesla CEO’s continued campaign against Unsworth offers a glimpse into the new ability of some of the world’s wealthiest and most powerful figures to directly attack private citizens who cross them — and will test the capacity of traditional legal tools against them. “Elon Musk can tweet his vindictive and vicious lie about Mr. Unsworth a hundred times and it will still be a lie,” Unsworth’s lawyer, L. Lin Wood, wrote in a statement. “After deleting the initial accusation and tweeting an apology, Mr Musk has continued to republish his false and unsupportable accusation. His conduct demonstrates that his recklessness is intentional and designed to harm Mr. Unsworth.” A spokesperson for Tesla did not immediately return a request for comment on Musk's newest allegations, and referred to a previous statement issued by the board in response to a question about its support for the company's CEO. The feud began in July when Musk tweeted that Unsworth was “a pedo guy” after the rescuer called the billionaire’s attempt to use a custom-designed submarine in the rescue effort a “publicity stunt.” Musk later apologized and deleted this tweets, but revisited the claim last week in an argument on Twitter, asking why Unsworth hadn’t sued yet if the accusations were indeed untrue. BuzzFeed News then reported that Wood had actually sent Musk a letter warning of a possible defamation suit in early August. Musk’s renewed attacks on Unsworth come after a series of erratic public gestures, notably a widely publicized suggestion that he would take Tesla private and the narration of his home life by the rapper Azealia Banks. And the new accusations leveled at Unsworth threaten to undermine a recent charm offensive intended to frame the CEO’s erratic behavior as the actions of an overworked luminary struggling to maintain his world-changing businesses. It’s been a particularly difficult summer for the billionaire, marked by Tesla’s missed production goals, clashes with reporters, and his failed attempt to take his car company private. Despite that, Musk still managed to maintain a dispute with Unsworth, a 63-year-old cave explorer and diver, whom he has now accused of taking a child bride. BuzzFeed News could find no evidence to support that claim, and Musk did not provide any documentation to support his accusations. Publicly available legal documents do nothing to support Musk’s claims: BuzzFeed News could not immediately locate any criminal records for Unsworth in the UK. Separately, a Thai immigration official named Ploy Pailin told BuzzFeed News that an individual on a visa would likely not have it renewed if they had been found guilty of criminal activity in the country. Pailin also said that while foreigners applying for visas in Thailand do not undergo mandatory background checks, those who are found guilty of serious crimes are often blacklisted by the government and can be removed from the country. BuzzFeed News BuzzFeed News also spoke with Woranan Ratrawiphukkun, a Thai woman who is Unsworth’s longtime girlfriend. She said she had been with Unsworth for more than seven years and has posted numerous photos about their relationship on social media dating back several years. Unsworth, she added, spends part of the year in Thailand and part of the time in the UK. Ratrawiphukkun, who said she is 40, declined to comment on Musk’s allegations against Unsworth, and referred a reporter to his lawyers. Among Musk’s other claims about Unsworth is that he was not part of the actual dive team in the Thailand cave rescue. While Unsworth did not dive for the mission, media reports and other people who were part of the rescue cited the Brit as instrumental to the effort, as he had previously mapped and explored some of the cave system and recruited some of the divers who went into the cave. “He may claim to know how to cave dive, but he wasn’t on the cave dive rescue team and most of the actual dive team refused to hang out with him,” Musk wrote in one email. In another email in which Musk wrote “on background” — BuzzFeed News again did not agree to these terms — the Tesla CEO said, “Never saw Unsworth at any point. Was told he was banned from the site.” A British diver on the rescue mission who had previously been in contact with Musk, Rick Stanton, denied those claims. “I've no idea what gave you those concerns about Vern,” Stanton wrote over Facebook Messenger. “They are completely unfounded. He was never kicked off site by anyone and worked continuously on the rescue for the full duration. He was pivotal to the entire operation.” Two Australian specialists who were brought in by the Thai government to aid the Thai cave rescue operation, Richard Harris and Craig Challen, also rejected Musk’s allegation. “Vern seemed like an excellent guy and absolutely vital to the mission,” said Harris, who, with Challen, helped in the sedation of the Thai boys before they were brought out of the cave by the British divers. “You must be confusing him with someone else.” “He was pivotal with his knowledge of the cave. [The] rescue wouldn’t have happened without him recommending the Brits were called,” Harris said. Photos and videos posted on Facebook by Woranan and members of the local Thai news media show Unsworth at the site through the duration of the operation, which lasted more than two weeks in the country’s Chiang Rai province. Some of those photos show Unsworth posing with other British members involved with the rescue. In his second email to BuzzFeed News, Musk commented on Unsworth’s interview with CNN. “Unsworth also said I was asked to leave by the Thai govt, which is utterly false. Thai Prime Minister thanked me personally per attached docs. I went all the way to area 3 with the Thai SEAL team, who were awesome.” Unsworth did say that Musk was asked to leave the cave in the interview, but did not specify who had asked him. Musk also supplied a letter to BuzzFeed News from the Thai prime minister thanking him for his team’s involvement in the rescue. “I wish to convey my deep appreciation to you and your engineering team for your expeditious and extraordinary efforts in constructing the Space-X mini-submarine 'Wild Boar' to assist the rescue operation of the Moo Pa Academy Football team trapped in Tham Luang Cave, Chiang Rai province,” wrote General Prayut Chan-o-cha. Elon Musk provided to BuzzFeed News In addition, Musk claimed that the mini-sub, which ultimately was not used in the rescue, was built to Stanton’s specifications, and that it was not deployed only because too much water had been drained from the cave. Stanton, however, denied that was the reason, and said he did not recall providing exact specifications to Musk. “We didn't use the tube because rescue operations were already well underway and it didn't have the necessary life support systems,” Stanton said to BuzzFeed News on Facebook Messenger. “Essentially, it wasn't developed enough. I do think it has promise in certain situations and I hope they keep working on it to get it in shape for evaluation and to be considered as a viable alternative in future underwater rescue scenarios.” In another claim, Musk noted that “the alleged threat of a lawsuit” from Unsworth “magically appeared when I raised the issue” on Twitter last week and that nothing had been sent prior to his outburst. L. Lin Wood, Unsworth’s lawyer, provided BuzzFeed News with confirmation showing that he had sent a note titled “Fwd: Defamation of Vernon Unsworth” containing the legal letter to the appropriate email address for Musk’s office at SpaceX on Aug. 6. BuzzFeed News corresponded with the Tesla and SpaceX CEO at a separate, personal email address that two sources confirmed belonged to Musk. One source, who had previously worked for Musk, noted that the email address can be accessed by the billionaire and his assistants. The source noted that it was not uncommon for Musk to personally respond to reporters and other people through that account. Wood did not respond to questions asking him to more specifically address each of Musk’s accusations, but suggested that he was moving closer to legal action. “Today the rich and powerful seem all too ready to tweet falsities in the hope and expectation that their wealth and position will protect them,” he wrote in a statement. “Pedophilia is too serious an issue to leave unchallenged. If Mr. Musk believes his wealth affords him protection from his lies and Twibels, he is sadly mistaken.” Here are the emails Elon Musk sent to BuzzFeed News reporter Ryan Mac From: Elon Musk < redacted > Date: Thu, Aug 30, 2018 at 6:43 PM Subject: RE: BuzzFeed News: Unsworth legal letter To: \\"ryan.mac@buzzfeed.com\\" Off the record I suggest that you call people you know in Thailand, find out what’s actually going on and stop defending child rapists, you fucking asshole.

It was designed and built to specifications provided to me directly by Stanton and the actual dive team. The only reason it wasn’t used was that they were able to drain almost all the water out of the caves, so the underwater portion was very short, and the monsoon arrived later than expected.

One of the least understood involves the peculiar roles of producer or \\"provider\\" and purchaser or \\"consumer\\" in the typical doctor-patient relationship. In most sectors of the economy, it is the seller who attempts to attract a potential buyer with various appealing factors of price, quality, and use, and it is the buyer who makes the decision. Such condition, however, is not common in most of the health-care industry. In the health-care industry, the doctor-patient relationship is the mirror image of the ordinary relationship between producer and consumer. Once an individual has chosen to see a physician -- and even then there may be no real choice -- it is the physician who usually makes all significant purchasing decisions: whether the patient should return \\"next Wednesday\\", whether X-rays are needed, whether drugs should be prescribed, etc. It is rare that a patient will challenge such professional decisions or raise in advance questions about price, especially when the disease is regarded as serious. This is particularly significant in relation to hospital care. The physician must certify the need for hospitalization, determine what procedures will be performed, and announce when the patient may be discharged. The patient may be consulted about some of the decisions, but in general it is the doctor's judgments that are final. Little wonder then that in the eye of the hospital it is the physician who is the real \\"consumer\\". As a consequence, the medical staff represents the \\"power center\\" in hospital policy and decision-making, not the administration. Although usually there are in this situation four identifiable participants-- the physician, the hospital, the patient, and the payer (generally an insurance carrier or government)-- the physician makes the essential decisions for all of them.

Translate to German: Kieser Training is a franchise system and is always looking for new partners with entrepreneurial skills to act as single franchisees in Germany and master franchisees worldwide. German:","completion":"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem und sucht stets nach neuen Partnern mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten, um als einzelne Franchisenehmer in Deutschland und als Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit zu agieren. Step-by-step explanation: 1. First, I translated \\"Kieser Training is a franchise system\\" to \\"Kieser Training ist ein Franchisesystem\\" since this is a proper noun and \\"Franchise system\\" is simply \\"Franchisesystem\\" in German. 2. I translated \\"always looking for\\" to \\"stets nach\\" to convey the constant search for new partners. 3. I translated \\"new partners\\" to \\"neuen Partnern\\". In German, \\"new\\" becomes \\"neuen\\", and \\"partners\\" is \\"Partnern\\". 4. I translated \\"with entrepreneurial skills\\" to \\"mit unternehmerischen Fähigkeiten\\". In German, \\"with\\" is \\"mit\\", \\"entrepreneurial\\" becomes \\"unternehmerischen\\", and \\"skills\\" is \\"Fähigkeiten.\\" 5. I translated \\"to act as\\" to \\"um...zu agieren\\". \\"Act as\\" can be translated to \\"agieren als\\" and combined with \\"zu\\" to serve the purpose of \\"in order to\\" in German. 6. I translated \\"single franchisees\\" to \\"einzelne Franchisenehmer\\" which means \\"individual franchisees.\\" In German, \\"single\\" becomes \\"einzelne\\", and \\"franchisees\\" is \\"Franchisenehmer\\". 7. I translated \\"in Germany\\" to \\"in Deutschland\\". The country name does not change. 8. I translated \\"and\\" to \\"und\\" to connect the phrases. 9. Lastly, I translated \\"master franchisees worldwide\\" to \\"Master-Franchisenehmer weltweit\\". The term \\"master franchisees\\" stays similar in form as \\"Master-Franchisenehmer\\" with a hyphen, and \\"worldwide\\" is translated to \\"weltweit\\" in German."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

Answer:","completion":"The West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories in the Middle East that are inhabited predominantly by Palestinians and have been subject to varying degrees of Israeli control. Step 1: Identify West Bank The West Bank, named for its location west of the Jordan River, is a landlocked territory bordered by Israel to the west, north, and south and Jordan to the east. This territory has been under Israeli occupation since the Six-Day War in 1967, although varying levels of self-administration have been granted to the Palestinian Authority. It is home to both Palestinian Arabs and Israeli settlers. The status and boundaries of the West Bank are a central issue in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, with Palestinians claiming it as part of a future independent state and Israelis arguing about different solutions. Step 2: Identify Gaza Strip The Gaza Strip is a small, densely populated coastal territory bordered by Israel to the north and east, Egypt to the south, and the Mediterranean Sea to the west. Like the West Bank, it has been subject to Israeli control since 1967, although it has been governed by the Palestinian militant group Hamas since 2007. Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005 but maintains control over the territory's airspace, territorial waters and border crossings (excluding the land border with Egypt, which is controlled by Egypt). The Gaza Strip has been a frequent flashpoint of violence between Israel and Hamas. Step 3: Summarize In summary, the West Bank and Gaza Strip are two territories of geopolitical importance in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Both have been subject to Israeli control since 1967, though they are inhabited primarily by Palestinians who seek to establish an independent state in these territories. Israel maintains different degrees of control and restriction over the territories and continues to be involved in territorial disputes concerning these regions."},{"prompt":"Ray Trickett - Ray Trickett is a British actor.

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life.

Charles Lutwidge Dodgson (; 27 January 1832 - 14 January 1898), better known by his pen name Lewis Carroll, was an English writer, mathematician, logician, Anglican deacon, and photographer. His most famous writings are Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, its sequel Through the Looking-Glass, which includes the poem \\"Jabberwocky\\", and the poem The Hunting of the Snark - all examples of the genre of literary nonsense. In 1856, Dodgson took up the new art form of photography under the influence first of his uncle Skeffington Lutwidge, and later of his Oxford friend Reginald Southey. He soon excelled at the art and became a well-known gentleman-photographer, and he seems even to have toyed with the idea of making a living out of it in his very early years. A study by Roger Taylor and Edward Wakeling exhaustively lists every surviving print, and Taylor calculates that just over half of his surviving work depicts young girls, though about 60% of his original photographic portfolio is now missing. Dodgson also made many studies of men, women, boys, and landscapes; his subjects also include skeletons, dolls, dogs, statues, paintings, and trees. His pictures of children were taken with a parent in attendance and many of the pictures were taken in the Liddell garden because natural sunlight was required for good exposures. He also found photography to be a useful entree into higher social circles. During the most productive part of his career, he made portraits of notable sitters such as John Everett Millais, Ellen Terry, Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Julia Margaret Cameron, Michael Faraday, Lord Salisbury, and Alfred, Lord Tennyson. By the time that Dodgson abruptly ceased photography (1880, over 24 years), he had established his own studio on the roof of Tom Quad, created around 3,000 images, and was an amateur master of the medium, though fewer than 1,000 images have survived time and deliberate destruction. He stopped taking photographs because keeping his studio working was too time-consuming. He used the wet collodion process; commercial photographers who started using the dry-plate process in the 1870s took pictures more quickly. Popular taste changed with the advent of Modernism, affecting the types of photographs that he produced.

Rage Against the Machine broke up as a result of de la Rocha's departure, but the remaining three members of the band—Tim Commerford, Tom Morello, and Brad Wilk—decided to stay together and announced plans to continue with a new vocalist. Several vocalists jammed with the three, including B-Real of Cypress Hill, but they did not want another rapper or anybody who sounded like de la Rocha. Contrary to popular belief, Layne Staley of Alice in Chains neither auditioned nor was asked to join the new project. Tom Morello denied this claim on his Twitter account in 2015.

Rubin also persuaded the three of them to go into group therapy with performance coach Phil Towle after the breakup. Rubin was confident that with the right new voice, Rage Against the Machine had the potential to become a better band; he believed \\"it could turn into a Yardbirds-into-Led Zeppelin scenario.\\" Commerford later credited Rubin for being the catalyst that brought Audioslave together. He called him \\"the angel at the crossroads\\" because \\"if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't be here today.\\"The chemistry between Cornell and the other three was immediately apparent; as Morello described: \\"He stepped to the microphone and sang the song and I couldn't believe it. It didn't just sound good. It didn't sound great. It sounded transcendent. And...when there is an irreplaceable chemistry from the first moment, you can't deny it.\\" The quartet wrote 21 songs during 19 days of rehearsal, and began working in the studio in late May 2001 with Rubin as producer, while sorting out the label and management issues.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose air is cleared in the lung happens, how will it affect a SMALLER amount of oxygen being delivered to the blood stream. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process?","completion":"If air is cleared in the lung and a smaller amount of oxygen is being delivered to the bloodstream as a result of the perturbation, this would have an effect on the overall respiratory process. The primary function of the lungs is to provide oxygen to the bloodstream while removing carbon dioxide. When there is a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream due to the perturbation, the body's cells receive less oxygen. This can directly lead to a lower overall oxygen concentration in the blood, known as hypoxemia. Indirectly, this can impact the respiratory process by triggering various physiological responses to compensate for the low oxygen levels. These may include: 1. Increased breathing rate: The body may attempt to increase the rate of breathing to take in more oxygen and exhale more carbon dioxide, leading to faster or deeper breaths. 2. Increased heart rate: To compensate for the lower oxygen levels in the blood, the heart may pump blood faster to try to distribute the available oxygen to the body's cells more rapidly. 3. Reduced energy production: As cells receive less oxygen, they may produce less adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the primary source of cellular energy. This can lead to fatigue, weakness, and reduced physical activity. Therefore, due to the perturbation of air clearance in the lung and resulting in a smaller amount of oxygen being delivered to the bloodstream, there is a direct effect on the respiratory process, which can have additional indirect effects on various physiological systems as the body tries to adapt to the change in oxygen levels."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword?, using the article: In 1775, Fort Ticonderoga, in disrepair, was still manned by a token British force. They found it extremely useful as a supply and communication link between Canada (which they had taken over after their victory in the Seven Years' War) and New York. On May 10, 1775, less than one month after the American Revolutionary War was ignited with the battles of Lexington and Concord, the British garrison of 48 soldiers was surprised by a small force of Green Mountain Boys, along with militia volunteers from Massachusetts and Connecticut, led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold. Allen claims to have said, \\"Come out you old Rat!\\" to the fort's commander, Captain William Delaplace. He also later said that he demanded that the British commander surrender the fort \\"In the name of the Great Jehovah and the Continental Congress!\\"; however, his surrender demand was made to Lieutenant Jocelyn Feltham and not the fort's commander, who did later appear and surrender his sword.With the capture of the fort, the Patriot forces obtained a large supply of cannons and other armaments, much of which Henry Knox transported to Boston during the winter of 1775–1776. Ticonderoga's cannons were instrumental in ending the Siege of Boston when they were used to fortify Dorchester Heights. With Dorchester Heights secured by the Patriots, the British were forced to evacuate the city in March 1776. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga by the Patriots made communication between the British Canadian and American commands much more difficult. Benedict Arnold remained in control of the fort until 1,000 Connecticut troops under the command of Benjamin Hinman arrived in June 1775. Because of a series of political maneuvers and miscommunications, Arnold was never notified that Hinman was to take command. After a delegation from Massachusetts (which had issued Arnold's commission) arrived to clarify the matter, Arnold resigned his commission and departed, leaving the fort in Hinman's hands., what would be the answer ?","completion":"The answer to the question, \\"What is the first name of the person who later appeared and surrendered his sword?\\" would be William.

No. Hypothesis: The previous session's fixed rate was higher than the currency trading","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis is true, let's unpack the information provided in the paragraph step by step: 1. The central bank sold 200 million because the peso weakened sharply from its fix rate in the previous session. 2. An auction is triggered when the currency is trading 1 percent weaker than its fix rate in the previous session. 3. The peso slumped from the fix rate seen on Wednesday (which was the previous session) after the U.S. Federal Reserve suggested raising interest rates in December. Since an auction is triggered when the currency is trading 1 percent weaker than its fix rate in the previous session, and the central bank did sell 200 million, we can infer that the peso was trading 1 percent weaker in the current session compared to the previous session. However, the hypothesis states that the previous session's fixed rate was higher than the currency trading. The information in the paragraph only tells us that the peso weakened compared to the previous session's fix rate, but it does not provide enough information to compare the previous session's fix rate and the current trading rate of the currency.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Context: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa.

In the city Health Department's recent survey of school children's heights and weights, researchers found 31% of Hispanic children were obese, compared with 23% of African-American children, 16% of white children and 14% of Asian children. \\"This is mirroring trends we're seeing nationally,\\" said Lorna Thorpe, an epidemiologist who worked on the study. The variances between different groups of children and the obesity rate are driven by a wide range of factors, including culture and diet, experts said. Latino children might have more trouble with their weight if their diets are heavy on high-carbohydrate foods like rice and beans, said Melissa Forzano, program director of the Center for Weight Management at North Shore Long Island Jewish Health System. And in poorer neighborhoods, an overreliance on fast food like pizza, burgers and fries can cause kids to pack on the pounds, she said - particularly if combined with a sedentary lifestyle. Another piece of the fat puzzle, Forzano said, is genetics - and that can be frustrating for children who don't understand why they eat the same junk as their best friends but are much heavier. How children and their families view food also is crucial. \\"Is the child using food to cope with emotions? \\" she asked. \\"Is the child being taught that food is the way to deal with things when you're sad or having a bad day? \\" Patience is important with childhood obesity, Forzano said. Some heavy children will eventually slim down as they get taller. In youngsters, \\"We emphasize not so much losing weight, but stabilizing weight,\\" she said. In some cases, Forzano said, \\"They will grow into it. What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about how Latino kids have a bigger problem with being overweight compared to kids from other backgrounds. They found that 31% of Hispanic children were obese. The reasons for this could be because of what they eat, like lots of rice and beans, or eating fast food. Another reason could be that some kids have genes that make them gain weight more easily. The article also talks about how kids and families think about food, like using it to feel better when sad. Lastly, it says that sometimes kids will become less heavy as they grow taller, and the goal for young kids should be to keep their weight the same instead of losing weight quickly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The laws were subject to fierce debate in parliament, with two opposition parties voting against castration. Human rights groups have objected to the punishments, arguing that violence will not be stopped by violence. The Indonesian Doctors Association said administering chemical castration would violate its professional ethics and said its members should not take part. The procedure entails injecting convicts with female hormones. It is used on sex offenders in Poland, South Korea, Russia, and some US states, among others. Prisoners in UK jails can volunteer for the treatment. The new laws also allow judges to sentence paedophiles to death or tag them electronically, and applies a 10-year minimum sentence for child sex crimes. Human rights groups including the National Commission for Women (NCW) criticised the laws and called for them to be re-evaluated each year to test whether they are a deterrent. Azriana, the head of the NCW, said: \\"Other countries that have chemical castration have not seen a reduction in sexual crime against children. Also it's a very expensive procedure and what we should be spending and investing our money in is services to support and help the victims.\\" Dr Yohana Susana Yembise, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, said the administration was \\"praying\\" that the punishments \\"will have the desired effect\\". She said: \\"Now we have the harshest punishments: the death penalty, life in prison, chemical castration, the public naming of perpetrators and the electronic chip. These are now law, so even if you hate the idea of them everyone now has to support this.\\" The punishments follow a number of high profile cases of child sexual abuse in the country. Last year, a British-Canadian teacher and an Indonesian were jailed for 10 years for sexually abusing three children at a Jakarta kindergarten. And earlier this year, the body of a nine-year-old girl was found in a cardboard box in Jakarta after she had been repeatedly sexually assaulted and killed. Summary:","completion":"In May, Indonesian President Joko Widodo proposed changes to the country's laws following the gang rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl.

Human rights groups and the National Commission for Women have criticized these laws, calling for annual evaluations to assess their effectiveness as a deterrent. Despite the controversy, Indonesia's Minister for Women Empowerment and Child Protection, Dr. Yohana Susana Yembise, expressed hope that the punishments will have the desired effect, and that they are now part of the law and should be supported.

In between these already very disturbing episodes, Buttgereit inserts truly horrifying images of a severely decomposing male corpse. The episodes aren't all equally powerful but, as a wholesome, \\"Der Todesking\\" is ranked quite high on the list of all-time most depressing art-house films. Particularly the episodes on Wednesday, involving a man explaining his sexual frustrations to a total stranger in the park, and the one of Sunday, focusing on a younger man molesting himself to dead, are extremely intense and devastating to observe. The added value of this film, or any other shockumenary like it, is debatable and I'm not even sure whether or not Buttgereit had any type of message to communicate here. There's the vague mentioning of an eerie chain letter that encourages its readers to commit suicide but mostly we remain uninformed about these people's motivations to end their lives so dramatically.

Roy Hodgson's men succumbed to a 2-1 defeat at the hands of La Celeste thanks to a Luis Suarez brace to leave them on the brink of elimination from Group D at the World Cup. And Tabarez is convinced that Cavani's display was 'key' to Uruguay's victory over 'a wonderful team' as he shutdown the supply line which England talisman Gerrard usually provides. Devastated: Steven Gerrard (right) cuts a forlorn figure after England lost 2-1 to Uruguay Celebrate: Cavani runs over to celebrate with Luis Suarez, who scored both","completion":"goals for Uruguay in the crucial Group D encounter After a tense and hard-fought match, Uruguay emerged victorious against England, sending the Three Lions to the edge of elimination from the World Cup's Group D. Tabarez was full of praise for Cavani, who succeeded in suffocating Gerrard's usually influential midfield role and thwarting his ability to create goal-scoring opportunities for his teammates. Uruguay took the lead in the 39th minute when Luis Suarez latched onto Cavani's precise cross to head home past England keeper Joe Hart. However, England fought back and leveled the score in the 75th minute with a well-worked team goal, finished off by Wayne Rooney, his first ever goal in a World Cup tournament. The match seemed destined to end in a draw, but Suarez rose to the occasion again in the 85th minute. Capitalizing on a mistake in the England defense, the Liverpool striker fired home a powerful shot, effectively securing Uruguay's victory and putting England's World Cup dreams in jeopardy. Post-match, Tabarez was keen to heap praise on his forward Cavani, not just for his role in setting up Suarez's opening goal, but also for his tireless effort in denying Steven Gerrard any space in midfield. By disrupting Gerrard's rhythm, Cavani forced England to rely on alternative methods of attack, which the Uruguay defense effectively stifled. England manager Roy Hodgson, however, remained defiant in defeat. Speaking in a post-match interview, he insisted that his team had not performed poorly and that they could still qualify for the knockout stages with a victory against Costa Rica in their final group game, provided other results went their way. Unfortunately for England, their hopes were dashed when Costa Rica went on to beat Italy the following day, ensuring the Central American team's progression to the knockout stages, along with Uruguay. England ultimately finished bottom of Group D after a goalless draw against Costa Rica, a bitterly disappointing end to their World Cup campaign. In the aftermath of the tournament, English fans and pundits alike pondered what might have been, mostly questioning the tactics employed by Hodgson, the performance of their experienced players, and the team's inability to cope with the defensive efforts of opponents such as Cavani. Meanwhile, Uruguay and their coach Tabarez celebrated their progress to the knockout stages, fueled by the brilliance of Luis Suarez, the work rate of Edinson Cavani, and a determined team effort."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His neighborhood is terrorized by a local gang called The Golden Lords, led by Simon Caine and allied with drug lord Anthony Byers. One night, Jeff steps in to rescue a woman from the gang only to end up running from them himself. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, he manages to escape. As he climbs out, he is struck down by a glowing, green meteorite. His spine is crushed and he receives severe burns. A small fragment of the meteor was left over and taken by a vagrant named Marvin. Reed awakens several days later in the hospital, but when his bandages are taken off, he is miraculously healed of all injuries.

Though he lay there helpless, still she found him an awesome figure, like a fallen cathedral tower. Only two other men are as tall, she thought. Amalric and Orlando. She felt a pang of guilt. How could she be thinking about the troubadour here where her royal master lay slowly dying? She fixed her eyes on Louis, and on the ivory and wood crucifix that rose and fell on his chest with his labored breathing. Nicolette felt as if she, too, could hardly breathe. Across the crowded room a fire roared in a huge stone-lined fireplace. The air was stifling. She resented all that made it so, down to the woolen draperies and wall hangings and the thick carpets that sealed in the heat. But she knew that this northern chateau, Pontoise-les-Noyons, a day's ride from Paris, had had to be built to withstand cold, its walls thick and its windows tiny ? so totally unlike the bright, airy Languedoc manor she had grown up in. Sweat trickled down her brow and stung her eyes. Her breath was coming in little gasps. She felt as if she would faint if she couldn't go outside soon. Dozens of people, the King's family and courtiers, had packed themselves uselessly into the room, making it even more suffocating. Their whispers, like the buzzing of mosquitoes, irritated Nicolette. Almost all of them, she was sure, worried more about their own welfare than about the King's. And even Louis's wife and mother, though they grieved for him, were too distracted to do much to alleviate his suffering. She saw the King's lips quiver, and quickly she bent close to him. Any last words could be terribly important. \\"Jerusalem,\\" he mumbled. \\"Towers - golden. Gates of pearl. Crystal waters.\\" Then he panted heavily. \\"Hush, sire,\\" she whispered. \\"Rest easy.\\" According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What Nicolette thought about King's welfare? Options: - He was slowly dying - His health has newer been better - There was nothing to worry about - not enough information Answer:","completion":"Nicolette thought about the King's welfare as him being slowly dying. In the passage, it is mentioned that she was attending to the King who is described as \\"a fallen cathedral tower\\" and she is by his side, looking after him while he lay there, helpless. It is evident that she is concerned about his health and even goes so far as to feel guilty for having thoughts about the troubadour while she is tending to her royal master. As she watches the King in his fragile state, her thoughts reveal that she is well aware of his grim condition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Context: During the 19th century, the major European powers went to great lengths to maintain a balance of power throughout Europe, resulting in the existence of a complex network of political and military alliances throughout the continent by 1900. These began in 1815, with the Holy Alliance between Prussia, Russia, and Austria. When Germany was united in 1871, Prussia became part of the new German nation. Soon after, in October 1873, German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck negotiated the League of the Three Emperors between the monarchs of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Germany. This agreement failed because Austria-Hungary and Russia could not agree over Balkan policy, leaving Germany and Austria-Hungary in an alliance formed in 1879, called the Dual Alliance. This was seen as a method of countering Russian influence in the Balkans as the Ottoman Empire continued to weaken. This alliance expanded in 1882 to include Italy, in what became the Triple Alliance. Bismarck had especially worked to hold Russia at Germany's side in an effort to avoid a two-front war with France and Russia. When Wilhelm II ascended to the throne as German Emperor , Bismarck was compelled to retire and his system of alliances was gradually de-emphasised. For example, the Kaiser refused, in 1890, to renew the Reinsurance Treaty with Russia. Two years later, the Franco-Russian Alliance was signed to counteract the force of the Triple Alliance. In 1904, Britain signed a series of agreements with France, the Entente Cordiale, and in 1907, Britain and Russia signed the Anglo-Russian Convention. While these agreements did not formally ally Britain with France or Russia, they made British entry into any future conflict involving France or Russia a possibility, and the system of interlocking bilateral agreements became known as the Triple Entente. Question: How many countries were part of the Holy alliance in 1815? Answer:","completion":"Three countries were part of the Holy Alliance in 1815. They were Prussia, Russia, and Austria."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Please answer the following question: SEOUL — South Korea is looking into developing and financing economic projects with North Korea that could take effect if a nuclear deal is reached with the United States. South Korean Finance Minister Kim Dong-yeon said on Wednesday the government was “internally carrying out preparations” to organize, finance and implement possible inter-Korea projects. But he also emphasized that Seoul would first seek support from the international community for any North Korean development projects, and would only proceed if the U.S. -North Korea summit, expected to be held in late May or June, produces a joint denuclearization agreement. North Korea is under tough sanctions imposed by the U.N. Security Council for its nuclear weapons and missiles tests, including accelerated efforts in the last two years to develop a long-range nuclear missile that could potentially target the U.S. mainland. The international sanctions ban an estimated 90 percent of the country’s external trade. Seeking sanctions relief is considered a key motivating factor in North Korean leader Kim Jong Un’s diplomatic pivot this year to suspend further provocative missile and nuclear tests, and to engage in talks to dismantle his nuclear arsenal. But easing sanctions would make it more difficult to enforce the North’s denuclearization promises. “Once the sanctions are lifted, North Korea will gain autonomy over its trade, and considering its low labor costs and skilled workforce, I think the North Korean economy would gain power again,” said Shin Beom-chul, the director of Center for Security and Unification at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies in Seoul. U.S. President Donald Trump has insisted he will keep sanctions in place until North Korea completely dismantles its nuclear program. South Korea, however, is considering a range of economic incentives to encourage Kim to follow through on a nuclear deal with Trump. But these investments are prohibited by the U.N. sanctions and would require a Security Council exemption to proceed. At the recent... When did the sanctions on North Korea get imposed?

Please answer the following question: You are presented with the question \\"Where are deposits of gold found?\\" and the following answer choices: - In sediment - kalenchoes - fissures - rocks - mines - coral reefs - inactive - calcite Now knowing that vein deposits of gold and silver are formed by igneous intrusion and veins of Gold ore most commonly occur in cracks and fissures in igneous rocks, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"Fissures Gold deposits are most commonly found in cracks and fissures in igneous rocks. These cracks and fissures form as a result of igneous intrusion, where hot, molten rock (magma) rises from deep within the Earth, forcing its way into surrounding rock layers. As the magma cools and solidifies, it creates a network of cracks and fissures that can become filled with mineral-rich fluids. Over time, these fluids deposit minerals, including gold, into the fissures. The formation of gold deposits in this manner is called hydrothermal mineralization. The hydrothermal fluids responsible for depositing gold are rich in dissolved metals, sulfur, and other elements. As these fluids move through the cracks and fissures in the igneous rocks, they can come into contact with cooler rock formations, leading to the precipitation of minerals – including gold – within the fractures. Other answer choices listed are either incorrect or insufficient in explaining where gold deposits are found: - In sediment: While gold can be found in sedimentary rocks, it is generally not the primary source of gold deposits. Gold-bearing sedimentary deposits are formed through the weathering and transportation of gold from its original source in igneous rocks. - Kalenchoes: Kalenchoes are a genus of succulent plants and have no connection to gold deposits. - Rocks: This answer is too vague, as gold can be found in various types of rocks – primarily igneous, as mentioned previously. - Mines: While gold can be extracted from mines, it is not the natural geological source of gold deposits. - Coral reefs: Coral reefs are marine ecosystems built primarily by coral polyps and have no direct link to gold deposits. - Inactive: This term does not provide a clear context for the location of gold deposits. - Calcite: Calcite is a common calcium carbonate mineral found in sedimentary rocks and has no direct connection to gold deposits. In conclusion, out of the given answer choices, \\"fissures\\" is the most accurate answer, as gold ore deposits most commonly occur in cracks and fissures within igneous rocks, created and filled by hydrothermal fluids through igneous intrusion."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

On the positive side, the reviewer commends the quality of the food, stating that it is \\"good\\" and \\"worth waiting for.\\" This indicates that they appreciate the taste and overall dining experience provided by the restaurant. This part of the review could potentially attract potential customers who are looking for good food and may be willing to compromise on service time to taste the delicious offerings.

His third wife is Kristen Hathaway (Kristen Stills), whom he married in 1996. Stills's son, Justin Stills, was born in 1972 to Harriet Tunis. Justin was critically injured while snowboarding on Mt. Charleston, just outside Las Vegas, in 1997. An episode of Discovery Health's documentary series Trauma: Life in the ER featured his treatment and recovery. Another son, Henry, has been diagnosed with Asperger syndrome and is profiled in the 2007 documentary Autism: The Musical. Stills's daughter Eleanor is a photographer and graduate of Art Center College of Design in Pasadena. Since Eleanor's graduation, she has been responsible for all recent Crosby, Stills & Nash photography. Stills has another daughter, Alex, who attends Emerson College in Boston, Massachusetts. His son Chris and daughter Jennifer are both recording artists. His youngest son, Oliver Ragland, was born in 2004 and named in honor of Neil Young, whose maternal family name is Ragland. Like all four members of CSNY, Stills has long been involved in liberal causes and politics. In 2000, he served as a member of the Democratic credentials committee from Florida during the Democratic National Convention, and was a delegate in previous years. The comic book series Scott Pilgrim features a character by the name of Stephen Stills, referred to as \\"the Talent\\" by the band he shares with the title character.

It is a common term used in Finland to refer to a particular type of food product. In particular, \\"Kebakko\\" is a Finnish food that can be closely compared to \\"kebab\\", a well-known dish of Middle Eastern origin. In Finland, this term has been adapted to become \\"Kebakko\\". This is in line with the typical Finnish practice of incorporating international dishes into their cuisine and giving them a uniquely Finnish twist, which is often reflected in the name as well. \\"Kebakko\\" is essentially a form of processed meat product. It usually consists of a mixture of various types of meat, which may include beef, pork, or poultry. This meat mixture is typically seasoned with a variety of spices to give it a distinctive, robust flavor. It is often shaped into sticks or patties which are then grilled or fried. The term \\"Kebakko\\" is a portmanteau of two Finnish words: \\"Kebab\\" which refers to the Middle-Eastern dish, and \\"Makkara\\" which means sausage in Finnish. This indicates its nature as a combination between the two food types, reflecting its unique position in Finnish cuisine.

After becoming disabled in a machete attack on a visit to his native Haiti, Jean-Claude Joseph needed help persuading his landlord to move him from a fifth-floor apartment to one on the ground floor. Isaac Benjamin became ensnared in a bureaucratic snafu that took away his Social Security disability payments for more than two years. The story of Martha, a woman from Sierra Leone, was more compelling. Beaten, raped and tortured in her politically repressive homeland, she knowingly used someone else's passport to escape to America, but was caught by immigration authorities upon her arrival. She desperately sought political asylum. Not the kind of cases that lead to ground-breaking upheavals in the law, but the kind of cases that are handled day in and day out by lawyers for the legally disenfranchised who have no where else to turn. The work of attorneys from Legal Services of New Jersey will be highlighted in a onehour documentary, \\"Quest for Justice,\\" to be aired 9 p.m. today on New Jersey Network. Produced by NYD2, a communications firm based in Somerset, the documentary features case histories of clients whose needs ranged from housing to fighting off deportation. Joseph, a 54-year-old naturalized citizen, turned to Legal Services when the landlord of his federally subsidized apartment complex in Elizabeth turned a deaf ear to his request for a ground-floor apartment. Having lost the use of his left arm in warding off the machete attack during a robbery attempt, Joseph said he found it increasingly difficult to negotiate the five flights of stairs lugging groceries or laundry on the frequent occasions when the building's elevator was out of order. \\"With this, it became impossible for me to stay upstairs,\\" he said, pointing to the scars on his forearm. \\"If I cannot carry my groceries or my laundry, how can I live?\\" \\"It was a compelling case,\\" said Legal Services attorney Stephen St. Hilaire. \\"The key for us -- and we have to make tough decisions all the time on whether to take a case -- was visualizing what he had to do to get to the fifth floor, struggling with a bag of groceries,\\" he said.

In fact, the biggest complaint that my husband and two children have about me is that I’m “always busy.” Seventeen years ago, when my oldest son was about a year old, he woke up in a very fussy mood. Instead of being his usual cheerful and compliant self, he just wanted to be cuddled. A mother’s dream, right? Well, not for me. There was too much to be done; I didn’t have time to hold him. I was well aware that in addition to some projects I was working on, there was laundry to be washed and ironed, breakfast dishes to do, a house that needed cleaning. My usual response would have been to try to coax my son into cheerfulness, or to put him back to bed to sleep it off. But it was clear that he was unwell, so against my usual inclination, I decided that I would just hold him. The chores could wait another day. So I settled into the recliner chair in the lounge room and held my son while he slept. I dozed occasionally too, waking up now and then to enjoy the feeling of snuggling my baby and looking at the world beyond the window. It was a cold day, but clear and sunny. The trees rustled in the gentle breeze, and birds and butterflies flitted about the garden. Inside, my son and I stayed snuggled together under a blanket for most of the day. He slept while I, for one of the few times in my life, just drank in the beauty of the world and the happiness of sharing this time with my son. Better mothers than I am must have done similar things many, many times with their children. But for me, this very small decision, this day of ‘laziness’, became a treasured memory.

The old vaulted church was stripped down: there was no cloth on the altar, just a DJ's toolkit and his beer. Through the dark, I could see three bolts left in the wall from where they'd taken down the crucifix. A confessional too beaten-up to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside, and where the pews had been taken out, a couple hundred people were testifying to the DJ's moving sermon. Rachel stepped forward into the crowd while I took a moment to drink in the ceiling's blue-lit, shadowed vault and the light-catching haze from who-knows-what rising between the DJ and the crowd. There was a terrific echo, each beat reverberating inside of the next, and the old stained-glass windows rattled in their frames. On the dance floor, people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air. I danced with Rachel for a while, but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes. She told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd. When she hadn't come back halfway through the next song, I glanced over at the bar. It was just a little set-up where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share, mostly beer. Rachel was standing with a plastic cup, looking like she was having a conversation, but I couldn't see anyone else there. The next time the crowd split, I saw him. He stood in front of a blue light, so I couldn't see him clearly, but what I saw was memorable. He wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet, and his hair gleamed black against his white skin. The blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor, setting off his striking face without illuminating its details, and his wrists flashed white in the darkness. He didn't move, just stared and held his drink. The next time I saw them, his mouth was moving. She nodded and he took her arm.

Comedian Freddie Starr has been released on bail for a second time today after being questioned by detectives investigating claims he molested a schoolgirl in Jimmy Savile's BBC dressing room. The 69-year-old voluntarily returned to speak to officers for further questioning earlier today following his release on bail in the early hours of this morning. He was taken into custody at a police station near his home in Warwickshire yesterday and was released for the second time today at around 5.20pm. He denies claims by Karin Ward that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl. His next bail date has not yet been revealed by Scotland Yard.

The young woman behind Freddie Starr has been pixelated by Channel 4 to protect her identity. This afternoon a spokesman for the. Metropolitan Police said: 'The man who was arrested and released on bail. has returned to the police station and is currently being interviewed.' He is the second celebrity to be. arrested after Gary Glitter, 68, was questioned for ten hours on Sunday. on suspicion of committing sexual offences. Detectives investigating Savile said. last week they had drawn up an arrest list of people who could be. questioned about allegations made by victims of Savile or his alleged. accomplices. A Scotland Yard spokesman. said this evening: 'The man. arrested yesterday, November 1, in connection with Operation Yewtree -. Yewtree 2 - returned on bail today and was interviewed. 'He has been re-bailed to a date in December.' Police earlier said he had been arrested 'on suspicion of sexual offences'. A spokesman. said the suspect was released on bail for the first timebetween 1am and 1.30am this. morning. Freddie Starr was driven away from his home in Studley, Warwickshire today by fiancee Sophie Lea. Police searched Starr's garage at his Warwickshire home yesterday after his arrest by detectives investigating allegations of sexual offences connected to Jimmy Savile. Denial: Freddie Starr, 69, recently on ITV's This Morning appeared alongside girlfriend Sophie Lea, 34, to deny he had any involvement in the scandal. Starr said a week ago that he was. prepared to speak to police about the allegations to clear his name. He. said: ‘Ask me anything – anything. I’ll be interviewed by any police. force.’ He has repeatedly denied claims that. he groped Miss Ward. Appearing on ITV News with his 34-year-old fiancee. Sophie Lea, Starr insisted he had never abused underage girls, and said. he had hired private detectives to prove his innocence. He initially denied ever meeting his. accuser, or appearing with her on Savile’s 1974 BBC show Clunk Click,. but footage later emerged showing him and Miss Ward in the same shot. Miss Ward has claimed: ‘I was. horribly, horribly humiliated by Freddie Starr, who had a very bad. attack of wandering hands and had groped me, and I didn’t like him. because he smelled like my stepfather and it frightened me and freaked. me out, and I rebuffed him.’ Standing guard: Police officers outside Freddie Starr's home. Freddie Starr has been arrested by detectives investigating allegations of sexual offences connected to Jimmy Savile. A car drives through the gates to Freddie Starr's home as police officers stand outside. It prompted Starr to seek an. injunction to prevent the claims being aired, but his High Court. application was rejected. He later invited reporters into his home and. told them the woman was ‘a nutter’ and accused her of ‘picking my name. out of a hat’. He said: ‘I’ve never touched an underage girl in my. life.’ PR guru Max Clifford has claimed. dozens of big-name stars from the 1960s and 1970s have contacted him. because they are ‘frightened’ they will become implicated in the. widening child abuse scandal. Appearing on Daybreak this morning,. Mr Clifford said a lot of old stars were worried about being dragged. into the investigation because they had appeared on Top Of The Pops or. Jim'll Fix It and merely posed for photographs with girls and Savile. Starr is the second celebrity to be arrested after Gary Glitter was questioned for 10 hours last Sunday on suspicion of committing sexual offences. Starr has previously denied claims by Karin Ward (above) that he tried to grope her in 1974 when she was a 14-year-old schoolgirl. Freddie Starr as Jimmy Savile in 1974 impressions show, Who Do You Do. He told the programme: 'It is a situation which could easily turn into a witch hunt, a lot of big stars are frightened. Where is it going to end?' 'I hope they (the police) concentrate on finding people like Jimmy Savile who were manipulating girls.' Starrs release this evening came as solicitor Liz Dux said Savile's estate, the BBC and three hospitals - Stoke Mandeville, Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor - are facing possible legal action by alleged victims. Ms Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said formal notice had been sent to 'all interested parties' of an intention to pursue claims against them. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.' Savile, who died last year aged 84,. has been described as one of the most prolific sex offenders in British. history. Police are following more than 400 leads into the DJ, who left. at least 300 victims over a four-decade rampage of child abuse. Miss Ward was one of several pupils. from Duncroft Approved School in Surrey who were invited to the BBC by. Savile to watch his shows being recorded. In 2007, Surrey Police investigated. historic complaints from former pupils of the now-defunct school, but. the Crown Prosecution Service ruled there was not enough evidence to. bring charges. Savile's estate, reportedly worth £4.3 million, has been frozen in response to the mounting allegations. Lawyers are also looking into the late presenter's overseas assets, thought to be administered from tax haven the Channel Islands. NatWest Bank, which is acting as the Jim'll Fix It presenter's will executor and trustee, yesterday revealed the distribution of his assets had been put on hold in anticipation of legal action from his alleged victims. Savile's will was written in 2006 and bequeaths his savings and other assets to 26 separate beneficiaries, according to the Financial Times (FT). The newspaper said it had obtained a copy of the document, which instructs that £20,000 in cash was to be shared between 20 of the celebrity's friends, family and neighbours. It says a further £600,000 was to be put into a trust fund, with the interest shared between eight people. The remainder - just under £3.7 million before expenses - was to be held by NatWest on behalf of the Jimmy Savile Charitable Trust, according to the FT. Savile's intended individual beneficiaries include the trustees of both his charities and existing and former employees of Leeds General Infirmary and Broadmoor Hospital, the newspaper added. Savile's relatives said they do not want a penny of his estate and called for the cash to be donated to an organisation to tackle sex crimes. The late presenter's nephew, Guy Marsden, 58, said his uncle was 'a monster' and it was only right that the money should be given to a police-run anti-paedophile unit, and Savile's victims. Savile's victims are to sue the star's estate to get answers and compensation, and to 'move on with their lives', a lawyer said yesterday. Liz Dux, who is representing more than 20 people who claim to have been sexually assaulted, said some had not been able to form adult relationships since the attacks. She said: 'Their main objective is to get answers as to why their previous complaints weren't listened to, to get some sort of compensation and to move on with their lives.'

After he wakes them and tells them to pray, Satan appears in a hooded androgynous, albino form, and tempts him with reasonable doubt, stating - \\"it is not right for one man to die for their (humanity) sins.\\" Ignoring it and praying on, Jesus' sweat becomes like blood, and drips to the ground while a snake emerges from Satan's guise. Jesus hears his disciples call out for him, he rebukes Satan by stomping on the snake's head, and the latter vanishes. After receiving a bribe of thirty pieces of silver, Judas, another of Jesus' disciples, approaches with a group of temple guards, and betrays Jesus (by confirmation of his identity) with a simple kiss on the cheek. As the armed guards move in to arrest Jesus, Peter takes a sword and cuts off the ear of Malchus, one of the guards and a servant of the high priest Caiaphas. Jesus, in turn, heals the ear. As the disciples flee, the guards secure Jesus, and beat him during the journey to the Sanhedrin. John tells Mary (mother of Jesus) and Mary Magdalene of the arrest while Peter follows Jesus and his captors at a distance. Caiaphas holds trial over the objection of some of the other priests, who are expelled from the court. When questioned by Caiaphas whether he is the Son of God, Jesus replies \\"I am.\\" Caiaphas is horrified, tears his robes in outrage, and Jesus is condemned to death for blasphemy. Peter, secretly watching, is confronted by the surrounding mob for being a follower of Jesus, and he denies this three times. A sobbing Peter flees, after remembering that Jesus had foretold this coping of a defense. Meanwhile, the guilt ridden Judas attempts to return the money he was paid to have Jesus freed, but is refused by the priests. Tormented by Demons, he flees the city, finds solitude, and hangs himself from a tree with a rope he finds on a dead donkey at dawn. Caiaphas brings Jesus before...

Deep in space, above a fiery planet named Dante, orbits the space station called \\"Dante 01\\". It hosts a psychiatric detention center that currently hosts six prisoners whose crimes were so severe that they volunteered to live under experimentation. The center is owned by a pharmaceutical company called Neurinos and directed by a man named Charon, with the assistance of psychiatrist Dr. PersÃ©phone and two security guards called CR and BR.One day, a Neurinos shuttle arrives with a new scientist named Elisa, carrying a new prisoner of unknown origins who was found as the sole survivor in a shipwreck and wakes up from the hypersleep severely disoriented and unable to speak. He is introduced to the other inmates: their leader CÃ©sar; his right-hand man Lazare, who developed the ability to hold his breath to escape the gas with which the prisoners are sedated; the large and violent Moloch, who's CÃ©sar's enforcer; the reclusive Bouddha, who has the habit of trying and murdering whoever is in pain out of misguided compassion; the deranged anarchist hacker Attila; and Raspoutine, a deeply religious man who claims the new one was sent by God to save them, and starts calling him \\"Saint-Georges, the Dragonslayer\\", because of a tattoo on his arm.Elisa and PersÃ©phone are at odds over their research methods, since the latter advocates a humanist approach to the prisoners' mental issues, while Elisa has been sent there to experiment with a new nanotechnology that directly modifies the patient's DNA, eliminating the genetic component of their antisocial behaviors. Charon asks Attila to hack into Elisa's files to find out the extent of her orders. Much to his horror, Attila finds out she's authorized to kill them all for the sake of her research.As expected, Bouddha attempts to strangle Saint-Georges in order to alleviate his suffering. This leads to infighting amongst the prisoners, so they get gassed, and Bouddha becomes Elisa's first subject. She injects him with nanites and returns him to the prison hold. Bouddha is immediately wracked by unbearable pain from the nanites bonding with his DNA, but Saint-Georges is somehow able to remove them from him (from his point of view, he's removing some kind of energy creature from Bouddha and eating it), so Bouddha becomes well again and as convinced as Raspoutine that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker, so he befriends him, swearing to protect him from the others. Later, Moloch attacks Saint-Georges, but Raspoutine inserts himself, causing Moloch to accidentally slit his own throat with the shiv he was holding. Gas pours in to knock the group out again, but not before Saint-Georges had run over to assist Moloch. The prison guards rush in only to discover, to their amazement, that Moloch has no wound on his throat, and is alive and well. On their way out, they inject CÃ©sar with the nanites.PersÃ©phone's assumption that Saint-Georges is a miracle worker is scoffed at by Elisa, but Moloch's own doubts prompt an increasingly debilitated CÃ©sar to fear an impending usurping of his authority, so he commands Lazare and Moloch to get rid of Saint-Georges. While Bouddha and Raspoutine are distracted, Saint-Georges is stabbed to death by Lazare. However, while the staff is examining his corpse, Saint-Georges wakes up completely healed, grabs Elisa and uses her as a hostage to reach the prison quarters before releasing her.CÃ©sar is now in severe pain from the nanites, but Saint-Georges cures him as well. Attila appears and tells the others of his plans to destroy them all out of spite, by making the space station crash into the planet, triggering the rage of the other prisoners. Attila manages to runs away, only to be found later in a shaft, having hanged himself.With Attila dead, the only way to save the station is to activate the manual override located under a trapdoor below the prisoner's quarters. The prisoners agree to let the staff through, but Elisa refuses to accompany the others inside the prisoner area. As all the station inhabitants work together to open the hatch, the gas goes off, knocking everyone but Lazare out.Elisa prepares to escape via shuttle, but Lazare ambushes her, forcing her to let him in the shuttle as well. As the others awaken, one of the guard finds out about Elisa's betrayal, but also that Attila had messed with the shuttle controls as well, resulting in the shuttle burning through the planet's atmosphere. After having finally opened the hatch, the group finds the cooling system overheated so now the corridor that leads to the manual controls is filled with boiling water. CÃ©sar realizes he is the only one short enough to fit into the little space, and volunteers to descend, wrapped in some protective fabrics. He emerges on the other side horribly burned and dies in the compartment before being able to entering the code necessary to reset the controls.In the epilogue, PersÃ©phone's narration recounts how Saint-Georges fulfilled his destiny by slaying the \\"dragon\\". We see him emerge from the station in a space suit and float above the planet, using the full extent of his inexplicable powers and the mysterious energy creatures that now reside inside him to terraform Dante into a livable planet, while his body disintegrates in space as a result of the transformation.","completion":"Question: What is the name of the space station orbiting the planet Dante?

It is easy to get on with some one who is down to earth. A down-to-earth person is the opposite of someone who acts important or proud. Down-to-earth people could be important members of society. But they do not consider themselves to be better than others who are less important. A person who is filled with his own importance and pride is said to\\" have his nose in the air\\". Americans use another expression that is similar in some ways to down to earth. The expression is\\" both feet on the ground\\". Someone with both feet on the ground is a person with a good understanding of reality. He may have dreams, but he does not allow them to have influence on his understanding of what is real. The opposite kind of person is one who \\"has his head in the clouds\\". Someone with his head in the clouds is a person whose mind is not on what is happening in real life.

Having never used a helium tank before, she wants to test how much to fill each balloon. If Catherine filled two balloons and one expanded more than the other does the smaller balloon have higher or lower air pressure? Hint: All fluids exert pressure like the air inside a tire. The particles of fluids are constantly moving in all directions at random. As the particles move, they keep bumping into each other and into anything else in their path. These collisions cause pressure, and the pressure is exerted equally in all directions. When particles are crowded together in one part of an enclosed space, such as the air particles first entering a tire, they quickly spread out to fill all the available space. That’s because particles of fluids always move from an area of higher pressure to an area of lower pressure. This explains why air entering a tire through a tiny opening quickly fills the entire tire.","completion":"In this case, the smaller balloon has higher air pressure. Since the particles of fluids, like the air inside a balloon, tend to move from areas of higher pressure to areas of lower pressure, the smaller balloon will have more air particles crowded together in a smaller space. This results in more collisions among particles and against the inner walls of the balloon, leading to higher pressure compared to the larger balloon.

Given the question: Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - The swallows and martins are a group of passerine birds in the family Hirundinidae that are characterised by their adaptation to aerial feeding. \\"Swallow\\" is used colloquially in Europe as a synonym for the barn swallow. - The barn swallow (\\"Hirundo rustica\\") is the most widespread species of swallow in the world. It is a distinctive passerine bird with blue upperparts, a long, deeply forked tail and curved, pointed wings. It is found in Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas. In Anglophone Europe it is just called the swallow; in Northern Europe it is the only common species called a \\"swallow\\" rather than a \\"martin\\". - Petrochelidon is a genus of birds known as cliff - nesting swallows . The genus includes all of the five species of birds commonly called cliff swallow , and contains the following species : - A passerine is any bird of the order Passeriformes, which includes more than half of all bird species. A notable feature of passerines compared to other orders of Aves is the arrangement of their toes, three pointing forward and one back, which facilitates perching. Sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds, the passerines form one of the most diverse terrestrial vertebrate orders, with over 5,000 identified species. It has roughly twice as many species as the largest of the mammal orders, the Rodentia. It contains more than 110 families, the second-most of any order of tetrapods (after Squamata, the scaled reptiles). The passerines contain several groups of brood parasites such as the viduas, cuckoo-finches, and the cowbirds. Most passerines are omnivorous, while the shrikes are carnivorous. What is the relationship between 'petrochelidon' and 'hirundinidae'? The answer is:","completion":"Petrochelidon is a genus of birds within the family Hirundinidae. The relationship between Petrochelidon and Hirundinidae is that Petrochelidon is a subset of the larger family Hirundinidae. This means that the birds belonging to the Petrochelidon genus also belong to the family Hirundinidae, sharing common characteristics and adaptations for aerial feeding."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

These fighting styles are often classified according to common traits, identified as \\"families\\", \\"sects\\" or \\"schools\\" of martial arts. Examples of such traits include \\"Shaolinquan\\" physical exercises involving Five Animals mimicry, or training methods inspired by Chinese philosophies, religions and legends. Styles that focus on qi manipulation are called \\"internal\\", while others that concentrate on improving muscle and cardiovascular fitness are called \\"external\\".

Stunts are a feature of many action films. Before computer generated imagery special effects, these effects were limited to the use of models, false perspective and other in-camera effects, unless the creator could find someone willing to jump from car to car or hang from the edge of a skyscraper: the stunt performer or stunt double. - Drunken Master is a 1978 Hong Kong martial arts film directed by Yuen Woo-ping, and starring Jackie Chan, Yuen Siu-tien, and Hwang Jang Lee. The film was a success at the Hong Kong box office, earning two and a half times the amount of Chan's previous film, \\"Snake in the Eagle's Shadow\\", which was also considered a successful film.

Answer the following question: Information: - Bornholm disease or epidemic pleurodynia or epidemic myalgia is a disease caused by the Coxsackie B virus or other viruses . It is named after the Danish island of Bornholm where early cases occurred . - A disease is a particular abnormal condition, a disorder of a structure or function, that affects part or all of an organism. The study of disease is called pathology which includes the causal study of etiology. Disease is often construed as a medical condition associated with specific symptoms and signs. It may be caused by external factors such as pathogens, or it may be caused by internal dysfunctions particularly of the immune system such as an immunodeficiency, or a hypersensitivity including allergies and autoimmunity. - Myocarditis, also known as inflammatory cardiomyopathy, is inflammation of the heart muscle. Symptoms can include shortness of breath, chest pain, decreased ability to exercise, and an irregular heartbeat. The duration of problems can vary from hours to months. Complications may include heart failure due to dilated cardiomyopathy or cardiac arrest. Myocarditis is most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections, certain medications, toxins, and autoimmune disorders. A diagnosis may be supported by an electrocardiogram (ECG), increased troponin, heart MRI, and occasionally a heart biopsy. An ultrasound of the heart is important to rule out other potential causes such as heart valve problems. Treatment depends on both the severity and the cause. Medications such as ACE inhibitors, beta blockers, and diuretics are often used. A period of no exercise is typically recommended during recovery. Corticosteroids or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) may be useful in certain cases. In severe cases an implantable cardiac defibrillator or heart transplant may be recommended. In 2013, about 1.5 million cases of acute myocarditis occurred. While people of all ages are affected, the young are most often affected. It is slightly more common in males than females. Most cases are mild. In 2015 cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, resulted in 354,000 deaths up from 294,000 in 1990. The initial descriptions of the condition are from the mid-1800s. - Pathology (from the Greek roots of \\"pathos\\", meaning \\"experience\\" or \\"suffering\\", and \\"-logia\\", \\"study of\\") is a significant component of the causal study of disease and a major field in modern medicine and diagnosis. - Immunodeficiency (or immune deficiency) is a state in which the immune system's ability to fight infectious disease and cancer is compromised or entirely absent. Most cases of immunodeficiency are acquired (\\"secondary\\") due to extrinsic factors that affect the patient's immune system. Examples of these extrinsic factors include HIV infection, extremes of age, and environmental factors, such as nutrition. In the clinical setting, the immunosuppression by some drugs, such as steroids, can be either an adverse effect or the intended purpose of the treatment. Examples of such use is in organ transplant surgery as an anti-rejection measure and in patients suffering from an overactive immune system, as in autoimmune diseases. Some people are born with intrinsic defects in their immune system, or primary immunodeficiency. A person who has an immunodeficiency of any kind is said to be immunocompromised. An immunocompromised person may be particularly vulnerable to opportunistic infections, in addition to normal infections that could affect everyone. Immunodeficiency also decreases cancer immunosurveillance, in which the immune system scans the body's cells and kills neoplastic ones. - Coxsackie B is a group of six serotypes of Coxsackievirus, a pathogenic enterovirus, that trigger illness ranging from mild gastrointestinal distress to full-fledged pericarditis and myocarditis (Coxsackievirus-induced cardiomyopathy). - Pericarditis is inflammation of the pericardium (the fibrous sac surrounding the heart). Symptoms typically include sudden onset of sharp chest pain. The pain may also be felt in the shoulders, neck, or back. It is typically better sitting up and worse with lying down or breathing deep. Other symptoms may include fever, weakness, palpitations, and shortness of breath. Occasionally onset of symptoms is gradual. The cause of pericarditis is believed to be most often due to a viral infection. Other causes include bacterial infections such as tuberculosis, uremic pericarditis, following a heart attack, cancer, autoimmune disorders, and chest trauma. The cause often remains unknown. Diagnosis is based on the chest pain, a pericardial rub, specific electrocardiogram (ECG) changes, and fluid around the heart. Other conditions that may produce similar symptoms include a heart attack. Treatment in most cases is with NSAIDs and possibly colchicine. Steroids may be used if those are not appropriate. Typically symptoms improve in a few days to weeks but can occasionally last months. Complications can include cardiac tamponade, myocarditis, and constrictive pericarditis. It is a less common cause of chest pain. About 3 per 10,000 people are affected per year. Those most commonly affected are males between the ages of 20 and 50. Up to 30% of those affected have more than one episode. Signs and symptoms. Substernal or left precordial pleuritic chest pain with radiation to the trapezius ridge (the bottom portion of scapula on the back), which is relieved by sitting up and bending forward and worsened by lying down (recumbent or supine position) or inspiration (taking a breath in), is the characteristic pain of pericarditis. The pain may resemble the pain of angina pectoris or heart attack, but differs in that pain changes with body position, as opposed to heart attack pain that is pressure-like, and constant with radiation to the left arm and/or the jaw. Other symptoms of pericarditis may include dry cough, fever, fatigue,...

Think like you are answering to a five year old. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? You can apply lemon juice to help lighten dark areas of your ringworm scar. Vitamin C is an important nutrient for normal wound healing, so it might help to minimize the appearance of a scar when applied to the skin as well. To apply lemon juice, soak a cotton swab in lemon juice and apply the lemon juice directly to the ringworm scar. Let the lemon juice dry and then rinse it away with some warm water. You can apply lemon juice to a ringworm scar once per day. You can also massage aloe vera gel into a ringworm scar to help soften the tissue. Aloe vera works well on burn scars, so it might help to improve other types of scars as well. To use aloe vera gel, smooth a small amount over your ringworm scar and leave it on. Do this a few times per day. Applying a steeped green tea bag to a scar may also help to minimize scarring and discoloration due to ringworm. Green tea may help with scars due to its antioxidant properties. To use green tea as a treatment for a ringworm scar, steep a bag of green tea in hot water for about three minutes. Remove the teabag from the water and squeeze some of the excess water from the bag. Then, apply the tea bag to the ringworm scar and hold it there for about 10 to 15 minutes. Repeat this process three to four times per day. You can also mix St John’s wort oil with castor oil and massage it into a ringworm scar. St John’s wort oil has been shown to promote C-section wound healing, so it may help with other types of scars as well. To use St. John’s wort oil, place two to three drops of the oil in two tablespoons of castor oil and stir the oils together until they are combined. Then, use your fingers to massage the oil into the ringworm scar. Repeat this process two to three times daily. Honey may also help to reduce the size of scars and discolored areas because honey acts as a natural moisturizer. Manuka honey and Tualang honey are good choices for medicinal use, but you may have to go to a health food store or check online to find these types of honey. To use honey on a ringworm scar, apply a thin layer of honey and then massage it into your skin for about five to 10 minutes. Leave the honey on the scar for about one hour. Rinse away the honey with warm water after time is up. If desired, you can cover the area in a thin gauze pad while you leave the honey on. Vitamin D oil has anti-inflammatory properties that seem to improve the appearance of surgical scars. Vitamin D has also been found effective for treating psoriasis, which indicates that it may benefit a more minor skin condition such as a ringworm scar. Talk to your doctor or dermatologist before using vitamin D to see if this treatment is a good option for getting rid of your ringworm scars. If you decide to use vitamin D as a treatment for your ringworm scars, then break open one 2000 IU vitamin D capsule and mix it with four to five drops of castor oil. Then apply the mixture to your ringworm scar and massage it into your skin. Vitamin E is a well-known, popular treatment for scar healing, but some studies have indicated that vitamin E may not be an effective treatment for scars. In some cases, vitamin E has even caused the scar to look worse or resulted in negative skin reactions. To be safe, check with your doctor or dermatologist before using vitamin E for your ringworm scars. If you decide to use vitamin E oil, try breaking open one 400 IU vitamin E capsule and mix it with four to five drops of castor oil. Then, apply the mixture directly to your scar and massage it into your skin.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which group of larvae had more changes in their RNA sequence? The specialists studied two groups of larvae. Group L displayed all kinds of mutations while group D didn't. Hint: Once again, a mutation is the change in the DNA or RNA sequence. In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

Article: You need to inspect the wound once it stops bleeding. Get to the cleanest, safest area that you can. You don't want to risk infection from environmental contaminants. Examine the wound to figure out how deep it is. If it is less than 1cm, you do not need to seek outside medical help and you can continue to clean the wound on your own. If it looks deeper than 1cm, you will need stitches, even if the blood stopped flowing. Reapply the pressure dressing and seek medical attention as soon as possible. If you have a large area of abrasion, which is greater than 12 cm by 12 cm, with a significant amount of particulate matter, seek medical attention as well so the area can be appropriately cleansed. That much debris will cause infection if not removed. This can be done by a doctor under local anesthesia. If the wound is dirty or caused by something rusty and it has been more than 10 years since your last tetanus shot, you will need a tetanus shot right away. Wounds can be misleading. Small wounds, such as puncture wounds, may seem small but they can be quite deep and are often full of bacteria. They also often become infected. This is particularly true of animal or human bites, so always seek medical attention for this kind of wound. Bacteria that live in the mouths of humans, cats, dogs, and other animals contain pasteurella and other virulent bacteria that can lead you from a small bite to the operating room within 24 hours. This is also true of fight bites, which are incurred during a fist fight. When one individual hits another in the mouth and gets accidentally bitten by the others teeth, the wounds are also particularly prone to infection. A bite may need to be treated with prescription antibiotics to prevent infection. Make sure you go to the doctor or emergency room to deal with bites. If your wound does not need medical care, you can take care of it at home. Rinse the wound with warm water to remove the excess blood. This may disrupt clotted blood and the wound may ooze or begin bleeding again. This is normal and shows that there is no significant vascular damage to contend with and the bleeding will stop again after cleansing. Once you rinse your wound of the initial blood, you can clean the wound. First, wash your hands with soap and hot water. This will help prevent contamination of the wound and help stop infection. Next, soak a gauze or clean cloth in a providone-Iodine solution such as Betadine. This will kill any bacteria that you will have encountered when your skin broke. Once you clean the wound with the solution, pat it dry with sterile gauze or a clean cloth. If irrigation of the wound did not get out all of the debris in the wound, such as twigs, thorns, or pebbles, use tweezers to very carefully pull out the remaining debris. Do not probe the wound because you could injure yourself further. If you don't have any providone-Iodine solution, you can use any antiseptic wash that is used on open wounds. If you don't have any solution at all, you can rinse the wound out for an additional amount of time to ensure it is cleaned as well as possible. Once your wound has been adequately rinsed and cleaned, you need to bandage it to keep it protected. First, apply antibacterial ointment such as Neosporin to the wound with gauze, a cotton ball, or a Q-tip. Next, if your wound is small and superficial, use a band-aid to cover the wound. If it is larger, grab a fresh set of gauze and medical tape from your first aid kit. Place the gauze over the wound and secure the edges of the bandage with tape. This will keep debris out. If you do not have gauze and medical tape, you need to purchase wound supplies at the drug store or pharmacy. The wound needs to be bandaged properly with sterile supplies in order to prevent infection. If the wound is over a flexible joint, buy rolled gauze to make it more easily managed and the bandage more secure. After your initial dressing, perform the cleansing and dressing ritual daily. When you are cleaning the wound, you need to look for signs of infection. These include redness at the wound edges, especially if the wound area expands from one day to the next, drainage or pus on the wound, and a fever. As long as no signs of infection present themselves, your wound should heal within a two to three week time frame. Lower extremity wounds or wounds on those who are obese may take on the longer to heal.

Given the below context: Around 1730, the Baroque style gradually began to break away from the defined Roman style of Baroque and gain an even stronger individuality, for two reasons: the rush to rebuild was subsiding, construction was becoming more leisurely and thoughtful; and a new clutch of home-grown Sicilian architects came to the forefront. This new generation had watched the rebuilding in the Baroque, and studied the ever more frequent engravings and architectural books and treatises arriving from the mainland. However, they were not like their predecessors (the former students of the Romans), and consequently were able to formulate strong individual styles of their own. They included Andrea Palma, Rosario Gagliardi and Tommaso Napoli. While taking account of the Baroque of Naples and Rome, they now adapted their designs for the local needs and traditions. Their use of resources and exploitation of the sites was often wildly inventive. Napoli and then Vaccarini had promoted the use of the external staircase, which was now taken to a new dimension: churches upon the summits of a hills would be reached by fantastical flights of steps evoking Vaccarini's mentor Francesco de Sanctis's Spanish Steps in Rome.Façades of churches often came to resemble wedding cakes rather than places of worship as the architects grew in confidence, competence, and stature. Church interiors, which until this date had been slightly pedestrian, came especially in Palermo to be decorated in a riot of inlaid marbles of a wide variety of colours. Anthony Blunt has described this decoration as \\"either fascinating or repulsive, but however the individual spectator may react to it, this style is a characteristic manifestation of Sicilian exuberance, and must be classed amongst the most important and original creations of Baroque art on the island\\".

Answer:","completion":"After the plans were described, we made instructions of our own since the instructions were easier to follow. Creating clear and concise instructions allowed the team to have a better understanding of the overall objective, thus streamlining the execution process and improving communication among team members. By breaking down complex plans into easier-to-follow instructions, we were able to reduce the chances of misinterpretation and errors. With the new instructions in hand, we divided the tasks among team members, considering their strengths and weaknesses to ensure that each individual was assigned to the most suitable role. Each team member took responsibility for their assigned tasks and communicated progress updates throughout the project implementation. As the project progressed, we also noticed an increase in efficiency as team members became more familiar with the newly created instructions. The time spent on clarifying questions and rectifying any misunderstandings was noticeably reduced, allowing us to focus our efforts on delivering a high-quality outcome. In addition to improved efficiency, the creation of easy-to-follow instructions allowed for better adaptability in the face of unexpected challenges. As changes to the project scope or objectives arose, we could quickly update our instructions to accommodate the new requirements, ensuring that our team remained agile and prepared to tackle emerging obstacles. Moreover, the long-term benefits of having well-documented instructions became evident as new team members joined the project. As these new members were provided with the updated instructions, they were able to easily understand their roles and integrate into the team, reducing the time and effort spent onboarding them while simultaneously minimizing any potential disruptions to the ongoing project. Throughout the entire project lifecycle, our decision to prioritize the creation of clear and easily understood instructions proved to be a critical factor in our success. By emphasizing simplicity and effective communication, we were able to build a strong foundation that supported the ongoing collaboration and coordination of our team, ultimately leading to the timely completion of the project with a high level of quality, exceeding the initial expectations. In conclusion, the choice of generating easier-to-follow instructions over sticking to the initial plans proved to be a valuable strategy in enhancing our team's performance and delivering exceptional results. It highlights the importance of constant evaluation and adaptation to ensure that our approach remains effective and aligned with the needs of both our team members and the project itself."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Recommendation: Congressional oversight for intelligence-and counterterrorism-is now dysfunctional. Congress should address this problem. We have considered various alternatives: A joint committee on the old model of the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy is one. A single committee in each house of Congress, combining authorizing and appropriating authorities, is another. The new committee or committees should conduct continuing studies of the activities of the intelligence agencies and report problems relating to the development and use of intelligence to all members of the House and Senate. We have already recommended that the total level of funding for intelligence be made public, and that the national intelligence program be appropriated to the National Intelligence Director, not to the secretary of defense. We also recommend that the intelligence committee should have a subcommittee specifically dedicated to oversight, freed from the consuming responsibility of working on the budget. The resolution creating the new intelligence committee structure should grant subpoena authority to the committee or committees. The majority party's representation on this committee should never exceed the minority's representation by more than one. Four of the members appointed to this committee or committees should be a member who also serves on each of the following additional committees: Armed Services, Judiciary, Foreign Affairs, and the Defense Appropriations subcommittee. In this way the other major congressional interests can be brought together in the new committee's work. Members should serve indefinitely on the intelligence committees, without set terms, thereby letting them accumulate expertise. The committees should be smaller-perhaps seven or nine members in each house-so that each member feels a greater sense of responsibility, and accountability, for the quality of the committee's work. The leaders of the Department of Homeland Security now appear before 88 committees and subcommittees of Congress. One expert witness (not a member of the administration) told us that this is perhaps the single largest obstacle impeding the department's successful development. The one attempt to consolidate such committee authority, the House Select Committee on Homeland Security, may be eliminated. The Senate does not have even this. Congress needs to establish for the Department of Homeland Security the kind of clear authority and responsibility that exist to enable the Justice Department to deal with crime and the Defense Department to deal with threats to national security.

Q: SEOUL — Despite recent tensions over North Korea’s nuclear and missile tests, life is actually quite normal for American military families living at Camp Humphreys in South Korea, which is the largest overseas Army installation in the world. Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas tries to come to most of his daughters’ high school soccer games at Camp Humphreys. In fact, his family’s lifestyle at this sprawling U.S. military base is similar to one they would lead back home. “We go to church on Sundays. We see all our friends there. We’re on the soccer field most of the afternoons, or just going for bike ride, the same things we would do if we were back in the States,” said Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Puskas, with the U.S. Eight Army. This is Puskas’ fourth tour in Korea. He met and married his Korean wife Mi-jung, during an earlier tour. His children have spent much of their lives at military bases in Korea. “I think it has given me a wider world view and has helped me understand other people a lot more,” said Elizabeth Puskas, the eldest daughter of the family who will attend college next year in the United States. The U.S. military in Korea is consolidating its forces in Camp Humphreys, including its military headquarters, as it moves to close older bases in congested Seoul and other regions of the country. Camp Humphreys is now the size of a small city, encompassing over 140 square kilometers of land, with construction underway to expand its capacity to accommodate over 40,000 people. There are modern apartments for soldiers and their families, schools, movie theaters, shopping centers and fast food restaurants to help bring some of the comforts of home to military life in Korea. The base even has its own golf course. “I have been around the army for part of the last 40 years as a soldier and now as a civilian, and this is as normal as any army post I’ve ever been on. In fact it is probably the nicest one I’ve been on because everything is new,” said Bob McElroy, a Camp Humphreys public affairs officer.

Any list of numbers we deal with will be enclosed in square brackets [] and separated by commas, such as: [1,2,3]. Here is a simple step-by-step explanation: 1. Understand the task: The task wants us to remove all the even numbers from a given list. It is also explicitly mentioned that even if every number in our given list is even, we are to return an empty list. We should also recall that zero is considered as an even number. 2. Examine our example: In the given example, [2, 195, 142, 141, 34, 34], we have a mix of both odd and even numbers. Notice also that some numbers may be repeated in the list, as in the case of 34. 3.

Fort Davis is a census-designated place (CDP) in Jeff Davis County, Texas, United States. The population was 1,201 at the 2010 US Census . It is the county seat of Jeff Davis County. It was the site of Fort Davis established in 1854 on the San Antonio-El Paso Road through west Texas and named after Jefferson Davis, who was then the Secretary of War under President Franklin Pierce. Can we infer the following? Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather","completion":"To infer that Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather, we must first gather information about its weather conditions and examine if there is a correlation between the population size and the weather. Step 1: Research the weather conditions of Fort Davis We would need to look into the climate, average temperatures, precipitation, and any extreme weather conditions in Fort Davis to see if there is a possible link to the population size. Step 2: Compare the weather with the population trend After gathering information on Fort Davis' weather, we would compare it with the population trend over time. If there is a clear decrease in population during adverse weather conditions or low population growth compared to similar regions with more favorable climate, it could indicate a relationship between weather and population size. Step 3: Analyze other factors that might affect the population size Before concluding that the small population is solely due to the weather, we must also consider other factors that could affect the population, such as economic opportunities, accessibility, and quality of life. We should compare these factors with the weather conditions in Fort Davis to see which one has a more significant impact on the population size. Step 4: Draw a conclusion Based on the research and analysis conducted in the previous steps, we can then determine whether or not it is reasonable to infer that the small population in Fort Davis is primarily due to its weather conditions. We would need to see a strong correlation between adverse weather and the low population or a lack of other significant factors to confidently make this inference. Without analyzing the weather conditions and considering other potential factors, it is not possible to confidently infer that Fort Davis has a small population due to its weather."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Now researchers are reporting this week in the Hong Kong Medical Journal on the November 2010 case of a newborn girl thought to have two tumors in her abdomen that were found to be 8- to 10-week-old fetuses instead. Weighing half an ounce and a third of an ounce, they were far enough along to each have four limbs, a spine, a rib cage, intestines, and an anus, and to be connected through an umbilical cord to a single placenta-like mass. \\"Since it is impossible for the little girl to have conceived the pregnancy on her own, the fertilization of the twin fetuses, of course, belongs to her parents, which has gone to the wrong place,\\" a local doctor tells the South China Morning Post. The baby girl carrying the fetuses underwent successful surgery to remove them at just two weeks of age. The condition, called fetus in fetu, is thought to occur in 1 in 500,000 births worldwide. This was the second such case to be reported in the region. The World Health Organization has classified it as a type of cancer called mature teratoma, but researchers write \\"the theory of demised multiple pregnancy has gained much support recently. More evidence is needed to confirm either theory.\\" (Last year, doctors found a 44-year-old calcified fetus in an 84-year-old woman.) Expand this summary.","completion":"Sometimes, really rarely, a baby can be born with something called \\"fetus in fetu.\\" It's like having tiny baby siblings inside their tummy, but they're not really alive. In these special cases, the tiny siblings don't grow the normal way, in their mommy's belly, but instead, they end up inside their brother or sister. It's so rare that it has only happened about 200 times. One time, in November 2010, doctors found what looked like two little siblings inside a newborn baby girl's tummy. They thought it could be tumors, but when they removed them, they saw that they were actually tiny fetuses, about 8 to 10 weeks old. They even had little arms and legs, and an umbilical cord connecting them. Since the baby girl couldn't have made these little sibling-fetuses herself, doctors think that they came from her mommy and daddy, and just ended up in the wrong place while they were growing. The baby girl had surgery to remove the tiny sibling-fetuses, and everything turned out okay. This kind of thing is so special that it only happens in about 1 in 500,000 births around the world.

His emotional state made it impossible for him to study, and within a month of his arrival in Italy, he began the journey back to England, stopping in Paris on 26 October 1816. There he enrolled in the atelier of Jean-Baptiste Regnault but found the atmosphere rowdy and the studio too full of Frenchmen, and he left after a week. While in Paris he also attended the Académie des Beaux-Arts, and amassed a large quantity of prints from the art shops of Paris. Still homesick, Etty left Paris, returning to London in November.Notwithstanding his unhappiness, Etty appears to have developed as a painter during his travels. For the first time, his two paintings exhibited at the 1817 Summer Exhibition (Bacchanalians: a Sketch and Cupid and Euphrosyne) attracted a favourable review in the press, in this case from William Paulet Carey writing in the Literary Gazette who considered Bacchanalians \\"a fine classical invention\\" and Cupid as showing \\"splendid promise\\". Carey was later to take great pride in being the first critic to recognise Etty's potential, and continued to champion him throughout his career. In 1818 Etty entered a copy of Damiano Mazza's The Rape of Ganymede—at the time thought to be by Titian—in one of the Royal Academy's painting competitions. Easily the most accomplished entry in the competition, Etty was due to win until two of the other contestants complained that he had technically breached RA rules by briefly removing the painting from Academy premises to work on it at home; they further complained that Etty was technically a professional artist and thus ineligible for the contest despite his still being a student.

Despite the ensuing messiness typical of using such materials, the narrator does not mind getting dirty. There are several potential reasons behind the narrator's attitude, which can be deduced from the context: 1. Bonding experience: The fact that the narrator uses the phrases \\"for her,\\" \\"more work for me than for her,\\" and \\"we'll be breaking out\\" suggest that the activity involves a close relationship between the narrator and another individual, possibly a child. As a result, the process of creating the item could be viewed as an enjoyable bonding experience where the mess is worth the quality time spent together. 2. Appreciation for creativity: The narrator seems to have a penchant for expressing themselves artistically, given the multiple mentions of various crafting materials. The excitement in breaking out these materials reflects enthusiasm for creativity, exploration, and expression. This passion may outweigh any concern for messiness, particularly if the final product is a rewarding accomplishment. 3. Enjoyment in the process: Through phrases like \\"not that I mind\\" and \\"you all know how much I love,\\" the narrator reveals their affinity for these kinds of activities. They seem to derive joy from working with these materials, which may lead to a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, dismissing any concerns about getting dirty in the process. 4. Unfazed by messiness: It is also possible that the narrator is simply unbothered by the mess that ensues from using these materials. They may have grown accustomed to the clutter, either as part of their everyday life or through repeated exposure to such situations. This familiarity could render the chaos insignificant when compared to the pleasure derived from the activity. In conclusion, the narrator does not mind getting dirty during the creation of this item due to the emotional and psychological benefits they experience. These may include bonding with their companion, enjoying their passion for creativity, and relishing the process of working with various materials. Furthermore, the narrator may find that their appreciation for the end product or for the hands-on experience outweighs any concerns about making a mess."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Adrian Begrand of PopMatters wrote \\"Nobody in metal today has the same kind of commanding stage presence as the self-professed Bald Bastard, Devin Townsend\\", and called Strapping Young Lad \\"one of the best live bands around\\". Townsend was famous for his on-stage antics; he integrated his ironic and tongue-in-cheek humor into live shows and interacted heavily with the audience. He would deliver comical, and often insulting remarks to them, organize circle pits, and parody heavy metal clichés as well as the genre itself.The band's humorous approach was also evidenced by a song frequently performed live from 1997, entitled \\"Far Beyond Metal\\", a parody of classic heavy metal. It became a live staple and a fan favorite, with lyrics changing practically every performance. Although it was recorded live on No Sleep 'till Bedtime, and on the For Those Aboot to Rock DVD, a studio version was not recorded until 2006 during The New Black sessions. The band was also sarcastic about their own Canadian heritage, they used \\"Blame Canada\\", a comedic anti-Canada song from South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut as intro music at many concerts in 2003 and 2004.For a period of time, Strapping Young Lad also played Townsend's solo material live. In 1998, after the release of Infinity, they began performing both Strapping Young Lad and Townsend's solo songs, as two separate sets.

How Social Networks Are Fueling The Solar Boom This guest post was written by Ben Higgins, director of government affairs for REC Solar, a California-based solar installer. How many times have you tried a restaurant, band, movie or book because a friend recommended it? Word of mouth buzz is a marketer’s holy grail. After all, trusted friends and people who share commonalities are the most credible referrers–they have no ulterior motive, have many of the same needs, and generally seek to make us happy. Thanks to our seemingly infinite social networks, we are inundated with recommendations influencing our tastes and preferences from food to clothing brands. Social influence stronger in conversations with neighbors and good friends, which is beginning to extend from our desktops to our rooftop energy decisions in a new phenomenon I call “social solar.” U.S. solar companies are closely managing two radical shifts in market fundamentals. First, solar module prices have plummeted, driving a whopping 70% increase in installations in 2012 even as some high-cost manufacturers have been driven out of business. Second, as solar hardware costs decline, the ‘soft costs’ of government red tape have emerged as the top focus for cutting the price of solar farther. Yet solar’s growth very much depends on adoption by homeowners and businesses. Going solar is more complicated than switching broadband providers, requiring permitting, construction and often financing—and many property owners are unwilling to invest that effort without a strong belief that it’s worth the hassle. By learning about the benefits from solar power systems from a trusted peer who faces many of the same local challenges (utility, construction, permitting options, siting), research from Yale and New York University demonstrates that social solar has already been shown to boost adoption rates by close to a percentage point. Across thousands of incoming sales leads in an industry that installed more than 10 billion worth of solar last year on tight margins, that difference can make or break a business. First, the good news. Thanks in part to falling module prices, solar is today cost-competitive with retail electricity rates in at least 20 states. In many markets, solar can be the most affordable energy source available. Still, adoption lags behind what the often-attractive financial returns would indicate, indicating that consumer awareness about solar costs is woefully behind. Now the bad news: many Americans still view solar as a solution to environmental woes rather than high utility bills. A September Solar Energy Industries Association survey found that while 92% of Americans support solar, 66% believe it’s still too expensive. As a result, solar’s customer acquisition costs are extremely high – in extreme cases equal to the cost of the solar panels – as sales teams spend time and money educating potential customers. The industry is quickly learning that the best and most cost-effective sales channels are solar’s early adopters. Solar, after all, is often a highly visible addition to homes or property, a natural conversation piece that sparks interest from neighbors – much like renovating the garage, installing new landscaping or buying an electric car. These front lawn conversations are vital for spreading the word about the mechanics of installing solar power as well as the economic payoff, from a trusted peer who’s been there and can take solar from fanciful to real. While solar companies have used customer referral programs for over a decade, these programs are kicking into overdrive targeting potential customers in neighborhoods with recent installations, expanding customer referral programs and providing prominent signage paired with local PR and social media. The message? Your neighbors, customers and even competitors are saving money with solar under similar conditions as you – and we make it easy for you to join them. The positive impact can be seen at both retail and wholesale levels. Take, for instance, two virtually identical commercial systems built for neighboring cold-storage facilities in California’s San Joaquin Valley. Once the first customer shared information about the financial benefits – savings of more than 300,000 per year and a 20-year return of more than 14% – solar became an easy proposition for the neighbors. The benefits of social solar apply on a broader scale as well. Solar policy advocates note that even after state financial incentives for solar have declined precipitously in top-tier markets including Arizona and New Jersey, small-scale solar adoption continues to grow. Many factors are behind this growth, but paramount is that solar’s newfound visibility on homes and businesses drove consumer interest, conversations and acceptance. Consumer awareness isn’t solar’s only near-term challenge. Solar companies still face a labyrinth of local, state and federal policies and must continue to attract investment and reduce costs even further to open new markets. However, solar can take a cue from other successful technologies in putting people – not the product – first. Turning solar’s early-adopters into social solar-evangelists, and credibly communicating that solar is a smart choice for nearly everyone to generate their own power will make an enormous step towards building our country’s clean energy future. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article discusses the impact of social networks in the growth and acceptance of solar as an energy source, a phenomenon referred to as \\"social solar\\". The plunge in solar module prices resulted in a significant increase in installations, making this form of energy cost-competitive in many states. However, despite these benefits, many consumers are still unaware of the economic advantages of solar power. The article emphasizes the value of social influence in boosting solar adoption. As solar installations are very visible, they often spark curiosity and conversations among neighbors and friends. Trusted peers sharing positive experiences with solar power help raise awareness about its practicality and economic benefits. Solar companies are magnifying this effect by strategically targeting potential customers in areas with new installations and enhancing their customer referral programs. These companies are using social media, signage, and local PR to convey the message that many are already benefiting from solar energy under similar conditions. Success stories of \\"social solar\\" are highlighted, such as commercial systems built for neighboring facilities in California, where the financial benefits shared by the first customer led to easy adoption by the neighbors. Influenced by real-life examples and direct benefits, consumer interest and acceptance of solar power has seen continuous growth even after reductions in financial incentives. Though challenges like local regulations and the need to reduce costs remain, the article highlights the significance of turning early adopters into advocates for this sustainable energy source. This can help drive consumer awareness and adoption, making solar power an accessible choice for many and aid in establishing a clean energy future for the country."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Jennifer is looking to move to a new city. She has always wanted to live in a coastal town, and she has narrowed her options down to two. She is looking to live in either Malarn or Trainlan. Malarn is known for its peppersteaks and its active nightlife. Malarn also regularly gets a large amount of dust in the air from a desert located across the ocean. Trainlan has a very famous art museum in its city, and being an art fanatic, that greatly appeals to Jennifer. She is planning to take a trip to both cities sometime in the near future to see them in person before making her decision. Are the coral reefs near Malarn more or less healthy than the reefs near Trainlan? Hint: During mid-summer (July in the northern hemisphere), the westward-moving trade winds south of the northward-moving subtropical ridge expand northwestward from the Caribbean into southeastern North America. When dust from the Sahara moving around the southern periphery of the ridge within the belt of trade winds moves over land, rainfall is suppressed and the sky changes from a blue to a white appearance, which leads to an increase in red sunsets. Its presence negatively impacts air quality by adding to the count of airborne particulates. Over 50% of the African dust that reaches the United States affects Florida. Since 1970, dust outbreaks have worsened because of periods of drought in Africa. There is a large variability in the dust transport to the Caribbean and Florida from year to year. Dust events have been linked to a decline in the health of coral reefs across the Caribbean and Florida, primarily since the 1970s. Similar dust plumes originate in the Gobi Desert, which combined with pollutants, spread large distances downwind, or eastward, into North America.There are local names for winds associated with sand and dust storms. The Calima carries dust on southeast winds into the Canary islands. The Harmattan carries dust during the winter into the Gulf of Guinea. The Sirocco brings dust from north Africa into southern Europe because of the movement of extratropical cyclones through the Mediterranean. Spring storm systems moving across the eastern Mediterranean Sea cause dust to carry across Egypt and the Arabian peninsula, which are locally known as Khamsin. The Shamal is caused by cold fronts lifting dust into the atmosphere for days at a time across the Persian Gulf states.

Here is a goal: How to clean kitchen cabinet doors. Which way makes more sense to accomplish this goal?","completion":"To accomplish the goal of cleaning kitchen cabinet doors, it is advisable to follow a step-by-step approach that ensures thorough cleaning and maintains the durability of the cabinet doors. There are various methods to clean kitchen cabinet doors, however, the most effective way involves using a combination of properly selected cleaning materials and appropriate techniques. Here is a detailed long answer to help you achieve this goal: Materials needed: 1. Soft microfiber cloths or gentle sponge 2. Dish soap or mild liquid detergent 3. White vinegar or baking soda 4. Warm water 5. Spray bottle (if using vinegar solution) 6. Bucket or large bowl 7. Rubber gloves (optional) 8. Vacuum cleaner with brush attachment (optional) Step 1: Prepare the cleaning solution There are two potential cleaning solutions - a mixture of warm water and dish soap or a combination of warm water and white vinegar. To make a dish soap solution, mix a few drops of mild dish soap in a bucket or large bowl of warm water. For a vinegar solution, combine equal parts of white vinegar and warm water in a spray bottle. Alternatively, you can create a baking soda paste by mixing three parts baking soda to one part water, especially for spot cleaning stubborn stains and grease. Step 2: Remove excess dust and dirt Before applying any cleaning solutions, it's crucial to remove excess dust and dirt from the cabinet doors. Use a vacuum cleaner with a brush attachment to gently vacuum the surface, paying attention to grooves, molding, and corners where dirt may accumulate. If you don't have a vacuum cleaner, use a dry microfiber cloth or soft brush to dust off the cabinet doors. Step 3: Clean cabinet doors with the selected cleaning solution For the dish soap solution, moisten the microfiber cloth or sponge in the solution and wring it out to remove excess water. Gently scrub the cabinet doors, moving in the direction of the wood grain to avoid damaging the surface. Pay attention to edges and corners as well as handles or knobs. If using the vinegar solution, spray it directly onto the cabinet doors and then use a microfiber cloth to wipe the surface. In the case of stubborn stains, apply baking soda paste onto the stain, let it sit for a few minutes, and gently scrub it with a cloth or sponge. Step 4: Rinse and dry It is essential to remove any soap or cleaning residue from the cabinet doors. Use a clean, damp cloth to wipe down the surface and remove any remaining cleaning solution. Be sure not to use excessive water that can damage the wood. After rinsing the cabinet doors, dry them immediately using a clean, dry microfiber cloth to prevent any water stains or damage. Step 5: Polish the cabinet doors (optional) If your cabinet doors have a glossy or shiny finish, you can apply a wood-friendly polish or wax to restore their shine. Apply the product following the manufacturer's instructions and buff the surface using a clean, dry microfiber cloth. Step 6: Maintain regular cleaning To keep your kitchen cabinet doors looking their best, establish a regular cleaning routine. Wipe down the cabinet doors using a damp microfiber cloth at least once a week to remove dust, dirt, and grease. Perform a thorough cleaning, as described above, every few months to ensure the longevity of your cabinet doors. In conclusion, the most sensible approach to accomplishing the goal of cleaning kitchen cabinet doors involves using a careful and regular cleaning routine with suitable cleaning materials and techniques. By following the steps above, you can ensure your cabinet doors are always clean, well-maintained, and looking their best."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

While I cannot provide a definitive answer, I can certainly discuss general preferences and patterns observed in relationships. Lastly, I will clarify whether the two questions are the same or different. 1. What do girls look for in guys? Is it still tall, dark, and handsome? Step 1: Research studies and surveys on preferences in relationships. Many studies have been conducted to determine what women find attractive in men. Step 2: Identify general preferences. While not true for everyone, research suggests that women generally find tall, dark, and handsome men attractive. However, the attractiveness of a man is a combination of physical attributes, personality traits, and behavior. Some common qualities that women look for in a partner include confidence, intelligence, humor, kindness, and ambition. Step 3: Consider individual preferences. Preferences can vary from person to person. Some women might prioritize physical appearance, while others place more importance on personality traits or shared values. Thus, it is essential to remember that attractiveness can be quite subjective. 2. Why am I single? Step 1: Consider possible factors. There could be various reasons for being single, such as choice, timing, or circumstances. It is essential to understand the user's situation to provide a more accurate response. Step 2: Evaluate personal development and relationship readiness. Evaluate whether you are ready for a relationship, focusing on personal growth, career goals, and emotional well-being. Self-improvement is vital for attracting a partner who compliments your values and interests. Step 3: Analyze social involvement. Another reason for being single could be a lack of social interaction. Expanding your social circle and participating in events can increase the chance of meeting someone compatible and forming romantic connections. Finally, I will address if these two questions are the same. While both questions are related to attraction and romantic connections, they are not the same question. The first question pertains to what girls find attractive in guys, while the second question addresses the reasons for being single.

They were carrying the usual rope, and it was hanging down from the basket of the balloon. At the end of the rope they had tied a metal box. This could hold water, or it could be empty. So they were able to change its weight. It was for use over the sea. They were also carrying some bags of sand. After the sun rose, the balloon went higher. It went up to 3,000 meters, and the air was very cold. The water in the balloon became ice. Snow fell past the men's basket, and they could see more snow on the ground. The men tried to throw out some more sand, but it was hard. They tried to break the icy sand with their knives, but it was not easy. The work was slow and they were still falling, so they had to drop some whole bags of sand. One of them fell on an icy lake and made a black hole in the ice.

I have a new situation: John was studying about the history of Sahara desert. He was amazed to find that ten thousand years ago there were plenty of rainfall in that region. He labeled that era as era A. Then he found that rainfall deceased in the region about eight thousand years ago. He labeled that era as era B. He was wondering how that change in rainfall might have helped emerge the Egyptian civilization. But I can use this background: Rainfall in an area is important because it influences the rate of weathering. More rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil. The rainwater reacts chemically with the particles. The top layers of soil are in contact with the freshest water, so reactions are greatest there. High rainfall increases the amount of rock that experiences chemical reactions. High rainfall may also carry material away. This means that new surfaces are exposed. This increases the rate of weathering. What is an answer for this question: Would era B see less or more rocks with chemical reactions than era A? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Era B would see less rocks with chemical reactions than Era A. This is because Era A had a higher amount of rainfall compared to Era B (ten thousand years ago vs. eight thousand years ago). As mentioned in the provided background, more rain means that more rainwater passes through the soil and reacts chemically with the particles, resulting in greater chemical reactions in rocks. In contrast, lower rainfall in Era B would result in a decreased rate of chemical reactions in rocks, as there would be less water passing through and reacting with the particles in the soil. Additionally, high rainfall (Era A) carries away material, exposing new surfaces for further weathering to occur. This process would be significantly reduced in Era B due to the decrease in rainfall. As for the impact of this change in rainfall on the emergence of the Egyptian civilization, it is important to note that the decreasing rainfall in Era B led to the formation of the desert environment we now know as the Sahara. As the area became more arid, human populations might have migrated towards more reliable sources of water like the Nile River, which provided a fertile environment for agriculture. The ability to grow crops and sustain larger populations could have contributed to the rise of complex societies as agricultural practices and resource management became crucial factors for survival and growth of populations, ultimately leading to the emergence of the Egyptian civilization."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It is believed that Western Kshatrapas (405–35 BC) were Saka rulers of the western part of India (Saurashtra and Malwa: modern Gujarat, Southern Sindh, Maharashtra, Rajasthan). They were successors to the Indo-Scythians and were contemporaneous with the Kushans, who ruled the northern part of the Indian subcontinent. The Indo-Scythians invaded the area of Ujjain and established the Saka era (with their calendar), marking the beginning of the long-lived Saka Western Satraps state. Matsya, a state of the Vedic civilisation of India, is said to roughly corresponded to the former state of Jaipur in Rajasthan and included the whole of Alwar with portions of Bharatpur. The capital of Matsya was at Viratanagar (modern Bairat), which is said to have been named after its founder king Virata.

The ruling comes days after presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump called to block non-citizen Muslims from entering the U.S. following the Orlando nightclub massacre. Even before the attack, Americans were divided, mostly along party lines, on the issue of refugees from war-torn countries in the Middle East. A survey conducted in late May by the Brookings Institution found of those polled, just 38 percent of Republicans supported taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared with 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. So who are these people who cause such a divide among Americans, triggering feelings of dread and suspicion in some and feelings of empathy and hospitality in others? Millions have been forced to flee the bloody conflicts in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other Middle Eastern nations. In 1951 the United Nation's Refugee Convention defined a refugee as someone who \\"owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality, and is unable to, or owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country.\\" By the end of 2014, there were 19.5 million refugees worldwide, according to the United Nations, 14.4 million of whom were under the mandate of the United Nations Human Rights Council. This was an increase of 2.9 million from 2013. The remaining 5.1 million refugees were registered with the United Nations Relief and Works Agency. However, there are an estimated 59.5 million forcibly displaced persons around the world, according to United Nation's Global Trends report. This population not only includes refugees, but internally displaced persons, asylum-seekers and stateless people as well. President Barack Obama has set... What is the name of the federal judge? A.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. \\", contrived sequels \\" How would the sentiment of this sentence be perceived?","completion":"The sentiment of the sentence, \\"contrived sequels,\\" can be perceived as predominantly negative. This is because the term \\"contrived\\" holds negative connotations, implying that something has been artificially created or manipulated, rather than occurring naturally or authentically. In this context, it suggests that the sequels in question have not been developed due to an inspired or genuine continuation of the original story or characters but have been fabricated for some other motives, such as commercial purposes or to capitalize on the success of the first installment. To better understand this sentiment, it is essential to break down the two terms used in this sentence: 1. Contrived: When something is labeled as \\"contrived,\\" it generally implies that it has been deliberately and artificially created or manipulated, often with the intent to deceive, impress, or gain some advantage. In this case, it carries a negative connotation, as it suggests a lack of authenticity and creativity. 2. Sequels: Sequels refer to follow-up works or continuations, usually in the context of creative pieces, like films, novels, or video games. Sequels are often created to continue exploring the characters and storyline introduced in the original work. When sequels are well-developed, they can provide satisfying additions to the franchise or story, and elicit positive reactions from fans and audiences. When combined, the phrase \\"contrived sequels\\" portrays a sentiment that is less than favorable, as it suggests that the sequels are not products of genuine creative effort. It conveys the idea that these follow-up works have been forced or artificially constructed, perhaps to simply cash in on the original work's success. Consequently, audiences may be led to believe that these sequels are of inferior quality, lacking depth, and ultimately, not as enjoyable or emotionally engaging as the original work."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This piece of information could lead to the conclusion that it might have been a popular topic on news TV lately. However, it's important to note that the premise only provides evidence for the topic being discussed once or in at least one instance, but does not confirm it to be popular or repeatedly featured on news TV. Furthermore, the words \\"either CNN or somewhere\\" might also introduce a level of uncertainty about the source of the information being from a news TV channel or any other platform. Even though it is mentioned that it was \\"talking about that,\\" this does not guarantee extensive news coverage or popularity. In the light of the provided information, the most accurate answer to choose would be: - it is not possible to tell The reason for this is that while the premise suggests some recent discussions have taken place, it does not provide strong evidence about the topic being popular on news TV lately.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. How can some people still believe the world is flat? Why do some people still think the Earth is flat? Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"Yes, the two questions you asked are essentially the same, both inquiring about the reasons why some individuals continue to believe that the Earth is flat, despite overwhelming scientific evidence indicating otherwise. To provide a comprehensive understanding, I will delve into the possible reasons behind the persistence of the flat-Earth belief: 1. Lack of education and scientific literacy: One factor that may contribute to the belief in a flat Earth is a lack of exposure to scientific knowledge and education. Many people worldwide do not have access to quality education, particularly in the realm of science, which might make it difficult for them to critically evaluate the scientific data supporting a spherical Earth. 2. Misinterpretation of personal experiences: Humans often rely on their senses and personal experiences to assess the world around them. For someone who has never traveled extensively, the Earth may appear flat due to the limited range of their observations. Therefore, they might misinterpret their surroundings and believe that the Earth is flat, despite the evidence against this notion. 3. Distrust in authority or mainstream science: Across the world, trust in institutions, including scientific and educational establishments, has eroded due to various factors. People who distrust established authority may be more inclined to entertain alternative theories or explanations, even those that defy scientific consensus. 4. Influence of misinformation and conspiracy theories: With the expansion of the internet and social media, the spread of misinformation and conspiracy theories has become easier and more prevalent. Individuals who encounter such ideas might become more predisposed to question scientific consensus, leading them to embrace ideas like the flat-Earth theory. 5. Psychological reasons: The belief in a flat Earth might offer some individuals a sense of psychological comfort by providing them with a more straightforward and easily understood model of the world. Additionally, this belief might help them feel unique or knowledgeable compared to the rest of society, which can be satisfying and appealing. 6. Cultural and religious factors: Some individuals might be influenced by cultural or religious beliefs that support a flat-Earth model. For example, they may interpret scripture or religious texts as describing a flat Earth, prompting them to reject scientific evidence in favor of their religious convictions. 7. Social aspects: The flat-Earth community has grown and become more organized in recent years, in part due to the internet. This community provides its members with a sense of belonging and shared identity, further motivating individuals to keep believing in this alternative worldview. In conclusion, there are several factors that could help explain why some people still believe in a flat Earth. These factors range from a lack of education and scientific literacy to psychological reasons, distrust in institutions, and the influence of misinformation, conspiracy theories, cultural, religious beliefs, and the social aspects of belonging to the flat-Earth community. While these questions are indeed the same, understanding the underlying reasons behind this belief can shed light on why it persists despite overwhelming evidence supporting a spherical Earth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Research shows that stress levels peak at the point where the pencil is poised to put a cross in the box against the name of the chosen candidate. This year's local council and police commissioner elections could see even more confusion with some Yorkshire voters being asked to make up to five choices. Even the most seasoned voter can often have a crisis of confidence in those final seconds in the privacy of the voting booth. I have to admit that even after more than four decades of taking part in elections a question still flashes through my mind every time the pencil touches the ballot paper: * \\"Am I ticking the box or putting a cross in it?\\" Surveys say I am not alone. Other regular concerns that come up are: ** \\"Is the candidate representing the party I want?\\" *** \\"Should the ballot paper be signed?\\" These election worry wobbles are only to be expected. Secret ballots mean that voting has to be a solitary experience and phoning a friend is not really an option. At most elections voters merely have to put a single cross against the name of just one candidate. That is exactly the system being used by eight local councils across Yorkshire to elect a fresh batch of councillors this year. However, two others will be asking a lot more of their electorate. Voters in Sheffield and Rotherham will be handed multiple choice ballot papers where they are being asked to pencil in up to three crosses. That is because for the first time these two South Yorkshire neighbouring local authorities are holding \\"all-out\\" polls where every seat is being elected. Traditionally councils use the \\"thirds\\" system in which on three successive years a third of the council seats come up for election. As each council ward is represented by three councillors it means that just one seat is being contested in each election year. Sheffield and Rotherham's full elections means all seats are up for election in every ward so voters will be able to pick three from a long list of candidates on the ballot paper. In Sheffield recent radical changes to the boundaries of all its wards forced a switch to full elections. Rotherham was ordered to contest every seat by the government in the hope of a fresh start for a council tainted by its failure to effectively tackle the scandal of the mass grooming and sexual assault of young girls by criminal gangs in the town. This is in addition to entirely separate elections being held on the same day across England where every voter will be given the choice of putting two crosses on the ballot paper. This is for the local Police and Crime Commissioner elections where the relatively unfamiliar \\"supplementary vote\\" system is being used. A cross can be put against both a first and second choice candidate. If no candidate takes more than 50% of the first choice votes then the second preferences come into play. The top two go into a run-off where the \\"supplementary\\" votes are added to their totals for a winner to emerge. No wonder the council officials who will be running polling stations on 5 May are preparing to spend a lot of time explaining how to vote. Those anxious questions answered: * A cross in the centre of the box against the name of the chosen candidate (or candidates) is the best option to ensure the ballot paper is not \\"spoilt\\". However, as long as the voter's intention is clear a tick or a single stroke of the pencil will probably be sufficient at the discretion of the returning officer. ** Official party name and an emblem are now printed alongside a candidate's name. Independents allowed a six-word description. *** Writing on a ballot paper to identify the voter, send a message to the candidate or make a statement will \\"spoil\\" the vote. What is a summary of this text?","completion":"In the upcoming local council and police commissioner elections, some Yorkshire voters may face confusion as they are asked to make up to five choices. Sheffield and Rotherham will be holding \\"all-out\\" polls, where every seat is being elected, causing voters to pencil in up to three crosses on multiple choice ballot papers. In addition to this, the \\"supplementary vote\\" system is being used for the Police and Crime Commissioner elections, where voters can put a cross against both a first and second choice candidate. Election worry wobbles, such as putting a tick or cross in the box and whether the ballot paper should be signed, are common concerns among voters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Mavs entered the 2011 NBA Finals as underdogs, due to Miamis \\"Big Three\\" coming together during the course of the 2010–11 NBA Playoffs. After dropping game one in Miami by a score of 92–84, the Mavs needed more than just Nowitzki to score, with Nowitzki even calling out teammate Jason Terry earlier in the playoffs. In the fourth quarter of game 2 with the Mavericks trailing 88–73, Dallas was desperate to avoid a 0–2 heading back home. Dallas then staged a comeback, going on a 22–5 run to end the game, and stun the Heat with a game two victory, evening up the series at a game a piece. After the series shifted back to Dallas, the Mavericks lost in game 3, with Nowitzki narrowly missing the potential game-tying shot, by a score of 88–86. Dallas yet again showed their resiliency, winning a pivotal game 4 with Dirk hitting multiple big shots down the stretch to tie the series at two. Game 5 was a bit of an offensive showcase, with both teams breaking 100 points for the first time in the series. Jason Kidd and Jason Terry both hit huge shots down the stretch and the Mavericks defeated the Heat 112–103, putting them one game from their first ever NBA title. Three nights later, the Mavericks captured their first ever NBA title with a 105–95 victory, completely reversing what had happened in the 2006 NBA Finals. Nowitzki scored 21, including 18 in the second half, and Terry provided 27 points off the Dallas bench. Nowitzki was so emotional after the game that he headed to the locker room before the game had concluded, and had to be coaxed back onto the floor for the NBA Championship trophy presentation. Nowitzki took home the NBA Finals MVP honors, after averaging 26 points a game during the series, shedding the Mavericks label as \\"soft\\", and putting an end to the Mavericks post-season futility. How many points did Nowitzki score in the first half of game 6 of the 2011 NBA Finals?","completion":"In the first half of game 6 of the 2011 NBA Finals, Nowitzki scored 3 points. We know that he scored 21 points in total during the game, and 18 of those points came in the second half. So, to find out how many points he scored in the first half, we subtract the points from the second half from the total points: 21 total points - 18 second half points = 3 first half points."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Look for a low-lying area like a valley or ravine, preferably obscured from the rain. Take refuge here until the storm passes. Crouch down with your heels touching and your head between your knees: this will make you a smaller target. Do not lie down flat, and minimize your contact with the ground. Lightning can be fatal up to one hundred feet away from the initial strike. Check weather forecasts early in the day, and avoid going to a swimming pool, river, lake, or beach on rainy days. If you find yourself in open water during a thunderstorm, return to land immediately. If you are in a boat and cannot return to safety, drop anchor and crouch as low as possible. Do not return to the body of water until thirty minutes after the last lightning strike. Any earlier, and the storm may not be over. Indoor swimming is equally unsafe. Avoid all large bodies of water during a storm. Taller objects are more likely to be struck by lightning. Wherever you are, don't become the highest object anywhere. Avoid standing under trees in a lightning storm, and stay away from tall objects like light posts. If you're in a forest, stay near a lower stand of trees. Umbrellas can increase your risk of getting hit if it is the tallest object in the area. Metal conducts electricity, and you are much more likely to get hit. If you are carrying large metal objects, let them go. Small metal objects, like piercings or electronic devices, do not carry a large risk and are safe to hold.

Given the question: This article: On returning to London, Moore undertook a seven-year teaching post at the Royal College of Art. He was required to work two days a week, which allowed him time to spend on his own work. His first public commission, West Wind (1928–29), was one of the eight reliefs of the 'four winds' high on the walls of London Underground's headquarters at 55 Broadway. The other 'winds' were carved by contemporary sculptors including Eric Gill with the ground-level pieces provided by Epstein. 1928 saw Moore's first solo exhibition, held at the Warren Gallery in London. In July 1929, Moore married Irina Radetsky, a painting student at the Royal College. Irina was born in Kiev in 1907 to Ukrainian–Polish parents. Her father did not return from the Russian Revolution and her mother was evacuated to Paris where she married a British army officer. Irina was smuggled to Paris a year later and went to school there until she was 16, after which she was sent to live with her stepfather's relatives in Buckinghamshire. Irina found security in her marriage to Moore and was soon posing for him. Shortly after they married, the couple moved to a studio in Hampstead at 11a Parkhill Road NW3, joining a small colony of avant-garde artists who were taking root there. Shortly afterward, Hepworth and her second husband Ben Nicholson moved into a studio around the corner from Moore, while Naum Gabo, Roland Penrose, Cecil Stephenson and the art critic Herbert Read also lived in the area (Read referred to the area as \\"a nest of gentle artists\\"). This led to a rapid cross-fertilization of ideas that Read would publicise, helping to raise Moore's public profile. The area was also a stopping-off point for many refugee artists, architects and designers from continental Europe en route to America—some of whom would later commission works from Moore. contains an answer for the question: What was the full name of the person who was posing for Moore?, what is it ? The answer is:","completion":"Irina Radetsky."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Answer based on context: The U.S. Institute of Medicine (IOM) updated Estimated Average Requirements (EARs) and Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) for iron in 2001. The current EAR for iron for women ages 14–18 is 7.9 mg/day, 8.1 for ages 19–50 and 5.0 thereafter (post menopause). For men the EAR is 6.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. The RDA is 15.0 mg/day for women ages 15–18, 18.0 for 19–50 and 8.0 thereafter. For men, 8.0 mg/day for ages 19 and up. RDAs are higher than EARs so as to identify amounts that will cover people with higher than average requirements. RDA for pregnancy is 27 mg/day and, for lactation, 9 mg/day. For children ages 1–3 years 7 mg/day, 10 for ages 4–8 and 8 for ages 9–13. As for safety, the IOM also sets Tolerable upper intake levels (ULs) for vitamins and minerals when evidence is sufficient. In the case of iron the UL is set at 45 mg/day. Collectively the EARs, RDAs and ULs are referred to as Dietary Reference Intakes. How many mg/day higher is the ULs for iron than the RDA for pregnant women?","completion":"Alright, let me explain this in a simple way. We want to find out how much more iron is allowed in the Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for iron compared to the Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for pregnant women. The UL for iron is 45 milligrams per day (mg/day). For pregnant women, the RDA is 27 milligrams per day (mg/day). To find out the difference, we need to subtract the RDA (27 mg) from the UL (45 mg): 45 mg/day (UL) - 27 mg/day (RDA) = 18 mg/day So, the ULs for iron is 18 mg/day higher than the RDA for pregnant women."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Additionally, the composition of the group, with three adults and one child, does not necessarily fit the traditional structure of a nuclear family. In order to validate or refute the hypothesis, we would need more contextual information such as their interactions with each other, verbal communication, or any specific physical attributes that might indicate a familial relationship, such as shared facial features or body language.

Make this lower case","completion":"People often demand things from God while they continue to rebel against His law and refuse to keep it. This contradictory behavior can be observed in various aspects of life, as individuals might seek God's help or intervention but remain unwilling to commit to following His teachings and commandments. To understand this further, let's delve into the factors that might contribute to such attitudes: 1. Lack of understanding or knowledge: Many people may not have a comprehensive understanding of God's law and might not be aware of the extent to which they are not following it. In these cases, individuals may demand something from God, not realizing that they are also rebelling against Him. 2. Justification of actions: Some individuals might feel justified in breaking God's laws, rationalizing that their actions serve a \\"greater good\\" or are a means to secure their own happiness. In these instances, they might seek God's help while still engaging in rebellion against His teachings. 3. Indulging in selfish desires: Human nature often tends to be self-serving and prioritizes personal desires over adherence to morality or divine guidance. As such, people might ask for God's assistance while still indulging in sinful behaviors. 4. Internal struggles: Many people face ongoing battles between their faith and their temptations, convictions, and desires. As a result, these individuals may cry out to God for help in their moments of weakness, even as they continue to grapple with the rebellious aspects of their character. 5. Misinterpretation of God's grace: Some might believe that God's love and forgiveness grant them the freedom to break His commandments without consequences, leading them to demand His intervention while not adhering to His rules. 6. Hypocrisy: In some cases, individuals might adopt a hypocritical attitude and demand God's help for their own advantage while actively disregarding His teachings in their day-to-day lives. In conclusion, people often seek the help and blessing of God while simultaneously rebelling against His law and refusing to keep it. This behavior can arise from various factors, including lack of understanding, justification of actions, selfish desires, internal struggles, misinterpretation of God's grace, and hypocrisy. To better align one's actions and attitudes with their faith, it is essential to gain a better understanding of God's teachings, practice self-awareness, and strive for personal growth and spiritual development."},{"prompt":"Question: where is keith whitley from I found the following answer on Google: He charted 19 singles on the Billboard country charts, including five consecutive Number Ones: \\" Don't Close Your Eyes \\", \\" When You Say Nothing at All \\", \\" I'm No Stranger to the Rain \\", \\" I Wonder Do You Think of Me \\" and \\" It Ain't Nothin' \\" (the last two posthumously).

On the other hand, most of the seats he designed had padding. He marked it as case B. Keith needed to know pros and cons of both designs. Would case B take less or more time for the force to act than case A? Hint: Extending the period of time over which a force acts in order to lessen the force is a common practice in design. Padding in shoes and seats allows the time to increase. The front of automobiles are designed to crumple in an accident; this increases the time the car takes to stop. Similarly, barrels of water or sand in front of abutments on the highway and airbags serve to slow down the stoppage time. These changes all serve to decrease the amount of force it takes to stop the momentum in a car crash, which consequently saves lives. Answer:","completion":"Based on the hint provided, case B (car seats with padding) would take more time for the force to act than case A (car seats without padding). The padding in car seats increases the time over which the force acts, reducing the overall force experienced by the occupant during an event such as a car crash. This extended time results in a more gradual deceleration and a lower impact force, which contributes to improved safety."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Afterwards, Zeus travels to Tartarus to meet with his brothers Hades (Ralph Fiennes) and Poseidon (Danny Huston), and his son Ares (Edgar Ramirez).

Answer:","completion":"Gretl Braun, whose full name was Margarete Berta Braun, was part of Adolf Hitler's inner social circle. She was the younger sister of Eva Braun, Hitler's longtime companion and, in the last days of World War II, his wife. Gretl was, however, less politically involved than her sister, and her presence in Hitler's inner social circle was largely due to her close familial relationship to Eva. Gretl Braun was a frequent guest at the Berghof, Adolf Hitler's home in the Obersalzberg of the Bavarian Alps near Berchtesgaden, Germany. The Berghof served as Hitler's vacation residence, and it was also a place where he entertained many guests, including his intimate circle. Gretl would have spent considerable time there due to her sister's relationship with Hitler. The Berghof was a two-story residence furnished lavishly, featuring a large living room with a conservatory and a grand terrace overlooking the stunning alpine landscape. Private quarters, guest rooms, and staff accommodations occupied the remainder of the space. The property also boasted a complex of additional houses, service facilities, security installations, and two SS barracks, making it a highly secured complex. In addition to the Berghof, it is also essential to mention the Reich Chancellery in Berlin, which was Hitler's official residence as German Chancellor. Hitler had an apartment in this neoclassical building where he spent a great deal of time when not at his alpine retreat. In particular, during the later stages of World War II, Hitler spent most of his time in the chancellery's bunker, the Führerbunker. Hitler, his companions, and some of his staff moved into the Führerbunker in January 1945 as Allied armies closed in on Berlin. It was in a reception area of the Führerbunker where Hitler and Eva Braun held their wedding ceremony, with Gretl Braun likely in attendance as one of the witnesses. Gretl Braun consequently would have been in both of these places as part of Hitler's inner social circle. From attending social gatherings at his alpine retreat in Berghof to experiencing the downfall of the Third Reich in the Führerbunker, Gretl Braun's presence was continuous in these pivotal locations of Hitler’s life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: A Romanian lawyer is suing his local Orthodox bishop and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. Madalin Ciculescu, 34, accused the five of fraud after they turned up several times to exercise the demons which were responsible for the bad smells that were ruining his business. He claimed that after the failed exorcism the demons even started haunting him at his home at Pitesti in Arges County in central Romania. Romanian lawyer, Madalin Ciculescu, 34, left, is suing his local Orthodox bishop, Constantin Argatu, right, and four priests claiming they failed to properly exorcise flatulent demons that were forcing him out of his home. The case alleging 'religious malpractice' is reportedly the first time there has been such an allegation made in a Romanian court. The four priests had all tried and failed to exorcise the demons, according to the legal papers that named bishop Constantin Argatu, even though he had not been to the property, as he was in charge of the priests who had been there. The case has already been rejected by a lower court in Romania and was rejected again this week by the Romanian High Court, but now the businessmen says he plans to go to the European Court of Human Rights. Unusual case: The court room wall showing the appeal against the earlier ruling. He told the court: 'If they (the accused) represent the way of God then God's ways are crooked. They did not remove the demons that made these bad smells as they promised to do, and I still see all sorts of demons in the form of animals, usually crows but also other such things, that are making my life miserable. 'When I am at home they switch the TV on and off all the time, they make foul smells that give me headaches and basically roam unhindered around my house and my business.' Eerie: The man claimed the demons turned his television on and off and said his hair-dryer was possessed. The man produced his mother to back up his claim saying that even the hair-dryer was possessed and a black shadow came out of it when anyone tried to use it - and she also said the fridge was infested by the flatulent demons that she confirmed left foul smells about the property. But the lawyer for the Archdiocese from Arges, Anton Alin, rejected the allegation of fraud saying that the exorcism had been properly carried out and they believed the allegations of further demons and more bad smells were simply a product of the man's imagination. The Romanian court agreed with the church and rejected the application against Bishop Argatu as well as priests Ionut Cret Ovidiu, Gheorghe Nicut, Marius Dumitrescu and Gheorghe Dunitru - and ordered Ciculescu to pay legal costs.","completion":"- Romanian lawyer Madalin Ciculescu sues local Orthodox bishop and four priests for failing to exorcise flatulent demons from his home. - The demons allegedly caused bad smells, affecting Ciculescu's business and personal life. - This case, dubbed \\"religious malpractice,\\" is the first of its kind in a Romanian court. - The lawsuit has been rejected by both a lower court in Romania and the Romanian High Court. - Ciculescu plans to take the case to the European Court of Human Rights."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

To destroy enemy ships [...] Make this lower case.","completion":"Destroying enemy ships is a complex and multifaceted task, requiring strategic planning, coordination, and efficient use of available resources. The key elements involved in this process include gathering intelligence, understanding the enemy's capabilities and intentions, having superior technology and firepower, and utilizing effective tactics for successful engagement. To maximize the chances of success, the following steps should be undertaken: 1. Intelligence gathering: The first crucial step in destroying enemy ships is to gather as much information as possible about their position, movements, and capabilities. This can be achieved through various means, such as deploying scout/detecting planes, submarines, or satellites. Additionally, analyzing communications and intercepting signals can contribute to a better understanding of the enemy's plans. 2. Analyzing enemy capabilities: It is essential to have a clear understanding of the enemy's arsenal and strategies to devise an effective plan and allocate resources appropriately. This could involve researching their ships, weapon systems, defense capabilities, and command structure. Intelligence gathered from reconnaissance missions, captured equipment, or surveillance can help in this analysis. 3. Development of superior technology: The development of advanced weapon systems, detection capabilities, and countermeasures is vital to maintaining an edge over the enemy. This involves investing in research and development in areas such as stealth technology, precision-guided munitions, electronic warfare, and drone technology. 4. Tactical planning and coordination: Having a well-thought-out strategy and efficient coordination between various units is indispensable for success in military engagements. This includes assigning specific roles and tasks to different naval vessels, aircraft, and ground forces, and ensuring that they work in harmony during an operation. Proper communication and synchronization between these units can increase combat effectiveness and avoid mistakes and friendly fire incidents. 5. Selecting the right time and place for engagement: A crucial factor in successfully destroying enemy ships is choosing the appropriate location and timing for the attack. This may depend on factors such as weather conditions, sea state, visibility, and the current state of both friendly and adversary forces. Striking when the enemy is unprepared, disorganized, or vulnerable is often crucial for maximizing the potential damage inflicted. 6. Execution of the attack: Once all these aspects have been carefully planned and prepared, it's time to carry out the assault. Various attack options are available, depending on the specific situation and capabilities of both sides. These options include naval gunfire, missile strikes, aerial bombardment, torpedoes, and boarding actions. 7. Utilizing deception and surprise: Catching the enemy off guard can greatly increase the likelihood of successfully destroying enemy ships. This can be achieved by employing deception techniques, such as creating false intelligence, using decoys, or hiding the true size and composition of your forces. 8. Post-attack assessment and adapting tactics: After the initial attack, it is essential to evaluate the results and adjust the strategy if necessary. Conducting damage assessment can provide crucial information on the enemy's remaining capabilities and the effectiveness of friendly forces. Based on this analysis, further attacks may be planned, or alternative tactics may be employed. In conclusion, destroying enemy ships is a multifaceted and challenging task that takes careful planning, superior technology, and meticulous execution. By incorporating the mentioned steps and continuously adapting and improving tactics, one can increase the chances of successfully destroying enemy vessels and achieving strategic objectives."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Imagine this, you have a puzzle with many pieces. Some bits are shaped differently and have varied colors, right? Now, we'll use that same idea to tell a story about a man named Bruce Ivins. This tale is like a puzzle, and we're going to put different pieces together. Bruce Ivins was a scientist who worked for the U.S. government, just like some people might work for a school or a store. Some people thought he released something very yucky and dangerous, called anthrax. Anthrax is something that can make people very sick, just like if you catch a cold or the flu, but much worse. Think of anthrax as this really, really bad type of germs that we don't want to catch. Now, some people thought Ivins did this to see if a new medicine, or vaccine, he was working on could stop the bad germs. Testing vaccines is like trying out a new superhero cape on a doll to see if it helps it fly. Soon, more puzzle pieces came into the picture. Some people said Ivins was being investigated, or looked at more closely, for some anthrax attacks that happened in 2001. That's when somebody used these bad germs to hurt others. It's like when your teachers watch you more closely if they think you might have not followed the rules at school. Bruce's lawyer, or the person who was trying to help him in this tough situation, said Ivins was innocent. Innocent means he didn't actually do anything wrong. The lawyer said that because of all the pressure, he felt very sad and upset, similar to feeling overwhelmed when you have too many homework assignments. But then, we found another puzzle piece. Bruce Ivins was so unhappy with all the worry and stress, he took his own life. His death was then confirmed as a suicide by a doctor who's specifically trained to know how people die, just like how your pediatrician knows specifically about growing children's health. This is a very serious and complicated puzzle, little friends. Not all puzzle pieces are easy or fun to look at, but they help tell the full story, just like these details we learned about Bruce Ivins.

The bad thing about this movie is that it seems to end so quickly. I could have kept watching for hours. Another downside is that I have been unsatisfied with everything Ashley Judd has done since. She is so perfect in this movie. This film is easily in my top ten favorites of all time.","completion":"The sentiment of this review is mostly positive. The person started with low expectations but ended up really liking the movie. They enjoyed the storyline, and the main character's journey. They also loved Ashley Judd's performance. The only negatives mentioned were that the movie felt too short, and that they have been unsatisfied with Ashley Judd's other work since this movie. Overall, they consider this film as one of their top ten favorites."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Question 1: How can Quora make money without any adds? Question 2: Does Quora make money, if yes then how? OPTIONS: 1). no. 2). yes. Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Yes, the answers to these two questions would be essentially the same since both are asking about Quora's monetization strategy. Quora, a popular question-and-answer platform, was launched in 2009 and for a long time, it didn't focus on monetizing its platform. However, it currently earns revenue through several methods. Does it make money without ads? Let's give a detailed explanation: 1) Advertising: Contrary to the assumption of the first question, one of the main ways Quora makes money is through ads displayed on its platform. It's their primary source of revenue. Businesses and Individuals pay to promote their products, services, or content to the active user base of Quora. The more users click on these ads, the more revenue Quora generates. So, even though users might seldom notice these ads, they exist and contribute significantly to Quora's income. 2) Quora Plus: This is a subscription service implemented by Quora, providing ad-free experience and additional features to its users. Those who subscribe to Quora Plus pay a monthly fee which also contributes to its revenue. 3) Partners Program: In the Quora Partner program, Quora pays individuals to ask questions. This program is invite-only, but it enables Quora to generate more interesting and engaging content to drive more activity on the platform. By doing so, they can attract more advertisers over time and hence increase their ad revenues. 4) Knowledge Market: Quora is testing a new feature that allows users to pay to have their questions answered quickly and accurately by experts on the site. If this feature launches successfully, Quora will get a cut from the transactions, which will also contribute to its income. It's worth noting that while Quora is taking steps to monetize, its primary focus remains on improving the platform and its overall user experience. The company may explore more revenue streams in the future but the focus will be on trying to make sure they align with the overall mission of the company, which is to share and increase the world's knowledge. The specific elements above are the ways in which Quora generates revenue as of now. In conclusion, while the platform does indeed generate revenue without \\"intrusive\\" ads, by offering a premium subscription service and through its partners program, ads still play a significant role in its monetization strategy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's widely accepted that not knowing your biological parents can be psychologically damaging. There have been documented cases of how not knowing who your biological parents can damage your sense of identity and heritage. Damian Adams, from Adelaide, Australia, was conceived using an anonymous sperm donation in the 1970s. Now Mr Adams is hoping to remove some of those psychologically harmful feelings he has felt since discovering he was conceived by a sperm donation. But rather than tracking down his biological father, something which he is legally forbidden from doing, Mr Adams hopes to address a less acknowledged hurdle. Damian, pictured (middle) with his mother and social father. The current practice for the birth certificate of donor conceived children is for the receiving couple to be listed as parents on the birth certificate. Mr Adams believes his birth certificate is inaccurate and that it is having a dehumanising effect on his life. ‘The current legal practice for donor conceived children is for the receiving couple, or commissioning couple, to be listed as parents on the birth certificate,’ Mr Adams told Daily Mail Australia. ‘This means my birth certificate is technically inaccurate. It creates a sense of deception in my life.’ If he is successful, Mr Adams will be the first Australian to have his birth certificate amended so his his father is listed an 'unknown'. 'I'm doing this because I want a factual record of my birth. I'm a firm believer in truth, it's how I was raised. I'm sure my (adopted) father would support me in this decision. I don't need a piece of paper to tell me how much I loved my father, or how much he loved me.' Mr Adams explained that donor-conceived children suffer from a lack of identity. 'We are are already denied access to their heritage and associated kinship. We are denied our medical history. Many animals have have a more accurate birth record than I do and I find that completely dehumanising.' Mr Adams said that his profession was instrumental in the pursuit. 'I work as a medical researcher. It means I am exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, which played a role in my decision to pursue this.' Mr Adams said that his profession of medical researcher has exposed to a vast range of social and scientific research into adoption and donor conception, in turn influencing his current pursuit. Mr Adams says he has received support from groups like donor conception Australia, as well as the full support of my friends and family. Mr Adams filed his his application with the Magistrates Court in Adelaide two weeks ago, but he says that this is something he had resolved to do several years ago. 'I have wanted to do this for a long time, but my family and professional life ended up prolonging the process.' If Mr Adams is successful, he only be second person in the world to have corrected their birth certificate in this way. In July this year, 26-year-old donor-conceived British woman Emma Cresswell became the first person to have achieved the feat, albeit after a six year legal battle. Mr Adams said he wasn't initially influenced by Mrs Creswells plight, but that it was vastly assuring. 'I had decided to do this before I heard about her, but it was very assuring to know that someone had achieved this. Somebody had to take the plunge. It was also opportune timing. If I do get to take this to a Magistrates courtroom, I will certainly be able to use her case to my advantage. The legal system in UK is largely similar to that in Australia.' Mr Adams believes there is no certainty in the outcome of his case to amend his birth certificate, however he believes the case of Emma Crosswell, the only person to have successfully achieved the same pursuit, will assist in his case. However in another sense it proved how difficult the process will be. 'The fact that it took six years, and that it has only ever happened once before-it means I have no certainty of a successful outcome.' Mr Adams says he has received a torrent of support for his cause. 'I've been approached by individuals, as well as support groups like donor conception Australia. There are people in a likewise position who hope to pursue the same path now. I also have the unbridled support of my friends and family, which I'm very grateful for.' Here is a summary of the highlights for this article:","completion":"Damian Adams, a donor-conceived individual from Adelaide, Australia, is seeking to amend his birth certificate to list his father as \\"unknown\\" instead of having the receiving couple listed as his parents.

Options: - snoring - talking - get cold - nothing - might dream A:","completion":"While snoring and talking can occur during sleep and getting a cold may potentially influence the quality of your sleep, the most suitable option to answer the question of what can happen in your mind while sleeping is \\"might dream.\\" Dreaming is a natural part of the sleep process that occurs during REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, which is a stage of sleep characterized by fast, desynchronized brain waves combined with rapid eye movements, muscle atonia, and increased respiration and heart rate. Dreams are most likely to be vivid and story-like during REM sleep, but they can also occur during other sleep stages, although often less vivid and without a clear narrative structure. There are various theories about why we dream, with some suggesting that dreams serve a biological function such as consolidating memories, processing emotions, and maintaining brain health. Others argue that dreams have a psychological function, helping us better understand ourselves, work through unresolved issues or fears, and maintain psychological well-being. Magnificent and bizarre, dreams can transport us to surreal landscapes, create intricate stories, or recreate fragments of our daily lives. They are sometimes vivid and emotionally charged and may involve the people, places, or situations with which we are familiar. While dreaming is a natural and essential part of sleep, there are also numerous sleep disorders that can affect the quality of our sleep, including sleepwalking (or somnambulism), which can involve complex behaviors while still asleep, and sleep talking (or somniloquy), the act of speaking during sleep without being consciously aware of it. These behaviors are typically associated with confusional arousals, which are a type of parasomnia that arises from the transition between sleep stages (especially between non-REM and REM sleep). In sum, while several things can happen during sleep, such as snoring, talking, and being influenced by various sleep-related factors like getting a cold, the most suitable option for answering the question about what can happen in your mind during sleep is dreaming. Dreaming is a normal, complex cognitive process that can reveal fascinating insights into our memories, emotions, and even our deepest desires and fears."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The axial skeleton is the part of the skeleton that consists of the bones of the head and trunk of a vertebrate. In the human skeleton, it consists of 80 bones and is composed of six parts; the skull bones, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone, the rib cage, sternum and the vertebral column. The axial skeleton together with the appendicular skeleton form the complete skeleton. Another definition of axial skeleton is the bones including the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum. Can we conclude that is the tibia part of the axial skeleton?","completion":"Based on the information given, the axial skeleton consists of the bones of the head and trunk of a vertebrate. Specifically in humans, it is composed of six parts: the skull bones, the ossicles of the middle ear, the hyoid bone, the rib cage, sternum, and the vertebral column. It also includes the vertebrae, sacrum, coccyx, ribs, and sternum according to another provided definition. The tibia, however, is not listed or included in any of these categories. The tibia is one of the two bones located in the lower leg, along with the fibula, and forms part of the knee and ankle joints. Given these facts, we can conclude that the tibia is not part of the axial skeleton, but rather part of the appendicular skeleton, which includes the limbs and limb girdles that are attached to the axial skeleton. This conclusion is made by analyzing the information given and noting that the tibia is not among the listed components of the axial skeleton. The distinction between the axial and appendicular skeleton is determined by the structure and location, with the axial encompassing the central core of the body (head and trunk) and the appendicular including the limbs and their attachment points. As the tibia falls under the category of a limb bone, it is therefore part of the appendicular, not axial, skeleton."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Translate to English","completion":"There are not any checkpoints and long queues at the ticket kiosk, and they should not take an hour just to make sure they are on time for their flight. The question refers to the absence of certain checkpoints and long lines at ticket kiosks at certain places, like airports or train stations. It emphasizes that it should not take individuals an hour just to ensure they are on time for their scheduled transportation, such as a flight. Such a situation can be inconvenient and cumbersome for travelers, adding to the stress of being at an airport or station to catch their transportation on time. To mitigate this issue, several strategies can be employed to improve the overall experience for travelers: 1. Efficient checkpoint systems: Implementing an efficient security checkpoint system can significantly reduce waiting times at airports or train stations. This can involve integrating modern technology, such as automated passport control kiosks and facial recognition systems that can accelerate the process and maintain security. 2. Online ticket purchasing options: Allowing travelers to purchase tickets online and giving them the possibility to use their smartphones or smart devices as tickets can save time for passengers and alleviate long queues at ticket counters. 3. Improved passenger flow management: Implementing smart passenger flow management systems can provide real-time data about passenger movement within the premises. This helps in identifying bottlenecks and taking necessary actions to resolve them and ensure a smooth flow of passengers. 4. Self-service kiosks: Self-service kiosks can facilitate passengers to check-in, print boarding passes, and complete other required pre-travel procedures without the need for assistance from a staff member. This can not only save time for passengers but also help in easing the workload on airport staff. 5. Designing waiting areas efficiently: To provide a comfortable waiting experience, waiting areas should be designed with sufficient seating and amenities. Charging stations, WiFi connectivity, and clear signage can make the waiting experience much more enjoyable for passengers. 6. Regular communication and updates: Keeping passengers informed about their transportation schedules, updates, gate changes, and potential delays can help them in planning their time accordingly. 7. Queue management technology: Installing digital queue management systems that display wait times and direct passengers to the appropriate checkpoints or kiosks can help in reducing confusion and streamlines the process. Taking such measures can result in a more enjoyable and hassle-free experience for travelers, ensuring that they can reach their transportation on time without spending an excessive amount of time waiting in lines and dealing with unnecessary stress."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the company that departed Florence second? ? Prior to the Willie Company departing Florence, the company met to debate the wisdom of such a late departure. Because the emigrants were unfamiliar with the trail and the climate, they deferred to the returning missionaries and church agents. One of the returning missionaries, Levi Savage, urged them to spend the winter in Nebraska. He argued that such a late departure with a company consisting of the elderly, women, and young children would lead to suffering, sickness, and even death. All of the other church elders argued that the trip should go forward, expressing optimism that the company would be protected by divine intervention. Some members of the company, perhaps as many as 100, decided to spend the winter in Florence or in Iowa, but the majority, about 404 in number (including Savage) continued the journey west. The Willie Company left Florence on August 17 and the Martin Company on August 27. Two ox-wagon trains, led by captains W.B. Hodgett and John A. Hunt, followed the Martin Company.Near Wood River, Nebraska, a herd of bison caused the Willie Company's cattle to stampede, and nearly 30 cattle were lost. Left without enough cattle to pull all of the wagons, each handcart was required to take on an additional 100 pounds (45 kg) of flour.In early September, Franklin D. Richards, returning from Europe where he had served as the church's mission president, passed the emigrant companies.

Please answer this question: when did political parties first form in the united states?","completion":"Political parties first began forming in the United States during the early years of the nation's inception, a period marked by debates over the scope of governmental power, the balance of authority between the federal and state governments, and the interpretation of the United States Constitution. The First Party System, as it is known historically, emerged in the decade following the ratification of the Constitution in 1789 and can be traced back to two primary factions: the Federalists and the Democratic-Republicans (originally known as the Anti-Federalists). These two groups had starkly different visions for the developing Republic, which fueled the formation of political parties in the nation. The Federalists, led by prominent figures such as Alexander Hamilton and John Adams, favored a strong central government and believed that it was essential for the newly-formed United States to establish a sound financial system, invest in infrastructure, and promote economic growth through trade and industry. In terms of foreign policy, Federalists generally supported maintaining close ties with Great Britain. They were largely comprised of merchants, bankers, lawyers, and other professionals based in urban centers, particularly in the north, and they found strong support among those who advocated for the ratification of the Constitution. On the other hand, the Democratic-Republicans, led by Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, were critical of the concentration of power in the central government and argued for a more limited federal government that would protect individual liberties. They emphasized the importance of agrarianism, with a preference for an economy based on agriculture and rural life, while also advocating for states' rights and strict constructionism in their interpretation of the Constitution. Democratic-Republicans tended to be more sympathetic towards revolutionary France and harbored a mistrust for Great Britain. The party's support base included farmers, small landowners, and residents of the newly-formed western territories, with support also concentrated in the southern states. The early years of political party formation were by no means a clear-cut or straightforward process, and the emergence of these factions took time to crystalize. The election of 1796 is commonly understood as the first instance in which these political parties played a major role in determining the outcome. The election saw John Adams, the Federalist candidate, narrowly defeat Thomas Jefferson, the Democratic-Republican candidate; however, a quirk in the process led to Jefferson becoming Adams' vice president. The official and organized establishment of the political parties can be traced to the period between 1796 and 1800. One of the key moments was the formation of the Democratic-Republican Societies, which were set up in 1793-1794 in response to the Federalists' policies and to coordinate political activities in support of the Democratic-Republican vision. By the end of the 1790s, the distinctions and organization of these political parties had taken shape, creating a foundation for the U.S. political party system as we know it today. It is important to note that the founding fathers, including President George Washington, initially frowned upon the formation of political parties, fearing that they would lead to factionalism, regionalism, and the undermining of the very fabric that held the young nation together. Yet, despite these concerns, the formation of political parties proved to be an inexorable development as the new nation sought to navigate its myriad internal and external challenges, laying the groundwork for the intricate and dynamic two-party system that endures in the United States to this day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This place floats like a butterfly and stings like a bee! This was my first REAL sushi experience because I always thought I was allergic so needless to say I was terrified! I was really nervous that I wasn't going to enjoy it and insult the chef by spitting it out or choking it down (You dirty birds). Quite the opposite happened. Not only was it completely tolerable, but I FUCKING LOVED IT!!! We did the AYCE and I don't recall everything I tried, but here are some of the highlights: Ahi Tuna Salad- This was the first thing I tried and was surprised by the delicate texture of the tuna combined with the crisp cucumber. Off to a good start. Rock n Roll- My favorite roll there probably because it had some sort of mayo on it and rice which are both on my cheat list usually. It was all wrapped in cucumber. If I wasn't dieting I would have ordered more. This is the roll I fantasize about the most. Spider Roll- Crunchy goodness. Nuff said. Teriyaki Chicken- Hands down the best I've had. It was so moist and not overwhelmingly sweet or greasy. What a perfect option for those non-sushi eaters(FYI- You are on the wrong team!) Lastly the sashimi.....OMG. The chef sent this over special for us because I was with one of us that eats here often. It was yellowtail simply drizzled with truffle oil and melted like butter on my tongue and that's when Blue Fin and I had a moment..... Up until then everyone at the table was watching the nonfish girl eat fish and I was trying to be graceful about the chewing, etc. . Not now. I wanted to eat it with my hands like Animal from the Muppets. Animal like sushi!!!! Being the lady I am, I contained the inner Animal, but it was still apparent to the table that this was my favorite. Probably the drooling noises gave me away.

After another pilot, Slick Goodlin, demands 150,000 to attempt to break the sound barrier, war hero Captain Chuck Yeager receives the chance to fly the X-1. While on a horseback ride with his wife Glennis, Yeager collides with a tree branch and breaks his ribs, which inhibits him from leaning over and locking the door to the X-1. Worried that he might not fly the mission, Yeager confides in friend and fellow pilot Jack Ridley.

For example, if it's known that she's walking towards a restaurant during typical dinner hours, this could add more weight to the claim. However, even with such additional information, it can't be guaranteed to be accurate, as people's plans and intentions can change, plans can be misleading or mistaken, and multiple factors can influence a person's actions.

In Sentence 1, Milenko Žujović is described as someone who \\"authored books on jurisprudence.\\" In Sentence 2, Milenko Žujović is described as someone who \\"wrote books on jurisprudence.\\" Step 3: Find the meaning of \\"authored\\" and \\"wrote.\\" Authored primarily means to have originated or created something, generally in the context of books, papers, or articles. Wrote means to have marked or formed words or symbols on a surface, usually with a pen, pencil, or another tool. However, it can also mean to compose a text, such as books, documents or articles. Step 4: Assess whether these words can be used interchangeably in the context. Both \\"authored\\" and \\"wrote\\" can be used to describe the action of creating or composing a book, which is the context of these sentences.

White bedding can be a little boring if you don't add other color or texture for visual interest. Interesting stitching patterns, such as white embroidery, can introduce some much-needed texture to your bed. Pick from: (i). You'll also add a touch of variety with the pillows and blankets. The regular colors include merino blue and red pillows, and white linens can create a striking contrast with the exact color of your headboard. (ii). For example, if you have a white blanket or comforter, pick one that has a stitched pattern in white. The pattern could be as simple as wavy lines, but it could be more complicated, too-anything from roses to stars or leaves. (iii). Solid color bedding is the best choice because it shows color and texture in the room without leaving bulk. Add a lamp on a shelf next to your bed to add texture. (iv). Don't feel like you have to opt for a constant patterned pattern or pattern. You can choose a white color of bedding you like or sit down and start making columns about how you intend to use your linens.","completion":"(iii). Solid color bedding is the best choice because it shows color and texture in the room without leaving bulk. Add a lamp on a shelf next to your bed to add texture. Once you have selected white bedding with interesting stitching patterns, as mentioned in the previous paragraph, you can further enhance the visual interest of your bedroom by incorporating solid color bedding. Introducing solid hues will tastefully complement the textured white bedding without seeming overwhelming or cluttered. These additional colors will help to enrich the overall appearance of your bed and surrounding decor by preventing the space from appearing bland or monotonous. To bring extra texture and balance to your bedroom, consider adding a lamp on a shelf or nightstand next to your bed. The lamp can be any texture or shape you prefer, such as a ceramic or metallic finish, with a patterned or textured lampshade. This accessory serves a practical purpose while also acting as a unifying element that connects your bedding, color scheme, and other decorative touches throughout the room. (iv). Don't feel like you have to opt for a constant patterned pattern or pattern. You can choose a white color of bedding you like or sit down and start making columns about how you intend to use your linens. Your bedding should reflect your personality and style preferences, so don't feel pressured to choose the perfect pattern or to adhere to any rules when decorating your bed. The most important aspect is that the bedding is visually appealing and makes you feel comfortable and relaxed when you enter your bedroom. When selecting your white bedding, consider making a list of how you plan to use your linens and what features are most important to you. This could include elements such as comfort, durability, softness, and ease of care. By focusing on your needs and preferences, you can select the ideal white bedding to complement your bedroom decor. In conclusion, enhancing your white bedding can be achieved by incorporating textured stitching patterns, adding solid color bedding, and placing a lamp on a shelf next to your bed. Remember to choose pieces that reflect your personal taste and consider how you intend to use your linens. By thoughtfully combining these elements, you can create a visually interesting and comfortable sleeping environment in your bedroom."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Der allgemeine Run der großen amerikanischen Studios auf computeranimierte Filme treibt mitunter seltsame Blüten. So schloss Traditionshaus Disney unlängst sämtliche Produktionslokalitäten für handgezeichnete Animation, um sich in Zukunft ganz und gar auf das ungleich prestigeträchtigere digitale Animieren zu konzentrieren. Aber handelt es sich dabei um einen \\"Schritt zurück nach vorn\\"? Aus der kleinen Fabel \\"Chicken Little\\" um ein überängstliches Hühnchen wurde ein Trickfilm. Shrek, Madagascar und Ko. haben es vorgemacht, Disney, ganz Mitläufer, zieht nach und fabriziert eine atemlose Komödie, vollgestopft mit schmissigen One-Linern, augenzwinkernden Anspielungen und viel, viel Action. Ganz auf Zeitgeist getrimmt feuert \\"Himmel und Huhn\\", so der unsäglich übersetzte Titel, ein wahres Stakkato von allem ab, was beim Publikum sowohl Lacher als auch Bezug zum Leben im eigenen Kulturkreis provozieren soll. Gerade dabei wird maßlos übertrieben, denn \\"Himmel und Huhn\\" rast von Szene zu Szene und verpackt leidlich ansprechende Storyfetzen in computerpolierten, audiovisuellen Overkill. Um all dies einigermaßen zu verdauen, braucht es die Aufmerksamkeitsspanne von überdrehten Sechsjährigen, die wohl auch das von Disney angepeilte Zielpublikum sind. Hühnchen Juniors Kampf um die Anerkennung seines Vaters verkommt zum bloßen Beiwerk in diesem eher kläglichen Versuch Disneys, zu beweisen, dass auf 3D-Filmen nicht unbedingt der Name Pixar prangen muss. Vielleicht sollte aber gerade der Name Pixar darauf prangen, denn im Gegensatz zu Disney scheinen die Storyschreiber des renommierten 3D-Studios schon lange begriffen zu haben, dass auch eine computeranimierte Geschichte erzählt werden muss. Disney dagegen haut sie dem Zuschauer als endlose Abfolge von hübsch gerenderten Bildern, hektischen Bewegungen und halsbrecherischen Kamerafahrten um die Ohren. Die deutsche Synchronisation trägt leider zum negativen Gesamtbild bei. Wer allen Ernstes die ewig stimmbrüchige Verona Feldbusch-Pooth und Stammel-Ass Boris Becker vor das Mikrofon zerrt, beweist, dass neben der Geschichte wohl auch eine angenehme Vertonung inhaltslosen bunten Bildern und großen Namen den Vortritt lassen muss.

I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot. Could you help me answer this question? If not, let me know by writing \\"Not answerable\\". Plot title: Good Night, and Good Luck. Movie plot: Set in 1953, during the early days of television broadcast journalism. Edward R. Murrow (David Strathairn) and his dedicated staff â headed by his co-producer Fred Friendly (George Clooney) and reporter Joseph Wershba (Robert Downey, Jr.) in the CBS newsroomâdefy corporate and sponsorship pressures, and discredit the tactics used by Joseph McCarthy during his crusade to root out Communist elements within the government. Murrow first defends Milo Radulovich, who is facing separation from the U.S. Air Force because of his sister's political leanings and because his father is subscribed to a Serbian newspaper. Murrow makes a show on McCarthy attacking him. A very public feud develops when McCarthy responds by accusing Murrow of being a communist. Murrow is accused of having been a member of the leftist union Industrial Workers of the World, which Murrow claimed was false. In this climate of fear and reprisal, the CBS crew carries on and their tenacity ultimately strikes a historic blow against McCarthy. Historical footage also shows the questioning of Annie Lee Moss, a Pentagon communication worker accused of being a communist based on her name appearing on a list seen by an FBI infiltrator of the American Communist Party. The film's subplots feature Joseph and Shirley Wershba, recently married staffers, having to hide their marriage to save their jobs at CBS as well as the suicide of Don Hollenbeck (Ray Wise) who had been accused in print of being a Communist. The film is framed by performance of the speech given by Murrow to the Radio and Television News Directors Association in 1958, in which Murrow harshly admonishes his audience not to squander the potential of television to inform and educate the public, so that it does not become only \\"wires and lights in a box\\".[2] My question: In what year is the movie set?

When I hit about 35 I started having trouble with weight. The strange thing was to me, it wasn’t that I was eating more then I used to, as a matter of fact I started eating less. When that didn’t help I barely ate at all. Still I couldn’t lose weight. What I didn’t know was we start to lose muscle mass every decade beginning in our thirties, and I was a ripe 35. Muscles use up more calories than fat, so less muscle means a slower metabolism and the need for fewer calories, and the pounds stack on easier. My second problem was my narcolepsy. When you wake up after a nights sleep there is a release of adrenaline which prompts body and mind into action and helps burn off calories. Narcolepsy causes me to sleep on and off during the day, and as explained by my doctor (so if I have this wrong about adrenaline it is my doctors fault lol) I am not getting that adrenaline release because my bodies clock doesn’t know if I am asleep or awake. He suggested in the morning to start exercising about 20 minutes to get that adrenaline rush, in the afternoon exercise about twenty minutes more for the same reason… Dieting and exercising brought those pounds back down. I will say it is much harder in the winter for me then in the summer. Summer time I am naturally active. I ride bikes with my husband, swim, garden, mow about an acre of lawn.

The decline of Constantinople – a main trading partner of Kievan Rus' – played a significant role in the decline of the Kievan Rus'. The trade route from the Varangians to the Greeks, along which the goods were moving from the Black Sea (mainly Byzantine) through eastern Europe to the Baltic, was a cornerstone of Kiev wealth and prosperity. Kiev was the main power and initiator in this relationship, once the Byzantine Empire fell into turmoil and the supplies became erratic, profits dried out, and Kiev lost its appeal.[citation needed] Who was not a major trading partner of Kievan Rus?

The cake was a more popular item on the menu than the shake, because the","completion":"cake offered a perfect balance of flavors, textures, and indulgence, which appealed to a wider range of customers and left them feeling more satisfied and content with their dining experience. First and foremost, the cake's flavors were expertly crafted to tantalize the taste buds of even the most discerning customer. Rich chocolate or moist vanilla layers were paired with the perfect accompaniment – whether it was a tangy fruit compote or delightfully creamy caramel – to create a harmonious medley that both contrasted and complemented the main flavor. This intricate dance of sweetness and acidity provided a taste experience that left diners craving more, thus ensuring the cake's higher popularity compared to the shake. In addition to the expertly balanced flavors, the texture of the cake played a significant role in its popularity. Each layer of the cake contributed a distinct element to its overall composition. Fluffy, moist sponge absorbed the juices of the filling, while firmer layers, such as a crunchy cookie base or a velvety ganache, added textural contrast. This satisfying interplay of textures kept customers engaged with each bite, ultimately making the cake a more gratifying choice compared to the shake, which tended to have a singular, uniform texture. Another factor contributing to the cake's appeal was its indulgent nature. While shakes might be tasty, they often lack the sense of luxury that can come from cutting into a beautifully crafted slice of cake. The visually stunning presentation of the cake, complete with intricate decorations and attention to detail, engaged diners before they even took a bite. Furthermore, cakes offer customers the opportunity to indulge in a combination of classic and innovative flavor profiles, while baked goods' longstanding cultural significance meant customers were more likely to associate cakes with special occasions and celebrations. Finally, the sense of satisfaction derived from the cake surpassed that of the shake. Cakes generally have a more substantial and well-rounded composition, making them a more filling and wholesome choice for dessert. A shake, in contrast, might be a refreshing and relatively lighter option, but its liquid nature means it is ultimately less satisfying from both a psychological and physiological standpoint. In conclusion, the cake's popularity on the menu over the shake stemmed from a variety of factors – its remarkable balance of flavors, satisfying textures, the sheer indulgence experienced when devouring it, and the overall sense of satisfaction that it provided customers. This convergence of elements guarantees that cakes continue to outshine shakes as a preferred dessert choice among diners at various establishments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Does root locus gives absolute stability of system or relative stability? Explain how? Why do we seek stability? Do those questions have the same meaning?","completion":"Root locus analysis is a graphical method used in control systems engineering to study the behavior and stability of systems in response to variations in system parameters, particularly the gain. It provides a clear visualization of how the poles of a given system move as a parameter, such as gain, is adjusted. The main aim of using root locus is to determine the stability of a system, but it should be noted that the method provides relative stability rather than absolute stability. Relative stability refers to the ability of a system to remain stable in response to small disturbances or parameter changes. In other words, a relatively stable system can withstand minor perturbations without losing its overall stability. Absolute stability, on the other hand, refers to the complete assurance that the system will remain stable under all circumstances and parameter variations. Absolute stability is a stronger notion than relative stability, but also a more demanding criterion to fulfill. Root locus analysis focuses primarily on relative stability. The reason for focusing on relative stability is the practical nature of real-world systems. It is often impossible or impractical to guarantee absolute stability for all conditions, especially when dealing with complex systems that can be affected by various unpredictable factors. Thus, engineers often seek to achieve reasonable stability margins so that the system can handle disturbances without experiencing instability. Also, it is important to remember that even a system with relative stability can be rendered unstable due to certain conditions and parameter variations, which highlights the importance of continuous monitoring and updating control strategies as necessary. Now, let's discuss why we seek stability in control systems engineering. Stability is an essential characteristic for many systems, as it ensures that the system maintains desired performance levels and remains safe to operate. When a system is stable, it is less vulnerable to oscillations, diverging responses, or any other undesirable behaviors that can eventually lead to failure or reduced performance. Stability is often a primary objective in control systems design due to its significance in assuring system dependability, efficiency, and safety. The two questions, \\"does root locus give absolute stability of a system?\\" and \\"does root locus give relative stability of a system?\\" are related but have distinct meanings. The first question is asking whether root locus analysis can guarantee absolute stability, which, as explained earlier, it cannot. Root locus analysis primarily aids in estimating the relative stability of a system. The second question is asking whether root locus analysis provides information about the relative stability of a system, to which the answer is yes, as the main objective of the root locus method is determining how system poles move as parameters change, providing insights into the system's relative stability."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ask a question about Josip Broz Tito.","completion":"Josip Broz Tito was the revolutionary leader and statesman who played a pivotal role in the founding of Yugoslavia and served as its Prime Minister and President from 1943 until his death in 1980. Based on his impact on the people of Yugoslavia and the broader European and global political landscape, the question arises: How did Tito's leadership strategies contribute to the creation and sustenance of the socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia during his tenure as the leader of the country? Tito's leadership strategies can be broadly categorized into three main domains: domestic politics, foreign policy, and economic planning. 1. Domestic politics: a. Unifying Yugoslavia: Tito managed to successfully unite the various ethnically and religiously diverse regions and peoples of the Balkans under the banner of a single socialist federation. By recognizing and addressing the cultural and historical differences between the constitutive republics, he was able to foster a sense of Yugoslav identity that formed the foundation of the new state. b. Establishing a socialist government: Tito successfully implemented a socialist system in the country, with the support of a strong and well-organized Communist Party. He instituted a system of decentralized decision-making authority, distributing power amongst the individual republics. This allowed for more local autonomy, which helped maintain stability within the country. c. Promoting \\"Brotherhood and Unity\\": This was Tito's signature policy strategy aimed at fostering solidarity among the diverse peoples of Yugoslavia. The policy sought to prevent ethnic tensions from escalating into full-blown conflict by promoting the idea that all Yugoslav citizens were equal, regardless of their individual ethnic backgrounds. This helped smooth tensions and prevent greater ethnic strife within the country during Tito's rule. 2. Foreign policy: a. Non-alignment: Tito spearheaded the Non-Aligned Movement during the Cold War era, together with other world leaders like Jawaharlal Nehru of India, Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt, and Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana. This policy allowed Yugoslavia to maintain its independence and autonomy during a time of great global ideological polarization by refusing to align completely with either the United States or the Soviet Union. b. Stand against Soviet control: Tito's independent stance came to the fore when he defied Joseph Stalin and the Soviet Union in the late 1940s and early 1950s. This led to the expulsion of Yugoslavia from the Communist Information Bureau (Cominform) in 1948. Tito's defiance of Soviet attempts to control Yugoslavia's political direction solidified the country's independence on the world stage. 3. Economic planning: a. Self-management system: Tito introduced a unique form of socialism in Yugoslavia through the system of workers' self-management. This economic model allowed workers to have a say in the management of their own factories, which was meant to bridge the gap between management and labor and encourage a more participatory form of socialism. It was also designed to increase innovation and efficiency in the Yugoslav economy. b. Market socialism: Tito's government gradually moved toward a more market-oriented form of socialism in the 1960s, which allowed for greater integration with the global economy. This helped Yugoslavia achieve relatively high levels of economic growth during Tito's rule, and the country enjoyed a relatively high standard of living compared to other Eastern European communist states at the time. In conclusion, Tito's leadership strategies were centered around unifying the diverse regions of Yugoslavia, establishing and maintaining a socialist government, and fostering a sense of shared identity among the country's citizens. His foreign policy initiatives allowed for greater autonomy and independence on the world stage, while his innovative economic planning led to increased prosperity in the country. Despite the eventual disintegration of Yugoslavia following his death, Tito's impact on the country and the wider region remains significant to this day."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It's a good thing he didn't go with \\"@andrew.\\" Drew Olanoff wants to benefit the LiveStrong charity because of the support the foundation has given him. Drew Olanoff, cancer-fighter and blogger, is auctioning off his enviable Twitter username \\"@drew\\" to benefit the LiveStrong foundation. Since Tuesday, its value has already been raised to 1 million, thanks to that other Drew -- last name Carey. \\"I thought we would find a Drew who would bid 10,000 on the last day and that was it,\\" Olanoff said. \\"I certainly didn't think Drew Carey would get wind of it.\\" Get wind he did. The Cleveland comedian raised the stakes on Saturday, first tweeting an initial bid of 25,000 only to quadruple it, offering up 100,000 if his Twitter followers totaled 100,000 by the auction's closing at midnight on November 9. Olanoff was taken back by Carey's generosity, whom he's never met nor spoken to, but it seems Carey wasn't done yet. In the middle of an interview yesterday with CBS (the corporation writing Carey's checks, as he's the host of the network's \\"The Price is Right\\"), he upped the ante from 100,000 to a cool 1 million if he gets the same amount of followers by midnight on December 31. Judging by how quickly the follower count increases every time his @DrewFromTV Twitter page is refreshed -- on Thursday evening, he was rapidly approaching 66,000 followers -- Carey is well on his way to doing so. Of course, if he doesn't reach a million followers, the donation will be prorated: If there are 500,000 followers when the clock strikes midnight, then 500,000 will be given to LiveStrong. It may seem like Carey's gotten himself into some sort of popularity game, but it's not about amassing millions of followers or the Twitter name, Olanoff said. \\"There are obviously going to be skeptics, but Drew Carey is new to Twitter. Celebrities can get followers; Ashton Kutcher has 3 million,\\" Olanoff told CNN. \\"What he's saying is, 'Follow me; you're worth a dollar, and it's going to LiveStrong.' \\" This isn't the first time Olanoff's stirred up the \\"Twitter-verse.\\" From the minute he was diagnosed with Hodgkin's disease in late May, he decided his cancer was of the social variety, and turned to Twitter to air his frustrations. \\"I'm a very public person, I'm a geek, and I've been on Twitter for years,\\" Olanoff said. \\"I realized this is serious, and I started to blame things on my cancer. I'm not a whiny person and I didn't want to get negative [so the site] it was a nice way for me to focus all of my anger and being upset and worrying. \\" With the help of a friend who's also suffered from Hodgkin's disease, Olanoff set up BlameDrewsCancer.com, where tweeters can blame his cancer for any and everything that's gone wrong, in 140 characters or less. Lance Armstrong, LiveStrong's founder, blamed a broken collarbone on it, while Alyssa Milano found Drew's cancer to be at fault for her inability to resist chocolate drizzled popcorn; she then tweeted an offer to help out Drew's cancer awareness campaign in whatever way she could. Famous or not, Olanoff found comfort in those tweets. \\"When I would go through my chemo treatments every two weeks, for me it felt like I had a huge support group, because when you're diagnosed with [cancer] you can feel alone,\\" he said. As a result, Olanoff has decided to keep blaming cancer even though signs are pointing towards improved health; his last chemo treatment is November 2. Until midnight on November 9, his 30th birthday, Olanoff's resolved to round up as many @DrewFromTV followers as he can, and maybe accept Carey's invitation to meet up when Olanoff's back in Los Angeles.

It is more than half of Russia and is 4,000 miles wide. Most of this area is a forest with animals and birds. In autumn, the forests in Siberia are full of mushrooms and berries . Many people like picking mushrooms, but that is not as simple as you might think. Old people who live in the villages know places where you can pick lots of mushrooms. Some mushrooms grow in colonies. If you find one, you only need to look around because nearby you'll find more of them. However, when picking mushrooms, it is important not to choose the wrong kind. You have to be careful because some mushrooms are poisonous even though they look good. The smell can help you choose them, because good mushrooms smell very good. Siberian people are very friendly and hospitable. If someone invites you home for dinner, you'll soon be full. You should try everything the host is having. The climate there depends on the territory. Some places have very comfortable climates with hot summers and cold winters. In my opinion, the best season is spring, when nature wakes up after a long winter. It is the time for blossoms and love. Birds come back from other warm countries. Trees become dressed in green. The sun becomes warm and the days are longer. The mood is wonderful and people smile a lot. It is an amazing time. In winter, you have opportunity for sports. The most popular sport in winter in Russia is cross-country skiing. During weekends, many people go into the country and ski. Noses freeze and cheeks hurt, but people continue to enjoy these times.

The larger of the two numbers is: Option A: 350 Option B: 250 Option C: 450 Option D: 500 Option E: 620 Student:","completion":"To solve this problem, we need to understand the concepts of Highest Common Factor (H.C.F.) and Least Common Multiple (L.C.M.). The H.C.F. of two numbers represents the largest number that can exactly divide both numbers, while the L.C.M. is the smallest number that can be completely divided by both numbers. We are given that the H.C.F. of the two numbers is 30. Let's denote the two numbers as x and y. From the information given, we can write two equations: Equation 1: H.C.F.(x, y) = 30 We are also given that the other two factors of the L.C.M. of the two numbers are 10 and 15. Since L.C.M. is the product of all the factors, we can write: Equation 2: L.C.M.(x, y) = 30 * 10 * 15 Now, there's a relationship between H.C.F. and L.C.M. of two numbers: H.C.F.(x, y) * L.C.M.(x, y) = x * y Using the equations 1 and 2, we plug in the values: 30 * (30 * 10 * 15) = x * y Now we need to find the values of x and y. Since we are looking for the larger of the two numbers, let's assume x > y. We can rewrite the equation as: 30 * (30 * 10 * 15) = x * (30 * a), where a is a positive integer representing the factor by which x is greater than the H.C.F. Simplifying and canceling the common factor 30 from both sides, we get: 10 * 15 = x * a 150 = x * a Considering that x must be a multiple of H.C.F. (which is 30), we can infer x belongs to {30, 60, 90, ..., 150}. We can test the multiples of 30, and see which one satisfies the equation 150 = x * a: 1. For x = 30, a = 150/30 = 5 2. For x = 60, a = 150/60 = 2.5 (not an integer) 3. For x = 90, a = 150/90 = 5/3 (not an integer) For x = 120 and x = 150, a will be less than 1, which doesn't make sense because x > y. Hence, the larger of the two numbers is x = 30 * 5 = 150. However, since 150 is not among the given options, there may be a mistake in the options provided."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Question: How many girls escape from the sorority house?

Marguerite \\"Peggy\\" Guggenheim (August 26, 1898 - December 23, 1979) was an American art collector, bohemian and socialite. Born to the wealthy New York City Guggenheim family, she was the daughter of Benjamin Guggenheim, who went down with the Titanic in 1912, and the niece of Solomon R. Guggenheim, who would establish the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation. Peggy Guggenheim created a noted art collection in Europe and America primarily between 1938 and 1946. She exhibited this collection as she built it and in 1949, settled in Venice, where she lived and exhibited her collection for the rest of her life. When Peggy Guggenheim realized that her gallery, although well received, had made a loss of PS600 in the first year, she decided to spend her money in a more practical way. A museum for contemporary arts was exactly the institution she could see herself supporting. Most certainly on her mind also were the adventures in New York City of her uncle, Solomon R. Guggenheim, who, with the help and encouragement of Hilla Rebay, had created the Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation two years earlier. The main aim of this foundation had been to collect and to further the production of abstract art, resulting in the opening of the Museum of Non-objective Painting (from 1952: The Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum) earlier in 1939 on East 54th Street in Manhattan. Peggy Guggenheim closed Guggenheim Jeune with a farewell party on 22 June 1939, at which colour portrait photographs by Gisele Freund were projected on the walls. She started making plans for a Museum of Modern Art in London together with the English art historian and art critic Herbert Read. She set aside 40,000 for the museum's running costs. However, these funds were soon overstretched with the organisers' ambitions. In August 1939, Peggy Guggenheim left for Paris to negotiate loans of artworks for the first exhibition. In her luggage was a list drawn up by Herbert Read for this occasion. Shortly after her departure the Second World War broke out, and the events following 1 September 1939 made her abandon the scheme, willingly or not. She then \\"decided now to buy paintings by all the painters who were on Herbert Read's list. Having plenty of time and all the museum's funds at my disposal, I put myself on a regime to buy one picture a day.\\" When finished, she had acquired ten Picassos, forty Ernsts, eight Miros, four Magrittes, three Man Rays, three Dalis, one Klee, one Wolfgang Paalen and one Chagall among others. In the meantime, she had also made new plans and in April 1940 had rented a large space in the Place Vendome as a new home for her museum. A few days before the Germans reached Paris, Peggy Guggenheim had to abandon her plans for a Paris museum, and fled to the south of France, from where, after months of safeguarding her collection and artist friends, she left Europe for New York in the summer of 1941. There, in the following year, she opened a new gallery which actually was in part a museum at 30 West 57th Street. It was called The Art of This Century Gallery. Three of the four galleries were dedicated to Cubist and Abstract art, Surrealism and Kinetic art, with only the fourth, the front room, being a commercial gallery. Peggy Guggenheim held important shows, such as the show for 31 Women artists, at the gallery as well. Her interest in new art was instrumental in advancing the careers of several important modern artists including the American painters Jackson Pollock and William Congdon, the Austrian surrealist Wolfgang Paalen, the sound poet Ada Verdun Howell and the German painter Max Ernst, whom she married in December 1941. She had assembled her collection in only seven years.

Interstate 29 has lots of twists and turns","completion":"From the given information, we can only deduce basic details about Interstate 29 (I-29). The information provided explains that I-29 runs from Kansas City, Missouri, up to the Canada–US border near Pembina, North Dakota, and connects with Manitoba Highway 75. It does not, however, provide specific details about the nature of the road, such as its twists and turns. In order to conclude whether or not Interstate 29 has lots of twists and turns, a closer look at the road itself and its geographical features is necessary. Interstate 29 stretches over approximately 750 miles (1,210 km) and primarily travels through the Midwestern United States. As an interstate highway, it generally follows a north-south direction and connects various cities, including Kansas City, Missouri; St. Joseph, Missouri; Omaha, Nebraska; Sioux City, Iowa; Sioux Falls, South Dakota; Fargo, North Dakota, and Grand Forks, North Dakota. This highway mainly traverses through rural areas, farmland, and prairie lands while avoiding the more rugged and varying terrains found in states further west, such as the Rocky Mountains. The surrounding topography affects the design of the road, as highways built through flatter regions typically have fewer twists and turns compared to those winding through mountainous areas. However, it is essential to note that the interstate system has been designed to maintain a high level of safety and efficiency in transportation. This means that even in potentially challenging geographic areas, engineers aim to create roads with smooth and gentle curves that avoid abrupt twists and turns. This design approach seeks to minimize the risk of accidents and maintain consistent traffic flow. In conclusion, based on the given information, it is not possible to definitively confirm whether Interstate 29 has many twists and turns. However, considering its geographical location and the design principles of interstate highways, it is reasonable to assume that I-29 follows a straightforward and relatively straight path, with gentle curves when necessary. To further ascertain the exact nature of the road's twists and turns, a more in-depth analysis of its route and topographical features would be required."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following context and answer the question. Context: U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday threatened tariffs on an additional 100 billion worth of Chinese goods, on top of the 50 billion in import taxes he already has proposed against Beijing. Though none of the tariffs have taken effect, it's the latest posturing in a trade dispute that some fear could escalate into a trade war. For decades, Trump has complained about China's trade practices. One of his main complaints is what he calls Beijing's theft of U.S. intellectual property. Last month, Trump cited IP theft as justification for his proposed tariffs on 50 billion in Chinese goods. China retaliated by threatening its own tariffs on the same amount of U.S. goods. Trump then escalated the dispute, saying he would consider tripling the amount of goods to which tariffs would be applied. China gains access to U.S. technology by employing several tactics, which many observers have said are unfair or illegal. Beijing has long required that U.S. businesses transfer technology to Chinese companies as a precondition of entering the Chinese market. For instance, if you are a U.S. carmaker who wants to sell automobiles to China, Beijing requires that you team up with a local Chinese company, or face steep tariffs on imported vehicles. In other cases, China requires U.S. companies to comply with localization requirements by storing sensitive data in the Chinese mainland. That increases the risk of intellectual property theft through means such as cyberattacks.It's difficult to quantify the value of technological knowledge. But according to an estimate last month by the U.S. trade representative, Chinese theft of American intellectual property costs between 225 billion and 600 billion every year. That rate is unsustainable, said top White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow. \\"We can't afford to give up our technology,\\" Kudlow said Friday. \\"When they steal our technology ... they're stealing the guts of our American future.\\" The Chinese government has always denied carrying out the cyberattacks that frequently...

Problem:Context: We determined whether milrinone, a phosphodiesterase III inhibitor, attenuates serotonin-induced (5-hydroxytryptamine [5HT]) pulmonary hypertension (PH) and bronchoconstriction. Dogs were anesthetized with pentobarbital (30 mg/kg + 2 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)). Bronchoconstriction and PH were elicited by 5HT (10 microg/kg + 1.0 mg. kg(-1). h(-1)). Pulmonary vascular resistance was used to assess PH. Bronchoconstriction was also assessed by changes in bronchial cross-sectional area obtained from our bronchoscopic method. At 30 min after 5HT infusion started, seven dogs were given milrinone: 0 (saline), 5, 50, 500, and 5000 microg/kg at 10-min intervals. The other 12 dogs were given milrinone 5000 microg/kg 30 min after 5HT infusion, and 5 min later were given propranolol 0.2 mg/kg (n = 6) or saline (n = 6) IV. The 5HT significantly increased percentage of pulmonary vascular resistance to 208% +/- 27% and decreased percentage of bronchial cross-sectional area to 52% +/- 5% of the basal. Milrinone significantly attenuated both PH and bronchoconstriction in a dose-dependent manner. However, -log 50% effective concentration (mean ED(50) in microg/kg) of milrinone for bronchoconstriction: 4.32 +/- 0.13 (47.6) was significantly smaller than that for PH: 3.84 +/- 0.29 (144.9) (P < 0.01). In addition, the spasmolytic effects of milrinone (5000 microg/kg) were not antagonized by propranolol, although this dose significantly increased plasma catecholamines. In conclusion, milrinone attenuates 5HT-induced PH and bronchoconstriction; however, this drug may be more sensitive to phosphodiesterase III in the airway smooth muscle than in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle. In addition, the relaxant effects could not be caused by beta-adrenoceptor activation because beta-blocker did not antagonize. Answer: We studied the effects of milrinone on serotonin-induced pulmonary hypertension and bronchoconstriction in dogs. Milrinone produces pulmonary vasodilation and bronchodilation, whose effects may not be caused by beta-adrenoceptor activation. In addition, this drug may be more sensitive to phosphodiesterase III in the airway smooth muscle than that in pulmonary vascular smooth muscle.

What is an undervalued stock? What are the best ways to find undervalued stocks?","completion":"No, the following two questions are not the same. Let's break down each question and understand the difference: 1. \\"What is an undervalued stock?\\" This question asks for a definition or explanation of what an undervalued stock is. An undervalued stock typically refers to a stock whose current market price is considered to be lower than its intrinsic value. This can happen for various reasons, such as market inefficiencies or investor sentiment. When an investment is undervalued, it can provide an opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a lower price before the market corrects itself and the price rises to reflect the stock's true value. 2. \\"What are the best ways to find undervalued stocks?\\" This question is asking for methods, strategies, or tips on how to identify or discover undervalued stocks in the stock market. It implies that you want to find stocks that are undervalued for potential investment opportunities. To find undervalued stocks, investors may use approaches like: a. Fundamental analysis - examining a company's financial statements, earnings growth, and industry trends to determine its intrinsic value. b. Technical analysis - utilizing historical price patterns and trading volume to identify undervalued stocks. c. Screening tools - using stock screeners to filter stocks based on specific criteria, such as low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios or high dividend yields. In summary, the first question seeks an understanding of what an undervalued stock is, while the second question aims for guidance on how to identify such stocks in the market.

To meet the family's extravagant debts, ground-floor rooms were turned into boutiques and cafe that attracted fashionable society, together with some shady hangers-on and intellectuals. Does it follow that \\"The boutiques and Cafe attracted the desired clientele.\\"?","completion":"Based on the given information, it is reasonable to assume that \\"The boutiques and Café attracted the desired clientele.\\" However, to provide a more detailed and long answer, it is essential to consider the context and factors that contribute to this conclusion. Firstly, the statement mentions that the family had extravagant debts, which implies that they were in severe financial distress. As a result, they resort to converting the ground-floor rooms into boutiques and a café. This decision suggests that these businesses were likely established as a means to generate income to repay those debts. Secondly, the phrase \\"fashionable society\\" indicates that the family targeted an audience belonging to the higher social strata, with a taste for luxury and refinement. This audience would typically have the financial means to afford the premium products and services offered in the boutiques and café. By catering to such customers, the family could potentially generate enough income to meet their financial obligations. Furthermore, the mention of \\"shady hangers-on and intellectuals\\" as part of the clientele also indicates that these establishments attracted a diverse range of people. Although not all of the visitors might have been the intended audience initially, their presence suggests that the boutiques and café have become popular or well-known within the community. This popularity would likely contribute to the success of these businesses and generate additional revenue. Moreover, the conversion of the rooms into commercial spaces suggests a strategic decision to draw customers. It is likely that the family carefully considered the location, layout, and design of the boutiques and café to maximize its appeal to the targeted clientele. The selection of available products and services within the establishments would have also been curated to cater specifically to the tastes and preferences of the desired customers. In conclusion, based on the information provided, it is reasonable to infer that \\"The boutiques and Café attracted the desired clientele.\\" However, the presence of additional visitors, such as \\"shady hangers-on and intellectuals,\\" implies that the establishments may have attracted a more diverse clientele than initially intended, potentially increasing the revenue generated from these businesses.

More on 1970s Nostalgia I’m obviously sympathetic to the main point of Peggy Orenstein’s column on the sexualization of pre-teens in this Sunday’s Times Magazine, but I think she’s fallen into the same nostalgia trap as Caitlin Flanagan: I find myself improbably nostalgic for the late 1970s, when I came of age. In many ways, it was a time when girls were less free than they are today: fewer of us competed on the sports field, raised our hands during math class or graduated from college. No one spoke the word “vagina,” whether in a monologue or not. And there was that Farrah flip to contend with. Yet in that oh-so-brief window between the advent of the pill and the fear of AIDS, when abortion was both legal and accessible to teenagers, there was — at least for some of us — a kind of Our Bodies, Ourselves optimism about sex. Young women felt an imperative, a political duty, to understand their desire and responses, to explore their own pleasure, to recognize sexuality as something rising from within. And young men — at least some of them — seemed eager to take the journey with us, to rewrite the rules of masculinity so they would prize mutuality over conquest. That notion now seems as quaint as a one-piece swimsuit on a 5-year-old … The question of teenage abortions aside, I’m not entirely immune to this kind of ’70s nostalgia myself. “Almost Famous” is one of my favorite movies, and Cameron Crowe’s portrait of a young rock journalist coming of age amid the revolution captures what I suspect Orenstein and (especially) Flanagan are pining for: A world where love and sex are viewed as avenues to transcendence, where experimentation takes place in a spirit of idealism rather than world-weariness, and where the previous generation’s authority (embodied by Frances McDormand’s wonderful mom) is simultaneously potent, sympathetic, liberal and benign. To the extent that this kind of nostalgia is at all defensible from a conservative perspective, I think James Poulos has the right take: I don’t think it’s really a milieu or a moment that our ’70s sex nostalgists are pining for. I think it’s something they would describe, if pressed, as a virtue: the virtue of moderate innocence, and of judicious moderation in passing from the extreme innocence of childhood to the extreme knowingness of adulthood. It’s not the modus vivendi of ’70s sexuality that’s worth praising … It’s the idea that a newly centered culture can manage to anchor itself outside an unreasonably artificial innocence on the one hand and outside an unreasonably artificial profanity on the other. As an aspirational goal for a post-sexual revolution culture, I’m all for anchoring our common life in this kind of “moderate innocence” — neither Anthony Comstock nor Lady Gaga, you might say, but somewhere in between. But I’m also for reckoning with historical reality. And it is crucial to acknowledge (as Poulos would but Flanagan and Orenstein might not) that “Almost Famous” was only a movie, that the actual milieu of the 1970s did not achieve anything remotely like this sort of anchoring — and that however admirable some of the more idealistic aspects of the sexual revolution may look when you contrast them with a culture where 9-year-olds bump and grind to Beyonce, the immediate real-world consequences of the idealistic ’70s were worse, in many ways, than the coarse and jaded equilibrium we’ve stumbled into since. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The text talks about the nostalgia some people have for the 1970s, especially in terms of sexual freedom and exploration. The author suggests that this nostalgia is for a time when love and sex were seen as ways to grow and learn, with a balance between childhood innocence and adult experiences.

While the essence of the questions is asking for information about safe hotel accommodations for unmarried couples, the context of each city differs significantly, thus they are not the same question. Mysore and Agra are two different cities in India, each with their unique cultural norms, legal circumstances, and accommodation options. Therefore, the safety and acceptability for unmarried couples booking hotels could vary by location. The question, therefore, would require different responses concerning Mysore and Agra. When looking for safe and hassle-free hotel accommodation for unmarried couples in Mysore, you could consider: 1. The Quorum Hotel: Known for its service and comfort, the Quorum hotel in Mysore respects privacy and does not engage in any moral policing. 2. Olive Residency: Another hotel that offers a comfortable stay for unmarried couples. All you need is valid ID proof. 3. Radisson Blu Plaza Hotel: Stylish and well-maintained, this hotel is part of an international chain known for its professional policies. Always ensure to check the hotel's policies towards unmarried couples before booking. For safe hotel accommodation for unmarried couples in Agra: 1. ITC Mughal, A Luxury Collection Resort & Spa: This luxurious hotel offers hassle-free accommodations for all guests, including unmarried couples. 2. Taj Hotel & Convention Centre: This is another safe and secure hotel that doesn't discriminate against unmarried couples. 3. DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel Agra: This hotel has a worldwide reputation for maintaining high standards of hospitality and discretion. Kindly remember to verify the hotel's couple-friendly policy before making a reservation. While the spirit of the queries is the same- asking for advice on secure, hassle-free hotel accommodation for unmarried couples- they pursue this within the contexts of two separate cities. Consequently, different results are required due to potentially varying considerations in regional culture, legality, and available options.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: Recycle newspaper and use in garden.","completion":"When it comes to recycling newspapers and using them in the garden, there are multiple solutions that can be helpful in achieving your goal. I will discuss two solutions, after which I'll provide a comparative analysis and recommend the better option. The first solution is to create a paper mulch or compost addition, and the second solution is to use newspapers as seedling pots or biodegradable planting. Solution 1: Paper Mulch or Compost Addition Mulching and composting are crucial to maintaining a healthy, sustainable garden. Newspapers can make an excellent addition to both mulches and compost as they are biodegradable and an abundant source of carbon. Here's how you can use them: 1. Mulching: Shred or tear the newspaper into smaller pieces (avoid using colored or glossy sections, as they may contain harmful chemicals) and spread them evenly around your plants. Make sure the layer is at least two inches thick to prevent weed growth, reduce soil evaporation, and maintain consistent soil temperature. Wet the newspaper lightly to help it decompose more quickly and minimize the risk of it being carried away by the wind. 2. Compost additive: Newspapers can be a valuable addition to your compost pile, as they contribute carbon-rich material, which is important for the composting process. Mix shredded newspapers with other organic waste (such as fruit and vegetable scraps, leaves, and grass clippings) in a 2:1 ratio of green to brown materials to maintain effective decomposition. Solution 2: Seedling Pots or Biodegradable Planting Using newspapers to create seedling pots or biodegradable pots for plants can be an innovative way to recycle newspapers and contribute to your garden's sustainability. Here's how you can do this: 1. Seedling pots: Cut out rectangular sections of a newspaper, fold them to form small cylinders, and press one end to close. Fill these pots with potting mix and plant your seeds. These pots can be placed in a tray and watered, allowing the paper to retain moisture, which benefits your seedlings. Once the seedlings have grown, you can directly plant the pot into the ground, as the newspaper will break down over time. 2. Biodegradable planting: Lay sheets of newspaper directly in the soil and cut slits where you want plants to grow. Plant seeds or seedlings into the slits. The newspaper will decompose over time, providing added nutrients to the soil and inhibiting weed growth. Comparative Analysis Both solutions have their advantages and can contribute to the health and sustainability of your garden. However, based on your goal, the better solution would be the first one: using newspapers as paper mulch or compost additions. Reasoning: Creating mulch or compost with newspapers helps to improve soil quality and promote nutrient-rich growth in your garden. Since newspapers are an excellent source of carbon, using them in these ways enables a more productive decomposition process and adds to the overall health of your garden. Furthermore, the addition of newspapers in mulch or compost directly contributes to weed suppression, moisture retention, and soil temperature regulation. This solution allows newspapers to have a more profound and lasting impact on your garden's ecosystem. On the other hand, while using newspapers for seedling pots or biodegradable planting is an innovative and eco-friendly idea, its long-term impact on overall soil quality, weed suppression, and moisture retention may not be as significant as the first option. In conclusion, recycling newspapers as part of a paper mulch or compost addition is a more effective solution for your garden's needs in the long run, as it contributes directly to maintaining a healthy soil composition and providing an environment that encourages sustainable plant growth."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Who does Lisa encounter in a store trying to purchase a dummy? Movie title: Lisa and the Devil Movie plot: Tourist Lisa Reiner (Elke Sommer) wanders away from her tour group in Toledo to go shopping inside a store, where she encounters a man named Leandro (Telly Savalas), who is purchasing a dummy and a carousel Lisa attempts to buy. Due to his resemblance to the portrait of the devil in a fresco she has just seen, Lisa flees, only to be confronted by a mustachioed gentlemen...who falls from a flight of stairs to his apparent death. When she fails to find back to the tour group, she takes refuge with a couple and their driver, who agrees to help Lisa get to her hotel. But their car breaks down in front of a crumbling mansion where Lisa discovers that Leandro works as the butler. The couple (a young woman and older man) persuade Leandro to let them stay while the driver (the young wife's lover) fixes the car. Lisa attempts to flee, but the countess' son Maximilian (Alessio Orano) stops Lisa and agrees to let the three stay over the objections of his mother, a blind Countess (Alida Valli). The obscure, mustachioed man continues to stalk Lisa as further mysteries unfold: the Countess and her son have a fourth guest in the mansion, a mysterious figure who is held prisoner inside a secret room. The Countess, Maximilian, Leandro, and the mustachioed man (revealed to be Carlos, the Countess' second husband) claim that Lisa is actually,\\"Elena,\\" Maximilian's long-lost girlfriend who was once frightened away by his jealous mother. Through a series of waking dreams, it is revealed that Elena was secretly sleeping with Carlos and that he was plotting to leave the jealous and reclusive Countess. After seeing Leandro preparing Carlos' body for burial juxtaposed with Carlos being alive, Lisa freaks out. Carlos attempts one last time to whisk Lisa away but Maximilian kills him. Lisa faints as Carlos' body morphs into the dummy Leandro purchased in the store. Leandro repairs the dummy (whose face has caved in, in the aftermath of the murder attempt). The driver is promptly killed by a mysterious figure after fixing the car.... A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Lisa and the Devil,\\" Lisa Reiner encounters a man named Leandro, played by Telly Savalas, in a store as he is trying to purchase a dummy.

Over the course of the narrative, it is unveiled that the mustachioed man is Carlos, the Countess' second husband, and that there is a twisted web of secrets and deception connecting all the individuals involved. Leandro, the butler, plays a pivotal role in the unfolding story – his connection to the dummy and his eerie resemblance to the devil further amplifying the film's atmosphere of the supernatural and suspense. In conclusion, the encounter between Lisa and Leandro in the store is a crucial moment in the movie \\"Lisa and the Devil,\\" as it establishes the initial connection between the characters and sets the stage for the suspenseful and mysterious events that follow.

Given the question: Given the following context: Boult was born in Chester, Cheshire, in North West England, the second child and only son of Cedric Randal Boult (1853–1950), and his wife Katharine Florence née Barman (d. 1927). Cedric Boult was a Justice of the Peace and a successful businessman connected with Liverpool shipping and the oil trade; Cedric and his family had \\"a Liberal Unitarian outlook on public affairs\\" with a history of philanthropy. When Boult was two years old the family moved to Blundellsands, where he was given a musical upbringing. From an early age he attended concerts in Liverpool, conducted mostly by Hans Richter. He was educated at Westminster School in London, where in his free time he attended concerts conducted by, among others, Sir Henry Wood, Claude Debussy, Arthur Nikisch, Fritz Steinbach, and Richard Strauss. His biographer, Michael Kennedy, writes, \\"Few schoolboys can have attended as many performances by great artists as Boult heard between 1901 and October 1908, when he went up to Christ Church, Oxford.\\" While still a schoolboy, Boult met the composer Edward Elgar through Frank Schuster, a family friend.At Christ Church college at Oxford, where he was an undergraduate from 1908 to 1912, Boult studied history but later switched to music, in which his mentor was the musical academic and conductor Hugh Allen. Among the musical friends he made at Oxford was Ralph Vaughan Williams, who became a lifelong friend. In 1909 Boult presented a paper to an Oxford musical group, the Oriana Society, entitled Some Notes on Performance, in which he laid down three precepts for an ideal performance: observance of the composer's wishes, clarity through emphasis on balance and structure, and the effect of music made without apparent effort. These guiding principles lasted throughout his career. He was president of the University Musical Club for the year 1910, but his interests were not wholly confined to music: he was a keen rower, stroking his college boat at Henley, and all his life he remained a member of the Leander Club. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person whose biography was Michael Kennedy?

Nelson banged loudy on the drum which really bothered Michael because","completion":"Nelson banged loudly on the drum which really bothered Michael because he was already under a tremendous amount of stress from both his personal and professional life, and the cacophony created by Nelson's incessant drumming only served to exacerbate this tension. Michael, a dedicated and hardworking individual, had been dealing with an ever-growing list of demands at his job, forcing him to work long hours and bringing work home. This often led to him feeling mentally and physically exhausted, which had subsequently taken a toll on his personal relationships. As a result, his relationship with his partner had grown strained over time, as they barely had any quality time together. The couple had been continuously arguing and were struggling to find a shared understanding. This wasn't the end of Michael's problems. His ailing parents needed his constant support and care, as both of their health conditions had significantly deteriorated in recent months. Michael was responsible for managing their medical appointments, medication, and supporting them emotionally as they navigated through illness and the effects of aging. The weight of the responsibility was a burden on Michael's shoulders, especially when coupled with his other obligations. Moreover, Michael had recently learned that his younger sister was planning to drop out of college, which had come as a surprise to him. He felt responsible for guiding her through this difficult decision and ensuring she was making the right choice for her future. Concerned, he had been trying to find time to help her explore her options and guide her towards a more stable path. In addition to all these stressors, Michael was also experiencing financial difficulties due to a series of unexpected expenses, including costly home repairs and medical bills for his parents. This created a constant state of anxiety as he worried about being able to provide for himself and his loved ones. So, when Nelson banged loudly on the drum, filling the air with relentless and disruptive noise, Michael couldn't help but feel a sense of frustration and annoyance. The drumming was not only an unwelcome distraction from the multitude of problems that occupied his thoughts but also a physical disruption to the already fragile peace he was trying to establish in his mind. The abrasive noise seemed to penetrate through the walls and reverberate inside his head, making it nearly impossible for him to focus on any of the tasks he needed to accomplish or to find even a moment of respite. In the end, Michael had to muster the courage to put his own mental wellbeing first and to communicate his feelings to Nelson. He approached his neighbor calmly and explained how the drumming was affecting him. Luckily, Nelson was understanding and empathetic, agreeing to limit his drumming to specific hours or to use practice pads to dampen the sound. This small act of consideration provided Michael with a valuable lesson in the importance of communication and how it can bring about positive change even in the most challenging situations. By addressing the issue directly and honestly, Michael was able to alleviate some of his stress, thereby making his overwhelming set of problems a little more bearable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Radar fire control meant they could hit targets from a much greater distance than the Japanese. The battleship Yamashiro, a cruiser and a destroyer were crippled by 16-inch (406 mm) shells; Yamashiro sank at 04:19. Only one of Nishimura's force of seven ships survived the engagement. At 04:25 Shima's force of two cruisers and eight destroyers reached the battle. Seeing Fusō and believing her to be the wrecks of two battleships, Shima ordered a retreat, ending the last battleship-vs-battleship action in history.

Choices: - digesting - being full - will not starve - survive - getting fat The rationale to choose \\"will not starve\\" as the answer is that: The answer to this question is:","completion":"\\"Will not starve\\" The rationale behind choosing \\"will not starve\\" as the answer is that: 1. The main goal of a poor person having food is to meet their basic need for nourishment and to prevent extreme hunger, which directly threatens their health and well-being. By consuming food, a poor person avoids starvation, ensuring that their body can properly function. 2. While \\"digesting\\" is a process that takes place after consuming food, it is not the primary goal of a poor person having food. It is a biological function that occurs regardless of one's socioeconomic status. 3. \\"Being full\\" could be a short-term outcome when a poor person eats food, but it might not be the main goal, considering that the person may not have consistent access to food. They are more focused on sustaining themselves over a longer period by avoiding starvation. 4. \\"Survive\\" is a broad term and covers many aspects of life beyond food consumption. While eating does contribute significantly to survival, choosing \\"will not starve\\" specifically addresses the primary objective of a poor person eating food. 5. \\"Getting fat\\" is typically not a goal for those experiencing poverty. The focus of a poor person having food is to maintain basic nourishment and avoid hunger, not to gain weight. In conclusion, the primary goal of a poor person having food is to avoid starvation, ensuring that they are able to maintain basic bodily functions and overall health."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q:Here's a question: To think for a long time you need to be able to? Here are possible answers to this question: - sit quietly - concentrate - know first - relax - drink I believe the correct choice is \\"concentrate\\", here's why: A:","completion":"The correct choice is indeed \\"concentrate,\\" and the reason behind that becomes quite clear when we delve into the process of thinking and understanding the cognitive skills required for effective long-term thinking. Thinking for a long time, or deep thinking, is a cognitive process that involves focusing on a specific topic, idea, or problem, extracting meaning, analyzing details, and developing insights. This process requires a higher level of attention and mental effort, which is why concentration is the most vital element. Here's a deeper explanation for each of the given potential answers: 1. Sit quietly: While sitting quietly can create a conducive environment for thinking and may help in focusing better, it is not a requirement for deep thinking. Some people can think effectively while walking, engaging in some physical activity, or even in a slightly noisy environment. Although a quiet environment can aid concentration, it is not the primary factor that enables long-term thinking. 2. Concentrate: Concentrating is the most crucial aspect of thinking for a long time. Concentration enables your brain to devote its cognitive resources to a specific task or idea and filter out distractions. This focused attention helps in improving thought processes, fostering creativity, and solving complex problems. Without concentration, engaging in deep thinking becomes extremely difficult. 3. Know first: Having prior knowledge about a subject can definitely help in improving the quality and depth of thinking. However, it is not mandatory for long-term thinking. Curiosity and a strong desire to learn can drive a person to think deeply about a topic, even if they don't know much about it at the beginning. 4. Relax: Although relaxation can help in easing stress and clearing the mind, it is not a primary requirement for long-term thinking. In fact, under certain conditions, people can think deeply even when they are under pressure or in a state of excitement. Deep thinking is more dependent on concentration and focus than on relaxation. 5. Drink: Consuming beverages, especially those containing caffeine, can have a stimulating effect on the brain and may help in boosting cognitive functions. However, it is not a prerequisite for thinking for a long time. Some individuals may not require any external stimulus to indulge in deep thinking, while for others, a drink may just be a personal preference and not a necessity. In conclusion, while other factors such as sitting quietly, having prior knowledge, relaxation, and drinking may assist or enhance the deep thinking process, concentration is the quintessential element that enables you to think for a long time. Concentration allows you to maintain focus, process information effectively, and develop meaningful insights on any given topic or problem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Shanks treats Marnie quite badly, telling her she will remain in the house until her sentence is up. He tells her to clean up some blood from the wall, and that she will have lots of time to think about what she did. Marnie argues with him, telling him that if the police had taken her crime reports seriously, her husband would still be alive today. The cynical Shanks leaves with indifference.Later that day, Marnie takes all of her husband's pictures, and belongings, and puts them in her basement, where the detector goes off. She then paints over the blood in the wall. She calls the power company about having her power restored, and they tell her they can't make it until Monday, so she has to light some candles.

The musical opened on Broadway on May 28, 1953 at the Majestic Theatre. Large advance sales guaranteed a considerable run; by the start of November, it had paid back its advance, and closed after 358 performances, paying a small profit to RCA. Thomas Hischak, in his The Rodgers and Hammerstein Encyclopedia, suggests that business fell off after the advance sales were exhausted \\"because audiences had come to expect more from a Rodgers and Hammerstein musical\\". According to Frederick W. Nolan in his book about the duo's works, \\"despite a 500,000 advance sale, despite a ten-month run (which, for anyone except Rodgers and Hammerstein, would have represented a major success), and despite an eventual profit in excess of 100,000, Me and Juliet has to be classed as a failure\\".The backstage drama portrayed in the musical was matched by actual difficulties among the cast. McCracken, who played Betty, was the wife of choreographer Bob Fosse and became pregnant during the run. Bill Hayes later wrote that she lost her baby through miscarriage about the same time she lost her husband to Gwen Verdon. The baby was in fact aborted, because the pregnancy would have endangered McCracken's health as a result of her diabetes. Hayes noted that in the fifteen months he played Larry, he did not recall ever having a conversation with Isabel Bigley, who was supposedly his love interest and wife: \\"I doubt that the audience ever believed we were deeply in love.\\" The show received no Tony Award nominations. During the run, Hammerstein followed his usual practice of visiting the theatre now and again to ensure that the performers were not taking liberties with his book. Upon his return, Hammerstein's secretary asked him how the show was going.

What is \\"What is the exchange rate for Australian to American money ?\\" asking about?","completion":"The question \\"What is the exchange rate for Australian to American money?\\" is asking about the conversion rate between the Australian Dollar (AUD) and the United States Dollar (USD). In the context of foreign exchange, it is essential to understand the value of one currency in terms of another to facilitate international transactions, trade, and travel. The exchange rate is a quantitative representation of the value of one country's currency compared to another country's currency. In this specific question, it is looking for the conversion factor used to determine how much of the United States Dollar one will receive in exchange for a given amount of the Australian Dollar or vice versa. The exchange rate between two currencies is not static; it fluctuates over time due to various factors that influence supply and demand. Some key factors include interest rates, inflation rates, political stability, and economic performance. Foreign exchange markets determine the exchange rate between different currencies and are usually influenced by activities from central banks, financial organizations, investors, and speculators. To find the current exchange rate for Australian Dollars to United States Dollars, one can refer to reliable financial websites, newspapers, or directly inquire at banks, currency exchange offices, and other financial institutions. In addition, there are numerous online tools and smartphone applications available that constantly update exchange rates, making it convenient for individuals to access this information in real-time. Understanding the exchange rate is crucial for businesses participating in global trade, individuals traveling or working abroad, and for investors seeking to take advantage of investment opportunities in foreign markets. It is essential to closely monitor exchange rates, as changes in currency values can have significant impacts on the overall costs of goods and services, profitability of investments, and economic welfare of a country and its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I taught in the traditional classroom, creating self portraits was something I had students do whether they were four or nine.

At least once during the year, likely toward the beginning, I would center a lesson around self portraits. In younger classes, there would be more than one. Creating a self portrait teaches students to be aware of themselves. Where is her head in relation to her body? Where are her feet in relation to her legs? It also teaches children spatial awareness. Where should he begin…with his feet or with his head? Where on the paper should his head be placed? How far down should his arms go? How can his whole body fit on a single piece of paper? A Lesson on Creating Self Portraits Whether you are in a classroom, or teaching a child at home, here is a simple lesson on creating self portraits geared toward young children, anywhere from age 2 through age 6. Keep in mind that their final product will show various levels of writing development, depending on what stage of writing they are in. (Basically, a two-year-old’s drawing should look very different than that of a five-year-old.) The teacher will need to model how to draw a self portrait. Gather the children around an easel or board and clip a paper to it. Narrate the process as you walk through the steps. “I am going to draw a picture of myself. I am going to start with my head.” Use your hands to show your actual head on yourself so students are aware of what you talking about.

This text is missing some spaces, please add them: Thehostrocksaresilicifiedmeta-sedimentswithquartz-chalcopyritestockworktypeveinletsanddisseminatedpyrite-chalcopyrite.","completion":"The host rocks are silicified meta-sediments with quartz-chalcopyrite stockwork type veinlets and disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite. In this context, the given information can be broken down and analyzed as follows: 1. The host rocks: These are the rocks in which mineral deposits or ore bodies are found. It is important to examine the host rocks in order to understand the geological setting and the formation processes of the mineral deposits. 2. Silicified meta-sediments: The host rocks in this case are described as silicified meta-sediments. Silicification is a process where rocks, particularly sedimentary rocks, are impregnated with silica (SiO2) that precipitates from fluids. This process strengthens the rock and makes it more resistant to erosion. Meta-sediments, on the other hand, are sedimentary rocks that have been subjected to metamorphism, i.e., they have experienced a change in their mineral assemblages, texture, or chemical composition due to changes in temperature, pressure, or introduction of new fluids. 3. Quartz-chalcopyrite stockwork type veinlets: This refers to a network of small, closely spaced, irregular veins or veinlets that are filled with quartz and chalcopyrite. Quartz is a common mineral, which is made up of silica (SiO2) and serves as a gangue mineral in many ores, whereas chalcopyrite is a copper iron sulfide mineral (CuFeS2) and is often found in association with other sulfide minerals. These veinlets can be an indication of a hydrothermal system circulating fluids through the host rocks, leading to the precipitation of minerals within the fractures. 4. Disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite: Disseminated mineralization refers to the presence of mineral grains scattered throughout the rock mass, rather than being confined to veins or other specific structures. In this case, pyrite (iron sulfide, FeS2) and chalcopyrite (copper iron sulfide, CuFeS2) are found disseminated within the host rocks. This is significant in terms of potential ore deposits, as it indicates that the host rock contains both copper and iron minerals that may be extractable through mining activities. In summary, the text describes a geological setting where the host rocks are silicified meta-sediments with a network of quartz-chalcopyrite stockwork type veinlets and disseminated pyrite-chalcopyrite mineralization. This information can help in understanding the formation and alteration processes of the host rocks, as well as assessing the potential for economic mineral deposits."},{"prompt":"The answer to the question: What does Jesus mention in the New Testament? is inside the article: Whales have also played a role in sacred texts such as the Bible. It mentions whales in Genesis 1:21, Job 7:12, and Ezekiel 32:2. The \\"leviathan\\" described at length in Job 41:1-34 is generally understood to refer to a whale.

This House believes Ethiopia is right to build a dam on the River Nile What argument could one make about this debate topic?","completion":"In the debate on whether Ethiopia is right to build a dam on the River Nile, there are several compelling arguments that can be made in support of Ethiopia's decision. 1. Sovereign Right to Utilize Natural Resources: One of the primary arguments is that Ethiopia, as a sovereign nation, has the right to harness, develop, and utilize its natural resources - in this case, the River Nile - to meet the needs of its people. International law recognizes each country's right to utilize transboundary water resources equitably and reasonably. If Ethiopia complies with these principles, they have a legitimate claim to develop the dam. 2. Socioeconomic Development: Ethiopia is a developing country with significant poverty and limited access to electricity. Building the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam (GERD) contributes to Ethiopia's socioeconomic development by helping meet the increasing demand for electricity. This, in turn, will increase access to education, healthcare, and other essential services that rely on a stable power supply. It can also boost industrialization, create jobs, and ultimately raise living standards, pulling many Ethiopians out of poverty. 3. Renewable Energy Production and Climate Change Mitigation: The GERD is a hydroelectric dam that will generate clean, renewable energy. By decreasing reliance on fossil fuels and reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the dam will contribute to global efforts to combat climate change. Additionally, investing in renewable energy aligns with many international goals and commitments, such as the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the Paris Agreement on climate change. 4. Regional Energy Integration: Besides benefiting Ethiopia, the dam has the potential to enhance regional energy integration in the broader East African region. The GERD will enable Ethiopia to export surplus electricity to neighboring countries, including Sudan and Egypt, helping reduce energy deficits and promoting regional cooperation. This can also lead to economic growth and stability in the region, potentially fostering stronger ties among these nations. 5. Water Management and Efficiency: The construction of the dam allows for improved water management and efficiency. By regulating the flow of the River Nile, the GERD can aid in preventing issues like flooding during heavy rain seasons while ensuring consistent water flow during dry seasons. This regulated water flow can benefit downstream countries such as Sudan and Egypt by providing them with more predictable water supply for agriculture, domestic consumption, and other purposes. However, it is essential to consider the concerns of downstream countries, especially Egypt, which relies heavily on the Nile for its water resources. To address these concerns, Ethiopia should engage in transparent and cooperative negotiations with surrounding nations, sharing information on the dam's potential impacts, and striving for mutually beneficial agreements. Studies on the Nile should be conducted regularly, and recommendations should be implemented to minimize any negative consequences of the dam on the environment and downstream countries. In conclusion, while it is crucial to acknowledge and address the concerns of riparian states, Ethiopia has the sovereign right to develop the Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam on the River Nile to foster its socioeconomic development and contribute to regional cooperation and global climate change mitigation efforts. Through a cooperative and transparent approach, it is possible to share the benefits of the dam equitably among the Nile Basin countries and ensure its successful implementation as a sustainable development project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Austin sold their shared in the market and the others saw that if they did not do the same they would lose all their money forever. Given the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\", is \\"Decide to keep their shares in the market\\" a valid answer?","completion":"No, the answer \\"Decide to keep their shares in the market\\" is not a valid response to the question \\"What will Others want to do next?\\". To understand why this response is not valid, let us analyze the situation provided: Austin sold their shares in the market, which has created a sense of panic or urgency among others, as they perceive the risk of losing all their money if they do not act similarly. This situation of fear is similar to a self-fulfilling prophecy in which the actions of one individual lead to others acting in the same way, often due to a lack of information or incomplete knowledge about the situation. Given the current situation, the most plausible response to the question would be that the others would also want to sell their shares to avoid potential financial loss. The fear of losing their money may compel them to follow Austin's actions, even if it might not be the best decision in the long run. This reaction is typical in a stock market as investors tend to mimic the actions of others, especially when facing situations that could result in significant financial loss. Therefore, it is highly likely that others would sell their shares instead of deciding to keep their shares in the market. The key factor here is the fear of loss, which drives market sentiments and may trigger herd behavior among investors. This behavior sees the majority of investors making decisions based on the actions of others rather than on rational analysis of market conditions and opportunities. Consequently, the answer \\"Decide to keep their shares in the market\\" does not accurately reflect the expected actions of the others given the provided context."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Some doctors suggest the brat diet, which stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. These foods can help you recover from nausea and vomiting because the foods are low in fiber and easy to digest and help replace nutrients lost. OPT: 1). Bananas are believed to help to lower cholesterol, too. Walnuts have lower cholesterol levels and lots of omega 3 fatty acids are also found in this breakfast.. 2). It is advised that you eat good nutrition because of the possibility of reintroducing those nutrients that can help your body absorb the nutrition. For example, there are yogurt products, fresh fruit, and fresh vegetables available to stock this diet.. 3). Choose a given diet in which to become nausea-free. Granola is an excellent source of whole-wheat pasta, rice, and oatmeal.. 4). The american academy of pediatrics (aafp) no longer recommends the brat diet for children. Instead, the aafp recommends that children resume eating a normal, well-balanced, age appropriate diet within 24 hours of getting sick..","completion":"In addition to the BRAT diet, there are other measures you can take to ensure a more comfortable and speedy recovery while dealing with nausea and vomiting. Firstly, hydration is crucial, as the body loses essential fluids and electrolytes during this period of illness. Consuming small sips of water, clear broth, or electrolyte-replacement drinks helps replenish these vital elements and prevents dehydration. Secondly, avoiding fatty, fried, spicy, and acidic foods, as well as sugary or caffeinated drinks, can help reduce the potential for further upsetting the stomach. Additionally, eating smaller, more frequent meals instead of large ones may also ease digestive stress. Ginger, an ancient remedy used to alleviate nausea, can be consumed in various forms such as ginger tea, ginger ale, or ginger candies. Similarly, peppermint tea can provide gentle relief from stomach discomfort. Adopting a relaxed eating environment is also essential, as stress may exacerbate feelings of nausea. Ensuring that you sit upright during meals, chew your food well, and avoid lying down soon after eating can ease the digestive process. Probiotics, often found in yogurt and fermented foods, are beneficial bacteria that promote digestion and maintain gut health. Integrating probiotics into your diet may help keep your digestive system balanced and functioning efficiently during illness. Lastly, seeking medical advice is crucial if persistent nausea and vomiting continue, as this could signal a more severe underlying issue. In some cases, doctors may prescribe anti-nausea medications to alleviate symptoms and help you regain your strength and appetite. While the BRAT diet may not be suitable for all individuals, particularly children, as the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests, it remains a gentle approach to nourishing the body during mild to moderate sickness. However, it is important to focus on an overall balanced and nutritious diet when possible and to pay attention to one's body's needs and preferences. Consulting a healthcare professional for personalized recommendations can further ensure a smooth and effective recovery from any nausea-inducing illness."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Answer the following question: Information: - An electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using electrical energy stored in rechargeable batteries or another energy storage device. Electric motors give electric cars instant torque, creating strong and smooth acceleration. They are also around three times as efficient as cars with an internal combustion engine. The first practical electric cars were produced in the 1880s. Electric cars were popular in the late 19th century and early 20th century, until advances in internal combustion engines, electric starters in particular, and mass production of cheaper gasoline vehicles led to a decline in the use of electric drive vehicles. The energy crises of the 1970s and 1980s brought a short-lived interest in electric cars; although those cars did not reach the mass marketing stage, as became the case in the 21st century. - Alfa Romeo Automobiles S.p.A. is an Italian car manufacturer, founded as A.L.F.A.

The traffic slowed and stopped on the ramp as it bottlenecked further into the city, and my head turned to examine the sign and the blocked view of the cityscape and land beyond. Past it was another billboard, with the name of a casino as its only text, filled with collaged images of money, plush rooms, and dancers. A quarter mile further brought me to an advertisement for business management solutions. Another few hundred yards and I was urged to try the new sandwich at the new sandwich place. The sun set and the signs stayed bright as automatic light switched on. The city grew dark and the hills beyond feebled out, existing only in our minds and finally not even there. All that remained were the well-lit and shiny reminders that lawyers were standing by to take my case to court, and that somebody's air conditioners would outlast somebody else's. I had an idea.

The Grand Prix des Frontières was a motor race held at a street circuit in Chimay, Belgium. The race was created by Jules Buisseret, who was also responsible for the circuit's existence. The first event was held in 1929 and was discontinued after the 1972 event for safety reasons. Can we draw the following conclusion? Buisseret not only created a Grand Prix but also the track itself.","completion":"Yes, we can draw the conclusion that Jules Buisseret not only created the Grand Prix des Frontières but also the street circuit in Chimay, Belgium, where the race was held. Jules Buisseret, a local politician, had a passion for motor racing and was instrumental in bringing the sport to the region. He was known for his strong involvement in the local community, and his vision for promoting Chimay as a site for motorsport events led to the creation of the street circuit. The circuit was comprised of public roads surrounding the small town of Chimay, with its layout evolving over the years in response to various technical and safety requirements. The track was considered both challenging for drivers and thrilling for spectators, with elements such as fast straights, sharp corners, and sweeping turns. From its inception in 1929, the Grand Prix des Frontières rapidly gained recognition among racing enthusiasts as well as professional drivers. It hosted multiple categories of races, ranging from sports cars and touring cars to motorcycles. The race attracted numerous well-known figures from the motorsport world, including iconic figures such as Juan Manuel Fangio and Stirling Moss. Over time, however, concerns about the safety of street circuits became more prevalent. These concerns were exacerbated by a number of tragic accidents at the Chimay circuit, culminating in the hosting of its last racing event in 1972. Changes in regulations and safety standards, coupled with the inherent dangers associated with racing on public roads, ultimately led to the discontinuation of the Grand Prix des Frontières. Despite its eventual end, the legacy of the Grand Prix des Frontières and the street circuit that Jules Buisseret helped create is remembered today as a fascinating chapter in the history of Belgian motorsport. This illustrates Buisseret's lasting impact not only in bringing motorsport to Chimay but also in shaping the very foundation upon which it was built: the challenging and historic street circuit."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lisa Marie Simpson is a fictional character in the animated television series The Simpsons. She is the middle child and most intelligent of the Simpson family. Voiced by Yeardley Smith, Lisa was born as a character in The Tracey Ullman Show short \\"Good Night\\" on April 19, 1987. Cartoonist Matt Groening created and designed her while waiting to meet James L. Brooks. The Simpsons uses a floating timeline in which the characters do not have physical ages; as such, Lisa is always depicted as 7-8 years old. The show itself is perpetually set in the year of broadcast (except for occasional flashbacks and flashforwards). In several episodes, events have been linked to specific time periods, although this timeline has been contradicted in subsequent episodes. Lisa's year of birth is given in \\"Lisa's First Word\\" (season 4, 1992) as 1984, during the Summer Olympics. The episode \\"That '90s Show\\" (season 19, 2008), however, contradicts much of the established backstory; for example, it presents Homer and Marge as being childless in the late 1990s. Lisa is a lover of music, with jazz as her favorite genre. She enjoys and excels at playing the saxophone and became friends with jazz musician Bleeding Gums Murphy, whom she regards as an idol. Murphy helps pull Lisa out of her depression in \\"Moaning Lisa\\" (season 1, 1990). She is later deeply saddened by Murphy's death in \\"'Round Springfield\\" (season 6, 1995). Lisa has been friendly with several boys, including Ralph Wiggum in \\"I Love Lisa\\" (season 4, 1993), Nelson Muntz in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\" (season 8, 1996) and Colin in The Simpsons Movie (2007). Bart's best friend Milhouse Van Houten has a crush on her, but despite dropping unsubtle hints about his feelings, he has been unsuccessful in winning her affection. Lisa is the most intellectual member of the Simpson family (she has an IQ of 159), and many episodes of the series focus on her fighting for various causes. Lisa is often the focus of episodes with \\"a real moral or philosophical point\\", which according to former writer David S. Cohen is because \\"you really buy her as caring about it.\\" Lisa's political convictions are generally liberal and she often contests other's views. She is a vegetarian, feminist, environmentalist and a supporter of gay rights and the Free Tibet movement. In a special Christmas message for the UK in 2004 Lisa showed her support for Cornish nationalism, even speaking the Cornish language to get her message across. While supportive of the general ideals of the Christian church in which she was raised, Lisa became a practicing Buddhist in the episode \\"She of Little Faith\\" (season 13, 2001) after she learned about the Noble Eightfold Path. An \\"End Apartheid Now\\" poster can be seen on her bedroom door during earlier seasons. does she have friends?","completion":"Yes, Lisa Simpson does have friends. Throughout the series, she has made several friends, some of whom are mentioned in the passage above. Some of her notable friendships include: 1.

Nelson Muntz - Lisa forms a connection with Nelson in \\"Lisa's Date with Density\\" (season 8, 1996). 3. Colin - Lisa becomes friends with Colin in The Simpsons Movie (2007). 4.

Betty was dressed more nicely than Monica was because OPTIONS: -Betty was going on a date. -Monica was going on a date.","completion":"Betty was dressed more nicely than Monica was because Betty was going on a date. This sentence describes a comparison between the way Betty and Monica are dressed, and it implies that the reason for the difference in their attire is based on their respective plans for the evening. In this case, the sentence indicates that Betty has a date, which is likely the cause for her being dressed more nicely than Monica. This choice in wording also suggests that Betty put in more effort into looking presentable and attractive for her date, compared to Monica. Going on a date is often seen as an opportunity for people to dress up and impress their potential romantic partner. This may involve wearing more stylish or attractive clothing, spending time on personal grooming, and putting more effort into their appearance than they might for less formal occasions. Dating can be an essential way for individuals to get to know each other, cultivate deeper connections, and explore possibilities of a romantic relationship. On the other hand, Monica may not be going on a date or engaging in any activities that would require her to dress up. Her attire could be more casual or less formal than Betty's, and her plans for the evening might be entirely different from Betty's. This could include staying in, going out with friends, or participating in an event that doesn't necessitate dressing up. The sentence sets up a contrast between Betty and Monica, emphasizing that Betty's better dressing is due to her having a date while Monica does not. This could be interpreted as evidence of differing priorities or social schedules in the lives of these two individuals. The sentence might also spark further inquiry into their respective evenings, why Betty has a date, and what Monica is doing instead, thereby suggesting a potential subplot or additional context for a larger narrative involving these characters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It depends completely on the context in which it's being used to determine a positive or negative sentiment. \\"Sleekness\\" generally signifies polish, smoothness, or a minimalist aesthetic. It describes attributes such as clean lines, shiny surfaces, simplicity, elegance, or efficiency. It's a term often employed to describe design, appearance or functionality in areas such as technology, fashion, architecture, and cars, among others. If used in a positive context, \\"sleekness\\" could reflect appreciation for the design, see instances below: 1. \\"The sleekness of the new smartphone model is astounding.\\" 2. \\"I love the sleekness of my new dress; it fits perfectly.\\" In the above examples, the term \\"sleekness\\" is used to express admiration and satisfaction, therefore, it carries a positive sentiment. However, it could be negative if it's used in a context that indicates a level of dissatisfaction or criticism, see scenarios below: 1. \\"While I appreciate the sleekness of the design, I find it too minimal and lacking character.\\" 2. \\"The sleekness of the car doesn't make up for its inefficiency.\\" Here, \\"sleekness\\" is mentioned along with certain detractions, making the sentiment negative. In conclusion, the sentiment of the term \\"sleekness\\" greatly depends on the context in which it's used.

His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) One of Hunter's first films for Warners was The Sea Chase (1955), supporting John Wayne and Lana Turner. It was a big hit, but Hunter's part was relatively small. Rushes were seen by William Wellman, who cast Hunter to play the younger brother of Robert Mitchum in Track of the Cat (1955). It was a solid hit and Hunter began to get more notice. His breakthrough role came when he was cast as the young Marine Danny in 1955's World War II drama Battle Cry. His character has an affair with an older woman, but ends up marrying the girl next door. It was based on a bestseller by Leon Uris and became Warner Bros largest grossing film of that year, cementing Hunter's position as one of Hollywood's top young romantic leads. In September 1955 the tabloid magazine Confidential reported Hunter's 1950 arrest for disorderly conduct. The innuendo-laced article, and a second one focusing on Rory Calhoun's prison record, were the result of a deal Henry Willson had brokered with the scandal rag in exchange for not revealing his more prominent client Rock Hudson's sexual orientation to the public. Not only did this have no negative effect on Hunter's career, a few months later he was named Most Promising New Personality in a nationwide poll sponsored by the Council of Motion Picture Organizations. In 1956, he received 62,000 Valentines. Hunter, James Dean and Natalie Wood were the last of the actors placed under exclusive studio contract to Warner Bros. Warners decided to promote him to star status, teaming him with Natalie Wood in two back-to-back films, a Western, The Burning Hills (1956), directed by Heisler, and The Girl He Left Behind (1956), a service comedy. These films also proved to be hits with audiences and Warners planned a third teaming of Hunter and Wood. Hunter rejected the third picture, thus ending Warner's attempt to make Tab and Natalie the William Powell and Myrna Loy of the 1950s. Hunter was Warner Bros.' most popular male star from 1955-1959.

Deep within the Earth, temperatures can get hot enough to create magma. As magma cools, crystals grow, forming an igneous rock. The crystals grow larger if the magma cools slowly, as it does if it remains deep within the Earth. If the magma cools quickly, the crystals will be very small. When crystals form from magma it is called crystallization . Q: What is it called when crystals form from magma? A: A:","completion":"When crystals form from magma, the process is called crystallization. This occurs as magma cools and its constituent components begin to solidify. The rate of magma cooling plays a significant role in determining the size of the crystals that form. If the magma cools slowly, typically when it remains deep within the Earth, the crystals have more time to grow and thus become larger. Conversely, if the magma cools rapidly, such as when it reaches the Earth's surface during a volcanic eruption, the resulting crystals will be smaller. This process of cooling and crystallization ultimately leads to the formation of igneous rocks, which showcase the various crystal sizes based on their cooling history."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here, we will explore five potential situations: 1. Exercising or jogging: Since the man is in a warm-up suit, there is a high possibility that he is engaging in some physical activity. The most logical next event in this scenario would be for the man to either stretch or begin exercising, such as jogging around a track or park. 2. Participating in a sports event: If the context is centered around a sports event, it would be reasonable to assume that the man in the grey warm-up suit is an athlete or a coach. In this case, his next logical action could involve participating in the event, such as starting a race or strategizing with his team before the game. 3. Training at a gym: Another plausible scenario for someone wearing a warm-up suit is going to the gym for a workout session. The most logical next event here would be for the man to engage in his exercise routine, such as lifting weights, participating in a fitness class, or utilizing the gym equipment. 4. Cooling down after exercise: Since wearing a warm-up suit indicates that the man might have been exercising, it is also possible that he is currently engaged in a cool down period. In this case, the most logical next event would involve stretching muscles, drinking water, and gradually reducing his heart rate. 5. Leaving for home or another destination: Lastly, if the man in the warm-up suit has completed his physical activity and feels satisfied with his workout or event, the most logical next event would be for him to change back into regular clothing, gather his belongings, and head towards his intended destination, such as home, work, or a social gathering.

Question: Information: - The Nordic combined events have been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since 1924. The first competition involved 18 km cross-country skiing, followed by ski jumping. Whoever earned the most points from both competitions won the event. At the 1952 Winter Olympics, the ski jumping was held first, followed by 18 km cross-country skiing. The cross-country skiing portion was reduced to 15 km at the 1956 Winter Olympics. The ski jumping styles would change over the years as well, from the Kongsberger technique after World War I to the Daescher technique in the 1950s to the current V-style from 1985 onwards. The cross-country skiing technique would switch from classical to freestyle for all competitions beginning in 1985, but the biggest change would occur at the 1988 Winter Olympics in the scoring with the Gundersen method, meaning the 15 km cross country portion would go from an interval start race to a pursuit race, so that whoever crossed the finish line first won the event. The team event with a 3 x 10 km cross country relay started at the 1988 Winter Olympics, changing to the current 4 x 5 km cross-country relay at the 1998 Winter Olympics. The 7.5 km sprint event was added at the 2002 Winter Olympics. Nordic combined remains a men's only event as of the 2010 Winter Olympics. For the 2010 Winter Games, the 15 km Individual Gundersen which consisted of 2 jumps from the normal hill followed by 15 km cross country will be replaced by a 10 km individual normal hill event which will consist of one jump from the individual normal hill following by 10 km of cross country using the Gundersen system while the 7.5 km sprint will be replaced by the 10 km individual large hill event. - Geir Andersen ( born February 12 , 1964 ) is a Norwegian nordic combined skier who competed from 1983 to 1989 . He won three medals at the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships with one gold ( 1984 : 3 x 10 km team ) and two silvers ( 1985 : 15 km individual , 3 x 10 km team ) . Andersen also finished 10th in the individual event at the 1984 Winter Olympics in Sarajevo . He had six individual victories in his career from 1984 to 1985 . - Nordic combined is a winter sport in which athletes compete in cross-country skiing and ski jumping. Nordic combined at the Winter Olympics and the FIS Nordic Combined World Cup are ongoing. - The FIS Nordic Combined World Cup is a Nordic combined competition organized yearly by FIS, representing the highest level in international competition for this sport. It was first arranged for the 1983/84 season. Team event was first time held in 1999/00 season. The FIS race director is a Norwegian ex ski jumper and ex world record holder Lasse Ottesen. - A winter sport or winter activity is a recreational activity or sport which is played during cold weather months. Most such sports are variations of skiing, ice skating and sledding. Traditionally such sports were only played in cold areas during winter, but artificial snow and artificial ice allow more flexibility. Artificial ice can be used to provide ice rinks for ice skating, ice hockey and bandy in a milder climate. - The FIS Nordic World Ski Championships have been held in various numbers and types of events since 1925 for men and since 1954 for women. Championship events include nordic skiing's three disciplines: cross-country skiing, ski jumping, and nordic combined (the latter being a combination sport consisting of both cross-country and ski jumping). From 1924 to 1939, the World Championships were held every year, including the Winter Olympics. After World War II, the World Championships were held every four years from 1950 to 1982. Since 1985, the World Championships have been held in odd-numbered years. - Nordic skiing pertains to skiing disciplines that use equipment where the toe of the ski boot is fixed to the binding in a manner that allows the heel to rise off the ski, unlike Alpine skiing, where the boot is attached to the ski from toe to heel. Recreational disciplines include cross-country skiing and Telemark skiing. - Ski jumping is a form of Nordic skiing in which athletes descend a specially constructed takeoff ramp (known as the \\"inrun\\"), jump from the end of it (the \\"table\\") with as much power as they can generate, and \\"fly\\" as far as possible down a steeply sloped hill. Points are awarded for distance and style by five judges, with competition sanctioned by the International Ski Federation (FIS). To enable the athletes (who are known as \\"ski jumpers\\") to effectively glide such long distances and land safely, the skis they use are considerably wider and longer than their cross-country and alpine skiing counterparts. Ski jumping is predominantly a winter sport and has been part of the Winter Olympic Games since its inception in 1924 for men and since 2014 for women. Since 1954 it is possible to ski jump in summer on artificial surfaces made from plastic. Along with cross-country skiing, ski jumping is one of two sports which form the Nordic combined discipline. Holmenkollbakken in Oslo is the holy place of this sport, which is most popular in Austria, Germany, Finland, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia.

It comprises the eastern half of the island of Timor; the nearby islands of Atauro and Jaco; and Oecusse, an exclave on the northwestern side of the island surrounded by Indonesian West Timor. The country's size is about 15,410 km (5,400 sq mi). - Bushrangers were originally escaped convicts in the early years of the British settlement of Australia who had the survival skills necessary to use the Australian bush as a refuge to hide from the authorities. By the 1820s, the term \\"bushranger\\" had evolved to refer to those who abandoned social rights and privileges to take up \\"robbery under arms\\" as a way of life, using the bush as their base. Bushranging thrived during the gold rush years of the 1850s and 1860s when the likes of Ben Hall, Frank Gardiner and John Gilbert led notorious gangs in the country districts of New South Wales. These \\"Wild Colonial Boys\\", mostly Australian-born sons of convicts, were roughly analogous to British \\"highwaymen\\" and outlaws of the American Old West, and their crimes typically included robbing small-town banks and coach services. In other infamous cases, such as that of Dan Morgan, the Clarke brothers, and Australia's best-known bushranger, Ned Kelly, numerous policemen were murdered. The number of bushrangers declined due to better policing and improvements in rail transport and communication technology, such as telegraphy. Kelly's capture and execution in 1880 effectively represented the end of the bushranging era. - Vanuatu (or ; Bislama ), officially the Republic of Vanuatu (Bislama: \\"Ripablik blong Vanuatu\\"), is a Pacific island nation located in the South Pacific Ocean.

These techniques are meant to provide basic necessities for human life which include water, food, and shelter. The skills also support proper knowledge and interactions with animals and plants to promote the sustaining of life over a period of time. Survival skills are often basic ideas and abilities that ancients invented and used themselves for thousands of years. Outdoor activities such as hiking, backpacking, horseback riding, fishing, and hunting all require basic wilderness survival skills, especially in handling emergency situations. Bushcraft and primitive living are most often self-implemented, but require many of the same skills. - A gold rush is a new discovery of gold that brings an onrush of miners seeking their fortune. Major gold rushes took place in the 19th century in Australia, New Zealand, Brazil, Canada, South Africa and the United States, while smaller gold rushes took place elsewhere. - Telegraphy (from Greek: \\"têle\\", \\"at a distance\\" and \\"gráphein\\", \\"to write\\") is the long-distance transmission of textual or symbolic (as opposed to verbal or audio) messages without the physical exchange of an object bearing the message.

On Christmas Eve 1852 , when under the alias of Thomas Smith , he and fellow bushranger William Robert Roberts were arrested at a brothel in Corio Street , Geelong , and eventually faced Judge Redmond Barry at the Geelong Circuit Court on 3 February 1853 on three counts of robbery . Barry sentenced both men to twelve , ten and ten years on each count , respectively -- in Melville 's case to be served consecutively . Although employed in chains on the roads of Victoria by the time of the Melbourne Private Escort Robbery of 20 July 1853 , Captain Melville 's name has become associated with it over the years because of the coincidence of one of the Escort robbers , George Melville , using the same surname as his alias . In 1854 he was one of a party of prisoners based on the prison hulk Success in Port Phillip Bay who attempted to seize and escape in a boat , during which a warder was killed . Sentenced to death but reprieved , he was then sent to Old Melbourne Gaol , where he was found hanged in his cell on 10 August 1857 . - Solomon Islands is a sovereign country consisting of six major islands and over 900 smaller islands in Oceania lying to the east of Papua New Guinea and northwest of Vanuatu and covering a land area of .

New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area.

Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - The Victorian gold rush was a period in the history of Victoria, Australia approximately between 1851 and the late 1860s. - Brothers Thomas (c. 1840 25 June 1867) and John Clarke (c. 1846 25 June 1867) were Australian bushrangers from the Braidwood district of New South Wales. They were responsible for a series of high-profile robberies and murders which led to the embedding of the \\"Felons' Apprehension Act (1866)\\", a law that introduced the concept of outlawry and authorised citizens to kill bushrangers on sight. Active in the southern goldfields from 1865, Thomas, John, their brother James and several other relations were responsible for a reported 36 hold-ups and the deaths of five policemenfour of them bounty hunters looking to bring them in. Some modern-day writers have described the Clarkes as the most bloodthirsty bushrangers of all.

Question 2: What would happen if Donald Trump died right now? Pick from: [+] no; [+] yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"The answers to these two questions are not necessarily the same, as they involve different circumstances and potential consequences. Question 1: What would happen if Donald Trump drops out of the race right now? If Donald Trump were to drop out of the race right now, the Republican Party would scramble to find a replacement candidate. Depending on when the drop-out occurs, the Republican National Committee (RNC) would have to follow specific rules and processes to select a new nominee. The RNC could either choose a nominee itself, or it could hold a convention wherein party delegates would choose the nominee. Potential consequences of this situation are numerous. For one, it could create a chaotic and fractured GOP. The party would face significant challenges in rallying its base behind the new nominee, and there would likely be divisions within the party about whom to support. Furthermore, the change in candidates could lead to an increased advantage for the Democratic candidate, due to the potential for a lack of organization and focus within the Republican campaign. Another possible outcome is that some Trump supporters may be disillusioned by his decision to drop out and either abstain from voting or vote for another candidate. This could impact not only the presidential race but down-ballot races for the House and Senate as well. Conversely, if the replacement candidate is well-liked and can quickly unite the party, it's possible that the GOP could still have a competitive election. Question 2: What would happen if Donald Trump died right now? In the event of the death of a presidential candidate, several things would occur. Like in the case of a candidate dropping out, the RNC would follow established party rules to select a new nominee. The process would be similar, either involving the RNC choosing a replacement candidate or holding a convention for party delegates to vote on a new nominee. However, the grief and shock resulting from the death of the candidate might have slightly different political consequences than if the candidate willingly chose to drop out. While it would still be a challenge to unify the party and rally voters behind a new candidate, the shared grief may bring the party together in a more unified way to support the replacement nominee. The circumstances of the candidate's death could be a rallying point for the Republican Party, potentially gaining sympathy votes and boosting the morale of the party. In summary, while some similarities exist between the two situations, such as the need for the RNC to select a new nominee and the challenge of rallying the party, the answers to these questions are not the same. The context of the situation and the potential consequences for the Republican Party and the election would differ between a candidate voluntarily dropping out and a candidate passing away."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. I eat a lot of baguettes, and although I enjoy most, it takes a lot to make me crave one nowadays. It has to be really well made and a cut above the rest. I can honestly say I had one of the best baguettes EVER from Dolce Vita. A sly one on Dalry Road, it looks fairly simple but subtly elegant on the outside, with the owners not feeling the need to have any brash, over the top signage. Inside, it looks clean, fresh and minimalist without being cold. There are a few delicious cakes and doughnuts in the window, but nothing too excessive. That's what makes Dolce Vita so excellent - it's a breath of fresh air. Keeping their menu broad but fairly simple, they serve up the nicest, soft baguettes with absolutely divine deli fillings. With varieties from cheese to mixed peppers, they combine different tastes so there's something in here for everyone. I went for the salami with cheese and peppers - it was amazing and SO cheap. What's more, the staff were down to earth, chatty and friendly while also being very professional. The girl serving me was so attentive but very laid back, so I felt relaxed while waiting for my lunch. I'd had a rough couple of days but she was really kind, and cheered me up by looking after me for the time I was in the shop. The food was unbelievably cheap for the quality of the bread and fillings. They were delicious, as was the pink doughnut covered in hundreds and thousands!

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Please answer a question about the following article about Insect: Paleoptera and Neoptera are the winged orders of insects differentiated by the presence of hardened body parts called sclerites, and in the Neoptera, muscles that allow their wings to fold flatly over the abdomen. Neoptera can further be divided into incomplete metamorphosis-based (Polyneoptera and Paraneoptera) and complete metamorphosis-based groups. It has proved difficult to clarify the relationships between the orders in Polyneoptera because of constant new findings calling for revision of the taxa. For example, the Paraneoptera have turned out to be more closely related to the Endopterygota than to the rest of the Exopterygota. The recent molecular finding that the traditional louse orders Mallophaga and Anoplura are derived from within Psocoptera has led to the new taxon Psocodea. Phasmatodea and Embiidina have been suggested to form the Eukinolabia. Mantodea, Blattodea, and Isoptera are thought to form a monophyletic group termed Dictyoptera. Neoptera can be divided into what kind of \\"based\\" group?","completion":"Neoptera can be divided into two kinds of \\"based\\" groups.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Q:My first memory of cooking was with my grandmother, Rosemary, in Sydney. She taught me how to make scrambled eggs on her electric stovetop, the kind with the coiled heating elements, in her small, linoleum-lined kitchen with cupboards that stuck a little when they closed. She was not an exceptional cook — I can remember plenty of bland and overcooked vegetables and custard made with powder to pour into pre-bought pie cases with tinned pineapple, her specialty — but she worked hard to put a balanced, home-cooked meal on the table three times a day, every day. The eldest of eight children, she dropped out of school during the Depression to help her single mother look after her siblings and work as a seamstress at David Jones. When the Second World War broke out and she was engaged to my grandfather, Aubrey, she started working on war-torn planes (“sometimes looking as if a steam roller has gone over them,” she said) as a sheet metal worker, putting them back together, when many of the men who used to do this work were off fighting the war. She said it was just like dressmaking, only using different materials. She had a twinkle in her eye and a distinct laugh that can really only be described as a cackle. She was a strong, incredibly smart woman with a fighter spirit who led her female co-workers out on the airport tarmac one day on a strike to earn equal wages to men. I am so proud that her story is taught as part of the Australian primary school curriculum. Her dream was to have a home with that electric stove.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Generate a short movie review that has \\"(i).\\" sentiment (Options: (i). negative; (ii). positive;).","completion":"(i). Negative Sentiment Title: The Confused Grandeur The Confused Grandeur is a film that disappoints on several levels, leaving the viewer feeling unfulfilled and struggling to get through the entire runtime. Right from the inception of the film, it fails to capture any significant attention, as the storyline consistently lurches from one futile attempt at entertainment to the next. The plot itself borders on the absurd, as it lacks depth and imagination in its conception. While it attempts to weave together elements of suspense, romance, and action, the result is a quagmire of clichéd sequences that fall short of evoking any genuine emotional response. The characters are unremarkable and one-dimensional, with their predictable actions only serving to disengage the audience even further. Numerous subplots are introduced haphazardly, and their relevance to the overarching theme remains unclear. The Confused Grandeur often veers off its intended course and ultimately leaves these subplots unresolved, suggesting a lack of proper planning in the scriptwriting phase. Moreover, the dialogues are cramped and hollow, with the characters relentlessly spouting trite and formulaic phrases that only add to the overall monotony. The acting performances leave much to be desired, as none of the cast members seem to have fully immersed themselves in their respective roles. The palpable disinterest displayed by the actors contributes to the unconvincing character portrayals, while the lack of chemistry between the leads undermines the romantic subplot altogether. Additionally, the action sequences fail to excite, as they primarily consist of poorly choreographed fight scenes and hasty, clumsily-executed stunts. Furthermore, the technical aspects of The Confused Grandeur merely accentuate its deficiencies. The editing is choppy, with excessive use of jump cuts, and the cinematography is uninspired, rarely venturing beyond standard shot compositions. The soundtrack, too, is lackluster, employing generic stock music that neither serves to emphasize key moments nor encapsulates the purported grandeur that the film's title suggests. In conclusion, The Confused Grandeur is a monumental letdown that wastes both the viewer's time and the untapped potential of its budget. Its principal flaw is that it seemingly does not know what kind of film it wants to be, trying to appeal to various tastes while practically satisfying none. As the film's end credits roll, the audience is left with a sense of relief that the ordeal has concluded, rather than any lingering impact or thought-provoking message."},{"prompt":"Read the following context and answer the question. Context: Thanks for the A2A Josh: Tough one to reduce to just a single incident but I’ll try. I grew up in North Central Indiana, about 50 miles south of South Bend. It was common to have frequent snow accumulation in the winter and blustery, freezing temps. It seems like this was particularly true during my childhood in the 70’s and 80’s. My family was blue collar through and through. We lived in the heartland in a town of just a few hundred with a sawmill and an on again off again gas station as our only two businesses. My dad worked in a factory for roughly 45 years. He apparently started that job right out of high school. My mom was an incredibly hard worker and Still is to this day. She did factory work, restaurant management and everything in between. It was this Protestant work ethic that led to one of the frequent tasks that my brother and I had to do which was not fun but ultimately was a very good deed. As I said, winters were often snowy and harsh. So my mom would make my brother and me shovel driveways and sidewalks for a couple of elderly residents. We did this of course, after we did our own driveway. Some people had motorized snowblowers but we did not. Standard snow shovels were our tools. I remember us whining about the chore, wishing we could just play in the snow or get out of it altogether. I don’t remember being overly conscious of the relief this provided for our elderly neighbors. I just remember that Mom would be disappointed if we didn’t do a good job. Later in life I would have great appreciation for the things required of me by my parents. Factory work and summer farm jobs helped us learn the value of hard work and would set us on a road to appreciation of future job opportunities that were less taxing. I still remember hating shoveling snow. But I’m forever grateful that I did it. Question: Why did the author's mother make him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly? Answer: Answer:","completion":"The author's mother made him shovel the snow from the homes of the elderly because it was a good deed that provided relief for their elderly neighbors who might have difficulty doing it themselves, and it also instilled in the author and his brother the values of hard work and helping others."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Output:","completion":"What are diseases caused by choices people make in their daily lives?"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Many sites host videos but keep in mind that all of them take a percentage of what you make. Therefore, it's a good idea to shop around and find the best deal overall. Don't be fooled by the phrase \\"make up to X amount,\\" as that just tells you what the top earners are making. Instead, look at what percentage they take from your overall tips. It's also smart to look at reviews of each site. You may find that some sites are considered better because they offer better traffic or less restrictive rules. Sites can take anywhere from 20% to 70% of the profits. Before deciding on a site, take a look at how its tipping system works. Many sites work on a token system, where customers buy tokens and then spend them on live webcam videos like yours. However, typically these systems aren't 1-to-1 with any currency, meaning 1 token doesn't equal 1 USD or whatever currency you're using. It's a good idea to figure out the tipping system so you know what you're making when the tokens roll in. You can start out with just your computer or phone's camera and basic home lighting. However, the better quality you have, the more likely you are to draw customers. Think about your background and what you want your customers to see when you go live. For instance, if you want to set a romantic mood, try softly lighting up your face and then having candles in the background. A screen name can help set your brand. For instance, choose a fun and cutesy nickname if that's how you plan to act on camera. If you're more into music or art, you may want to focus on that. In the end, though, the most important thing is it must be unique. You may not want to use your real first name when setting up a screen name. While webcamming is generally safe, using any real information can give bad guys tips on how to find you offline and things like blackmailing and doxing can happen if you're not careful. If you're going to be on the internet, you must come to terms with the fact that people you know may see you. However, to make it easier on you, some sites allow you to block access from certain countries, so you're less likely to be seen by someone you know. That way, you can block access to the state you live in or the country. Many customers are looking for particular things. You can use physical descriptions, such as \\"curvy,\\" \\"thick,\\" and/or \\"busty.\\" You can also add words that describe what you'd like to do on your channel, such as \\"flirting,\\" \\"playing music,\\" and/or \\"eating.\\" Try to come up with a brand and stick with it. For instance, maybe you want to focus on playing artsy music most of the time with a little bit of sexual fantasy on the side. Focus on words that would draw users to your channel, such as \\"guitar,\\" \\"acoustic,\\" or \\"playing naked.\\" While tips are the main way you'll make money, you can also be rewarded in other ways, such as when customers buy items off your wishlist and send them to you. You can put anything you want on your wishlist, set it to public, and then post it on your profile. Make sure to keep your address private when creating the list. Also, it's a good idea to set up a PO box to help keep your own address anonymous. Summary:","completion":"To become a successful webcam model, consider the following steps: 1. Research different video hosting sites, taking into account the percentage they take from your earnings and the site's reputation for traffic and rules. 2.

It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of United States, such as folk music (especially Appalachian folk music), and blues music. Blues modes have been used extensively throughout its recorded history. Country music often consists of ballads and dance tunes with generally simple forms and harmonies accompanied by mostly string instruments such as banjos, electric and acoustic guitars, dobros and fiddles as well as harmonicas. According to Lindsey Starnes, the term \\"country music\\" gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term \\"hillbilly music\\"; it came to encompass Western music, which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term \\"country music\\" is used today to describe many styles and subgenres. The origins of country music are the folk music of working-class Americans, who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional English ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities. In 2009 country music was the most listened to rush hour radio genre during the evening commute, and second most popular in the morning commute in the United States. - \\"Something About a Woman\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American country music artist Jake Owen.

The villagers are nationalist and exclusionary, taunting Michael (John Mills) (the mute village idiot) and British soldiers stationed at a nearby army base. They are resentful of Rosy Ryan (Sarah Miles), the spoilt daughter of the local publican Tom Ryan (Leo McKern), who himself is an informer for the British army hoping to keep the peace in the village. In public, Ryan pretends to be a staunch nationalist; in an early scene, he strongly supports the recently suppressed Easter Rising, referring to the rebels as \\"our boys\\".Rosy is bored with her humdrum village life and fantasizes about the outside world much to the chagrin of the local priest, Father Hugh Collins (Trevor Howard), an old, sharp-witted and highly influential person who knows all that goes on in the village. Rosy is in love with the local schoolmaster, Charles Shaughnessy (Robert Mitchum), a widower older than herself. She imagines that Shaughnessy will be able to add excitement to her life because he is educated and listens to classical music. He tries to convince her they are not a good match and suggests she leave the village and see the world. The two ultimately marry, but Rosy quickly becomes discontented with her marriage. She is looking for passion beyond just love in her relationship.Major Randolph Doryan (Christopher Jones) arrives to take command of the local army base.

The next contract, negotiated to start from the 1997–98 season, rose to £670 million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024 billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001 to 2002 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320 million from the sale of its international rights for the three-year period from 2004 to 2005 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Skys monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six packages of matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid £1.7 billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3 pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6 million, a 63 per cent increase on the £105 million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT Group have agreed to jointly pay £84.3 million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10 pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625 million, nearly double the previous contract.

Write a title for this article: Before he got to repealing ObamaCare, before he got to dumping Common Core, before he got to abolishing the IRS, Ted Cruz talked about Jesus. In kicking off his presidential campaign Monday at Liberty University, Cruz began with his father, a Cuban immigrant who washed dishes in Texas for 50 cents an hour, who drank too much along with his wife, who left home when Ted was 3 but came back because “God transformed his heart … Were it not for the transformative love of Jesus Christ, I would have been raised by a single mom.” That introduction, part of a passionate speech delivered without notes in Lynchburg, Va., helps explain why many in the mainstream media don’t quite know what to make of the Texas senator — or view him as a fringe figure. On the “Today” show, Kelly O’Donnell said “he’s 44, only been on the national scene a couple of years.” MSNBC’s Jonathan Alter, while not counting him out, also said “he’s only been in the Senate for two years.” Perhaps they had forgotten that Barack Obama was 45 and had spent just two years in the Senate when he kicked off his presidential candidacy? Cruz is a hero to the Tea Party right, and his speech hit many of its themes: against same-sex marriage, protecting the right to bear arms, reclaiming the Constitution. But the very things that make him popular could, in the media’s telling, be campaign obstacles. Here’s how CBS News put it: “Cruz's down-the-line appeal to the GOP base may prove to be his calling card in the primary battle to come, but it's also led him to pick fights with the party brass that could ultimately undermine his candidacy. His ability to raise money, secure endorsements, and build the kind of infrastructure necessary to win a national primary may be hampered by his lack of support among the establishment. And his ideological rigidity has sown doubts among some Republicans about how competitive Cruz would be in a general election.” In the two-minute NBC report, there were sound bites of Cruz reading “Green Eggs and Ham” (from his 21-hour filibuster that preceded the government shutdown) and warning “the world is on fire” (prompting a question from a 3-year-old girl). I wrote last week that the many in the MSM went way overboard in using that incident to portray Cruz as a frightening figure, despite the fact that the girl’s mother said she wasn’t scared at all. Look at how the Huffington Post frames its setup piece for the Cruz kickoff: “Much of the rest of the country (including Republican leaders in Congress) viewed Cruz as a vaguely scary renegade, and the GOP establishment’s official grumpy grandpa, Sen. John McCain (Ariz.), dismissed him as a ‘wacko bird.’ \\"But the Young Americans for Liberty loved his loathing of the party elders, and his determination to shove a stick between the spokes of the System … “Uncorked anger doesn’t usually win presidential nominations, let alone presidencies. People want hope and uplift in the White House and not just expressions of outrage. The president is the person who is supposed to make things work. To some, the 44-year-old Cruz gives off a vaguely scary aura of cheerful menace.” Uncorked anger. Cheerful menace. You might get the impression that HuffPost just doesn’t like the guy. And this happens to reflect the line of the Democratic Party, which in an email calls Cruz, in bold letters, “really, really scary.” Politico also emphasizes the theme that Cruz ticks people off: “His own colleagues in Washington have frequently been disdainful of Cruz since he helped instigate the 2013 government shutdown. And his hardline views and uncompromising style have disqualified him even in the eyes of more conservative elements of the political class who are concerned about electability. “But Cruz is embracing that outsider status, just as he did in Texas, where in 2012 he beat out the presumed Republican Senate nominee, former Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, and became a hero to that conservative state’s tea party.” The Washington Post says this is one of five things you need to know about the senator: “Cruz's often tells the story of his father, Rafael -- also the senator's given name -- leaving Cuba as a young man with 100 sewn into his underwear. Rafael Cruz, an evangelical pastor, has a history of making headline-grabbing statements. They include telling an audience that President Obama should be sent ‘back to Kenya,’ asserting that the Bible ‘tells you exactly who to vote for.’” So his dad’s an issue too. Slate says that Cruz spouts “bizarre nonsense” on climate change: “In case you haven’t heard, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) is not a fan of reality. “The reality of science, that is. He has a history of saying global warming–denying talking points and used some of his political power just this past week to pressure NASA into downplaying its role in measuring the effects of global warming on the planet.” Just for good measure, \\"Morning Joe\\" panelist Donny Deutsch likened Cruz to Sarah Palin. My take is that the mainstream media always gravitate toward establishment candidates, in part because these politicians excel at fundraising and endorsements, which journalists highly value. That’s why the media consistently underestimate such insurgent candidates as Mike Huckabee and Rick Santorum before they catch fire. But recent history suggests that the establishment Republican prevails in the end: Mitt Romney, John McCain, George W. Bush, Bob Dole. The question for 2016, up against Hillary, is whether this time could be different. How about a conservative view? Here’s Allahpundit on Hot Air: “The problem with finding a path for Cruz next year, though, is that as the field narrows and losers drop out, the primaries inevitability become a referendum on electability and acceptability. I can see Walker stumbling; I can see Jeb flaming out from voters’ Bush fatigue; I can see Paul stuck at 20 percent, unable to add to his libertarian base; and I can see Rubio never quite contending because he can’t scrape the votes he needs from the center and right. What I can’t see is all of those things happening, and realistically, they’d all have to happen to make Cruz the nominee.” It’s a crowded field, to be sure. The thing that brought Cruz national fame was the filibuster and his leading role in the 2013 shutdown. To his supporters, Cruz was fighting for conservative principles against ObamaCare. To his critics, Cruz was pursuing a kamikaze strategy that could never have succeeded because the Democrats controlled the White House and the Senate. The coming campaign will be a test of whether Cruz can break out beyond his evangelical base. But it will also be a test of the media establishment that views him mainly as a bomb-thrower.

Using microwaves to directly heat owners of a room would save much of the energy wasted by heating walls and furniture. And despite popular ideas about microwaves, this technique would be safe, according to Charles R. Burlier of the Microwave Research Center in Marlborough, New Hampshire. Low-power microwaves only penetrate the skin (low-power microwave penetration in a ham is about 0.2 inches, for example) and with no negative effects. To test this idea, Buffler subjected himself to microwaves in a special room using a standard 500-watt, 2459 MHz magnetron . He found that a person will start to feel warmth at about 20 milliwatts per square centimeter (mw. / sq. cm. ) ; a satisfactory feeling of warmth occurs between 35 and 50mw. / sq. cm. By comparison, a person standing in noonday summer sun feels the amount of 85 mw. / sq. cm. And a frozen meat pie in your microwave oven receives about 1000 mw. / sq. cm. In houses of the future, each room could be provided with its own magnetron, says Buffler. When you stepped into the living room, for example, a motion detector would turn on the magnetron, filling the room with low-power microwaves. In the same way that a microwave oven heats up a hamburger, but not the plate it's on, you would feel warmth from the microwaves without changing the temperature of your coffee table. (You could, however, make your favorite easy chair even more comfortable by treating it with a radiation-absorbing chemical.) While it might be some time before homeowners are comfortable enough with the idea to set up whole-body microwave heaters in houses, Buffler says microwaves may attract livestock farmers. Lambs that are born outdoors in winter, for example, are frequently lost to cold. Microwaves could warm the lambs safely and quickly.

Yes or no, is the answer \\"Perhaps microwave heaters will be first used by livestock farmers, who wish to protect their lambs in winter.\\"? A:","completion":"Yes, the answer \\"Perhaps microwave heaters will be first used by livestock farmers, who wish to protect their lambs in winter\\" is a statement that Buffler would most probably agree with.

Question: what made the civil war different from others","completion":"No, the provided answer does not address the question about what made the American Civil War different from other wars. To answer the given question: the American Civil War is distinguished from other wars for several reasons: 1. A war between Americans: The Civil War was fought primarily between citizens of the same country, the United States, divided into Union (mostly Northern states) and Confederate (mostly Southern states) forces. 2. Slavery: One of the key issues that fueled the conflict was slavery, with the Confederate states fighting to maintain their right to continue the institution, and the Union states opposing its expansion and, eventually, seeking its complete abolition. 3. Industrial Revolution and technological advancements: The Civil War occurred during a period of rapid industrialization and embraced new technologies, such as railroads, telegraph communication, advanced weaponry (rifles, repeating guns, and strategic naval warfare), and early development of photography to document events on the battlefields. 4. Large-scale casualties: The Civil War resulted in substantial casualties, with an estimated death toll of 620,000 to 750,000 soldiers, which was more than the combined total of American deaths in both World War I and World War II. 5. Reconstruction: The Civil War led to a significant period of national healing and political transformation known as Reconstruction (1865-1877), which aimed to rebuild the nation, reintegrate the Confederate states, and establish civil rights for former slaves. 6. Lasting impact: The Civil War had a profound impact on the United States, shaping its political landscape and social fabric. It led to the abolishment of slavery through the 13th Amendment, as well as the 14th and 15th Amendments, which granted equal citizenship and voting rights to former slaves.

When deciding what foreign language to take at school, I picked French instead of Chinese because the","completion":"pronunciation and grammar seemed more approachable to me. Taking into account my personal preferences and learning style, I thought that French would be a better fit for me. Here is a step-by-step analysis of the thought process that led me to this decision: Step 1: Assessing Personal Preferences First, I assessed my personal preferences for language learning. I have always been fascinated with European languages and culture, which naturally drew me towards French. Additionally, I have relatives and friends who speak French, which I believed would make the learning process more enjoyable and provide opportunities for practice and real-life conversation. Step 2: Evaluating Language Difficulty Next, I evaluated the perceived difficulty of learning French and Chinese. While both languages require time and effort, I noticed that French uses the same alphabet as English, with some additional accent marks. This seemed much more manageable than learning the thousands of characters in Chinese. Furthermore, French pronunciation, although containing some unique sounds, appeared less challenging than mastering the tones required in Chinese. Step 3: Considering Grammar and Vocabulary In comparing the grammar and vocabulary of the two languages, I found that French, being a Romance language, shares many cognates with English due to the influence of Latin and Norman French on the English language. This would potentially make vocabulary acquisition easier. On the other hand, Chinese grammar is structurally very different from English, and although it lacks verb conjugation, it has a myriad of unique particles and sentence structures that may prove more difficult for me to grasp. Step 4: Researching Language Resources Within my school and in my local community, I discovered that there were more opportunities for language exchange and practice with native French speakers than with Chinese speakers. Moreover, I had access to a wider variety of French learning resources, from textbooks and online platforms to movies and music, which I believed would play a significant role in support of my studies. Step 5: Envisioning Future Opportunities Lastly, I considered the benefits and opportunities that would come with learning each language. While Chinese is spoken by a larger population and offers economic advantages, French is an official language in several international organizations and offers opportunities for travel, work, and education in French-speaking countries. Given my personal interests and aspirations, French seemed to present more appealing opportunities. After going through these steps, I concluded that French was the more suitable language for me to study at school. This choice took into account my personal preferences, the perceived ease of learning the language, available resources, and the potential benefits and opportunities that come with fluency in French."},{"prompt":"Answer the following question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Chapter 38 1 Figure 38.19B 3 Figure 38.38 In the presence of Sarin, acetycholine is not removed from the synapse, resulting in continuous stimulation of the muscle plasma membrane.

Question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who sailed back east along the coast to Honduras? ? Gil González Dávila set out from the Caribbean island of Hispaniola early in 1524, with the intention of exploring the Caribbean coast of Nicaragua. His course took him to the north coast of Honduras. After founding Puerto de Caballos, Gil Gónzalez sailed west along the coast to the Amatique Bay, and founded a Spanish settlement somewhere near the Dulce River, within modern-day Guatemala, which he named San Gil de Buena Vista. He launched a campaign of conquest in the mountainous region dividing Honduras from Guatemala. González left some of his men under the command of Francisco Riquelme at San Gil de Buena Vista, and sailed back east along the coast to Honduras. The colonists at San Gil did not prosper, and soon set out in search of a more hospitable location. They resettled in the important indigenous town of Nito, near the mouth of the Dulce River. Although they were in a desperate state, and near-starving, they were still there when Cortés passed through en route to Honduras, and were absorbed into his expedition.The Dominicans established themselves in Xocolo on the shore of Lake Izabal in the mid-16th century. Xocolo became infamous among the Dominican missionaries for the practice of witchcraft by its inhabitants. By 1574 it was the most important staging post for European expeditions into the interior, and it remained important in that role until as late as 1630, although it was abandoned in 1631.In 1598 Alfonso Criado de Castilla became governor of the Captaincy General of Guatemala. Owing to the poor state of Puerto de Caballos on the Honduran coast and its exposure to repeated pirate raids he sent a pilot to scout Lake Izabal. As a result of the survey, and after royal permission was granted, Criado de Castilla ordered the construction of a new port, named Santo Tomás de Castilla, at a favourable spot on the Amatique Bay not far from the lake.

A new study suggests that for women who already have heart disease, poor sleep may be particularly dangerous to their heart health. Research indicates that poor-quality sleep--and waking too early in particular--is associated with increased inflammation among women with heart disease. There was no similar association found for men, suggesting that women with heart disease and sleep problems may be at particular risk for inflammation that can be damaging to the heart. Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco investigated the relationship between sleep quality and inflammation linked to coronary heart disease. They also sought information about how an association between sleep and inflammation might differ between men and women. Their investigation included 980 men and women at first, and 626 completed the 5-year study. All of those included were suffering for coronary heart disease. The average age of men in the study was 66. Women were slightly younger, with an average age of 64. Researchers measured sleep quality by asking participants to rate their sleep over the previous month. They also asked for reports of some of the most common sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, waking frequently throughout the night, and waking too early in the morning. After 5 years, researchers repeated tests for inflammation and once again sought reports on sleep quality and sleep problems. When they analyzed data for both men and women together, researchers found no links between inflammations and sleep quality. However, when they...

Article: LEEDS, England--A Leeds University psychology professor is researching a course to help dozens of Britons forgive their enemies. \\"The hate we hold within us is a cancer.\\" Professor Ken Hart said, adding that holding in anger can lead to problems such as high blood pressure and heart disease. More than 70 people have become volunteers in Hart's first 20-week workshop in London--a course he says is the first of its kind in the world. These are people who are sick and tired of living with a memory. They realize their bitterness is a poison they think they can pour out, but they end up drinking it themselves, said Canadian-born Hart. The students meet in each group of eight to ten for a two-hour workshop with a director every two weeks. The course, ending in July, is expected to get rid of the cancer of hate in these people. \\"People have lots of negative attitudes towards forgiveness,\\" he said, \\"People confuse forgiveness with forgetting. Forgiveness means changing from a negative attitude to a positive one.\\" Hart and his team have created instructions to provide the training needed. \\"The main idea is to give you guidances on how to look at all kinds of angers and how they affect you, and how to change your attitudes towards the person you are angry with,\\" said Norman Claringbull, a senior expert on the forgiveness project. Hart said, \\"I believe forgiveness is a skill that can be taught, as these people want to get free of the past.\\" Question: If you are angry with somebody, you should _ . - attend Hart's course - persuade him or her to have a positive talk with you - never meet him or her any longer - treat him or her positively instead of negatively","completion":"treat him or her positively instead of negatively"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: Who was the commander during the Battle of Mecca,","completion":"Title: The Battle of Mecca and Its Commanders: A Dive into Islamic History Introduction The Battle of Mecca, also known as the Conquest of Mecca, holds a significant place in Islamic history. As the battle that marked the eventual conversion of the city of Mecca to Islam, it is a renowned event. Although the siege of Mecca, the holiest city in Islam, was short, its influence on the growth of the religion was immense. In this article, we explore the crucial protagonists in the Battle of Mecca, focusing on the military commanders and their roles in this significant event. The Battle of Mecca: A Brief Overview The Battle of Mecca took place in January 630 AD (8 AH in the Islamic calendar) and was initiated by the Islamic Prophet Muhammad, who declared Mecca as the objective of his military expedition. The city was under the control of the Quraysh tribe, a powerful group that had previously persecuted Muhammad and his followers. Tensions between the Muslims and the Quraysh soared due to the violation of the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah by the Quraysh, prompting Muhammad to assemble an army and head towards Mecca. The Commander: Prophet Muhammad As the primary leader of the Muslim forces, the Prophet Muhammad was the chief commander responsible for planning the operation. His leadership during the Battle of Mecca was pivotal, focusing on a full-scale invasion and urging his troops to avoid bloodshed due to the sacred nature of the city. This showcased his keen strategic mind and adherence to the Islamic principles of peace and respect for human life. Muhammad's overall aim was to liberate Mecca, eliminate pagan practices, and establish it as a center for the Islamic faith. Key Military Commanders While Prophet Muhammad was undoubtedly the driving force behind the Battle of Mecca, he was not alone in his efforts. Accompanying him were several notable military commanders who played crucial roles in executing his strategic plans. Some key figures include: 1. Abu Bakr al-Siddiq: Regarded as one of the closest companions of the Prophet Muhammad, Abu Bakr al-Siddiq acted as both a trusted advisor and an influential commander. As the first person to embrace Islam outside of Muhammad's immediate family, Abu Bakr was instrumental in rallying support amongst the Muslims and leading the army towards Mecca. 2. Umar ibn al-Khattab: Another prominent companion of the Prophet, Umar ibn al-Khattab, was a skilled and confident commander. He played a crucial part in the early years of Islam, contributing to military, political, and social aspects of the Islamic state. Umar's influence and military leadership in the Battle of Mecca helped ensure its ultimate success. 3. Ali ibn Abi Talib: Widely acknowledged as the cousin and son-in-law of the Prophet Muhammad, Ali ibn Abi Talib displayed immense bravery and skill in numerous military campaigns. During the Battle of Mecca, Ali’s expert knowledge of the city and its defenses provided valuable guidance for the Muslim forces as they sieged the city. 4. Khalid ibn al-Walid: A brilliant military mind and steadfast leader, Khalid ibn al-Walid was initially an adversary of the Muslim forces. However, after converting to Islam, he joined the ranks of the faithful and played an indispensable role in numerous battles. In the Battle of Mecca, Khalid was entrusted to lead one of the four divisions that entered the city, resulting in minimal bloodshed and a peaceful conquest. Conclusion The Battle of Mecca demonstrated the tactical prowess and strategic thinking of Prophet Muhammad and his skilled commanders during this critical juncture of Islamic history. Though the battle was swift and involved minimal confrontation, it marked a turning point for Islam, solidifying the faith's dominance over the Arabian Peninsula and resulting in the conversion of many Quraysh tribe members. The commanders mentioned above, along with the Prophet himself, played an essential role in this remarkable conquest, shaping the future of Islam and its growth beyond Arabia."},{"prompt":"Question: \\"Vincenzo Giannusa\\", given a list of categories: company, educational institution, artist, athlete, office holder, mean of transportation, building, natural place, village, animal, plant, album, film or written work, what category does the title belong to?

Tom Colicchio of 'Top Chef' urges school lunch funding Tom Colicchio, a leading chef and the head judge of Bravo's Top Chef television program, told the House Education and Labor Committee today that increased funding for school lunch programs is critical for the nation's health and economy. The committee is considering an 8 billion bill that would fund federal nutrition programs. The legislation would set standards for food sold in school vending machines. Colicchio, noting that he is \\"the son of a lunch lady,\\" said students will eat healthy foods if they have the option. Top Chef, which was filmed in Washington this season, recently challenged its chef contestants to create a healthy lunch for local students. \\"The kids ate it,\\" Colicchio said of the healthier-than-tater-tot dishes. \\"They asked for seconds, they asked for thirds.\\" The bill has captured other celebrity attention. Food Network star Rachael Ray spoke on Capitol Hill when the bill was introduced in June. The proposal is supported by first lady Michelle Obama, who has made combating childhood obesity one of her top initiatives. Robert Rector, senior research fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, countered that schools should be able to make decisions about what children are served, not the federal government.

The context also reveals that it had four volumes, with the last one being issued in 1842. Step 2: Formulate the hypothesis The hypothesis to be drawn is: The London Saturday Journal was the best-selling magazine in London, England in 1841. Step 3: Assess the evidence supporting the hypothesis The context does not provide any information about the magazine's sales, popularity, or whether it was the best-selling magazine in London in 1841. Step 4: Identify possible gaps in the evidence Since the context lacks information about the magazine's sales and popularity, drawing conclusions about its status as the best-selling magazine is not supported by the available evidence.

Lil Mago, Casper, and Smiley rob the passengers for any money they have until Lil Mago spots Sayra and attempts to rape her. Casper intervenes, killing Mago and then sending Smiley off. Smiley goes back to the gang and reports about Mago's death. The new gang leader, El Sol, accuses Smiley of collusion, to which Smiley timidly protests and begs to be sent to kill Casper to prove his loyalty. El Sol agrees and Smiley travels north to track down Casper. On the train, the still shocked Casper is avoided by other passengers. When some try to throw him off the train, Sayra warns Casper and keeps on approaching him, despite her father's warnings. Casper's knowledge from previously smuggling gang members and avoiding the police proves useful, as he eludes his pursuers. He is finally accepted by Sayra's family but decides to leave the train while the others are sleeping....

Question: Where does Quigley go to confront Marston? Movie plot title: Quigley Down Under Movie plot: Matthew Quigley (Tom Selleck) is an American cowboy and sharpshooter with a specially modified rifle with which he can shoot accurately at extraordinary distances. He answers a newspaper advertisement that asks for a man with a special talent in long-distance shooting, using just four words, \\"M. Quigley 900 yards,\\" written on a copy of the advertisement that is punctured by several closely spaced bullet holes. When he arrives in Australia, he gets into a fight with employees of the man who hired him, who are trying to force \\"Crazy Cora\\" (Laura San Giacomo) onto their wagon. After he identifies himself, he is taken to the station of Elliot Marston (Alan Rickman), who informs Quigley his sharpshooting skills will be used to eradicate the increasingly elusive Aborigines. Quigley turns down the offer and throws Marston out of his house. The aborigine manservant knocks Quigley over the head and Marston's men beat him and Cora unconscious and dump them in the outback with no water and little chance of survival. However, they are rescued by Aborigines. Cora now reveals that she comes from Texas. When her home was attacked by Comanches, she hid in the cellar and accidentally suffocated her child while trying to prevent him from crying. Her husband had then put her alone on a ship to Australia. Now Cora consistently calls Quigley by her husbandâs name (Roy), much to his annoyance. When Marston's men attack the Aborigines who helped them, Quigley kills three. Escaping on a single horse, they encounter more of the men driving Aborigines over a cliff. Quigley drives them off with his deadly shooting and Cora rescues an orphaned baby she finds among the dead Aborigines. Leaving Cora and the infant in the desert with food and water, Quigley rides alone to a nearby town. There he obtains new ammunition from a local German gunsmith, who hates Marston for his murdering ways. Quigley also learns that he has become a legendary hero among the Aborigines.

Alongside the Hauptschule, Realschule, and Gymnasium, there are also vocational schools, known as \\"Berufsschule\\" or \\"Berufliche Schule,\\" which offer practical and vocational training designed to equip students with specific skills for their future careers. Additionally, comprehensive schools, known as \\"Gesamtschule,\\" merge elements from each type of secondary school to provide a more inclusive and comprehensive education for all students. As the educational landscape in Germany continues to evolve, some states have opted to transition away from the traditional Hauptschule model and instead offer alternatives like the Mittelschule to better facilitate the various educational needs and aspirations of their students.

What is the answer to this question? what years did the harry potter books take place?","completion":"The Harry Potter books, written by British author J.K. Rowling, take place over a span of seven years, each year covering an academic year in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The storyline begins with Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone in the United States) and ends with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Here's a detailed breakdown of the timeline and events taking place in the series: 1. Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (Sorcerer's Stone): This first book takes place during the 1991-1992 academic year. The story begins when Harry turns 11 years old, learns about his magical heritage, and joins Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is also when he first meets his best friends, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. 2. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets: The second book covers the 1992-1993 academic year at Hogwarts. This year, Harry and his friends investigate the titular Chamber of Secrets and unravel the school's dark history involving Salazar Slytherin and the basilisk. 3. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban: This third installment takes place during the 1993-1994 academic year. This year, the infamous Sirius Black escapes from the wizarding prison, Azkaban, and is believed to be after Harry. The story revolves around unraveling the truth about Sirius Black and his connection to Harry and his parents, James and Lily Potter. 4. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire: This book occurs in the 1994-1995 academic year. During this time, Harry unexpectedly and controversially becomes a participant in the dangerous Triwizard Tournament. The tournament is held to promote magical cooperation between Hogwarts, Beauxbatons, and Durmstrang schools of magic. The climactic finale marks the return of the dark wizard, Lord Voldemort. 5. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix: The fifth book covers the 1995-1996 academic year. As few believe Harry and Dumbledore's claims about Voldemort's return, the Order of the Phoenix, a secret society, is reestablished to oppose Voldemort and his Death Eaters. This year, Harry becomes more deeply involved in the war against Voldemort, as he and Dumbledore's Army, a student-led group, prepare to fight Dark forces. 6. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince: The sixth book takes place during the 1996-1997 academic year.

The war against Voldemort takes a tragic turn as Dumbledore, the Hogwarts headmaster, dies at the end of the year. 7. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: The final book is not constrained to an academic year as Harry, Ron, and Hermione leave Hogwarts to search and destroy Voldemort's remaining horcruxes. It begins in summer 1997 and ends in May 1998, thus roughly spanning the 1997-1998 timeline. The series reaches its climax with the Battle of Hogwarts, where several beloved characters meet their end, and Harry ultimately defeats Lord Voldemort.

Does the sentence \\"Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.\\" provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is another stopover location?\\"","completion":"The sentence \\"Some examples of important stopover locations are the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay.\\" does provide a valid answer to the question \\"What is another stopover location?\\". However, to generate a more detailed and longer response, allow me to elaborate on the importance of the two mentioned stopover locations and provide additional examples. Stopover locations play a crucial role for migratory birds and other species during their long journeys. These locations offer temporary resting spots where the species can refuel, rest, and reproduce before continuing their journey. The Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay are two examples of vital stopover locations for numerous migratory birds and marine species. The Bay of Fundy is situated between the Canadian provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. This location is known for its large tidal range, which creates a highly productive ecosystem. This ecosystem, in turn, attracts a diverse array of migratory bird species such as the Semipalmated Sandpiper, Red Knot, and Black-bellied Plover. The abundance of food, such as small crustaceans and mollusks, support these birds' nutritional requirements, allowing them to prepare for the next leg of their journey. Additionally, many marine species, like whales, use the Bay of Fundy as a feeding location due to the high concentration of marine prey. Delaware Bay, located on the East Coast of the United States between the states of Delaware and New Jersey, is another significant stopover location. It is particularly essential for the migration of Red Knots and other shorebirds that travel immense distances, some even flying from the southernmost tip of South America. One of their primary food sources in Delaware Bay is the eggs of horseshoe crabs, which spawn during the same period when the birds arrive. The high nutritional content of the eggs allows the birds to replenish their energy reserves and continue their northward migration. In addition to the Bay of Fundy and Delaware Bay, there are several other significant stopover locations across the globe. These include: 1. Wadden Sea: This UNESCO World Heritage site stretches along the North Sea coast of Germany, Denmark, and the Netherlands. It provides critical feeding grounds for migrating birds such as the Eurasian Oystercatcher, Bar-tailed Godwit, and the Ruddy Turnstone. 2. Yellow Sea: Located between China and Korea, the Yellow Sea is home to extensive mudflats and tidal flats. These habitats serve as essential stopovers for migratory shorebirds such as the Spoon-billed Sandpiper and Nordmann's Greenshank, which can feed on the diverse invertebrates found here. 3. Hudson Bay: Situated in northeastern Canada, Hudson Bay provides a crucial stopover location for numerous Arctic bird species, including the Common Eider, Snow Goose, and Semipalmated Plover, which rely on the area's rich estuaries and wetlands for food and shelter. In conclusion, while the sentence provided initially offers a valid response to the question, the importance and diversity of stopover locations worldwide cannot be overstressed. These vital ecosystems not only support the successful migration and survival of various species, but they also serve as indicators of environmental health and contribute significantly to global biodiversity."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Given the question: Question: \\"What is another name for the national government?\\" Context: \\"New York is the most important source of political fundraising in the United States, as four of the top five ZIP codes in the nation for political contributions are in Manhattan. The top ZIP code, 10021 on the Upper East Side, generated the most money for the 2004 presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John Kerry. The city has a strong imbalance of payments with the national and state governments. It receives 83 cents in services for every 1 it sends to the federal government in taxes (or annually sends 11.4 billion more than it receives back). The city also sends an additional 11 billion more each year to the state of New York than it receives back.\\" Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The another name for the national government is the federal government. In the context provided, it highlights the financial relationship between New York City and the federal government, showing an imbalance in the funds and services exchanged between them. The federal government, also often referred to as the central government, is responsible for governing the entire nation and dealing with matters that affect the country as a whole, such as foreign policy, defense, and fiscal policies. This government entity has the power to collect taxes, make and enforce laws, and regulate interstate commerce. In the United States, the federal government is made up of three branches: the executive branch, headed by the President; the legislative branch, comprising the Senate and the House of Representatives; and the judicial branch, led by the Supreme Court. In the context mentioned above, New York City's contribution to the federal government in taxes outweighs the services and funding it receives in return. This imbalance, with the city receiving only 83 cents for every dollar it sends to the federal government, signifies that New York City annually sends approximately 11.4 billion more than it receives back. New York City also experiences a similar imbalance with the state government, with an additional 11 billion being sent to the state annually compared to the funds and services it receives in return.

Paragraph: He repeatedly calls on his followers to embrace martyrdom since \\"The walls of oppression and humiliation cannot be demolished except in a rain of bullets.\\" For those yearning for a lost sense of order in an older, more tranquil world, he offers his \\"Caliphate\\" as an imagined alternative to today's uncertainty. For others, he offers simplistic conspiracies to explain their world. Bin Laden also relies heavily on the Egyptian writer Sayyid Qutb. A member of the Muslim Brotherhood executed in 1966 on charges of attempting to overthrow the government, Qutb mixed Islamic scholarship with a very superficial acquaintance with Western history and thought. Sent by the Egyptian government to study in the United States in the late 1940s, Qutb returned with an enormous loathing of Western society and history. He dismissed Western achievements as entirely material, arguing that Western society possesses \\"nothing that will satisfy its own conscience and justify its existence.\\" Three basic themes emerge from Qutb's writings. First, he claimed that the world was beset with barbarism, licentiousness, and unbelief (a condition he called jahiliyya, the religious term for the period of ignorance prior to the revelations given to the Prophet Mohammed). Qutb argued that humans can choose only between Islam and jahiliyya. Second, he warned that more people, including Muslims, were attracted to jahiliyya and its material comforts than to his view of Islam; jahiliyya could therefore triumph over Islam. Third, no middle ground exists in what Qutb conceived as a struggle between God and Satan. All Muslims-as he defined them-therefore must take up arms in this fight. Any Muslim who rejects his ideas is just one more nonbeliever worthy of destruction. Bin Laden shares Qutb's stark view, permitting him and his followers to rationalize even unprovoked mass murder as righteous defense of an embattled faith. Many Americans have wondered, \\"Why do 'they' hate us?\\" Some also ask, \\"What can we do to stop these attacks?\\" Bin Laden and al Qaeda have given answers to both these questions.

The Grand Ole Opry is a weekly country-music stage concert in Nashville, Tennessee, which was founded on November 28, 1925, by George D. Hay as a one-hour radio \\"barn dance\\" on WSM. Currently owned and operated by Opry Entertainment (a division of Ryman Hospitality Properties, Inc.), it is the longest-running radio broadcast in US history. Dedicated to honoring country music and its history, the Opry showcases a mix of famous singers and contemporary chart-toppers performing country, bluegrass, Americana, folk, gospel, and comedic performances and skits. It attracts hundreds of thousands of visitors from around the world and millions of radio and Internet listeners. Following the departure of the Opry, Ryman Auditorium sat mostly vacant and decaying for twenty years. An initial effort by National Life & Accident to tear down the Ryman and use its bricks to build a chapel at Opryland USA was met with resounding resistance from the public, including the influential musicians of the time. The plans were abandoned, and the building remained standing with an uncertain future. Despite the absence of performances, the building still held such significance as an attraction that it would remain open for tours. In 1991 and 1992, Emmylou Harris performed a series of concerts there and released some of the recordings as an album entitled At the Ryman. The concert and album's high acclaim renewed interest in reviving Ryman Auditorium as an active venue. Beginning in September 1993, Gaylord Entertainment undertook a full renovation of the Ryman, restoring it into a world-class concert hall that reopened with a broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion on June 4, 1994. On Sunday, October 18, 1998, the Opry held a benefit show at Ryman Auditorium, marking its return to the venue for the first time since its final show on March 15, 1974. The show was well received by fans, performers, and management alike, and so the decision was made to host the Opry's regular shows there on January 15 & 16, 1999 as part of the celebration to commemorate 25 years at the new venue. Beginning in November 1999, the Opry was held at Ryman Auditorium for three months, partly due to the ongoing construction of Opry Mills. The Opry has returned to the Ryman for the three winter months every year since, allowing the show to acknowledge its roots while also taking advantage of a smaller venue during an off-peak season for tourism. While still officially the Grand Ole Opry, the shows there are billed as Opry At The Ryman. From 2002 to 2014, a traveling version of the Radio City Christmas Spectacular took up residence at the Grand Ole Opry House each holiday season while the Opry was away.

Sam is the first to arrive, and while drinking wine in Room 6, two inbreds forcefully enter and attack Sam, where with a collection of duct tape, an iron bar, and an axe, they bind Sam's legs with the tape, place the iron bar beside her ankles, and use the axe head to force the bar through both her ankles.

Please answer the following question: Information: - A wave pool is a swimming pool in which there are artificially generated, reasonably large waves, similar to those of the ocean. Wave pools are often a major feature of water parks. Siam Park City Water Park in Thailand is home to the world's largest wave pool certified by Guinness World Records, and Siam Park (Tenerife) in Spain is home to the biggest man made waves (about 3 meters (9.8 ft)) in the world. - A museum is an institution that cares for (conserves) a collection of artifacts and other objects of artistic, cultural, historical, or scientific importance and some public museums make them available for public viewing through exhibits that may be permanent or temporary. Most large museums are located in major cities throughout the world and more local ones exist in smaller cities, towns and even the countryside. Museums have varying aims, ranging from serving researchers and specialists to serving the general public. The goal of serving researchers is increasingly shifting to serving the general public. - The American Museum of Natural History (abbreviated as AMNH), located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, New York City, is one of the largest museums in the world. Located in park-like grounds across the street from Central Park, the museum complex comprises 28 interconnected buildings housing 45 permanent exhibition halls, in addition to a planetarium and a library. The museum collections contain over 33 million specimens of plants, animals, fossils, minerals, rocks, meteorites, human remains, and human cultural artifacts, of which only a small fraction can be displayed at any given time, and occupies more than . The museum has a full-time scientific staff of 225, sponsors over 120 special field expeditions each year, and averages about five million visits annually. - The Upper West Side, sometimes abbreviated UWS, is a neighborhood in the borough of Manhattan, New York City, that lies between Central Park and the Hudson River and between West 59th Street and West 110th Street. The Upper West Side is sometimes also considered by the real estate industry to include the neighborhood of Morningside Heights. - In physics, a standing wave also known as a stationary wave is a wave in a medium in which each point on the axis of the wave has an associated constant amplitude. The locations at which the amplitude is minimum are called nodes, and the locations where the amplitude is maximum are called antinodes. - An ocean (the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere. On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean, which covers almost 71% of its surface. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern (Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans. The word \\"sea\\" is often used interchangeably with \\"ocean\\" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land. - The lion (\\"Panthera leo\\") is one of the big cats in the genus \\"Panthera\\" and a member of the family Felidae. The commonly used term African lion collectively denotes the several subspecies in Africa. With some males exceeding in weight, it is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru. The lion is classified as a vulnerable species by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), having seen a major population decline in its African range of 3050% over two decades during the second half of the twentieth century. Lion populations are untenable outside designated reserves and national parks. Although the cause of the decline is not fully understood, habitat loss and conflicts with humans are the greatest causes of concern. Within Africa, the West African lion population is particularly endangered. - The City of New York, often called New York City or simply New York, is the most populous city in the United States. With an estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area of just , New York City is also the most densely populated major city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the center of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the world. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce, finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace defining the term \\"New York minute\\". Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an important center for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial capital of the world. - Jack Roland Murphy or \`\` Murph the Surf '' ( or \`\` Murf the Surf '' ) ( born 1938 ) is a surfing champion , musician , author , artist , and convicted murderer , who was involved in the biggest jewel heist in American history at the American Museum of Natural History . Today Jack Murphy is an ordained minister , working with inmates in the field of prison ministry . - Surfing is a surface water sport in which the wave rider, referred to as a surfer, rides on the forward or deep face of a moving wave, which is usually carrying the surfer towards the shore. Waves suitable for surfing are primarily found in the ocean, but can also be found in lakes or in rivers in the form of a standing wave or tidal bore. However, surfers can also utilize artificial waves such as those from boat wakes and the waves created in artificial wave pools. - Cultural artifact or artefact is a term used in the social sciences, particularly anthropology, ethnology, and sociology for anything created by humans which gives information about the culture of its creator and users. \\"Artifact\\" is the spelling in North American English; \\"artefact\\" is usually preferred elsewhere.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. More important than phone calls and visits is truthfulness. Be open with your friends so they know the real you, even when you aren’t so proud of yourself. Friendships can only grow when honesty is present, so always be yourself. Always honor your friends. If others are gossiping about them, either intervene or walk away. Always keep their secrets. If you tell them that you’ll do something, do it without having to be reminded. For instance, if you hear someone talking badly about them, say “Hey, Monica is one of my good friends. I’d appreciate it if you didn’t speak like that about her.” If you do something wrong to your friends, say you’re sorry to them. Friendships are bound to run into the occasional conflict, and that’s okay. What’s not okay is allowing bitterness to fester and poison your relationship. Call them or pull them aside and say something like “I’m so sorry for making that comment about your mom. I wasn’t thinking straight. It won’t happen again.” Friendships thrive when everyone feels valued. Let your friends know what they mean to you. Tell them how thankful you are to have them in your life and compliment them regularly. Boost them and make them feel lucky to have you, too. Take special moments like birthdays to be appreciative, but let them know you love them on regular days, too. Say something like “You’re such a great friend. I don’t know what I’d do without you. Thanks for always being there for me.” Just like you have your imperfections, know that your friends have them, too. Instead of trying to make them think like you about certain issues, accept their differences. This doesn’t mean letting them treat you badly, but do know that they are human and unique. For instance, your friend might be in an unhealthy relationship that you're tired of hearing about. Instead of getting mad at them for staying, continue to love and support them. Summary:","completion":"To be a good friend, always be truthful and open with your friends, showing them the real you. Keep their secrets, stand up for them, and say sorry when needed. Make them feel valued by telling them how important they are to you.

Please write a short summary for the following article: North Korea: The danger of romancing Kim (Opinion) Editor's note: Christian Whiton is a former deputy special envoy for human rights in North Korea for the George W. Bush administration. He is president of the Hamilton Foundation, a principal with DC Advisory, a public policy consultancy, and the author of \\"Smart Power: Between Diplomacy and War.\\" The views expressed are his own. (CNN) -- Securing the release of American prisoners Kenneth Bae and Matthew Miller from North Korea was not cost-free. It may also be an omen of the return of recurring efforts by U.S. administrations of both parties to negotiate deals with Pyongyang that inevitably fail. The United States supposedly does not have diplomatic relations with North Korea. After all, the arms proliferating, dollar counterfeiting, nuclear-armed dictatorship, which torpedoed a South Korean ship in 2010, hasn't accounted for all of the foreign nationals it kidnapped abroad to train its spies, and occasionally threatens America and its allies with annihilation. But that hasn't stopped a string of senior U.S. diplomats from visiting Pyongyang over the past three administrations. The most recent denizen was U.S. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, who on Saturday brought home the two Americans imprisoned by the regime for alleged speech and faith-related activities that wouldn't get a second look in the civilized world. While Clapper's trip may have been \\"last-minute,\\" as the Obama administration described it, the efforts to arrange it probably went on for months -- and are emblematic of an unfortunate approach to North Korea and its Chinese allies that spans Republican and Democratic administrations -- especially in their final years. Washington and Pyongyang both have agendas beyond what is visible today. Is North Korea being magnanimous in releasing Bae and Miller before their trumped-up prison sentences ran out, or might it want something in return? In fact, it has already acquired something: the appearance of legitimacy. The autocrats who maintain North Korea's totalitarian rule through fear -- and the young leader, Kim Jong Un, who even had his uncle executed -- relish any opportunity to show how they can make representatives of vastly more powerful nations come to Pyongyang and kiss their proverbial ring. Previous visitors in this vein have included then-Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, former President Jimmy Carter, former Vice President Al Gore, and various representatives of then-Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. The North Korean government knows more about the U.S. political cycle than many American political scientists. It saw that the final two years of the Bill Clinton and George W. Bush administrations were fruitful for dealing with presidents and secretaries of state desperately trying to burnish their legacies. Under President Clinton, aid to North Korea from Washington and Seoul spiked beginning in 1999, and included efforts to build nuclear power plants for the North Koreans. Under President Bush, Rice announced in 2007 a breakthrough whereby Pyongyang would give up its nuclear program in exchange for aid. As some predicted, North Korea took the aid but kept the nuclear program. It now likely hopes for a repeat of sorts. North Korea no longer depends on foreign handouts for its survival. By some accounts, its economy is better off than ever, thanks to expanded trade with China -- much of which is supposedly banned by U.N. resolutions. But Pyongyang would still welcome further sanctions relief and loves to be courted diplomatically, which makes it look strong. Courtship of North Korea also invariably involves obeisance to the notion that China will pressure its neighbor into behaving -- and perhaps even surrendering its nuclear weapons program. This is a diplomatic truism that just isn't true: Beijing has always normalized trade with North Korea rapidly after any disruptions in the wake of North Korean nuclear tests or other belligerent acts. But it seems only Pyongyang and Beijing are in on this joke played on American and allied diplomats -- and China's unelected government itself cherishes the legitimacy it gets from being seen as the regional diplomatic linchpin. That is why Beijing has also been promoting multilateral talks with North Korea. The way out of this is to stop believing that romancing Pyongyang will advance U.S. interests. North Korea has violated numerous arms agreements with the United States or other parties. Pyongyang will not be sweet-talked out of its nuclear arsenal or other provocations. Washington can end the cycle of North Korea taking Americans hostage by declaring U.S. passports invalid for travel to North Korea. Furthermore, the United States and its allies should pivot to a program of putting nonviolent pressure on the North Korean regime. Washington should tell the truth about China's support of Pyongyang, increase aid to defectors who try to pierce the curtain of censorship that keeps North Koreans in the dark and punish any company or bank that does business with the regime. Putting the United States at the same table as lawless thugs isn't just morally repugnant -- it's ineffective. The free world should devote more effort to a better form of diplomacy that makes life difficult for its opponents. Read CNNOpinion's new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Choose from: * yes. * no.","completion":"Answer: Edgar Allan Poe, the famous American writer known for his macabre and mystery tales, has a house in Philadelphia which is now a historic site. Born on January 19, 1809, in Boston, Poe lived in various cities throughout his life, including Baltimore, Richmond, and New York City. During his time in Philadelphia, from 1838 to 1844, he resided at what is now known as the Edgar Allan Poe National Historic Site. Located at 532 N. 7th Street, the house is a brick-and-mortar reminder of Poe's time in the city. It was in this unassuming rowhouse where he penned some of his most famous works, such as \\"The Murders in the Rue Morgue,\\" \\"The Tell-Tale Heart,\\" and \\"The Gold-Bug.\\" Despite the city's grim reputation in his day, Poe experienced significant professional growth during his time in Philadelphia, becoming a prominent literary critic and editor. The house itself is modest, consisting of four main rooms as well as a cellar and a small backyard. The site was declared a National Historic Landmark on November 11, 1971, and was officially listed on the National Register of Historic Places the following year. The site is now a museum dedicated to Poe's life and works and is managed by the National Park Service. It is open to the public, providing visitors with a glimpse into the life of the famous author as well as an exploration of the wider historical context of his time. Poe's time in Philadelphia was an important and productive chapter in his life, as he not only authored famous works of fiction but also contributed to shaping the literary landscape of the United States.

The three-story home will be completed in four months. Is three stories high and is decked out in gold-leaf and marble fittings.","completion":"Title: The Glorious New White House in Erbil: A Symbol of Kurdish Pride and Prosperity Erbil, the capital of the autonomous Kurdistan region, has recently become home to a truly extravagant and audacious construction project. A Kurdish businessman, whose passion for architectural opulence and a love for the American executive mansion, has embarked on a quest to bring the essence of the White House to this ancient city. The three-story palatial residence, adorned with gold-leaf and marble fittings, promises to make a remarkable statement on the city's skyline and reaffirm the spirit of Kurdish resilience and prosperity. This fascinating project, set for completion within the next four months, has already sparked significant interest and attention from both local and international observers. As the businessman's dream home takes shape, the striking similarities in architectural design and attention to detail evoke the iconic image of the U.S. president's residence. However, this rendition of the White House nestled in the heart of Erbil is not a mere carbon-copy; it symbolizes the aspirations and wealth of a determined and ambitious Kurdish community. Erbil, an ancient city with a rich history dating back over 6,000 years, is no stranger to architectural grandeur, with its skyline exhibiting an eclectic mix of ancient citadels, mosques, shopping malls, and cutting-edge modern complexes. Yet, the construction of this White House-inspired residence, standing at an impressive three stories high, carves out its own unique space in Erbil's urban landscape. The embodiment of opulence, the building is resplendent in gold-leaf and marble fittings, indicating its owner's fondness for luxury and extravagance. Such ostentatious displays of wealth and grandiosity are not unheard of in this part of the world, with a deep-rooted appreciation for opulent architecture and decorative arts apparent in the region's cultural history. Thus, it is no surprise that our Kurdish businessman has chosen to splurge on prime materials and craftsmanship for his grand vision. While some may argue that the extravagant White House replica is a mere display of vanity or curiosity, it can also be viewed as a reflection of the region's growth and success. Over the past few decades, the Kurdistan region has grown to be an economic powerhouse, with significant investment in oil reserves and infrastructure contributing to the area's development and prosperity. As such, opulent and metaphorically significant buildings like this one are natural expressions of the pride and wealth resulting from this rapid growth. Moreover, the construction of this White House replica is also indicative of the deep appreciation and respect that many Kurds have for the United States. As an indispensable supporter of Kurdish rights and aspirations, the construction of a symbol of American power within Erbil is a nod to this long-standing partnership. In conclusion, the construction of this White House-inspired three-story residence in Erbil is not only a testament to the ambition of a single Kurdish businessman but also an emblem of Kurdish pride and prosperity. As the opulent gold-leaf and marble adorned structure nears completion, it stands as both a tribute to the deep historical ties between Kurds and the United States and the remarkable resilience and growth that the Kurdistan region has experienced in recent years."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The major organs of the digestive system include the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and small and large in- testines. These organs all work together to help you gain energy from the food you eat. Digestion starts in the mouth. When food is swallowed, it travels through the esophagus to the stomach. In the stomach, digestion continues and a small amount of absorption of nutrients takes place. Most chemical digestion and nearly all absorption of nutrients take place in the small intestine. This organ consists of three parts: duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. The large intestine is the last stop in the digestive system. This is where water is absorbed. The food not digested is released as waste.

Could you please come up with a good question for the passage \\"Mill's empiricism thus held that knowledge of any kind is not from direct experience but an inductive inference from direct experience. The problems other philosophers have had with Mill's position center around the following issues: Firstly, Mill's formulation encounters difficulty when it describes what direct experience is by differentiating only between actual and possible sensations. This misses some key discussion concerning conditions under which such \\"groups of permanent possibilities of sensation\\" might exist in the first place. Berkeley put God in that gap; the phenomenalists, including Mill, essentially left the question unanswered. In the end, lacking an acknowledgement of an aspect of \\"reality\\" that goes beyond mere \\"possibilities of sensation\\", such a position leads to a version of subjective idealism. Questions of how floor beams continue to support a floor while unobserved, how trees continue to grow while unobserved and untouched by human hands, etc., remain unanswered, and perhaps unanswerable in these terms. Secondly, Mill's formulation leaves open the unsettling possibility that the \\"gap-filling entities are purely possibilities and not actualities at all\\". Thirdly, Mill's position, by calling mathematics merely another species of inductive inference, misapprehends mathematics. It fails to fully consider the structure and method of mathematical science, the products of which are arrived at through an internally consistent deductive set of procedures which do not, either today or at the time Mill wrote, fall under the agreed meaning of induction.\\"? A:","completion":"Certainly, let's delve into several layers of the passage to create an in-depth question. Question: \\"The passage critically evaluates Mill's empiricism, raising several intricate points about the implications of his philosophical stance. Based on your understanding of the analysis, answer the following multipart question: 1. Explain, in your own words, Mill's view of empirical knowledge as being inferred from direct experience. How does the author seem to regard this stance? 2. Discuss the author's issue with the categorization of sensations into actual and possible, in relation to Mill's philosophies. What examples from the text support your argument? 3. Elucidate on the author's contention about unrecognised 'aspects of reality' in Mill's position. How do instances like 'floor beams continuing to support a floor while unobserved' challenge the nature of Mill's empirical framework? 4. Define what the author implies by the term \\"gap-filling entities\\". How does this concept relate to the argument? 5. Assess the author's critique of Mill's handling of mathematics as 'another species of inductive inference'. What does this criticism reveal about the author's perception of mathematics, and how does it differ from Mill's? 6. Lastly, propose a counterargument supporting Mill's position based on the text and your own knowledge of philosophy. Consider if there are any aspects that might be defensible or were overlooked in this critique.

I was so sad that I had no tears. But that night when my dad tried to cheer me up, my laugh turned into crying. So it came as no surprise to learn that scientists believe crying and laughing come from the same part of the brain. Just as laughing has many health advantages, scientists are discovering that so, too, does crying. Whatever it takes for us to _ pressure is important to our emotional health, and a study found that 85 percent of women and 73 percent of men report feeling better after crying. Besides, tears attract help from other people. Researchers agree that when we cry, people around us become kinder and friendly and they are more ready to provide support and comfort. Tears also enable us to understand our emotions better; sometimes we don't even know we're very sad until we cry. We learn about our emotions through crying, and then we can deal with them. Just as crying can be healthy, not crying - holding back tears of anger, pain or suffering - can be bad for physical health. Studies have shown that too much control of emotions can lead to high blood pressure and heart problems. If you have a health problem, doctors will certainly not ask you to cry.

The potential health risks of holding back tears are also touched upon, reinforcing its importance. Hence, \\"Power of Tears\\" aptly summarizes the main theme of the passage.

Falun Gong, also known as Falun Dafa, is a spiritual practice that combines meditation, moral teachings, and physical exercises. It was first introduced in China in 1992 by Li Hongzhi and quickly gained popularity due to its teachings of self-improvement, spiritual growth, and the promotion of truth, compassion, and tolerance in everyday life. However, in 1999, the Chinese government began a crackdown on Falun Gong, labeling it a \\"cult\\" and launching a brutal campaign to persecute its practitioners. Since the beginning of this crackdown, numerous reports have emerged detailing the various forms of human rights abuses that Falun Gong practitioners have been subjected to, including arbitrary arrest, torture, forced labor, and even organ harvesting. These actions, along with the Chinese government's ongoing campaign to discredit and demonize Falun Gong, have resulted in untold suffering and death for countless practitioners. Ms. Ivy's recent meeting with Frank Weddig demonstrates her commitment to promoting awareness of the ongoing persecution faced by Falun Gong practitioners in China. It also shows her support for efforts at various levels of government, both nationally and internationally, to condemn the Chinese government's treatment of these individuals and call for an end to the persecution. In conclusion, the meeting between Ms. Ivy and Frank Weddig is a crucial step in raising global awareness about the plight of Falun Gong practitioners in China. By discussing the resolution introduced by Mr. Weddig, they hope to bring attention to the ongoing human rights abuses committed by the Chinese government against this peaceful religious group and urge for action to be taken to put an end to the persecution."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Based on the premise \\"yeah yeah i watched that cause he was cute\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"I didn't watch that because I did not think he was so cute.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on logical reasoning and linguistics, we cannot conclusively affirm that the hypothesis \\"I didn't watch that because I did not think he was so cute\\" is true based solely on the premise \\"yeah yeah I watched that because he was cute.\\" This is because the premise and the hypothesis do not constitute a direct logical implication or a relationship of contra-position. Let's unpack these components: 1. The premise: \\"Yeah yeah I watched that because he was cute.\\" This implies that the attractiveness of the person involved was a motivating factor for the speaker to watch something. However, it does not establish this as the sole or exclusive reason for deciding whether or not to watch something. It simply confirms it was at least part of the reason in this specific instance. 2. The hypothesis: \\"I didn't watch that because I did not think he was so cute.\\" This suggests the inverse: if the person involved is not deemed cute, the speaker will not watch. But the provided premise does not provide any evidence or suggestion that the lack of attractiveness would be a deterrent. In logic, a traditional 'if-then' statement and its contrapositive are logically equivalent. If the premise was 'If he is cute, then I watch,' then the contrapositive - 'If I did not watch, then he is not cute' - would be logically equivalent. But the provided premise isn't quite in 'if-then' format, making things less clear. Given the information at hand, while it may be possible to imagine that the speaker might not watch something if they do not find the individual involved cute, we must refrain from making this a solid conclusion. We lack sufficient data about other potential factors influencing the speaker's decision to watch or not watch: the plot premise, genre preferences, other actors involved, or even just availability of time. The speaker's decisions could also vary across different situations or over time. In conclusion, while the premise does provide some insight into the speaker's motivations, it does not definitively validate the hypothesis \\"I didn't watch that because I did not think he was so cute\\". Further information on the speaker's decision-making process would be necessary to accurately support or refute this hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Her mother and grandmother speak minimal English. Her older sister is an unwed mother living on welfare. Her older brother is a drug-dealing junkie. In the course of the film, Cynthia faces chaos and betrayal. One of her buddies is deliberately murdered, while another of her loved ones is accidentally shot. She runs from the police at one point, and to them at another. But through it all, Cynthia has a secret friend: Anne Frank.In a flashback scene early in the film, Cynthias now-dead father gives his young daughter a dog-eared copy of THE DIARY OF ANNE FRANK, and for the rest of the film Annes words, read verbatim by Cynthia, provide both her solace and her inspiration.

Here's a detailed overview of the process: 1. Over 99% of the exocrine pancreas cells produce digestive juices. 2. These cells secrete the digestive juices 'externally' into the small intestine. 3. The digestive juices contain enzymes for breaking down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. 4. The digestive juices flow from the pancreas through an excretory duct into the small intestine. 5. In the small intestine, the enzymes break down fats, proteins, and carbohydrates into smaller molecules that can be absorbed by the body. 6. As the nutrients are absorbed, blood sugar levels rise due to the increased levels of glucose resulting from the breakdown of carbohydrates. 7. In response to the rise in blood sugar levels, the pancreas releases the hormone insulin. The final step: Insulin, secreted by the pancreas, helps regulate blood sugar levels by signaling cells in the body to take in glucose from the bloodstream. This process ensures that the body maintains a stable blood sugar level, preventing any potential complications associated with high or low blood glucose levels. Proper insulin function is crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing diseases such as diabetes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The answer to the question: What is the name of the building that Viscount Grey de Wilton laid the first stone for? is inside the article: Radcliffe Tower is all that remains of an early 15th-century stone-built manor house. The structure is a Grade I listed building and protected as a Scheduled Monument. The construction of a nearby tithe barn is not documented, but it was probably built between 1600 and 1720. It was used for storage of the local tithes (a tenth of a farm's produce). Along with Radcliffe Tower, the Parish Church of St Mary is a Grade I listed building. The town also has two Grade II* listed buildings; Dearden Fold Farmhouse, completed during the 16th century, and Radcliffe Cenotaph, built in 1922 to commemorate the First World War. Outwood Viaduct, and Radcliffe's most visible landmark, St Thomas' Church, are Grade II listed buildings. St Thomas' took nine years to complete. The first stone was laid by Viscount Grey de Wilton (grandson of the Countess Grosvenor) on 21 July 1862, and it was consecrated in 1864 by the first Bishop of Manchester, James Prince Lee. Construction of the tower began in 1870 and the building was completed in 1871. The building cost £7,273, (£670 thousand today) and the tower cost £1,800 (£160 thousand today). The first vicar was the Reverend Robert Fletcher. Radcliffe's first public ornament was a drinking fountain located at the bottom of Radcliffe New Road. It was presented to the town by a Mrs Noah Rostron in memory of her husband, and erected in August 1896. The fountain no longer exists at this location.

However, the book also deals with or alludes to a number of secondary political and social issues existing in Odessa, all of which share ties to the Permian Panthers football team. These include socioeconomic disparity; racism; segregation (and desegregation); and poverty.The coach, Gary Gaines, is constantly on the hot seat. After a loss, he comes back to see \\"For Sale\\" signs on his lawn. Tied into the successes and failure of the coach and the team in general are the conflicts the players struggle with on and off the gridiron. The coach overuses his star player, running back James \\"Boobie\\" Miles, who gets seriously injured (Miles tore his ACL, missed the playoffs, and had a limp for the rest of his life). When this happens, sports radios are flooded with calls for his resignation. Miles' once-arrogant attitude vanishes as he sees his once promising chance of playing big-time college football disappear and starts to question his future after he notices his not-so promising academic standing. Quarterback Mike Winchell struggles with being able to play consistently, and his inability to make decisions for himself. Fullback Don Billingsley has a rocky relationship with his father, who won a state championship at Permian and carries on a feud with his son for not performing on the level he'd like to see, despite the fact that Don doesn't do anything to light his father's temper. Third-string running back Chris Comer, who takes the spot of Miles after his injury, attempts to get rid of his fear of being hit and getting injured, especially when the player who last occupied his spot suffered a season ending injury.
