Think like you are answering to a five year old. Background: Wasim Akram (Urdu: wsym khrm; born 3 June 1966) is a former Pakistani first-class cricketer, cricket commentator and television personality. He is acknowledged as one of the greatest bowlers of all time. A left-arm fast bowler who could bowl with significant pace, he represented the Pakistan cricket team in Test cricket and One Day International (ODI) matches. In October 2013, Wasim Akram was the only Pakistani cricketer to be named in an all-time Test World XI to mark the 150th anniversary of Wisden Cricketers' Almanack. Context: Akram was a significant figure in the 1992 Cricket World Cup held in Australia and New Zealand when Pakistan won the tournament. In the final, against England, his innings of 33 runs off 19 balls pushed Pakistan to a score of 249 runs for 6 wickets. Akram then took the wicket of Ian Botham early on during the English batting innings; and, when brought back into the bowling attack later on, with the ball reverse swinging, he produced a spell of bowling which led to Allan Lamb and Chris Lewis being bowled in successive deliveries in one over. His performances earned him the Man of the Match award for the final. In 1993, Akram took two consecutive 4-wicket hauls against Sri Lanka in Sharjah, in which 7 out of 8 wickets were either LBW or bowled. In the 1992-1993 Total International Series in South Africa (involving Pakistan, West Indies and South Africa), he took 5 wickets against South Africa and got his 200th wicket in his 143rd match. Akram took 46 wickets in calendar year 1993, his best year ever in ODIs. His average was less than 19, with an economy rate of less than 3.8 runs per over. He took six 4-wicket hauls in 1993, the most by him in any year. In the 1996 Cricket World Cup, Akram missed the quarterfinal match against India which Pakistan lost and went out of the World Cup. Wasim's great career was often tainted by controversy, not least in the Caribbean in April 1993, his maiden tour as Pakistan's captain. During the team's stop-over in Grenada, he was arrested along with three teammates--Waqar Younis, Aaqib Javed and Mushtaq Ahmed--and two female British tourists; he was charged with possession of marijuana. Between 1994 and 1996, he took 84 wickets in 39 matches. From January 1992 to December 1997, Akram played 131 matches and took 198 wickets at an average of 21.86, with 14 4-wicket hauls in ODIs. Question: why was he significant? Answer:","completion":"Wasim Akram is significant because he was an amazing cricketer, one of the best ever! Imagine this, buddy. You know how in some games, there's a hero who helps his team win? That's what Akram did for his team, many times! In a big tournament in 1992, he hit 33 runs very quickly and got out some very important players from the other team, England. This helped Pakistan win the whole tournament! Also, in a series of games in 1993, he took lots of wickets (that means he got the batsman from the opposing team out). In fact, he did this so well that year that it was his best year for taking wickets! He played many games and was very good at getting players out, but he also faced some problems, like getting in trouble with the police once. But despite these issues, his bowling skills made him a really important player. It's like if you're playing a game, and you have someone who tags everybody else out - that makes them pretty special, right? That's why Wasim Akram is significant!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You should describe the task and explain your answer.

The freighter heads right for them, blasting its horn. Despite Ashland's best efforts, the charging freighter collides with the cruise ship, sinking it. (Some of the sinking scenes were taken from the 1960 film The Last Voyage and darkened to match the nightly effect.) The next morning, a handful of survivors√¢¬Ä¬îMarshall, his wife Margaret (Howes), and their children Robin and Ben; a young officer named Nick and his love interest Lori; the ship's comic Jackie; and a passenger, Mrs. Morgan√¢¬Ä¬îare adrift on a large piece of wreckage. Ashland surfaces nearby and he's brought aboard, barely conscious. Later, the survivors come upon the black freighter, unaware it's the ship that attacked them. Finding a boarding ladder slung from the stern, they climb aboard, but not before the ladder plunges into the sea as the officers try to climb it with the injured Ashland. When all are finally aboard, Jackie tries to rally the survivors with humor, but a cable seizes him by the ankle, and he is swung outboard by one of the ship's cranes, which lowers him into the water before cutting him loose, to be swept astern and lost. Shocked, the survivors explore the corridors of the empty, echoing vessel, finding only cobwebs and 1930s memorabilia. Hatches open and close by themselves and lights go on and off while a swinging block knocks out Nick, who is exploring above deck. Meanwhile, a delirious Ashland hears a mysterious voice speaking to him in German, telling him \\"This ship has been waiting for you...It is your new ship....Your chance has come!\\" The others finally set up in a dusty bunk room, and they separate to retrieve supplies and the injured captain....

You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. Question: \\"Who were on opposite sides of the idea to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center?\\" Response: \\"The NSC\\" Options are: (a). no; (b). yes; Does the response correctly answer the question?","completion":"(b). yes; The response correctly answers the question. According to the text, the NSC staff, specifically Clarke, pushed for funding for an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center.

She carried him wrapped in a sweatshirt from the shelter at the corner where she'd been saying for months she was going to go. She set him down on the hardwood floor and he clipped around like a fawn - - clip, clip -- looking through doorways and carefully eyeing us both. He was tiny but he was strong. He was muscular and sleek, like a miniature greyhound, and we both watched intently as he clipped around, soldiering things out and whining under his breath. Miss Tennessee looked at me and smiled and said: \\"Well honey? What do you think?\\" And I told her: \\"I love the little guy.\\" He was never really my dog. He was more like my step-dog, but together we named him Steve. We thought it was funny, giving a dog a man's name like that. But it fit, like Miss Tennessee, which I started just to tease her about being full-grown and long- legged and pretty, but in a tomboyish way that made it both absolutely ridiculous and absolutely plausible that she had ever been Miss Anything. It always made her swallow a grin. Steve's name, on the other hand, made it sound like he wasn't a dog at all, but this little man. Miss Tennessee often called him that: the little man. Steve liked me okay but he loved Miss Tennessee. With me it was man things. After he got snipped or when he was stung by bees, down there, in grass that came up to his chin, he would come sit by me, hoping I'd understand. With her, it was everything else. When she took a bath, he stood with his paws on the side of the tub, and when she went someplace he couldn't go he stood where he last saw her and waited. If she went into a store and left us together in the car, he stood with his paws on the dashboard, waiting and crying and looking at me like maybe I was to blame. According to the above context, answer the following question. What is probably true about Miss Tennessee? A:","completion":"Based on the passage provided, the following can be inferred about Miss Tennessee: 1. She is an animal lover: Miss Tennessee is the one who brought the dog, Steve, home from the shelter. She had been talking about going to the shelter for months, indicating her fondness for animals and a strong desire to adopt a pet. 2. She is compassionate towards animals: She took care to carry Steve in a sweatshirt from the shelter, a sign that she wanted to ensure his comfort and safety. 3. She has a tomboyish charm: Miss Tennessee is described as being full-grown, long-legged, and pretty, but in a tomboyish way. This suggests that she has a balanced mix of feminine and tomboyish qualities, making her unique and attractive in her way. 4. She has a sense of humor: She found it funny to give a dog a man's name, which shows that she enjoys humor and doesn't take things too seriously. The name 'Miss Tennessee' also reflects this quality, as it was used to tease her but also highlighted her attractiveness and charm. 5. She shares a strong bond with her dog, Steve: The passage mentions that Steve absolutely loved Miss Tennessee. He would accompany her when she took a bath, wait for her when she went to places he couldn't, and become anxious when she left him in the car. This indicates that Miss Tennessee had a special bond with her dog and cared for him deeply. 6. She is patient and understanding: When asked for her opinion on Steve, Miss Tennessee sought the narrator's opinion first, showing that she values his thoughts and feelings. In summary, Miss Tennessee is probably a compassionate, charming, and humorous person with a strong bond with her dog, Steve. She displays both feminine and tomboyish qualities, making her an interesting and unique character."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

In 1988, Sub Pop Records LLC was formed by Pavitt and Jonathan Poneman in Seattle, Washington. Sub Pop achieved fame in the late 1980s for first signing Nirvana, Soundgarden, Mudhoney and many other bands from the Seattle alternative rock scene. They are often credited with taking the first steps toward popularizing grunge music, and have continued to achieve critical and commercial success in the new millennium, with bands such as Fleet Foxes, Foals, Beach House, The Postal Service, Flight of the Conchords, Sleater-Kinney, Blitzen Trapper, No Age, Wolf Parade and The Shins on their roster. In 1995 the owners of Sub Pop sold a 49% stake of the label to the Warner Music Group. - Jack Endino (born 1964) is an American producer and musician based in Seattle, United States. Long associated with Seattle label Sub Pop and the grunge movement, Endino worked on seminal albums from bands such as Mudhoney, Soundgarden, and Nirvana. Endino was also the guitarist for the Seattle band Skin Yard which was active between 1985 and 1992. Endino has maintained a down-to-earth and humorous website since 1997, and currently manages a studio in Seattle called Soundhouse Recording. - Skin Yard was an American grunge band from Seattle, Washington, who were active from 1985 to 1993. The group never gained a mainstream audience, but were an influence on several of their grunge contemporaries, including Soundgarden, Screaming Trees, The Melvins, and Green River. - Blues rock is a fusion genre combining elements of blues and rock. It is mostly an electric ensemble-style music with instrumentation similar to electric blues and rock. From its beginnings in the early- to mid-1960s, blues rock has gone through several stylistic shifts and along the way inspired hard rock, Southern rock, and heavy metal. Blues rock continues to be an influence, with performances and recordings by several popular artists. - Doom metal is an extreme style of heavy metal music that typically uses slower tempos, low-tuned guitars and a much \\"thicker\\" or \\"heavier\\" sound than other metal genres. Both the music and the lyrics intend to evoke a sense of despair, dread, and impending doom. The genre is strongly influenced by the early work of Black Sabbath, who formed a prototype for doom metal with songs such as \\"Black Sabbath\\", \\"Children of the Grave\\", \\"Electric Funeral\\" and \\"Into the Void\\". During the first half of the 1980s, a number of bands from England (Pagan Altar, Witchfinder General), the United States (Pentagram, Saint Vitus, Trouble) and Sweden (Candlemass, Count Raven) defined doom metal as a distinct genre. - Highlights and Lowlives is the eighth studio album by American rock band Blue Cheer , released in 1990 and produced by Jack Endino . - Punk rock (or simply \\"punk\\") is a rock music genre that developed in the early to mid 1970s in the United States, United Kingdom, and Australia. Rooted in 1960s garage rock and other forms of what is now known as \\"proto-punk\\" music, punk rock bands rejected perceived excesses of mainstream 1970s rock. Punk bands typically use short or fast-paced songs, with hard-edged melodies and singing styles, stripped-down instrumentation, and often political, anti-establishment lyrics. Punk embraces a DIY ethic; many bands self-produce recordings and distribute them through informal channels. - Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is a subgenre of alternative rock that emerged during the in the American state of Washington, particularly in Seattle. The early grunge movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop, but by the early 1990s its popularity had spread, with grunge acts in California and other parts of the U.S. building strong followings and signing major record deals. - \\"Summertime Blues\\" is a song co-written and recorded by American rockabilly artist Eddie Cochran. It was written by Cochran and his manager Jerry Capehart. Originally a single B-side, it was released in August 1958 and peaked at number 8 on the \\"Billboard\\" Hot 100 on September 29, 1958 and number 18 on the UK Singles Chart. It has been covered by many artists, including being a number-one hit for country music artist Alan Jackson, and scoring notable hits in versions by The Who and Blue Cheer. Jimi Hendrix performed it in concert. - Stoner rock or stoner metal is a musical subgenre which combines elements of heavy metal, psychedelic rock, acid rock, doom metal, and blues rock. The term desert rock is often used interchangeably with the term \\"stoner rock\\" to describe this genre; however, not all stoner rock bands would fall under the descriptor of \\"desert rock.\\" Stoner rock is typically slow-to-mid tempo and features a heavily distorted, groove laden bass-heavy sound, melodic vocals, and \\"retro\\" production. The genre emerged during the early-1990s and was pioneered foremost by the Californian bands Kyuss and Sleep. - Soundgarden is an American rock band formed in Seattle, Washington, in 1984 by singer and rhythm guitarist Chris Cornell, lead guitarist Kim Thayil, and bassist Hiro Yamamoto. Matt Cameron became the band's full-time drummer in 1986, while bassist Ben Shepherd became a permanent replacement for Yamamoto in 1990. - Blue Cheer was an American rock band that initially performed and recorded in the late 1960s and early 1970s and was sporadically active until 2009. Based in San Francisco, Blue Cheer played in a psychedelic blues rock style, and are also credited as being some of the earliest pioneers of heavy metal, with their cover of \\"Summertime Blues\\" sometimes cited as the first in the genre.

Common options include coconut oil for a rich, tropical essence, or vegetable oil for a more neutral taste. Be sure to heat the oil evenly over a medium flame, as this will ensure that the adai cooks evenly without burning or becoming too greasy. Step 2: Pour the batter Once the oil has heated, pour a ladle of batter into the frying pan. The batter should be a mixture of ground rice, legumes, and a selection of aromatic spices such as cumin, black pepper, and red chili. Water should be added to this mixture until a smooth and slightly thick consistency is reached. Pouring the batter evenly will help create a perfectly round adai that is neither too thick nor too thin. Step 3: Flip, cook, and achieve the golden brown perfection Allow the adai to cook for a few moments until its surface appears to be slightly crispy and the edges have turned golden brown. At this point, carefully flip the pancake using a spatula. Continue cooking until the other side of the adai turns golden brown as well. This crucial step will ensure that the pancake is thoroughly cooked, with a deliciously crunchy outer layer that contrasts with its soft and tender interior. Step 4: Experiment with a variety of ingredients The true charm of adai lies in its versatility, which invites creativity and innovation in the kitchen. By experimenting with different types of rice and legumes, incorporating new spices, or adding unique and unexpected ingredients such as grated vegetables, nuts, and seeds, you can create endless varieties of adai tailored to specific tastes and preferences. A popular variation, for example, is the inclusion of chopped onions and grated coconut to create a wonderful blend of flavors and textures. Conclusion In a world of ever-evolving culinary trends, the time-tested adai stands out as a delectable and versatile classic that can be easily customized to suit a wide array of tastes and preferences. By following these basic steps and exploring the many exciting directions this dish can be taken, both new and experienced chefs will find the joys of adai to be a delightful and satisfying addition to their culinary repertoire."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bowden's","completion":"Title: The Great Bowden Escape Step 1: Establish the Main Characters The story revolves around Bowden, a highly regarded scientist, who learns about a secret government project which he is vehemently opposed to. His close friends and colleagues, Emily and Michael, are determined to help him escape the clutches of the higher-ups involved in the project. The antagonist is a government agent, Douglas, who is tasked with bringing Bowden into compliance with the government's demands. Step 2: Establish the Setting The story is set in the near future, where the lines between scientific advancement and ethical boundaries are blurred. Most of the events take place within a small, secluded house on the outskirts of a bustling city. Step 3: Develop the Inciting Incident While working on a top-secret government project, Bowden uncovers the true intentions and consequences of the project - an advanced mind-controlling weapon with potentially disastrous consequences. Unfortunately, his tracks are traced, and the government officials send Agent Douglas to persuade Bowden to continue his work in silence. Step 4: Build the Main Conflict In an attempt to protect Bowden and prevent the completion of the mind-controlling weapon, Emily and Michael devise a plan to fake Bowden's departure. Unbeknownst to the government officials, they are hiding him in a secret panic room within the house. With limited time and resources, they work to dismantle the project and expose the government's dark intentions to the public. Step 5: Create a Subplot As Emily, Michael, and Bowden work towards their goal, a low-level government employee, Jenny, becomes suspicious of their activities. She begins secretly investigating them and eventually joins their cause, proving to be instrumental in their efforts to bring this information to the public. Step 6: Introduce Obstacles and Rising Tension Agent Douglas and his team find it increasingly difficult to believe that Bowden has genuinely left. As suspicion grows, the pressure on Emily, Michael, and Bowden mounts. Their efforts to expose the truth are impeded by technological challenges, government surveillance, and paranoia. Trust is tested, and secret alliances are formed. Step 7: Reach the Climax With the government closing in on the house, Emily, Michael, Bowden, and Jenny devise a plan to transmit their findings to the media. They face a heated confrontation with Agent Douglas, resulting in a high-stakes standoff. Bowden remotely triggers a data release that reveals the truth to the world. Step 8: Resolution The public outcry forces the government to shut down the mind-controlling project for good. While Emily, Michael, and Jenny face repercussions for their actions, Bowden is given a reduced sentence due to his cooperation, and Agent Douglas is reassigned. The final scene shows Bowden reunited with Emily and Michael, ready to embark upon a new, ethical scientific endeavor. In conclusion, The Great Bowden Escape revolves around the main character, Bowden, for whom his friends fake a departure and hide him in a house to protect him and stop an unethical government project. Incorporating elements of friendship, tension, and high stakes, the movie concludes with the protagonists securing a thrilling victory against the antagonist, exposing the truth, and steering the world away from a potentially disastrous scenario."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"Yes, the two questions are paraphrases of each other, as they both inquire about the purpose and function of the World Trade Center. I will provide a detailed answer below. The World Trade Center (WTC) was a complex of buildings located in Lower Manhattan, New York City. The original complex was completed in 1973 and was primarily designed for commercial purposes. Its primary function was to facilitate international trade and commerce, connecting businesses worldwide. The buildings were famous for their iconic Twin Towers, which were among the tallest in the world until their destruction in the terrorist attacks on September 11, 2001. The New World Trade Center complex has since been rebuilt, with One World Trade Center as the main building. The WTC served multiple purposes, which can be categorized as follows: 1. Office space: The WTC provided expansive office spaces for various businesses, accommodating both domestic and international companies. The Twin Towers alone had approximately 10 million square feet of rentable office space. Many prominent financial institutions, including banks, investment firms, and insurance companies had offices in the complex. 2. Trade and commerce: As a hub for international trade, the WTC had multiple dedicated spaces for exhibitions, conferences, and events related to global business. The United States Customs Service also had its New York office in the WTC complex, further highlighting its role in trade. 3. Transportation: The WTC housed the World Trade Center PATH station (Port Authority Trans-Hudson), a major public transit hub that connected New York City to New Jersey. Serving thousands of passengers daily, the PATH station was an essential part of the complex, facilitating easy access for commuters and visitors. 4. Tourism: The observation decks on the 107th floor of the North and South towers provided breathtaking views of New York City and its surroundings. These observation decks were popular tourist attractions, drawing millions of visitors each year. 5. Retail and dining: The World Trade Center complex featured an underground shopping mall called the Mall at the World Trade Center. The mall provided an array of shopping and dining options for people working in and visiting the complex. 6. Art and culture: The WTC housed many pieces of artwork, including sculptures, paintings, and tapestries. Prominent artists such as Alexander Calder and Joan Mir√≥ had works displayed in the complex, reflecting the cultural importance of the location. In conclusion, the World Trade Center served as a hub for international commerce and trade, while also providing office spaces, retail and dining options, transportation facilities, and tourist attractions. The complex was a symbol of global economic connectivity and an important part of New York City's infrastructure. The newly rebuilt World Trade Center continues to fulfill many of these functions today."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

We know that team P has 20 engineers and can complete the task in 32 days, while team Q has 16 engineers and can complete the task in 30 days. To find the working capacity of one engineer from each team, we can follow these steps: 1. Determine the work completed by each team per day. - Team P: work completed per day = 1/32 (since they complete the task in 32 days) - Team Q: work completed per day = 1/30 (since they complete the task in 30 days) 2. Determine the work completed by one engineer from each team per day. - Team P: work completed by one engineer per day = (1/32) / 20 = 1/640 - Team Q: work completed by one engineer per day = (1/30) / 16 = 1/480 3. Find the ratio between the working capacities of one engineer from each team. - Ratio: (1/640) : (1/480) To simplify the ratio, let's first find the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators: LCM(640, 480) = 3,840 Now, we can express both working capacities with the same denominator: - Team P: (6/3840) - Team Q: (8/3840) Now, we have the simplified ratio: - Ratio: 6:8 - Further simplification gives us: 3:4.

First, apparently capitalizing on the success of the two 'Superman' serials, this low budget feature was made and released to theaters, marking George Reeves' and Phyllis Coates' initial appearances as Clark Kent / Superman and Lois Lane. Part of the opening is re-used in the series. Outside the town of Silby, a six-mile deep oil well penetrates the 'hollow Earth' allowing the 'Mole-Men' to come to the surface. Forget about the other holes (those in the plot). Second, unlike most SF invasion films of the fifties, the hero plays a dominant (and controlling) force in preaching and enforcing tolerance and acceptance of difference against a raging mob of segregationist vigilantes. No 'mild mannered reporter' here! Clark Kent, knowledgeable and self-assertive, grabs control of the situation throughout (\\"I'll handle this!\\"), even assisting in a hospital gown in the removal of a bullet from a Mole-Man! As Superman, he is gentler than Clark towards the feisty Lois, but is also the voice of reason and tolerance as he rails against the vigilantes as \\"Nazi storm troopers.\\" Third, you will notice that the transition from the Fleisher-like cartoon animated flying of Superman in the two serials to the 'live action' flying in the 'Adventures of Superman' had not yet been made. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review appears to be mixed. The reviewer points out some positive aspects of the film, such as its message of tolerance and acceptance, along with the strong, self-assertive portrayal of Clark Kent/Superman.

I was VERY disappointed in the attention and attitude I received from the front desk staff. I originally booked for a two queen terrace suite 4 months in advance and we checked in two hours prior to 'Check in time'. We were told we would get notified via text when the room was available - never happened. We went to the front desk for a second time to a more helpful person and they gave us a one-bedroom suite - which we were told was an \\"upgrade\\". We needed two beds and we were told that we could get a two queen terrace suite the next day. We asked for the sofa bed to be made that evening around midnight when we would be gone and they confirmed it would be assembled upon our return back to the room. This was never done, so 2 people had to sleep on an uncomfortable sofa bed. The next morning I did call to express my disappointment, and they came to make the sofa bed at 12:00 (noon time). We asked for the two queen terrace suite (we called early around 9 am) and we were met with resistance from the front desk. I was ready to ask to be moved to another hotel immediately, but John Greene from your resort services took it upon himself to correct the situation. I have nothing but great things to say about John as he is an asset to the Cosmopolitan. I stayed at the Cosmopolitan last year and enjoyed myself to the fullest, however I cannot say the same this time. I am likely not to recommend this property to any of my colleagues, friends, or family in the near future. To be completely honest, the only thing that kept me coming back was the terrace.

It may differ from the original work by means of reharmonization, melodic paraphrasing, orchestration, or development of the formal structure. Arranging differs from orchestration in that the latter process is limited to the assignment of notes to instruments for performance by an orchestra, concert band, or other musical ensemble.

Jessie doesn't enjoy wearing her ring as much as her necklace because the","completion":"ring feels heavy and cumbersome on her finger, while the necklace feels almost weightless around her neck. Ever since she was a child, she had been enamored by the mesmerizing pendant that dangled from the delicate silver chain. It featured an intricately carved dragonfly with glittering emerald eyes, a gift from her late grandmother, whom she remembered with immense fondness. The ring, on the other hand, was something she had acquired later in life. It bore an intricately sculpted rose, crafted with skill and detail that could only be found in the work of master jewelers. Each petal was infused with varying shades of deep red, giving the rose a lifelike appearance. The ring was a gift from her fianc√©, Richard, and symbolized their love and commitment to one another. Although it held great sentimental value, Jessie couldn't help but feel weighed down by the ring's physical presence on her finger. She often found herself absentmindedly fidgeting with the ring, turning it around her finger or tapping it against nearby surfaces, much to the annoyance of her friends and co-workers. The constant reminder of the ring's presence on her finger only seemed to heighten her awareness of its weight and discomfort. One day, as she was walking through the park to clear her mind, she stumbled upon an elderly woman feeding birds by the pond. The woman had a kind, knowing smile and gentle eyes that twinkled with an air of mischief. Drawn to her, Jessie decided to approach her and strike up a conversation. As they spoke about life and love, Jessie found herself pouring her heart out about her struggles with the ring. To her surprise, the elderly woman chuckled softly and reached into her knit bag to pull out a long string of what appeared to be enchanting, iridescent crystals. \\"My dear,\\" she began, \\"I understand your plight. Sometimes, all we need are options to help us feel more at ease with our decisions.\\" With that, the old woman handed Jessie the shimmering string of crystals. Jessie was mesmerized by the beauty of them and was grateful for the gift. However, she was unsure of how they could help her situation. The elderly woman then guided Jessie through the process of removing the heavy stone from her ring, revealing a tiny secret compartment built into the band. Together, they placed the iridescent crystals inside, sealing it securely. In an instant, the ring's weight seemed to vanish, and it now rested lightly upon her finger. \\"In the past, they believed that carrying the weight of a ring with a hidden crystal could protect and empower the wearer. People would choose the crystals based on their properties and needs,\\" the woman explained. \\"These crystals will help you feel more connected and comfortable with your ring, while still honoring the love it represents.\\" Jessie gazed at the transformed ring, her heart swelling with gratitude for the stranger's thoughtful gift and the newfound sense of peace she now felt. In the days that followed, Jessie found herself feeling more connected to the ring and its symbolic meaning. She continued to wear her beloved dragonfly necklace, but now she felt the same kinship toward the rose ring that she had always appreciated about the pendant. The kindness of the elderly woman and the enchanting crystals had not only shifted her feelings about the ring but also reminded her that sometimes, the greatest burdens could be alleviated through new perspectives, creative solutions, and the wisdom of connected souls."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

As many as five million species of plants, animals, and insects (40 to 50 percent of all living things) live there, and are being lost faster than they can be found and described. Their loss is immeasurable. Take rubber for example. For many uses, only natural rubber from trees will do. _ are not good enough. Today over half the world's commercial rubber is produced in Malaysia and Indonesia, while the Amazon's rubber industry produces much of the world's four million tons. And rubber is an important material in making gloves, balloons, footwear and many sporting goods. Thousands of other tropical plants are valuable for their industrial use. Many scientists strongly believe that deforestation contributes to the greenhouse effect -- or heating of the earth from increased carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. As we destroy forests, we lose their ability to change carbon dioxide into oxygen. Carbon dioxide levels could double within the next half-century, warming the earth by as much as 4.5 degrees. The result? A partial melt-down of polar ice caps, raising sea levels as much as 24 feet; even 15 feet could threaten anyone living within 35 miles of the coast. Unbelievable? Maybe. But scientists warn that by the time we realise the severe effects of tropical deforestation, it will be 20 years too late. Can tropical deforestation affect our everyday lives? Now, you should have got the answer. Question: Which of the following might be the best title for the passage? Answer: Select from: i. Tropical Forests. ii. The Value of Tropical Forests. iii.

Context: Jonathan Swift said, ‚ÄúEverybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.‚Äù Wouldn‚Äôt it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life ‚Äì although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer‚Äôs, Parkinson‚Äôs, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. ‚Äì basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries ‚Äì it‚Äôs easier and tastier. Question: What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? Options: - not enough information - they will have an increased risk of disease - they will enjoy their food more - they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","completion":"they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Rinse quinoa in a fine mesh sieve until water runs clear, drain and transfer to a medium pot. Add 2 cups water and salt and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to medium low and simmer until water is absorbed, 15 to 20 minutes. Set aside off the heat for 5 minutes; uncover and fluff with a fork. This method (option a) is more reasonable for accomplishing the goal of making quinoa for several reasons: 1. Rinsing the quinoa: Using a fine mesh sieve is a practical way to rinse quinoa, as it ensures that the small grains won't fall through the sieve while still allowing water to pass through and remove any debris or residue. Rinsing the quinoa until the water runs clear ensures that the quinoa is thoroughly cleaned, as it may have a natural coating, called saponin, that can make the cooked quinoa taste bitter. 2. Cooking the quinoa: Adding 2 cups of water and salt to the quinoa in a medium pot provides the right ratio for cooking (1 part quinoa to 2 parts water) and enhances the flavor. Bringing this mixture to a boil and then covering the pot and reducing the heat to medium low helps to cook the quinoa evenly. Simmering the quinoa for 15 to 20 minutes is a suitable cooking time, as it allows the quinoa to absorb the water without overcooking. 3. Finishing the quinoa: Letting the cooked quinoa sit off the heat for 5 minutes helps the grains to steam, giving them a more tender and fluffy texture. Uncovering the pot and fluffing the quinoa with a fork after this time assists in separating the grains and prevents a sticky or clumpy result. On the other hand, option b includes a typo (‚Äúsleeve‚Äù instead of \\"sieve\\") and then repeats the exact same process as option a. This makes option a the clearer and better choice for preparing quinoa."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Without a second thought, I packed my bags and jumped on a plane to Singapore, and the following day I found myself looking out the airplane window at the beautiful waters surrounding the island of Langkawi off the coast of Malaysia. The last time I was in Langkawi was in 2001, when it was relatively quiet. Langkawi has come a long way since then; there are 4, 5, and even 6-star hotels, as well as spas, golfing, horseback riding and even a cable car taking visitors to the highest point on the island. At the Langkawi International Airport I met my shipmates and we were driven to Pantai Tengah with a quick pit stop for sunblock and duty-free goodies. Many other shopping opportunities abound since Langkawi was designated as a duty-free zone in 1987 to entice tourists to the island. A luxurious yacht tender picked us up. Phillipe, the first mate, maneuvered the tender between sailboats and as we went around a small island there she was, S/V Blue Gold. This majestic 10-passenger sailboat--all 165 feet of her--had been built in Italy and recently underwent a full retrofit. Once aboard, the crew welcomed us with refreshments and big smiles. Before we got too comfortable and settled into the plush comforts of the boat, Alain, the captain, took us on a tour of Blue Gold's impressive accommodations.

Part 2: The answer type is a \\"span\\" if the answer can be found in the passage. Usage: If the answer to the question can be directly extracted from the passage, we would label it as \\"span.\\" However, in this case, the question asks for a date, not a specific phrase or text from the passage.

What is the best way to: What is a good way to save money and eat healthier?","completion":"To accomplish the task of saving money and eating healthier, a step by step approach would be appropriate and the justifications for each step are also outlined: 1. **Planning out meals:** Prior to shopping for groceries, plan out your meals for the week. This means deciding what to eat for breakfast, lunch, and dinner daily. By doing so, you'll know exactly what ingredients you need for your meals, which can help you avoid purchasing unnecessary items. >Justification: Planning ahead provides control over what you eat and also avoids last-minute unhealthy food choices. It can also reduce waste by ensuring that you only buy what you will use. 2. **Creating a detailed shopping list:** After planning your meals, create a detailed list of all the ingredients needed. This will help make sure that everything needed for homemade, healthy meals is on hand. >Justification: A detailed shopping list keeps you focused and on-task, reducing the chance of impulse buys or unnecessary purchases. 3. **Cooking at home:** Rather than eating out or ordering fast food, aim to cook more meals at home. It's often healthier and less expensive. >Justification: Preparing your own meals allows you to control the ingredients and portion sizes, and it is typically much cheaper per serving than restaurant meals or pre-made meals at the grocery store. 4. **Buying fruits and vegetables that are in season:** Seasonal produce is often cheaper and fresher, which can help you save money and eat something that is healthier. >Justification: Fruits and vegetables in season are loaded with nutrients and flavor. Plus, they cost less because they are more abundantly available. 5. **Batch cooking and freezing:** Cook large quantities and freeze individual meals. This approach can save both time and money since buying in bulk is often cheaper. >Justification: This method reduces the risk of you turning to expensive, less healthy options when you do not have time to cook. 6. **Avoid buying processed foods:** Processed foods often come with a higher price tag and are not as healthy as wholesome, fresh foods. >Justification: Processed foods often contain high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats, as well as preservatives. By avoiding these foods, you can improve your health and potentially save money. 7. **Drinking water instead of sugary drinks:** It's not only a healthier choice, but also a money-saving move. >Justification: Sugary drinks contribute to weight gain and other health issues, and they're also an added expense. Water is virtually free and has zero calories. Executing these steps effectively would help you in saving money and eating healthier."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She is one of only two ships of the United States to be named after a monarch. She was later reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated SSN-642. Based on that paragraph can we conclude that this sentence is true? The submarine did not house missles","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, we cannot conclude that the sentence \\"The submarine did not house missiles\\" is true. In fact, the paragraph states that USS Kamehameha (SSBN-642) was a \\"Benjamin Franklin\\"-class ballistic missile submarine. The SSBN classification itself implies that it was specifically designed to carry ballistic missiles. The \\"Benjamin Franklin\\"-class submarines were developed during the Cold War and were equipped with ballistic missiles as their primary armament. These submarines were designed as part of the United States' nuclear deterrent strategy, carrying missiles with nuclear warheads that could be launched at targets across the globe if needed. Initially, they were equipped with Polaris missiles and later transitioned to the Poseidon missile system in the late 1960s. Later, the USS Kamehameha was reclassified as an attack submarine and redesignated as SSN-642, which can give a hint that it might have undergone some changes in its armament configuration. However, even though the focus of its mission shifted more towards its attack capabilities, it is incorrect to conclude that the submarine did not house missiles at any point in its service. Instead, we could infer that during its time as a ballistic missile submarine (SSBN-642), it did carry ballistic missiles, and later as an attack submarine (SSN-642), it might have carried different types of armament, such as cruise missiles, torpedoes, or mines. In summary, it would be incorrect to claim that the submarine did not house missiles based on the paragraph provided. The USS Kamehameha, as a \\"Benjamin Franklin\\"-class ballistic missile submarine, was designed to carry ballistic missiles during a portion of its service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are Bigger or Smaller ): The size of an ocean wave depends on how fast, over how great a distance, and how long the wind blows. The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be. John was watching the ocean from the beach and after a long period of observation, he concluded that the less wind there is, that the waves will become Bigger or Smaller? The answer is:","completion":"To determine the answer to this question, let's break down the information given in the passage step by step. Step 1: Understand the main factors affecting the size of ocean waves The passage states that three factors determine the size of ocean waves: the speed of the wind, the distance the wind blows, and the duration the wind blows. Step 2: Analyze the relationship between the factors and the size of the waves The passage tells us that \\"The greater each of these factors is, the bigger a wave will be\\". This means that if any of these factors increase, the size of the wave will also increase. Step 3: Apply the given information to John's observation John observed the ocean for a long period and made a conclusion about the relationship between wind and wave size. The question asks what will happen to the wave size if there is less wind. Step 4: Compare the factors and make a conclusion If there is less wind, it means the speed of the wind is lower. Referring back to the passage, we understand that a greater wind speed contributes to a bigger wave size. Thus, when the wind speed is lower (less wind), the wave size will be smaller. So, the answer is: Smaller."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Possible answers: 1). yes 2). it is not possible to tell 3). no","completion":"The given premise is \\"Miss Universe contest.\\" Based on this premise, we can analyze whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There is a Miss Universe contest.\\" To make this analysis, we should first understand the meaning of entailment in the context of logic and reasoning. Entailment refers to a relationship between statements where the truth of one statement necessarily implies the truth of another statement. In other words, if a statement A is true, then statement B must be true as well. This is also known as logical consequence or logical implication. Now, let's examine the given premise and hypothesis. The premise is \\"Miss Universe contest,\\" which refers to the existence of a beauty pageant called Miss Universe. The hypothesis is \\"There is a Miss Universe contest,\\" which is essentially stating the same thing with the existence and acknowledgment of such a competition. With these definitions in mind, we can analyze the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis. If the premise is true and there is a Miss Universe contest, then it would automatically imply that the hypothesis stating \\"There is a Miss Universe contest\\" is also true. Consequently, the truth of the premise necessarily leads to the truth of the hypothesis.

In late February one bitcoin was worth √Ç¬£22 (33) but now each one sells for about √Ç¬£60 (90). Thieves who run networks of hijacked PCs are increasingly using these machines to create or \\"mine\\" the coins. But bitcoin miners say thieves will struggle to keep up, as coin-generating technology becomes more sophisticated. As a virtual currency, bitcoins depend on a wide network of closely connected computers to log who holds the coins and where they are spent. That network also shares information about who is \\"mining\\" the coins. Mining involves solving a hard mathematical problem and miners typically use large numbers of computers to speed up the number crunching involved. \\"Botnet mining is fundamentally theft of private property, illegal and unethical,\\" Jeff Garzik, a bitcoin developer told the BBC, adding that bitcoin miners had battled botnets for years, seeing them as a \\"cost and a burden\\" they just had to deal with. Many cyber-thieves who control botnets, large networks of home PCs compromised with a virus, were using them as a dedicated mining pool in a bid to generate bitcoins for themselves, said Derek Manky, senior security strategist at Fortinet. The operators of one of the biggest current botnets, known as ZeroAccess, had recently ramped up their efforts to use machines they control to mine bitcoins, he said, adding that millions of infected PCs were unwittingly enrolled in the criminal network. \\"ZeroAccess has employed an affiliate model,\\" he said. \\"They pay other people to install malware for them.\\" The operators of ZeroAccess were making so much money that they were paying high prices for each infection. Current rates ran at about 100 (√Ç¬£65) for every 1,000 infections, said Mr Manky. As well as mining bitcoins, PCs enrolled in ZeroAccess were also being used to poison search results - to cause users to unwittingly click on booby-trapped web pages - or fraudulently click on adverts to generate revenue. \\"ZeroAccess has been extremely profitable,\\" said Mr Manky. The wider bitcoin community was aware of the efforts botnet owners were making to produce their own cash, said Mr Manky. \\"They try to detect and remove these transactions but it's a bit of a cat and mouse game,\\" he said. \\"The operators of ZeroAccess know about that and just change their tactics.\\" However, said Mr Garzik, criminal participation in bitcoin mining was likely to get much less profitable as professional miners turned away from using desktop PCs to generate the coins. Increasingly, he said, professional miners were using custom-made chips, called Asics (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits), to mine because such processors worked faster. \\"It is theorised that the current shift in bitcoin mining to 'Asic' miners - the fastest and most advanced generation - will simply make it unprofitable for botnet miners,\\" said Mr Garzik. Vitalik Buterin, technical editor at Bitcoin Magazine, said the the rise of Asic mining meant cyber-thieves would soon be pushed out. Currently, he said, only about one-third of all professional miners were using Asics, but as that proportion grew, the number of bitcoins that could be generated with a botnet would shrink. \\"The fact that botnets are (somewhat) viable now is basically an aberration resulting from the massive price increase that has not yet been matched by increased mining activity,\\" he said. \\" Once Bitcoin stabilises again the botnets will rapidly crawl back into the shadows.\\"","completion":"This article explains that cyber thieves are using hijacked computer networks to create or \\"mine\\" bitcoins, but as bitcoin mining technology becomes more sophisticated, it will be harder for them to keep up."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The War of the Limburg Succession, was a series of conflicts between 1283 and 1289 for the succession in the Duchy of Limburg. The cause of the War of the Limburg Succession was the death of Waleran IV, Duke of Limburg in 1280, and his only daughter Ermengarde of Limburg in 1283. Waleran IV had no sons and Ermengarde had no children. Ermergarde had married Reginald I of Guelders, who now claimed the Duchy of Limburg. However, Waleran's nephew Adolf VIII of Berg, son of his elder brother Adolf VII of Berg, also claimed the Duchy. Unable to assert his claims, he sold them in 1283 to the mighty John I, Duke of Brabant. Between 1283 and 1288, several smaller confrontations occurred between both sides, none of them decisive. Meanwhile, most of the other local powers chose sides. Siegfried II of Westerburg, the Archishop of Cologne and ruler of the Electorate of Cologne, traditional enemy of the Duke of Brabant, forged an alliance with Reginald I, joined by Henry VI, Count of Luxembourg, and his brother Waleran I of Luxembourg, Lord of Ligny, as well as by Adolf, King of Germany. On the other side the Counts of Mark took the chance to affirm their independence from the Archbishop of Cologne and together with the Counts of Loon, Tecklenburg, and Waldeck allied with Brabant and Berg. The citizens of the City of Cologne, eager to emancipate themselves from the Archbishop's rule, also joined this alliance. After the decisive Battle of Worringen in 1288, won by Duke John I of Brabant and his allies, the Duchy of Limburg came in the possession of the Duke of Brabant. The City of Cologne gained its independence from the Archbishopric and finally the status of an Imperial city in 1475.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Here's a question and a few possible answers: Q: What can cause someone to want to go somewhere else because it's so smelly? Possible A: rose bush, go back, die, arrive there, fart Why is \\"fart\\" an answer aligned with human common sense? Answer:","completion":"\\"Fart\\" is an answer aligned with human common sense because the question pertains to unpleasant smells causing someone to want to leave a particular location. When we interpret the question more deeply, it is evident that it asks why a particular place would smell so bad that it compels individuals to exit. Hence, we are looking for an answer associated with producing an unpleasant smell that can potentially disrupt individuals present in the surrounding vicinity. Among the options provided, \\"fart\\" aligns with the context of the question. According to human common sense and everyday experiences, a fart, which is the release of gas from the digestive system through the rectum, can produce a foul smell. It's a natural process and everybody does it; however, it can be embarrassing and uncomfortable for others in closed environments because of the associated smell. This can lead to discomfort and, as a result, people might wish to leave the place. Therefore, it justifies why someone would want to move to another location. As for the other options: 'rose bush' generally has a pleasant fragrance and would more likely attract people rather than repel them. 'Go back' and 'arrive there' are actions that don't specifically relate to the generation of a smell at all. 'Die' might be associated with the smell of decomposition, but it's macabre and less likely to be considered in a common conversation unless in a very specific context. Thus, \\"fart\\", being associated with an unpleasant smell eliciting a common human reaction of wanting to leave a smelly place, is the most suitable answer amongst the provided options, aligned with everyday human observations and common sense."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer this question: who assumes office if the president is impeached?","completion":"To answer this question, I will look into the procedure of presidential impeachment and what happens when the president is removed from office. Step 1: Understanding Impeachment Impeachment is the process by which a legislative body brings charges against a government official, including the president. In the United States, the House of Representatives is responsible for bringing articles of impeachment, while the Senate conducts the impeachment trial. Step 2: Outcome of Impeachment Trial If the Senate votes to convict the president on any of the articles of impeachment with a two-thirds majority, the president is removed from office. It's important to note that impeachment itself does not automatically remove the president from office; it is merely the formal accusation. Step 3: Order of Succession Following a president's removal from office, the order of succession comes into play. In the United States, the Presidential Succession Act establishes the line of succession for filling the vacancy left by a removed president. Step 4: Identifying the Successor According to the U.S. Presidential Succession Act, the first person in line to assume office if the president is removed from office is the Vice President. In this case, the Vice President would be immediately sworn in as the new President of the United States. In conclusion, if the president is impeached and ultimately removed from office, the Vice President assumes office as the new President."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

For week four, the Bears donned their 1940s throwbacks when they hosted the 1-2 Packers, the Bears having led the all-time series 93-89-2, but the Packers had won 9 of the previous 11 games. On offense, the Bears' worst-ranked rushing game (64 yards per game) had a chance to produce against the Packers, who were ranked 30th by allowing 156 yards per game, while opponents had run a league-most 37.3 times per game while scoring an also league-high five rushing touchdowns. Also, Matt Forte had recorded 336 yards and four touchdowns against the Packers in his last two games. The offense also was challenged by the pass defense, with defenders Sam Shields and Tramon Williams, who were stingy in man coverage. For the Bears' defense, the Packers had also struggled on the run, ranking 26th in the league with a 78-yard rushing average and the longest run being of 17 yards, while having averaged only 3.63 yards per carry. Additionally, Green Bay was ranked 28th in the league in yards. However, the team faced the Packers' passing attack, which featured the receiving duo of Jordy Nelson and Randall Cobb. The former led the league in targets (37) and first downs (16), while ranking second in receiving yards (351), while the Bears had struggled with covering slant and dig routes, both of which Nelson excelled at. The latter had three touchdowns in 2014, but was used primarily for hitch and stick routes. The Packers were two-point favorites. Sherrick McManis, Shea McClellin, Roberto Garza, Matt Slauson, Jared Allen, Charles Leno, Jr., and Jeremiah Ratliff were inactive. Kyle Long, Alshon Jeffery, and Ryan Mundy served as team captains for the game, while the honorary captains were Dick Butkus and Kurt Becker. The Packers won the coin toss, and decided to kick. On the first drive, the Bears scored on Jay Cutler's six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Marshall, which the Packers responded with Eddie Lacy's two-yard touchdown run. During Chicago's next drive, on 4th and 1, Cutler fumbled the snap, and upon picking up the ball, recorded a 16-yard run on an accidental fumblerooski. The drive continued into the second quarter, ended with Robbie Gould kicking a 23-yard field goal. The two teams exchanged touchdowns on the final three plays: Aaron Rodgers' three-yard pass to Nelson, Cutler's eight-yard pass to Jeffery, and Rodgers' 22-yard pass to Cobb. The Bears reached the Packers' nine-yard line by the final play of the first half; on the play, Cutler's pass for Bennett was ruled short of a touchdown. During the television review, Micah Hyde covered the camera angle, preventing the touchdown and ending the half with the Packers leading 21-17. In the third quarter, the Packers drove to the Bears' 34-yard line, where Rodgers completed a touchdown pass to Davante Adams, which would be nullified by a holding penalty on center Corey Linsley; Crosby would eventually kick a 53-yard field goal. Afterwards, Cutler's pass for Josh Morgan would be tipped by Williams and intercepted by Clay Matthews, with Green Bay capitalizing on the takeaway with Rodgers' 11-yard touchdown pass to Nelson. On the next drive, Shields intercepted Cutler, and Crosby kicked a 23-yard field goal; however, a holding penalty on Jon Bostic led to Rodgers' three-yard touchdown pass to Cobb. On Chicago's next drive, Williams intercepted Cutler, but the play would be nullified; the Bears would subsequently punt. On the Packers' next drive, they would reach the Bears' 20-yard line before Crosby's field goal was blocked by Willie Young, the first block by the Bears in over a year. Jimmy Clausen replaced Cutler on the final drive, and the Bears ran out the clock to end the game. The Bears recorded 496 yards, the first time since 1979 against the Minnesota Vikings that the Bears recorded such yardage and lost. The last time the team recorded more than 496 yards and lost occurred in 1947 against the Los Angeles Rams and Chicago Cardinals. Additionally, the rushing attack recorded 102 yards in the first quarter, the first time Chicago recorded at least 100 rushing yards in the first quarter since 2010 against the Carolina Panthers. The game was only the second in NFL history to have no total punts.

Answer the following question: I'm taking a test and have to guess the right answer to the question after the article. Article: For Yali Liu, the hardest thing about UK higher education is having to go to the pub. \\"It's how much you need to invest socially with other students,\\" she says. \\"I don't like going to a pub or club, but people just keep going out and I feel the pressure to go out too.\\" This is because, unlike in China, she says, there is so much emphasis during the course on teamwork and group projects, so socialising with other students - especially British people, is crucial. Liu, 23, who is in her final year of a BSc in business administration at the University of Bath, is one of more than 80,000 Chinese students studying in UK universities. They are responsible for a large proportion of the more than PS10bn a year that international students contribute to the UK economy. However, research shows that where their academic attainment is concerned, the picture is not satisfactory. While nearly 58% of all students - and 45% of overseas students graduated with a first-class degree last year, this was true of only 35% of students from China. To find an explanation, Zhiqi Wang and Ian Crawford, lecturers at the University of Bath, compared the performance of Chinese and British undergraduates in each year of their degree. Taking a sample of 100 British and Chinese students and comparing their average marks and final degree classification, they found a dramatic drop in performance among the Chinese students between year one, when they performed better than their UK counterparts, and year two, when they performed worse. They believe the drop results from two factors. First, Chinese students fail to adapt their approaches to learning and so their performance declines in the later years when the complexity of the work increases. Second, many young people in China enroll in higher education due to pressure from family rather than their own motivation. Professor Sedghi thinks part of the problem may be the changing socio-economic background of Chinese undergraduates. While 85% of Chinese students at British universities before 2000...

And that's a bad thing, because at least if this had been a Troma film, it would have had wanton violence and a greater sense of anarchic abandon that might have brought my rating up a bit. So what we have instead is a very tame (rated PG), barely lukewarm, low budget (Roger Corman produced it with an unknown director who has subsequently remained unknown) Gremlins (1984)/Critters (1986)-wannabe with almost exclusively flat humor, little of the logic that made Gremlins work so well--fantasy logic or not, no suspense, no sense of adventure, and no violence or nudity to make up for it. Although I'm sure some of the problems with the film are inherent in the script--let's face it, no one could deliver these jokes so that they would be funny--it seems like the biggest blame has to fall into the lap of the director, Bettina Hirsch. In more capable hands, Munchies could have been entertaining. After all, it starts out like many great adventure films. Simon Waterman (Harvey Korman) and his son Paul (Charles Stratton) are in Peru on an archaeological dig. Simon is a bit of a wacky archaeologist who is always floating theories about the connections between ancient sites and alien civilizations. For example, he thinks he sees evidence of laser-cutting on ancient stonework. So they're at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simon's theories when they happen upon a secret chamber. Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub \\"Arnold\\", one of the titular munchies. They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town. Simon, who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature, has to go off to a colleague's lecture, and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen. Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend, Cindy (Nadine Van der Velde), are left in charge of Arnold, but as they haven't seen each other in a long time, they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sack. Meanwhile, Simon's brother Cecil (played also by Korman in a dual role), owner of a successful snack foods company, is eager to buy off Simon's home and land--they're adjacent to his own. Simon doesn't want to sell, so Cecil hits upon a scheme to steal Arnold. Things gradually spiral out of control, and the munchies, who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food, begin to overrun the town. That reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen. The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background, such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town. Interiors, with the exception of Cecil's home, tend to look like poorly decorated, cheap sets, and more importantly, they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots. Oddly, given the paucity of the production design overall, Cecil's home is quite a gem, imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details, and Cecil's stepson, Dude (Jon Stafford), was an amusing counterpoint. Too bad, then, that he's out of the film so quickly. At any rate, Korman is a fun actor, but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil. Unfortunately, Simon ends up being absent for most of the film. Cecil, who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair, is not only the \\"evil capitalist\\" of the film, he's one of Korman's classic inconsiderate, boorish characters--that was one of his specialties, frequently capitalized on in \\"Carol Burnett Show\\" (1967) skits. Unlike \\"The Carol Burnett Show\\", which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos, Hirsch reins Korman in way too far, and the Cecil character just doesn't work the way it should. There are a lot of other director-related problems, not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing, which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film. Even scenes that should have been shoe-ins for amping up the drama--such as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the road--are put together far too awkwardly to have much affect. There are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands. Where did the munchie in the chamber at Machu Picchu come from? The film's trailer seems to show an answer to this, but it was edited out of the final cut. A more serious problem is that, unlike gremlins, there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute, cuddly furballs to menacing monsters. It just happens. Further, because Munchies was kept PG, and the violence remains toned down, when the creatures are in their monster phase, they're never very threatening. They're also easily dispatched, at least temporarily. Admittedly, the gist of the film isn't suspense, horror, compelling drama or any of that other stuff, but humor. It's intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless rip-offs in its wake. The only problem with that is that the film just isn't funny, even though I chuckled a couple times. A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clich√©s. Too much of the remaining material consists of non-sequiturs. Given bad timing from Hirsch, it all just falls flat.

Please answer the following question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn play hooky from school and have a plan to revive a dead cat with the spirit of a man named Hoss Williams who is on his death bed. Sawyer and Finn talk with Muff Potter, the town drunk, but are interrupted when Injun Joe says that Doc Robinson wants to see them. Muff and Joe meet Robinson and he informs them that they have a job to dig the grave of Williams. Joe is angry that Robinson didn't fix his leg correctly. Meanwhile, Tom continues to skip school and comes up with fantastic stories about why he's not home for dinner, where he tricks the children of the town to do his punishment chores for him. After Williams dies, the two go to the cemetery and find out that Muff and Joe are digging up a grave on the advice of Robinson. Joe continues to be angry at Robinson and demands more money for the job. When Robinson refuses, Injun Joe picks up a shovel, accidentally knocking Muff out, hits Doc Robinson into the grave with the shovel, then grabs Muff's knife and jumps in after Doc Robinson. Tom and Huck witness all this and then run off, making a pact not to tell anyone what they saw. Joe frames Muff for the murder and Muff goes to jail. Meanwhile, the beautiful Becky Thatcher moves to town which sends Sawyer into a romantic daze. At the trial for Muff, Tom is unable to contain himself as Joe is called to the stand and lies about the incident, continuing to frame Muff for the murder.

Purchase an ozone generator and hook a plastic tube to fit the valve where the ozone is released. Place the other end of the tube into the water container. Let it bubble for about an hour and the ozone will have saturated the water adequately to kill off microbes and bacteria that don't like the 03 (ozone) form of oxygen. (2). Take your drinking water jug outside and leave it in a place where it is protected from flying or crawling creatures. After an hour the natural ozone and sunlight will have been absorbed into your water which will have saturated the water adequately to kill off microbes and bacteria that don't like the 03 (ozone) form of oxygen.","completion":"Alright, imagine you want to make your drinking water cleaner and safer. There are two ideas that people suggest. Let's talk about them like you're five years old. 1. The first idea is to buy a special machine called an \\"ozone generator.\\" This machine makes a special kind of oxygen called \\"ozone.\\" You would connect a plastic tube to the machine and put the other end in your water container. The ozone from the machine would then go into the water and make lots of little bubbles for about an hour. This helps make the water clean because the ozone kills tiny germs that can make us sick. 2. The second idea is to take your water jug outside and let it sit in the sunlight for an hour. The sunshine and the natural ozone in the air will also help clean the water. But, you need to protect the jug from bugs and other creatures that might get in the water. Between these two ideas, the first one with the ozone generator will do a better job of cleaning the water. This is because the machine makes a lot of ozone, which can really help get rid of the tiny germs. The second idea with the sunlight might help a little bit, but it won't be as good as using the ozone generator."},{"prompt":"Select from: -Yes; -No; Tracy adopted a child last week.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Circulatory System Changes Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30 percent, or approximately 1‚Äì2 liters. The greater blood volume helps to manage the demands of fetal nourishment and fetal waste removal. In conjunction with increased blood volume, the pulse and blood pressure also rise moderately during pregnancy. As the fetus grows, the uterus compresses underlying pelvic blood vessels, hampering venous return from the legs and pelvic region. As a result, many pregnant women develop varicose veins or hemorrhoids. Q: Blood volume increases substantially during pregnancy, so that by childbirth, it exceeds its preconception volume by 30 percent, or approximately what?

Based on the premise \\"Adrin winced and rolled his shoulder twice.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Adrin felt no pain in his shoulder.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the premise \\"Adrin winced and rolled his shoulder twice,\\" we cannot conclude that the hypothesis \\"Adrin felt no pain in his shoulder\\" is true. In fact, the given premise suggests the opposite. The statement reveals two important actions that Adrin performs, both of which imply discomfort or pain in his shoulder: 1. Adrin winced: Wincing is a facial expression or an involuntary flinch that is generally associated with pain, discomfort, or sudden distress. The fact that Adrin winces suggests that he is experiencing some level of discomfort or pain, which contradicts the hypothesis that he feels no pain in his shoulder. 2. Adrin rolled his shoulder twice: Rolling one's shoulder is a common action people take when attempting to alleviate discomfort, stiffness, or pain in the shoulder area. The fact that Adrin does this twice reinforces the idea that he is experiencing at least some level of discomfort. Considering these actions, it is highly unlikely that Adrin felt no pain in his shoulder. Rather, the premise suggests that he is experiencing some degree of discomfort or pain that prompted him to wince and roll his shoulder. Furthermore, we cannot draw any conclusions about the severity of Adrin's shoulder pain or the cause of his discomfort based on the given premise alone. We would need more information and context to determine factors like the intensity of his pain, the cause of his discomfort (such as an injury, strain, or some other reason), and whether it is a chronic or acute issue. However, the hypothesis \\"Adrin felt no pain in his shoulder\\" is contradicted by the premise provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Goalkeepers are normally allowed to handle the ball within their own penalty area, and once they have control of the ball in their hands opposition players may not challenge them for it. However the back-pass rule prohibits goalkeepers from handling the ball after it has been deliberately kicked to them by a team-mate, or after receiving it directly from a throw-in taken by a team-mate. Back-passes with parts of the body other than the foot, such as headers, are not prohibited. Despite the popular name \`\`back-pass rule'', there is no requirement in the laws that the kick or throw-in must be backwards; handling by the goalkeeper is forbidden regardless of the direction the ball travels.

During a quiet moment, I announced it was now Dad's turn to listen to stories for a change. I wanted everyone to tell Dad what we loved about him. The room became quiet. Then one after another, people told stories from their hearts, while Dad listened with tears in eyes. Everyone seemed to have more than one story. Even the little grandchildren couldn't wait to tell Dad why they loved him. For a man who had been kind to so many hundreds of people in his life, here was our chance to tell him how much we love him. A few months later, at Dad's memorial service, we more fully realized what we had given to Dad that night.

In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Cream blushes don't have to contain dangerous chemicals. By making your own cream blush, you get to decide exactly what goes into it‚Äîand you can customize the color too. This section will teach you how to make your own cream blush. You can apply it using your fingers or makeup sponge. Fill the bottom pot with an inch or two of water and place the upper pot on top. Transfer everything to the stove and turn the stove on to a medium heat. If you do not have a double boiler, then you can make your own by filling a large pot with an inch or two of water, and placing a large bowl over it. The bottom of the bowl should not touch the water. You will need 1 teaspoon of shea butter and ¬Ω teaspoon of emulsifying wax. Place both ingredients into the upper pot or bowl of your double boiler. Heat the two ingredients until they melt. Be sure to stir them while they are melting with a spoon or spatula. This helps the butter and wax melt more evenly, and it mixes them together. Once the shea butter and emulsifying wax have melted completely, turn the stove off and move the double boiler to a heat-resistant surface. The mixture in the pot should look translucent, and there should be no clumps. Once the mixture has cooled slightly, measure out 1 tablespoon of aloe gel and transfer it to the mixture. Blend everything together with a spoon or spatula. Try to use a clear aloe gel, as opposed to a tinted one. Add both your mica and cocoa powders a little bit at a time until you get the color you want. You can use any color of mica powders you want, but pinks and reds might yield the best and most natural results. The cocoa powders will help darken the blush. If you wish to have a lighter blush, then use less cocoa. You will need ¬Ω to 1 teaspoon of each powder, depending on your preferences. Consider dipping a spoon into the mixture, letting it cool, and holding it against your cheek to make sure you have the right color. Once you have achieved the color you want, transfer everything into a small, seal-able jar using a spoon or spatula. Leave the jar in a cool place, unopened, until it has solidified, then seal the jar tightly with a lid. Wait 24 hours before using the blush. This allows it to solidify. You can leave your container as is, or you can personalize it further by adding a personalized label or embellishing it with stick-on gems.","completion":"This article provides a step-by-step guide on creating your own chemical-free, customizable cream blush using natural ingredients, a double boiler, and blending mica and cocoa powders for the desired color."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The action scenes were very exciting and clever, but I had trouble keeping up with the visuals. 6. Writing and directing \\"Avengers: Age of Ultron,\\" Joss Whedon proves he has a superpower of his own: mediocrity. 7. Lovable characters, just the right amount of humor and spectacular action make \\"Ultron\\" a worthy bridge to whatever happens next in The Avengers' universe. 8. Still light and funny, but the novelty's worn off, and the bloat and repetition are starting to show 9.

It seems the two characters are part of a pack of supernatural or magical beings (specifically \\"Lykan\\"). The female is described as being able to keep up with Lucien, who is noted to be extremely fast. Step 2: Introduce a new event in the story As they return to the pack, a brown Lykan female joins them, flanking the other female (the protagonist) on either side. This new character has a more long and languid appearance, along with blue eyes that appear to be laughing as she looks questioningly between the protagonist and Lucien. Step 3: Develop interactions between characters The protagonist will notice the brown Lykan female's gaze and feel compelled to interpret the situation. In turn, she will be curious to understand the relationship between her, Lucien, and the newcomer. Step 4: Add dialogue and personal reflections to enrich the story The protagonist might reflect on her feelings towards Lucien, the pack dynamics, and how the presence of the other Lykan adds intrigue to the situation. Step 5: Connect the interactions to the upcoming events in the story This encounter may lead to the development of new alliances, rivalries, or revelations about the characters and their roles within the pack. Story continuation: The protagonist noticed the brown Lykan female's questioning gaze, and with it came an odd sensation, a mix of curiosity and concern. She couldn't help but wonder what the newcomer wanted, or if there was any hidden intention behind her eyes. \\"What's so funny?\\" she inquired, her voice equally curious and assertive. The brown Lykan female tilted her head, her eyes sparkling as she replied, \\"Oh, nothing. I was just admiring the rapport between you two. It's rare to see Lucien being so comfortable with someone else from the pack.\\" The protagonist found herself blushing at the implication, but she quickly recovered. \\"We were just heading back to the pack. Lucien was showing me his running skills.\\" \\"Well, it's nice to see you two getting along so well,\\" said the newcomer, a playful grin forming on her face. \\"I'm Ellara, by the way.\\" \\"And I'm Yara,\\" the protagonist introduced herself. As they continued running, Yara began to feel the subtle shift in the pack's dynamics. Ellara's presence added an air of mystery, and she could sense the unspoken questions lingering in the air. It was clear that their journey back to the pack was no ordinary one, and that perhaps, she, Lucien, and Ellara had important roles to play in the future of their pack."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In business, net income (total comprehensive income, net earnings, net profit, informally, bottom line) is an entity's income minus cost of goods sold, expenses and taxes for an accounting period. It is computed as the residual of all revenues and gains over all expenses and losses for the period, and has also been defined as the net increase in shareholders' equity that results from a company's operations. In the context of the presentation of financial statements, the IFRS Foundation defines net income as synonymous with profit and loss. Is it true that is net earning the same as net income?","completion":"Yes, net earnings and net income are often used interchangeably in the context of financial performance and financial reporting. Both terms refer to the same financial metric that illustrates a company's profitability after accounting for all its costs, expenses, and taxes over a specific accounting period. To provide a detailed understanding of net income and net earnings, let's break down each component of the formula: 1. Revenues: Also known as sales, revenues represent the amounts a company earns from its primary business activities, such as selling products or services to customers. It is crucial to note that revenue is recognized when the transaction occurs, not necessarily when cash is received. 2. Gains: These are profits from non-operating or secondary activities, such as selling fixed assets or other investments. Gains can be either realized (when the asset is sold) or unrealized (when the asset's market price increases without selling it). Generally, gains are not as common as revenues and are not considered a primary source of income. 3. Cost of Goods Sold (COGS): This is the direct cost associated with producing or acquiring the goods or services a company sells. COGS typically includes material costs, labor costs directly tied to production, and manufacturing overhead expenses. 4. Expenses: These are costs incurred during regular business operations that are not directly linked to producing or acquiring goods and services, such as administrative expenses, marketing expenses, salaries, rent, utilities, research and development costs, etc. 5. Taxes: This is the liability a company has towards tax authorities based on its taxable income. Companies often need to estimate their tax liabilities and integrate them into their income statement. 6. Accounting Period: This is the time span covered by the financial statement, typically a fiscal quarter or fiscal year. When you calculate net income or net earnings, you take the total revenues and gains the company has earned during the accounting period and subtract all the costs, expenses, and taxes. The resulting figure demonstrates the company's ability to generate profit from its operations and other activities. In summary, net earnings and net income are essentially the same concept in the realm of financial accounting and reporting. Both terms are used to describe a company's profitability after accounting for all costs, expenses, and taxes during a defined accounting period. Entities may use either term in their financial statements, and investors and analysts often treat them synonymously when assessing a company's financial performance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context: After a few years of peace, the Ottoman Empire attacked the Habsburg Empire again. The Turks almost captured the Empire's capital of Vienna, but king of Poland John III Sobieski led a Christian alliance that defeated them in the Battle of Vienna, which shook the Ottoman Empire's hegemony in south-eastern Europe. A new Holy League was initiated by Pope Innocent XI and encompassed the Holy Roman Empire , joined by the Venetian Republic and Poland in 1684 and the Tsardom of Russia in 1686. Ottomans suffered two decisive defeats against the Holy Roman Empire: the second Battle of Moh√°cs in 1687 and the Battle of Zenta a decade later, in 1697. On the smaller Polish front, after the battles of 1683 , Sobieski, after his proposal for the League to state a major coordinated offensive, undertook a rather unsuccessful offensive in Moldavia in 1686, with the Ottomans refusing a major engagement and harassing the army. For the next four years Poland would blockade the key fortress at Kamenets, and Ottoman Tatars would raid the borderlands. In 1691, Sobieski undertook another expedition to Moldavia, with slightly better results, but still with no decisive victories. The last battle of the campaign was the Battle of Podhajce in 1698, where Polish hetman Feliks Kazimierz Potocki defeated the Ottoman incursion into the Commonwealth. The League won the war in 1699 and forced the Ottoman Empire to sign the Treaty of Karlowitz. The Ottomans lost much of their European possessions, with Podolia returned to Poland.

Given the question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What do Arkham's inhabitants do to the warlock? , can you please find it? In 1765, the inhabitants of Arkham, Massachusetts, are suspicious of the strange phenomena surrounding the grand \\"palace\\" that overlooks the town. They suspect the palace's owner, Joseph Curwen, is a warlock. A young girl wanders up to the palace in a trance-like state. She is led by Curwen and his mistress, Hester, down into the dungeons. The girl is subjected to a strange ritual, in which an unseen creature rises up from a covered pit. The townspeople observe the girl wandering off, and they storm the palace to confront its owner. Though the girl appears unharmed, the townspeople surmise that she has been bewitched to forget what happened to her. They drag Curwen out to a tree where they intend to burn him. The mob leader, Ezra Weeden, insists that they do not harm Hester (to whom he had been previously engaged to marry). Before being burned alive, Curwen puts a curse on Arkham and its inhabitants and their descendants, promising to rise from the grave to take his revenge. In 1875, 110 years later, Curwen's great-great-grandson, Charles Dexter Ward, and his wife Anne arrive in Arkham after inheriting the palace. They find the townsfolk hostile towards them and are disturbed by the horrific deformities that afflict many of Arkham's inhabitants. Charles is surprised by how well he seems to know the palace and struck by his strong resemblance to a portrait of Curwen. He and Anne meet Simon, the palace caretaker, who persuades them to stay at the palace and to forget the townspeoples' hostility. Charles becomes more and more obsessed with the portrait of Curwen, and at times seems to change in his personality. The answer is:","completion":"The inhabitants of Arkham suspect Joseph Curwen of being a warlock due to the strange phenomena surrounding his palace.

Information: - The Swedish Empire refers to the Kingdom of Sweden's territorial control of much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries, a time when Sweden was one of the great European powers. The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and the end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. In Swedish history, the period is referred to as \\"stormaktstiden\\", literally meaning \\"the Great Power era\\". - Yakov Karlovich Grot ( Russian : ) ( December 27 ( O.S. December 15 ) 1812 -- June 5 ( O.S. May 24 ) 1893 ) , was a nineteenth - century Russian philologist of German extraction who worked at the University of Helsinki . Grot was a graduate of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum . In his lifetime he gained fame for his translations of German and Scandinavian poetry , his work on the theory of Russian orthography , lexicography , and grammar , and his approach to literary editing and criticism , exemplified in a full edition of the works of Derzhavin ( 1864 -- 1883 ) . His Russkoye Pravopisaniye ( 1878 , 1885 ) ( , Russian orthography ) became the standard textbook of Russian spelling and punctuation until superseded by the decrees of 1917 -- 1918 , although his definition of the theoretical foundations remains little changed to this day . Shortly before his death , he assumed the compilation of Academic dictionary of Russian ( 1891 -- 1923 ) , which , although continued by Aleksey Shakhmatov , was never to be completed . He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1858 , its chairman from 1884 , and its vice-president from 1889 . He was appointed Russian - language tutor to the future tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. His spelling primers \`\` reduced words to historical hieroglyphs of a kind , mismatched with the living spoken language of most Russians '' ; later linguists like Baudouin de Courtenay and Filipp Fortunatov promoted reforms that would make spelling a better reflection of spoken language . - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - The University of Helsinki (, , abbreviated UH) is a university located in Helsinki, Finland since 1829, but was founded in the city of Turku (in Swedish \\"√Öbo\\") in 1640 as the \\"Royal Academy of Turku\\", at that time part of the Swedish Empire. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes. - The Royal Academy of Turku (or \\"√Öbo Kungliga Akademi\\", ) was the first university in Finland, and the only Finnish university that was founded when the country still was a part of Sweden. In 1809, after Finland became a Grand Duchy under the suzerainty of the Russian Tzar, it was renamed the \\"Imperial Academy of Turku\\". In 1828, after the Great Fire of Turku, the institution was moved to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the Grand Duchy's capital. It was finally renamed the University of Helsinki when Finland became a sovereign nation-state in 1917. - Helsinki is the capital and largest city of Finland. It is in the region of Uusimaa, in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of 1,214,210, and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located some north of Tallinn, Estonia, east of Stockholm, Sweden, and west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities. - Turku is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Southwest Finland. Turku, as a town, was settled during the 13th century and founded most likely at the end of the 13th century, making it the oldest city in Finland. It quickly became the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire (1809) and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812), Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains a regional capital and an important business and cultural center. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe.

He meets Alexandria (Catinca Untaru), a young Romanian-born patient in the hospital who is recovering from a broken arm, and begins to tell her a story about her namesake. Alexandria is told she has to leave, but Roy promises to tell her an epic tale if she returns the next day. The next morning, as Roy spins his tale of fantasy, Alexandria's imagination brings his characters to life. Roy's tale is about five heroes: a silent Indian warrior (Jeetu Verma), a muscular ex-slave named Otta Benga (Marcus Wesley), an Italian explosives expert called Luigi (Robin Smith), Charles Darwin (Leo Bill) with a pet monkey called Wallace, and a masked swashbuckling bandit. An evil ruler named Governor Odious (Daniel Caltagirone) has committed an offense against each of the five, who all seek revenge. The heroes are later joined by a sixth hero, a mystic. Alexandria vividly imagines her friends and people around her appearing as the characters in Roy's story. Although Roy develops affection for Alexandria, he also has an ulterior motive: by gaining her trust, he tricks her into stealing morphine from the hospital pharmacy so that he can attempt suicide; a choice driven by his love leaving him for the actor for whom he provided the stunt footage. However, Alexandria returns with only three pills, having mistaken the \\"E\\" on the piece of paper Roy gave her for a \\"3\\".

Roy talks Alexandria into stealing a bottle of morphine tablets locked in a fellow patient's cabinet, and then downs it all.

The reviewer expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the service they experienced at their formerly favorite uptown location. The detailed account of their visit highlights various issues that collectively contribute to the negative sentiment: 1. Lack of immediate attention or acknowledgement: The reviewer mentions that they were seated for ten minutes without any interaction from the staff, which can be seen as a lack of consideration and attentiveness in regard to customer service. 2. Avoidance of eye contact: The fact that a waitress passed their table twice without making eye contact indicates a possible disregard for their presence or intentional avoidance. This behavior can be perceived as unprofessional and neglectful, causing frustration for the customer. 3. Inattention from multiple staff members: The reviewer notes that servers congregated at the hostess stand rather than attending to their duties, giving the impression of an overall lack of focus and commitment to customer service. This observation further emphasizes the lack of attention and care from the staff. 4. No response upon leaving: Despite walking out in disappointment, the reviewer states that no staff members noticed or attempted to address their dissatisfaction, reinforcing the idea of unsatisfactory customer service. 5. Disappointment in a favorite place: The fact that the location was once their favorite uptown spot highlights the disappointment and dissatisfaction felt by the customer. A decline in the quality of service can lead to a strong negative sentiment, especially in a place that previously held a special significance to the reviewer.

Understand that even if you were an outstanding undergraduate (as most graduate students were), you will face an entirely different set of challenges in graduate school. The specific nature of your coursework, research, teaching, and laboratory obligations will vary tremendously depending on your field, your school, and your department, and so will your potential paychecks and funding packages, so do some research and figure out what, exactly, you‚Äôre signing up for. Many department websites will answer your basic questions about particular programs, so start there to get a sense of what your obligations as a graduate student might be. Consider contacting current students as well. Most programs have a Director of Graduate Studies who can put you in touch with students in your program. You can then send an email or two to ask more specific questions. Current students may have insights about the standard workload and funding packages, and ‚Äì unlike the website ‚Äì they may be forthcoming about the potential downsides of pursuing a degree in their department. Graduate school is not something to do just because you can‚Äôt think of anything else to do with your life. No one should sink years of time, money, and energy into a graduate degree without being crystal clear about his or her goals and what is required to achieve them. This goes double for people with families. Know your reasons for pursuing a graduate degree, and do some extra research about what your opportunities will look like after graduate school ‚Äì don‚Äôt just assume that your M.A. or Ph.D. will get you a wonderful job. Many people in the academic world are reluctant to admit this, but the job market for academics is abysmal right now, especially in the humanities and social sciences. If you are pursuing a graduate degree in one of these fields, think twice: even if you go to a top program and do well, you may find yourself, five to ten years down the road, with an impressive Ph.D., considerable debt, and no job. For graduate students with a family, this might be especially troubling. Do your research, and go in with your eyes open (if at all). If you are married or in a committed relationship, it is imperative to discuss the upcoming challenges with your spouse or partner. For most people with families, beginning a graduate program will entail some combination of relocating, quitting jobs, creating a new budget, making new child-care arrangements, and re-evaluating the division of household labor. These are major, life-changing developments, so work to discuss them openly and honestly. If your partner is not an academic, he or she may not fully understand what your new commitments will look like. Once you‚Äôve done the research yourself, make sure you pass along your knowledge and clear up potential misunderstandings ‚Äì let your partner know, for example, if you think you‚Äôll need to work on weekends or travel for research. If your children are old enough to understand, you‚Äôll need to discuss your plans openly with them as well. Remember that your decision to attend graduate school will change their lives, too: they will likely need to adjust to new schools or child-care facilities, changes in their schedules, and less time with you. Be up front with them, in a way that‚Äôs appropriate to their ages and maturity levels, and explain why you‚Äôre taking this path. Whatever your financial circumstances, graduate school is an expense to be considered carefully. Ideally, you should avoid going to graduate school, especially in the humanities and social sciences, unless you are fully funded by your program of choice ‚Äì ‚Äúfully funded‚Äù generally meaning that you receive a tuition waiver and a modest monthly stipend, often in exchange for teaching or laboratory duties. But people with families should be extra cautious, especially since ‚Äúfull funding‚Äù will probably not include money for expenses like child care. Research child-care costs ahead of time. If you‚Äôve been a stay-at-home parent and plan to pay for child care for the first time, you may have no idea how expensive these services can be. If you‚Äôre quitting a ‚Äúreal world‚Äù job to attend graduate school, you may not realize how insufficient your stipend will be once you subtract the costs of child care from it. Either way, you need to know what you‚Äôre getting into. Be sure you look into any tax credits or deductions associated with child care costs. Factor in changes to your partner‚Äôs income, too. If you‚Äôre married or in a committed relationship, your partner‚Äôs income also needs to be assessed. Are you moving to attend graduate school? If so, your partner will probably have to find a new job ‚Äì how will you pay the bills in the meantime? Will your decision to attend graduate school affect your partner‚Äôs work schedule or potential for overtime hours? If so, you need to consider that as well. You may be tempted to get as much financial aid as possible from the government, but though this decision might be appealing right now, it‚Äôs probably unwise in the long term. Ph.D. programs, especially, take a very long time; the debt will add up, and then, in the end, you‚Äôll face the horrible academic job market. How will you pay it back?","completion":"Graduate school can be very different from undergraduate studies and requires careful planning, especially for those with families; it is important to research your specific program, the job market after graduation, and discuss the changes with your partner and children to make the best decision."},{"prompt":"Information: - Andrew Mark Cuomo (born December 6, 1957) is an American politician who has been the 56th Governor of New York since January 1, 2011. A member of the Democratic Party, he was elected in 2010, holding the same position his father, Mario Cuomo, held for three terms from 1983 to 1995. - The Governor of the State of New York is the chief executive of the U.S. state of New York. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New York's state government and the commander-in-chief of the state's military and naval forces. - A governor is, in most cases, a public official with the power to govern the executive branch of a non-sovereign or sub-national level of government, ranking under the head of state. In federations, \\"governor\\" may be the title of a politician who governs a constituent state and may be either appointed or elected. The power of the individual governor can vary dramatically between political systems, with some governors having only nominal and largely ceremonial power, while others having a complete control over the entire government. - A commander-in-chief is the person or body that exercises supreme operational command and control of a nation's military forces or significant elements of those forces. In the latter case, the force element is those forces within a particular region, or associated by function. As a practical term; it refers to military competencies that reside in a nation-state's executive leadershipeither a head of state, a head of government, a minister of defence, a national cabinet, or some other collegial body. Often, a given country's commander-in-chief (if held by an official) need not be or have been a commissioned officer or even a veteran. This follows the principle of civilian control of the military. - A head of state (or chief of state) is the public persona that officially represents the national unity and legitimacy of a sovereign state. In developing the current Constitution of France (1958), former French president Charles de Gaulle said the head of state should embody \\"the spirit of the nation\\" (\\"\\"). In some countries, typically those with parliamentary governments, the head of state is a ceremonial figurehead that does not actually guide day-to-day government activities and may not even be empowered to exercise any kind of political authority (e.g., Queen Elizabeth II in the United Kingdom). In other countries, the head of state is also the head of government, such as in the U.S., where the president is both a public figurehead and the actual highest ranking political leader who, in practice, oversees the executive branch. - A federation (also known as a federal state) is a political entity characterized by a union of partially self-governing states or regions under a central (federal) government. In a federation, the self-governing status of the component states, as well as the division of power between them and the central government, is typically constitutionally entrenched and may not be altered by a unilateral decision of either party, the states or the federal political body. Alternatively, federation is a form of government in which sovereign power is formally divided between a central authority and a number of constituent regions so that each region retains some degree of control over its internal affairs. - Charles J.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve -113*s = -222*s - 259 - 286 for s.","completion":"Alright, little buddy! Let's solve this math problem step by step, and I'll explain everything to you. Our goal is to find out what 's' is. Here's the equation we have: -113 * s = -222 * s - 259 - 286 Step 1: Let's combine the numbers on the right side that don't have the letter 's' with them: -259 - 286 = -545 So, now our equation looks like this: -113 * s = -222 * s - 545 Step 2: Let's get all the 's' terms on one side. We can do this by adding 222 * s to both sides of the equation: (-113 * s) + (222 * s) = (-222 * s) + (222 * s) - 545 This will make our equation look like this: 109 * s = -545 Step 3: To find the value of 's', we need to get rid of the 109 attached to it. We can do this by dividing both sides of the equation by 109: (109 * s) / 109 = -545 / 109 Now, our equation looks like this: s = -5 And that's it! The value of 's' is -5.

Problem:Paragraph: Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) is an emerging respiratory disease caused by the MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV). MERS has been endemic to Saudi Arabia since 2012. The reservoir of MERS-CoV is the dromedary camel, suggesting that MERS is primarily a zoonotic disease. MERS-CoV is common in dromedaries throughout the Middle East, North Africa, and East Africa as evidenced by neutralizing antibodies against MERS-CoV; however, human cases have remained limited to the Middle East. To better understand the cause of this difference, the virological properties of African camel MERS-CoV were analyzed based on the spike (S) protein in Ethiopia. Nasal swabs were collected from 258 young dromedaries (‚â§ 2 years old) in the Afar region of Ethiopia, of which 39 were positive for MERS-CoV, as confirmed by genetic tests. All positive tests were exclusive to the Amibara woreda region. Using next-generation sequencing, two full-length genomes of Amibara isolates were successfully decoded; both isolates belonged to the C2 clade based on phylogenetic analysis of full-length and S protein sequences. Recombinant EMC isolates of MERS-CoV, in which the S protein is replaced with those of Amibara isolates, were then generated to test the roles of these proteins in viral properties. Amibara S recombinants replicated more slowly in cultured cells than in EMC S recombinants. In neutralizing assays, Amibara S recombinants were neutralized by lower concentrations of sera from both Ethiopian dromedaries and EMC isolate (wild-type)immunized mouse sera, relative to the EMC S recombinants, indicating that viruses coated in the Amibara S protein were easier to neutralize than the EMC S protein. Neutralization experiments performed using S1/S2 chimeric recombinants of the EMC and Amibara S proteins showed that the neutralization profile was dependent on the S1 region of the S protein. These results suggest that the slower viral replication and the ease of neutralization seen in the Ethiopian MERS-CoV are due to strain-specific differences in the S protein and may account for the absence of human MERS-CoV cases in Ethiopia.

News article: Spending ¬£250,000 on an engagement ring is just asking for trouble What a mysterious carry-on in St Tropez last week, when Jenson Button and his wife Jessica Michibata were apparently gassed and robbed in their villa, and woke up feeling ghastly to find Jessica‚Äôs ¬£250,000 engagement ring missing. Was the robber gang Russian? How did they get the huge container of gas up the drive and administer it? Or did the Buttons just have a frightful hangover? Who knows, but there‚Äôs another much more baffling mystery here: why have a ¬£250,000 ring in the first place? It‚Äôs just asking for trouble. I inherited my mother‚Äôs diamond ring, which is titchy and worth peanuts compared to Jessica‚Äôs, but I still wouldn‚Äôt dare wear it outdoors. What if I lost it? And, around here, the odds are that someone would wrench it from my finger, or simply chop my finger off. I don‚Äôt even dare have it in the house, in case burglars sniff it out, so it‚Äôs hidden away in the bank, and one day, when I‚Äôm old and broke, I can perhaps use it to keep myself in gruel for years. My mother used to wear it bravely, but, as she grew older and sicker, the ring became more of a burden, causing nothing but worry. Every time she was carted off to hospital, her desperate parting words would be: ‚ÄúTake my ring.‚Äù She was sure that, if it was left on her finger, it would be nicked while she was asleep, drugged or out cold on the operating table, and gone by the time I reached her deathbed. So, I would take it and hide it until she came home ‚Äì a terrifying responsibility. But, even when my mother was young and healthy, the ring caused problems. One day, when my Auntie Milly had just remarried, she asked to look at it. ‚ÄúCan I see your ring, Clarice?‚Äù My mother held up her hand. Milly held up her own, and her new engagement ring, and smiled dreamily. ‚ÄúMine is bigger!‚Äù said she, enraging my mother. Good job Milly didn‚Äôt stand next to Jessica.

This year is likely to be one of financial crises in industries and countries around the world. Whether those turn into a global financial crisis is an open question, and the answer will likely turn on the health of the U.S. financial industry and broader economy.

While there are certainly factors that should concern investors, the author argues that terror is not warranted. The article predicts that a number of financial crises may occur in various industries and countries throughout the year, but whether these crises escalate to a global scale remains uncertain. The ultimate determining factor in this regard is likely the health of the US financial industry and the broader American economy, as any crisis that does not significantly impact these areas cannot be truly considered global."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But Lucien,the stars are still there,and one day,when you are older and your tears have gone,you will see them again.And,in a strange way,I expect that you will find your father there,too,in your mind and heart.I find that my parents,who died years ago,still figure in many of my dreams and that I think of them perhaps more than I ever did when they were alive.I still live to please them and I'm still surprised by their reactions.I remember that when I became a professor,I was so proud,or rather so pleased with myself that I couldn't wait to cable my parents.The reply was a long time in coming,but when it did,all my mother said was \\"I hope this means that now you will have more time for the children!\\" I haven't forgotten.The values of my parents still live on. It makes me pause and think about how I will live on in the hearts and minds of my children and of those for whom I care.Would I have been as ready as Philip Lawrence have been to face the aggressors,and to lay down my life for those in my care?How many people would want me back for Christmas?It's a serious thought,one to give me pause. I pray silently,sometimes,in the dead of night,that ancient cry of a poet \\"Deliver my soul from the sword,and my darling from the power of the dog.\\" Yet I know the death comes to us all,and sometimes comes suddenly.We must therefore plan to live forever,but live as if we will die tomorrow.We live on,I'm sure,in the lives of those we love,and therefore we ought to have a care for what they will remember and what they will treasure.If more parents knew this in their hearts to be true,there might be fewer knives on our streets today.

Because lipids are very high in energy, eating too many may lead to unhealthy weight gain. A high-fat diet may also increase lipid levels in the blood. This, in turn, can increase the risk for health problems such as cardiovascular disease. The dietary lipids of most concern are saturated fatty acids, trans fats, and cholesterol. For example, cholesterol is the lipid mainly responsible for narrowing arteries and causing the disease atherosclerosis.

Ronaldo is a nutrition enthusiast and eats a diet with appropriately low amounts of fat and cholesterol. Jeff, on the other hand, doesn't really care about nutrition at all.

They were arguably two of their generation's best midfielders, the trajectories of their careers and similar playing styles meaning they were forever compared. Now, with both having brought an end to trophy-laden careers, BBC Sport looks to tackle the debate on who was better one last time - and gives you the chance to cast your vote. News app users should click this link to vote Though he went on to be a Chelsea legend, Lampard's Premier League life began at West Ham, making his debut as a replacement for John Moncur in a 3-2 win over Coventry in January 1996. Gerrard arrived in the top flight two years later in Liverpool colours, which he would sport for his entire career in English football. There are 211 reasons to place Lampard in the Stamford Bridge hall of fame, the midfielder's goals making him Chelsea's all-time top scorer, while Gerrard's contribution to the Liverpool cause was often evident via heart-on-his-sleeve performances. Neither were shy of goals or games - Lampard would go on to make 609 Premier League appearances to Gerrard's 504, scoring 177 goals to the Liverpudlian's 120. In his most prolific season, 2009-10, Lampard scored 22 goals in 36 games as he claimed the third of three Premier League winner's medals with Chelsea. He had previously won the title in 2004-05 and 2005-06. The closest Gerrard's Liverpool came to a league title was the season of his infamous 'slip' against Chelsea in 2013-14. That season, he weighed in with 13 goals and 13 assists from midfield. Gerrard missed out on a Premier League crown, but the hometown hero guided his club to Champions League success in 2005, as well as two FA Cups, three League Cups, a Uefa Cup and a Uefa Super Cup. But it is Lampard who boasts the most silverware. Football finance expert Rob Wilson says if you took both players in their prime and sold them in last month's transfer window, Lampard would attract a marginally higher fee. But neither would match the world-record ¬£89m Manchester United spent to re-sign Paul Pogba from Juventus. \\"I wouldn't put them on the same level as what we have seen with Pogba, simply because of the marketability of Pogba and his association with Adidas,\\" said Wilson, from Sheffield Hallam University. \\"Hindsight is a perfect science. We have seen the performances they were able to generate for their respective clubs, the consistency they were able to deliver and, particularly in the case of Lampard, the goals he scored as well. \\"You would be comfortably talking ¬£50m-¬£60m in transfer value - Lampard would be slightly more because of the number of goals he scored from midfield. \\"If we were to have seen them sold this summer or next summer, you would be talking about wage packets of ¬£250,000 a week.\\" This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser During their final seasons in England, both players were included in the Sunday Times Rich List, with Gerrard's wealth in 2015 calculated at ¬£42m, and Lampard's at ¬£39m. While Lampard only once commanded a transfer fee, Chelsea signing him for ¬£11m from West Ham in 2001, Gerrard left Anfield only when his contract expired in 2015, 18 years after signing his first professional deal. Having first played in the same England team in 2002, Lampard and Gerrard featured 73 times together before both retired in the summer of 2014. Despite the suggestion the duo \\"couldn't play together\\", during that time England won 63% of their games with both in the team, and 51% without. Gerrard was the more successful of the two when playing on his own, England winning 61% of 41 games, compared with 48.5% of the 33 matches with just Lampard involved. Lampard made his debut a year before Gerrard's first England appearance, but it was the Liverpool man who established himself first, scoring his first international goal in the 5-1 win over Germany in 2001, and captaining his country at three major tournaments. Squeezing two of England's most glittering members of the 'golden generation' into one midfield was seen to be a problem for a string of national managers, but BBC Sport football analyst Pat Nevin believes the issue lay with the coaches rather than the players. \\"The problem wasn't Gerrard or Lampard, the problem was the managers,\\" said former Scotland international Nevin. \\"I don't think it was that complicated what they had to do, so that was a huge disappointment. \\"Playing within a system, England tended to play 4-4-2 and teams were never stretched. There were two guys who were phenomenal at going into space and finding space, but had nowhere to run.\\" Gerrard's performances in a Liverpool shirt sometimes led to the perception he had single-handedly dragged his team-mates towards glory, not least in the Champions League final against AC Milan in 2005 and the Reds' FA Cup triumph over West Ham a year later. Lampard, meanwhile, was no doubt a great player, reaching double figures for goals in 10 successive Premier League seasons, but was his career helped by playing in world-class Chelsea teams? In a bid to compare who played in the better side, we took the XIs that started the clubs' respective Champions League-winning finals and calculated the reported cost of each player to see how expensive the teams were to assemble. Gerrard was part of the Liverpool side that came from 3-0 down at half-time to beat AC Milan on penalties in the 'Miracle of Istanbul'. That team would go on to boast 635 caps between them, with Gerrard's 114 England appearances matched by Spain's Xabi Alonso, while Norway's John Arne Riise (110) and Finland's Sami Hyypia (105) also reached their centuries. With Liverpool's success seven years earlier than Chelsea's, it is inevitable their starting XI would be cheaper than the Blues'. But at face value the Anfield outfit built their European victory for ¬£100m less, with the side that started in Turkey costing a combined ¬£40.35m. Chelsea's Champions League triumph also came via a penalty shootout, the Blues beating Bayern Munich on German soil. Lampard was among the scorers from the spot after Didier Drogba's late goal levelled the game in 90 minutes. Lampard (106) was one of four Chelsea players to win more than 100 caps for his country, with Petr Cech (Czech Republic, 124), Ashley Cole (England, 107) and Drogba (Ivory Coast, 104) contributing to a total 784 caps for the Blues. The cost of that side? ¬£140.1m - and that's not including Fernando Torres (¬£50m) and Michael Essien (¬£24.4m), who were on the bench in Munich. This content will not work on your device, please check Javascript and cookies are enabled or update your browser Phil Neville, who played alongside the pair for England and against them for Manchester United and Everton, told BBC Sport they were \\"always driving each other on to be better\\". \\"If Frank scored a goal, Stevie had to score a goal,\\" he added. \\"It's what great players do and you see it with how Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi compete with each other. You are inspired by the biggest challenges. \\"It was a strength and a weakness of why they couldn't play together, in a way. \\"I think Stevie, in his club career, maybe felt a little bit on his own at times. Maybe he looked at Frank as part of a great team, winning league titles and other cups - whereas he made Liverpool a good team by his own performances.\\" As players of such similar style and stature in the game, leaving the Premier League for the MLS only furthered the Lampard-Gerrard debate. Gerrard joined LA Galaxy for the 2015-16 season, while Lampard chose New York City. Over the course of two campaigns in the MLS, Gerrard made 36 appearances to Lampard's 31. However, it was the former West Ham, Chelsea and Manchester City man who turned a stuttering Stateside start around to eventually make the bigger impact for his club, scoring 15 times including his 300th career goal. Lampard on Gerrard: \\"There were many a night I can recall Stevie driving from midfield at Anfield and I tried to reverse that at Chelsea and be our driving force. \\"There's a huge respect we both have for each other. We get on very well, particularly in our latter years. It's nice to come up against Stevie.\\" Gerrard on Lampard: \\"When that whistle goes and for 90 minutes when we are competing against each other it is war. We fight against each other, we always have. And when it's over there is a mutual respect there. \\"I'm a huge fan of Frank. He's a phenomenal goalscorer from midfield. I play in the same position myself so I understand how difficult that is.\\" Following some fantastic battles on the field, will Gerrard and Lampard renew their rivalry in the technical area? Gerrard is set to begin his coaching career at Anfield, where the Liverpool legend will work with the club's youth teams. He was linked with the manager's job at League One side MK Dons last year but said the opportunity had come \\"too soon\\" for him. Lampard, meanwhile, has said he will study for his coaching qualifications with the Football Association - meaning they could yet line up in opposing dugouts. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses the legendary status of Frank Lampard and Steven Gerrard, two of the best midfielders of their generation, playing for Chelsea and Liverpool, respectively.

When the Pharaoh discovers their tryst, Imhotep and Anck-su-Namun murder the monarch. Imhotep is dragged away by his priests before the Pharaoh's guards can discover his involvement; Anck-su-Namun then kills herself, intending for Imhotep to resurrect her. After Anck-su-Namun's burial, Imhotep breaks into her crypt and steals her corpse. He and his priests flee across the desert to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, where they begin the resurrection ceremony. However, they are caught by Seti's guards before the ritual could be completed, and Anck-su-Namun's soul is sent back to the Underworld. For their sacrilege, Imhotep's priests are mummified alive, and Imhotep himself is forced to endure the curse of Hom Dai: his tongue is cut out and he is buried alive with a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs. The ritual curses him to become an immortal walking plague if he were ever to be resurrected. He is buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus below a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance throughout the ages by the Medjai, descendants of Seti's palace guards. If Imhotep were ever to be released, the powers that made him immortal would allow him to unleash a wave of destruction and death upon the Earth.In 1923, soldiers from the French Foreign Legion, led by American Rick O'Connell, make a final stand at Hamunaptra against an overwhelming force of Medjai warriors.

The plans - which also include the installation of a lift and a recording studio - have been poorly received by Page, who lives in the Grade I listed Tower House nearby. The musician - whose band's hits included Whole Lotta Love - has owned the landmark home for more than 40 years and regards it as one of the most important properties in the borough. In a strongly-worded letter to the council, Page has expressed a number of concerns. He wrote: 'I have been responsible for the protection of the Tower House for over 40 years and I am always concerned when proposals are made for nearby properties which may be detrimental to the well-being of this important heritage asset.' Page says because Williams' house is Grade II listed, the exterior should be considered 'sacrosanct'. The famous pair have lived next door to each other for more than a year but have fallen out over the plans. Williams bought the house - which is the former home of Michael Winner - with his wife Ayda Field in 2013. Page - pictured (left) recently with his girlfriend Scarlett Sabet, 25, and (right) in Led Zeppelin's 1970s heyday - says Williams' home is Grade II listed and its exterior should be treated as 'sacrosanct' He says a new window planned will overlook the side of his house and his back garden, which will have a 'significant impact on the amenity' of his property. The rockstar is also concerned that work on the underground swimming pool could cause 'vibrations and possible structural' damage to Tower House. Page, aged 71, also objects to Williams knocking down part of his home's boundary wall to allow access to a planned garden car park. He wrote: '[This] will be detrimental to the general amenity of the conservation area as well as destroying part of the attractive boundary wall.' Williams' planning application states the building work will take place from early this month until October this year, with workmen accessing the site between 8am and 6pm on Mondays to Fridays and 8am and 1pm on Saturdays. He promises no work will be carried out on Sundays or Bank Holidays and reversing vehicles will be guided in by 'suitably qualified banksman'. The house's main bedroom, pictured during the time the late Michael Winner lived at the property. Williams bought the house in 2013, after the director's death, and is now keen to renovate the property. The west London mansion, pictured in 2011 when Winner tried to sell it, includes a swimming pool room. Page bought Tower House in 1972. The 19th century, Grade I listed home was built by William Burgess and, in the 1960s, was saved from demolition after a campaign led by John Betjeman and Evelyn Waugh. Williams' house also has a colourful history. The property was bought by George Winner for ¬£2,000 in 1946. It was the home Michael Winner grew up in. The Death Wish director took the property over in 1978, transforming it from three flats into his own personal palace. Winner put the mansion on the market for ¬£60 million in 2011, but he couldn't find a buyer. The director passed away in January 2013, with Williams buying the home later that year for ¬£17.5 million. He submitted the plans to Kensington and Chelsea Council in December with the public consultation ending on January 2. A decision on the plans is expected by the end of the month. Both parties declined to comment. Plans on the local council's website show the extent to which Williams plans to re-tile his home's roof. They also show how he wants to demolish parts of inside walls and build a new window (top left of plan) The designs show the window (bottom left of plan) that Page has complained about to council officials.

She could read and write fairly well, and had been used to helping her husband the under-steward with his accounts at Muro, but even if she had looked at the recipe she would have understood nothing of the doctor's hieroglyphics and abbreviated Latin words. The prescription was for a preparation of arsenic, which Matilde had formerly taken for some time. The chemist would not make any difficulty about preparing twenty doses of it for the Countess Macomer, though the whole quantity of arsenic contained in so many would probably be sufficient to kill one not accustomed to the medicine, if taken all at once. But though Matilde was so anxious to have the stuff before luncheon, she had a number of doses of it put away in a drawer, which she took out and counted, after Elettra had gone. She opened one of the little folded papers and looked at the fine white powder it contained, took a little on the end of her finger and tasted it. Then, from the same drawer, she took a package done up in coarser paper, and opened it likewise, looked at it, smelt it, and touched it with the tip of her tongue very cautiously indeed. It was white, too, but coarser than the medicine. She was very careful in tasting it, and she immediately rinsed her mouth with water, before she tied up the package again, shut the drawer, and put the key into her pocket.

Friday April 13, 2001 02:45 PM By Lance Hornby, SLAM! Sports The sequel to last year's Battle of Ontario means much more than provincial bragging rights for the Maple Leafs. This series against the Ottawa Senators -- which starts tonight with 96 hours of compacted scheduling for Games 1, 2 and 3 -- could change the face of the Leafs, from the front office to the bench. Captain Mats Sundin's contract is up, coach/general manager Pat Quinn could lose one of his two jobs, veterans such as Steve Thomas are getting long in the tooth and the much hyped \\"built for playoffs\\" philosophy is under heavy scrutiny. The board of directors will be looking over Quinn's shoulders, Quinn will be judging the players and anxious fans will be expecting results. Somewhere out there, Eric Lindros is lurking. \\"Last year we had some pretty good success and (faces) still changed around here,\\" forward Darcy Tucker said as the Leafs headed for the airport. \\"Anytime expectations rise for a hockey team, so does the mandate of the hockey club if you don't get the job done. \\"I'm sure every guy in this dressing room wants to be back next year, but if we don't accomplish what we want to, maybe that's not going to happen.\\" Sundin, points leader here for seven consecutive seasons, said a new contract is \\"the last thing on my mind.\\" \\"I'm not management,\\" he said of looming changes. \\"But we have to prove to people we're a better team. \\"We made some changes in the off-season and it's up to the new guys and the guys who were here before to show that we're good enough.\\" After a week of steady practices and a chance to forget Saturday's fifth loss in as many games this season to Ottawa, the Leafs really didn't care that most hockey writers in North America have dismissed them. \\"Two years ago, there were really no expectations on the team and we ended up playing in the conference final,\\" Sundin said. \\"The feeling now is similar to that. No one felt we were going to beat out Philadelphia and Pittsburgh and there's no reason we can't have a run like that or a better one this year.\\" Winger Garry Valk, a likely scratch tonight with a lingering eye injury, says the unfamiliar role of underdogs and opening on the road is not the end of the world. \\"It doesn't matter if you scored 50 goals in the regular season,\\" Valk said. \\"Ask guys such as Jonas Hoglund. He scored 29 goals for us, had a career year (last year) and the media just ripped on guys like him for a so-called bad playoffs.\\" The Leafs brought in Gary Roberts and Shayne Corson at great expense (5 million for both this season alone) to beef up for exactly the type of situation they face tonight. Roberts came through with a team-high 29 goals, Corson was a disappointment, while behemoth Dave Manson was a steadying influence on defence.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: Are both Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore scenthounds crossed with Foxhounds? Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the breeds involved In this question, we need to analyze whether both Porcelaine and Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore scenthounds are crossed with Foxhounds. To do this, we should first understand the characteristics and breeding history of these breeds. Step 2: Research breed history Porcelaine: The Porcelaine is a rare breed of scenthound that originated in France. It is known for its keen sense of smell and high-energy personality, which make it an excellent hunting companion. It was historically used for hunting small game, particularly hare and roe deer. Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore: The Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore is another scenthound breed originating in France, known for their prowess in hunting foxes, deer, and wild boar. They are large, powerful dogs that combine speed, stamina, and excellent scenting abilities to excel in their hunting roles. Foxhound: Foxhounds are scent hounds that originated in England and are prized for their ability to track and hunt foxes. They have excellent stamina, are fast runners, and are known for their good nature and adaptability. Step 3: Analyze breeding relationships Now that we have a basic understanding of these breeds, we can analyze the breeding relationships between them. Porcelaine and Foxhound: While the Porcelaine is a French breed, and Foxhounds are an English breed, both breeds share some similarities in their skill of hunting. However, there is no direct evidence or documentation to suggest that Porcelaines were crossed with Foxhounds during the development of the breed. Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore and Foxhound: The Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore is a breed that resulted from the crossing of French scenthounds with English Foxhounds in the 19th century. As a result, it has inherited some of the best characteristics, such as excellent hunting skills and a keen sense of smell, from both breeds. Conclusion: Based on the breed histories and breeding relationships, it can be concluded that the Grand Anglo-Fran√ßais Tricolore scenthound is indeed crossed with Foxhounds, but the Porcelaine scenthound is not."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa and in India (where an endangered remnant population resides in Gir Forest National Park). In ancient historic times, their range was in most of Africa, including North Africa, and across Eurasia from Greece and southeastern Europe to India. In the late Pleistocene, about 10,000 years ago, the lion was the most widespread large land mammal after humans: \\"Panthera leo spelaea\\" lived in northern and western Europe and \\"Panthera leo atrox\\" lived in the Americas from the Yukon to Peru.

The reviewer's overall experience at the restaurant appears to be unsatisfactory, mainly due to several factors that negatively impacted their visit. First and foremost, the food does not seem to have met the reviewer's expectations. The cashier recommended three flavors to add to their roast beef, but the review does not explicitly mention whether the customer was satisfied with the flavor combinations. Instead, they focus on their dissatisfaction with the duration it took for their order to be served. The mention of having \\"4 tables and 3 of them already eating their food\\" communicates the reviewer's disappointment over the slow service, despite the restaurant's seemingly low occupancy. Furthermore, the reviewer's negative sentiment continues with their mention of the poor taste of the tap water. This critique provides a clear indication of their negative impression of certain aspects of the dining experience. Nevertheless, it is important to note that the review also includes a couple of positive comments. The reviewer mentions that the bathroom was clean and the staff were nice, which are favorable aspects that might be appreciated by potential diners. However, these positive points are not enough to outweigh the negative experiences that the reviewer has emphasized. In conclusion, the sentiment of this review can be described as mixed with a negative leaning, as the reviewer had an overall unsatisfactory experience. The slow service, poor taste of tap water, and potentially underwhelming food overshadow the positive remarks about the cleanliness and friendly staff. This may deter potential customers from visiting the establishment, as the priority for most diners is typically excellent food and service."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following context: The \\"magnificent and accurate\\" Shakespeare edition which Boydell began in 1786 was to be the focus of his enterprise‚Äîhe viewed the print folio and the gallery as offshoots of the main project. In an advertisement prefacing the first volume of the edition, Nicol wrote that \\"splendor and magnificence, united with correctness of text were the great objects of this Edition\\". The volumes themselves were handsome, with gilded pages that, unlike those in previous scholarly editions, were unencumbered by footnotes. Each play had its own title page followed by a list of \\"Persons in the Drama\\". Boydell spared no expense. He hired the typography experts William Bulmer and William Martin to develop and cut a new typeface specifically for the edition. Nicol explains in the preface that they \\"established a printing-house ... [and] a foundry to cast the types; and even a manufactory to make the ink\\". Boydell also chose to use high-quality wove Whatman paper. The illustrations were printed independently and could be inserted and removed as the purchaser desired. The first volumes of the Dramatic Works were published in 1791 and the last in 1805. Boydell was responsible for the \\"splendor\\", and George Steevens, the general editor, was responsible for the \\"correctness of text\\". Steevens, according to Evelyn Wenner, who has studied the history of the Boydell edition, was \\"at first an ardent advocate of the plan\\" but \\"soon realized that the editor of this text must in the very scheme of things give way to painters, publishers and engravers\\". He was also ultimately disappointed in the quality of the prints, but he said nothing to jeopardize the edition's sales. Steevens, who had already edited two complete Shakespeare editions, was not asked to edit the text anew; instead, he picked which version of the text to reprint. Wenner describes the resulting hybrid edition: The thirty-six plays, printed from the texts of Reed and Malone, divide into the following three groups: (1) five plays of the first three numbers printed from... answer the following question: What is the first name of the person who picked which version of the text to reprint?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (November 2015) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 2025, a corporation called \\"The Union\\" has perfected bio-mechanical organs to replace diseased organs. However, if they fall behind on payments, a \\"repo man\\" reclaims the artificial organ (artiforg) from the body; the procedure frequently results in the death of the customer due to them being crucial organs. Remy and his partner Jake Freivald are considered the best of the Union's repo men. However, Remy's wife Carol disapproves of his work, believing that it is a bad influence for their son Peter. At a family barbecue, Jake does a quick repossession on a passenger in a cab using a kitchen knife. Carol sees this and leaves with Peter, urging Remy to make a decision. While out driving with Jake, they discover a \\"nest\\", a refuge for Union customers who have defaulted on payments for their artiforgs and become fugitives to avoid the repo men. Remy and Jake raid the nest by themselves and reclaim 32 artiforgs, which impresses their boss Frank. He offers them the opportunity to become full-time raid captains. Remy refuses and attempts to ask Frank to transfer to sales, but Jake cuts him off. Jake tells Remy that what they do is important, but Remy's mind is made up. Jake suggests that Remy's last job be a musician that Remy is a fan of. After helping the musician finish one last song, he uses a defibrillator in order to stop the artificial heart, but the device malfunctions, and Remy is severely injured, requiring replacement of his heart with an artiforg. Carol divorces Remy for taking another job, so he moves in with Jake. In sales, he is unable to lie to potential customers about the consequences of non-payment and is forced back into repo to pay for his heart, but has developed sympathy for his victims and develops a psychological block that prevents him from repossessing their artiforgs....

To find the LCS in the given lists A and B, we can use the dynamic programming approach. First, let's represent the two given lists as: A = ['r', 'u', 6461, '9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i', 's', 'l'] B = [7049, 6243, '9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i', 'D', 8875, 'J', 4035] Now, create a 2D table (dp) with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). Initialize all dp[i][0] and dp[0][j] values to 0, where 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ len(A) and 1 ‚â§ j ‚â§ len(B). Then, iterate through the table and perform the following steps: 1. If the elements at the current indices A[i-1] and B[j-1] are equal, set the current cell value as dp[i-1][j-1] + 1. 2. If not, set the value as the maximum of dp[i-1][j] and dp[i][j-1]. At the end of the iteration, the last cell dp[len(A)][len(B)] will store the length of the longest common subsequence. To find the actual subsequence, backtrack through the table and reconstruct the sequence. In this case, applying the steps above, we get: dp = [[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 3], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4, 4], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5], [0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]] The length of the longest common subsequence is 5. Backtracking through the table to find the actual subsequence: LCS = ['9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i'] So, the longest common subsequence in the given lists A and B is ['9255', 'T', 'D', '6367', 'i']."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Are these two questions paraphrases of each other?","completion":"These two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other as they are written differently but convey the same meaning. Both questions are regarding difficulties in finding bookmarked answers on Quora. Here is a detailed and long response to the core issue: There could be several reasons why you are unable to see or find your bookmarked answers on Quora. Some of the potential causes and possible solutions to this problem are listed below: 1. Account settings or synchronization issues: The first possibility is that there may be an issue with your account settings or synchronization. Quora relies heavily on real-time synchronization of data from their servers to your device. If your settings are configured incorrectly, or your device experiences synchronization issues, then you may not be able to access your bookmarked answers. Solution: Make sure you are logged into the correct account on Quora. Additionally, ensure that your device is connected to the internet, and the Quora app or website has the necessary permissions to access your device's data. 2. Platform-dependent limitations: If you are using either the mobile app or website version of Quora, it is possible that you may be experiencing platform-dependent limitations. Certain features available on the desktop version of the website may not be available in the mobile app, and vice-versa. Solution: Try accessing Quora on both the mobile app and website version using a desktop web browser. This may help you identify if the problem is specific to one platform. 3. Quora updates: Quora frequently updates its platform to fix bugs, add new features, and improve existing functionalities. Due to these updates, it is possible that your bookmarking feature may be temporarily disabled or functioning differently. Solution: Check for updates or announcements from Quora about any changes to the bookmark feature. If you find that there has been an update, read the release notes to find out about any modifications to the bookmark feature and follow the instructions to get it working again. 4. Accidental deletion of bookmarks: There is a possibility that you may have accidentally deleted or un-bookmarked some of your bookmarked answers. This would result in them not appearing in your bookmarks list. Solution: Carefully review your bookmarks to ensure you have not mistakenly deleted or unmarked any of your saved answers. If you find that you did, unfortunately, there is no way to recover the deleted bookmarks. However, you may be able to locate the original answers by searching through your browsing history or using Quora's search feature to find the answers manually. 5. Quora policy and moderation: Quora has a set of community guidelines and policies in place to protect its users and maintain the quality of the content on the platform. Sometimes, content that violates these guidelines may be removed by the platform moderators or due to user reports. If any of your bookmarked answers were removed, they will no longer show up in your bookmarks. Solution: Unfortunately, there is no way to recover removed content. The best course of action in this case is to find alternative answers that serve the same purpose and bookmark them instead. In conclusion, the inability to view or find your bookmarked answers on Quora can indeed stem from issues related to account synchronization, platform limitations, platform updates, accidental deletions, or content moderation. By following the mentioned solutions and understanding the potential reasons behind the problem, you can effectively tackle this inconvenience."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The Dutch Take Over: Intent on capturing a piece of the Portuguese trade in pepper and other spices, the Java-based Dutch Ailied with the Malays in 1633 to blockade Melaka. The trade blockade was to last eight years, and ended in a seven-month siege. The Portuguese surrendered in 1641, wracked by malaria and dysentery and denied their usual reinforcements from Goa. By then, the city had become a stagnant backwater. Unlike the Portuguese, the Dutch decided to do business with the Malays of Johor, who controlled the southern half of the peninsula together with Singapore and the neighboring Riau islands. A trade treaty gave the Dutch command of the spice trade but reserved Johor's rights in tin exports from Perak, Selangor, and Klang. Without ever retrieving the supremacy of the old Melaka sultanate, Johor had become the strongest Asian power in the region. For the Dutch, Johor provided a buffer against other Europeans. Meanwhile, fresh blood came in with the migration into the southern interior of hardy Minangkabau farmers from Sumatra, while tough Bugis warriors from the east Indonesian Celebes (Sulawesi) roved the length and breadth of the peninsula. The Minangkabau custom of freely electing their leaders provided the model for rulership elections in modern federal Malaysia. Their confederation of States became today's Negeri Sembilan (\\"Nine States\\"), with Seremban as its capital. The name Minangkabau itself means roughly \\"buffalo horns\\" and is reflected in the distinctive upward curving roof in museums and government offices built in the traditional Minangkabau style. The Bugis were energetic merchants and great sailors. With the Dutch concentrating once more on Java and the Moluccas in the 18th century, the Bugis took advantage of the vacuum by raiding Perak and Kedah, imposing their chieftains in Selangor and becoming the power behind the throne in Johor. The Bugis in Johor's administration provided much of the spirit in that State's independent stand in the 19th and 20th centuries. Throughout this period, the east coast states enjoyed a relatively tranquil prosperity, Terengganu notably thriving from its textile industry and trading in pepper and gold with the Thais, Cambodians, and Chinese. The British, under the private auspices of the East India Company (EIC), were beginning to poke their noses into North Borneo.

Question: WHERE ARE TULIO AND MIGULE ESCORTED ? Movie title: The Road to El Dorado Movie plot: In Spain 1519, two con artists, Tulio and Miguel, win a map to the legendary City of Gold, El Dorado, in a rigged gambling match. After their con is discovered, the two evade capture and hide aboard one of the ships to be led by Hern√É¬°n Cort√É¬©s to the New World. During the trip, they are caught as stowaways and imprisoned, but manage to break free and take a rowboat with the help of Cort√É¬©s' horse, Altivo. Later, they land on an unknown shore at the edge of Mexico, and Miguel begins to recognize landmarks from the map, leading them to a totem marker near a large waterfall. Believing it to be a dead end, they suddenly encounter a native woman being chased by guards; when the guards see Tulio and Miguel riding Altivo as depicted on the totem, they escort them to a secret entrance behind the falls, along with the woman, and into a city truly made of gold, El Dorado. They are brought to the city's elders, kind-hearted Chief Tannabok and wicked high priest Tzekel-Kan. Tzekel-Kan, seeking to seize the city from Tannabok, insists that the two, mistaken as gods, demonstrate their powers. Tulio and Miguel bicker between themselves, while a nearby volcano begins to erupt. When Tulio yells at Miguel to stop pestering him, the volcano suddenly stops erupting, and the citizens take this as proof of their godhood. Celebrations are held, and the pair are given luxurious quarters to stay, along with charge of the woman, Chel. Chel is aware the two are conning the people but promises to remain quiet if they take her with them when they leave the city. The two are showered with gifts of gold from Tannabok, but disapproves Tzekel-Kan in sacrificing a civilian as the gods' ritual. Tulio convinces Tannabok to build them a vessel that will allow them to leave the city with all the gifts they've been given, which will take three days. Miguel explores the city, allowing Chel to get romantically close to Tulio. Miguel comes to appreciate the peaceful life that the citizens seem to enjoy, and joins in with some of their activities....

Write a \\"A).\\" movie review (Choose your answer from: A). negative B). positive).","completion":"A) Negative Movie Review: The Emoji Movie (2017) Title: A Meltdown of Misplaced Emojis The Emoji Movie, directed by Tony Leondis, premiered in 2017, introducing the world to the fictionalized lives of emojis. With an impressively talented voice cast, featuring T.J. Miller, Anna Faris, James Corden, and Patrick Stewart, expectations were riding high. However, the movie unfortunately suffers from a weak plot, lack of character development, and cringe-worthy humor that falls flat, ultimately leaving audiences utterly disappointed. For a film that aspired to be unique and fresh, The Emoji Movie blatantly rips off elements from several popular animated films, most notably Disney's Wreck-It Ralph and Pixar's Inside Out. The movie revolves around Gene, a \\"meh\\" emoji who struggles to fit in due to his inability to maintain a single emotion. Along with his friends Jailbreak and Hi-5, Gene embarks on a journey to find his true emotion and purpose. While this concept has potential, the plot becomes gruesomely predictable and brimming with numerous plot holes. The film attempts to deliver a message about individuality, self-acceptance, and how it's okay to be different. However, this message is constantly obscured by the overwhelming product placement scattered throughout. Furthermore, the connection between the characters and the audience simply isn't there. It's challenging for viewers to genuinely care about the problems emojis face, resulting in a largely disconnected experience. Additionally, the movie desperately tries to capitalize on popular trends by including famous internet personalities and relying on shallow technology-based humor. Despite the comedy that was intended to have a mass appeal, these jokes come across as glaringly outdated, often causing eye-rolls instead of laughs. A movie about emojis warranted the potential for creating a visually stunning animation. Still, the graphics are lackluster and unimpressive, adding nothing to the film's appeal. The voice cast is undoubtedly talented, but they seem to do very little to salvage the uninspired script. Performances are mediocre, and none of the actors truly shine in their roles. More disheartening is the fact that Sir Patrick Stewart plays a character as flat and uninteresting as the literal poop emoji. In summary, The Emoji Movie is heavily weighed down by its uninspired plot, inability to connect with audiences emotionally, boring visual spectacle, and misguided humor. Although the film had potential to be a heartwarming, imaginative journey delving into the world of technology and interpersonal relationships, it regrettably turns out as a crass, corporate cash-grab with little artistic merit. It's ultimately a major disappointment that left audiences wishing they could press the \\"delete\\" button on this ill-conceived cinematic venture."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

In this context, it appears to be contributing to the development of new European innovations, which could range from technological inventions to groundbreaking strategies in business, science, or any other field. European innovation refers to the concept of pushing technological boundaries, discovering scientific breakthroughs and developing unique business strategies within the European sphere. History has shown that Europe has a prestigious track record of innovation, with everything from the discovery of gravity, to the invention of the World Wide Web laying claim to European roots. In the modern day, this innovative impulse is evident in the various European policies and strategies aimed at furthering scientific research and development. Large-scale efforts such as the European Union's Horizon 2020 program showcase this commitment. Horizon 2020's end goal is fostering innovation and research, providing a financial incentive for relevant projects and attempting to remove obstacles that could potentially hinder innovation. The statement's reference to public expenditure should be defined according to criteria that improve productivity and production indicates that the speaker wishes to tie spending not to arbitrary projects or unproven theories, but rather to ideas and initiatives that have demonstrable potential to boost productivity and production based on established criteria. The terms \\"productivity\\" and \\"production\\" are integral concepts within the field of economics and business. Productivity refers to the efficiency of production, or how much output you can get from each unit of input. When productivity is high, more goods and services are produced for the same amount of work. This generally leads to increased profits and economic growth. Production, on the other hand, quite simply refers to the process of creating goods and services. When referencing economic expenditures, the intent would be to make sure that decisions for spending public money are guided by the potential to turn that expenditure into increased productivity and production, therefore yielding the maximum benefit from that investment. This philosophy of prudent expenditure is an important one, particularly in the context of public monies. It emphasizes an approach that focuses not just on quantity of expenditure, but quality as well, driving governmental bodies to prioritize projects that promise concrete returns and sustainable growth.

What Does a Stronger Economy Mean for Your Career Plans As 2014 came to a close there were a number of indications that the New Year promised a much stronger economic climate. Among the key positive developments: inflation is currently at is lowest level in six years; the stock market closed the year with an overall growth rate of nearly 10%; the price of oil dropped significantly; the unemployment rate fell to 5.8%; 2014 had the strongest job growth in the past 15 years; and there is strong evidence of overall wage growth and an increase in hiring. This is great news for the active job seeker, but what does it mean for the currently employed professional? Should you take advantage of a stronger economy and look for a new job? A strong economic and labor force environment tends to cause more job shifts but before deciding to search for a new job it‚Äôs important to do a ‚Äúself check in‚Äù and determine your motivation for and commitment to making a potentially significant job change. That ‚Äúself check in‚Äù should include answering for yourself some key questions: No doubt you have heard of the 80/20 rule and some would argue that if you are satisfied 80% of the time with your current job, then there is no real reason to consider a change. I would argue instead that you should aim to be happy at work at least 90% of the time. If you are unhappy 20% of the time that easily equates to one full day out of your workweek and why should you settle for that? Of course potential job dissatisfaction comes from a wide variety of sources ‚Äì working conditions, compensation, colleagues and supervisors are among the most common reasons workers cite in leaving their current jobs ‚Äì but the nature and extent of dissatisfaction can be uniquely personal. Don‚Äôt underestimate the important linkage between your work and personal goals. Before considering a potential job change analyze the pros and cons not only about your job, but also of the things that are important to your life outside of work. Family, friends and lifestyle are enormously important and you want to make sure that any new situation you consider can provide you with better opportunities to achieve both the personal and professional goals you seek. Even a strong economy is not forgiving of the lazy job seeker so if you decide a job change is warranted prepare to put in the necessary work. Researching leads, completing applications, going through the interviewing and selection process ‚Äì never mind the actual logistics of changing jobs and perhaps homes, schools, and lifestyles ‚Äì takes time, effort and skill. While it is always better to look for a job while currently employed, it still takes a personal investment and sometimes your current job can make that challenging. Before you make the final decision to consider a job change make sure that you have exhausted all the avenues open to you at your current job to address the issues that might be motivating you to consider a change. Sometimes positive change only requires a thoughtful and evidence based proposal to your current employer to reconsider compensation, job responsibilities and assignments, or enhanced professional development opportunities. So many people skip this step, but if an employer knows that you are a strong performer, they won‚Äôt want to lose you, especially since replacing a professional usually costs an employer an average of four times the salary they are paying given lost productivity and recruitment costs. Make sure that when you are ready to begin your job search that you have a number of tools and clearly defined strategies in place. These should include a resume that focuses on accomplishments and quantifies success whenever possible; your LinkedIn profile should not only provide a summary of your experiences and skills, but be geared to the positions you are seeking to move into and contain endorsements and recommendations from a variety of individuals in your network. It‚Äôs also a good time to reach out to former employers, colleagues and other contacts through LinkedIn and other sources, who may be able to connect you to professionals with opportunities. If your job search involves moving into a different industry or field, be prepared to discuss your skills and experiences in a way that demonstrates their relevance and be prepared to provide examples that can really showcase what you can bring to an organization. Increasingly employers are using phone and virtual interviews to screen candidates. Be sure to prepare for these as rigorously as you would any in person interview as you need to make a strong and positive impression that will advance you to the next phase of the interview process. This will be especially important if you are looking for positions in a different geographic location. Once you do receive offers, make sure to negotiate for the compensation and extras you want and that motivated you to look for a new position. Be clear, for example, about performance evaluations and future salary raises, bonus structure, coverage for relocation expenses and additional benefits. What ever you agree upon, be sure to get it in writing before you formally accept. Remember that negotiation is always the most effective when you have information so utilize Payscale.com, LinkedIn, and the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, among many other sources, to educate yourself about compensation levels and other comparable insights on the jobs you are considering. The prospect of a new job can be exciting and stimulating and a stronger economic environment makes the prospect even more enticing. Whether you decide to stay put or consider something different, this is an excellent opportunity for self-reflection and discovery and perhaps a New Year‚Äôs resolution to move forward personally and professionally in a new direction.

Mosques, several houses and an army post in Ursoon village in the southwest of Chitral district in Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa province faced extensive damage after incessant rain caused flash floods early on Sunday. Chitral is in the far north of Pakistan, bordering Afghanistan's Badakhshan province. \\"Most bodies had been identified, however, some bodies might have been washed away to Afghanistan,\\" Osama Ahmad Warraich, deputy commissioner of Chitral, told Al Jazeera, before adding that eight of the dead were soldiers. Eighty-two homes in Ursoon were affected by the waters, a rescue services statement said, with some of them swept away, along with a mosque and an army post. \\"Sixteen of the dead were offering prayers in the mosque when it was swept away by the flood,\\" spokesperson for the provincial disaster management authority Latifur Rehman said. The army has been taking part in rescue operations in the affected areas together with the district administration.

Poorly-built homes across the country, particularly in rural areas, are susceptible to collapse during the annual spring and monsoon rains in July and August, which are often heavy. During the rainy season last summer, torrential downpours and flooding killed at least 81 people and affected almost 300,000 people across Pakistan.

The heavy monsoon rains began late on Saturday and were concentrated mainly in the north-western province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, which has been badly affected by flooding in recent years that some scientists have linked to climate change. The worst-hit district was Chitral, on the country's north-west border with Afghanistan, where the flood waters killed 41 people in the village of Ursoon near the Afghan border, which is home to some 100 families, district mayor Maghfirat Shah said. Eighty-two homes in the village were affected by the waters, a rescue services statement said, with some of them swept away, along with a mosque and an army post. \\"Sixteen of the dead were offering prayers in the mosque when it was swept away by the flood,\\" said Latifur Rehman, a spokesman for the provincial disaster management authority. At least eight of the victims were soldiers, and another eight bodies were swept over the border into Afghanistan, senior local official Osama Waraich said. Mr Rehman said a military-led rescue and relief operation had begun, with helicopters being used to reach the affected people and provide them with tents, food and medical aid. Separately, two Chinese engineers were killed and five Pakistani workers injured when the heavy rains caused the roof of a construction site to collapse at Tarbela Dam, also in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, Mr Rehman said. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif's office issued a statement expressing his grief. At least 40 feared dead in India landslides Meanwhile, at least 40 people were feared dead following a downpour that triggered flash floods and landslides in India's northern Uttarakhand state over the weekend, a state official said. Several more people were still missing, a spokesman at the state chief minister's office, Om Prakash Sati, said on Sunday, with remote Chamoli and Pithoragarh being worst affected districts in the state. The state has so far confirmed 18 deaths, of whom 15 were from Pithoragarh. The official toll was expected to rise. Thousands were feared stranded as landslides blocked hundreds of roads. State authorities asked people in low-lying areas to evacuate as a precautionary measure. Relief operations have begun, but incessant rains have hampered efforts and raised fears of flooding as rivers were close to their danger levels, Mr Sati said. \\"There is no need to panic,\\" Uttarakhand's chief minister Harish Rawat told reporters, adding more teams from the state central authorities and other relief forces had all been kept on high alert as a precautionary measure. Several damaged roads have also been repaired, Mr Rawat said.

Sentence 1 states that there is a huge chemical database, while Sentence 2 directly contradicts this claim, asserting that there is only a small chemical database. In order to determine whether the second sentence holds true if the first sentence is accurate, we must analyze the relationship between the two statements. When examining Sentence 1, it seems the speaker is describing their work with air modeling, specifically for the Dallas area. They mention having a weather station that collects information related to temperature, wind speed, wind direction, and housing a huge chemical database. This large chemical database would likely be utilized for air quality analysis, pollutant tracking, and forecasting purposes to better understand the air conditions within the region. On the other hand, Sentence 2 makes a contrasting claim about the size of the chemical database. By stating that there isn't a huge chemical database, but just a small one, the speaker could be intending to revise or clarify their previous statement, or it could be an entirely different perspective from another person. Given the information provided, if we assume that Sentence 1 is true and that there is a huge chemical database, then the content of Sentence 2 would not be accurate since it negates the existence of a large chemical database.

At Harvard, the Winthrop Street Homeless Shelter is one of 86 social service programs associated with the Phillips Brooks House Association, which is a student-run nonprofit organization. Students can work with deaf children, bring pets to nursing homes, and prepare Chinese students to become US citizens, and so on. Volunteerism develops well outside of colleges, too.

The credit portion of the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 did not affect the Czech Republic much, mostly due to its stable banking sector which has learned its lessons during a smaller crisis in the late 1990s and became much more cautious. As a fraction of the GDP, the Czech public debt is among the smallest ones in Central and Eastern Europe. Moreover, unlike many other post-communist countries, an overwhelming majority of the household debt - over 99% - is denominated in the local Czech currency. That's why the country wasn't affected by the shrunken money supply in the U.S. dollars. However, as a large exporter, the economy was sensitive to the decrease of the demand in Germany and other trading partners. In the middle of 2009, the annual drop of the GDP for 2009 was estimated around 3% or 4.3%, a relatively modest decrease. The impact of the economic crisis may have been limited by the existence of the national currency that temporarily weakened in H1 of 2009, simplifying the life of the exporters. Answer this question: Which had a smaller effect on the Chech Republic, the credit portion of the crisis of exporting?","completion":"The smaller effect on the Czech Republic during the Financial crisis of 2007-2010 was the credit portion of the crisis. The Czech Republic's stable banking sector, which had learned from a previous crisis in the late 1990s, played a key role in mitigating the impact of the credit crisis. The cautious nature of the banking sector at that time ensured that there was minimal exposure to risky investments and lending practices. In addition, over 99% of the household debt in the Czech Republic was denominated in the local Czech currency, which further insulated the country from the effects of the shrunken money supply in U.S. dollars. This is a crucial factor that protected the Czech economy from the credit crisis, as they did not suffer from the currency fluctuations and tight credit conditions that affected many other countries during that time. On the other hand, the Czech Republic, being a significant exporter, was sensitive to the decrease in demand from Germany and other trading partners. This did have a notable impact on the country's overall economic performance, with the GDP dropping around 3% to 4.3% in 2009, which is considered a relatively modest decrease compared to other countries in the region. However, the existence of their own national currency, which temporarily weakened in the first half of 2009, did provide some relief to the exporters, as it made their products relatively cheaper and more competitive in the international market. In summary, the credit portion of the crisis had a smaller effect on the Czech Republic than the decrease in export demand due to their stable banking sector, a majority of household debt denominated in the local currency, and the temporary weakening of the national currency that supported their exporters."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Kyle needed a graphics card for their computer while Donald's card was up to date, so Choose from: A. Kyle did not need to buy one online.. B. Donald did not need to buy one online..","completion":"B. Donald did not need to buy one online. While Kyle desperately scoured the internet to find a suitable graphics card for his computer, Donald couldn't help but feel grateful that his card was still up to date. He knew how frustrating it could be to search for the perfect card, weighing the pros and cons, and wanting to make the most of his hard-earned money. As Donald sat on his comfortable leather gaming chair, he recalled the experience he had when he first purchased his high-end graphics card about six months ago. Back then, he was obsessed with gaming performance and needed to play all the latest titles at max settings without any compromise. He spent weeks researching and reading countless reviews on tech websites and forums, comparing specs, and benchmarking different graphics cards' performances. Finally, he decided on the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080, a beast of a card that would allow him to play games at 4K resolution while still achieving a smooth gaming experience. On the other hand, Kyle was overwhelmed with the number of options available in the market. He was not exactly a tech-savvy person and did not have a clear idea of what specifications mattered the most while selecting a graphics card. The more he researched, the more confused he became. Donald realized that Kyle could use his help and offered to lend a hand in the search for the perfect graphics card. Together, they created a list of requirements based on Kyle's needs and budget. After filtering through numerous options, they narrowed it down to two potential cards: the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3060 Ti and the AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT. Both had their merits, and while the NVIDIA card seemed to have a slight performance edge, the AMD card offered a more affordable price point. As they debated the merits of each card, Kyle gave it some thought and ultimately realized that since most of his time was spent on graphic design work and some light gaming, he didn't need the absolute top-of-the-line card. The AMD Radeon RX 6700 XT would be more than enough to suit his needs, and he appreciated the extra money he'd save by going with that option. Once the decision was made, Kyle ordered the AMD card, eagerly waiting for it to arrive so he could start enjoying improved performance on his computer. Donald couldn't help but feel a sense of accomplishment, knowing that he was able to help his friend make an informed choice and ultimately save money in the process. As they waited for the graphics card to arrive, Donald shared his knowledge of tweaking and optimizing graphic settings with Kyle, so he could get the most out of his new hardware. They spent hours fine-tuning in-game settings, experimenting with different combinations to achieve the perfect balance between performance and visual quality. When the graphics card finally arrived, Kyle excitedly opened the packaging, meticulously reading and following the installation instructions. With Donald's assistance, everything went smoothly, and they successfully installed the new card in Kyle's computer. Upon turning the computer on and launching the first game, Kyle was immediately blown away by the level of performance and detail he could now achieve. With Donald's guidance, they further tweaked the settings, ensuring that Kyle got the absolute best experience possible. In the end, Donald didn't need to buy a new graphics card online, but he gained immense satisfaction from helping his friend Kyle navigate the process, make a well-informed decision, and optimize the performance of his new hardware. Their friendship deepened as they bonded over their shared interest and experiences, leaving both of them grateful for having each other's support in their tech endeavours."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Often we believe that our child will pick up on our values if they live in the same home. While they may pick up many of our values, parents need to remember they are not the only influence in their child's life. These outside values often compete with family values for your child's attention. If we do not make a conscious effort to _ our children, they may not get instilled at all. I wish I had learned that lesson a little earlier. I thought if I lived my values for my children they would pick them up and make their own. Sometimes this happened and sometimes it didn't. I often see twenty-something \\"kids\\" who have no faith in many of the values of their family in favor of the values of their friends. Children will often pick up the negative you show quicker than the positive, so the positive things need extra focus to set them. Some of the influences your children face every day include their church, their school, their friends, any clubs or sporting groups they are part of and more. Kids spend many hours a day at school and with their friends. Sometimes in the business of life, we suppose our children will obtain that foundation we want for them. Instilling a foundation of family values to sustain your child requires more than living it in front of them. That is important, but building up your child with this important foundation must become intentional. That means we plan times to gather as a family. We plan activities together that show the values we want to pass on. We talk about our values; we live our values; we discuss the values of others and how they differ from ours; we constantly look for opportunities and make our own opportunities to share these values in word or deed with our children.

He decided to base it on Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, but his preliminary work came to a halt in April 1948 when Alice Wimborne died. To take Walton's mind off his grief, the music publisher Leslie Boosey persuaded him to be a British delegate to a conference on copyright in Buenos Aires later that year. While there, Walton met Susana Gil Passo (1926‚Äì2010), daughter of an Argentine lawyer. At 22 she was 24 years younger than Walton (Alice Wimborne had been 22 years his senior), and at first she ridiculed his romantic interest in her. He persisted, and she eventually accepted his proposal of marriage. The wedding was held in Buenos Aires in December 1948. From the start of their marriage, the couple spent half the year on the Italian island of Ischia, and by the mid-1950s they lived there permanently.Walton's last work of the 1940s was his music for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948).

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- Eric Hahn thought his financial situation was set after he was approved for a private student loan with an 8 percent interest rate to supplement his federal education loans. Eric Hahn, 21, estimates he will be in debt for the next five to seven years for his undergraduate tuition. Just a few weeks later, Hahn, 21, was forced to cash in his savings and investments so he could make his rent and tuition after finding out that the lender, MyRichUncle.com, had suspended its private student loan program. \\"Due to continued disruptions in the capital markets, combined with the continued demand we have experienced this year, we are reaching funding capacity limits,\\" a message on his cell phone said, mimicking a statement on the company's Web site. The sudden news left Hahn, a senior-year finance major, scrambling to find additional funding after maxing out his borrowing options from the federal government. Eventually, the country's leading student loan provider, Sallie Mae, approved him for a private loan at 12 percent. After he graduates, Hahn estimates it will take him anywhere from five to seven years to repay about 30,000 he will have borrowed by then. \\"Money isn't cheap,\\" said Hahn, who transferred to Georgia State University in Atlanta from the University of Connecticut last year because the tuition was less expensive. \\"The process is time-consuming, and there's also the stress of having to liquidate my investments and wonder where I'm going to find money.\\" About 8 percent of student borrowers rely on private loans, which tend to be costlier and stricter than federal loans, said Robert Shierman, executive director of the Institute for College Access and Success.

The four officers were taken aback by Taylor's searing words and felt they had been humiliated. A decade after the incident, K·ª≥ described Taylor as \\"the sort of man who addressed people rather than talked to them\\", referencing the confrontation. Karnow said \\"For the sake of their own pride, they [the Vietnamese officers] resented being treated in ways that reminded them of their almost total dependence on an alien power. How could they preserve a sense of sovereignty when Taylor, striving to push them into 'getting things done', behaved like a viceroy?\\" However, Thi also took a perverse pleasure in riling Taylor. He was seen by a CIA officer soon after, grinning. When asked why he was happy, Thi said \\"Because this is one of the happiest days of my life ... Today I told the American ambassador that he could not dictate to us.\\" Nevertheless, Taylor's conduct had rankled the officers, stirring their latent sense of nationalism and anti-Americanism; Kh√°nh would exploit this to strengthen his fragile position in the junta.Kh√°nh's quartet of delegates responded to Taylor in a circumlocutory way. They remained calm and did not resort to direct confrontation. K·ª≥ said the change was necessary, as \\"the political situation is worse than it ever was under Di·ªám\\".

K·ª≥ further accused some of the HNC members of being communist sympathizers and cowards who wanted to stop the military from strengthening.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Early in chapter 5 we introduced, along with Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, two other men who became operational coordinators for al Qaeda: Khallad and Nashiri. As we explained, both were involved during 1998 and 1999 in preparing to attack a ship off the coast of Yemen with a boatload of explosives. They had originally targeted a commercial vessel, specifically an oil tanker, but Bin Laden urged them to look for a U.S.warship instead. In January 2000, their team had attempted to attack a warship in the port of Aden, but the attempt failed when the suicide boat sank. More than nine months later, on October 12,2000, al Qaeda operatives in a small boat laden with explosives attacked a U.S. Navy destroyer, the USS Cole. The blast ripped a hole in the side of the Cole, killing 17 members of the ship's crew and wounding at least 40. The plot, we now know, was a full-fledged al Qaeda operation, supervised directly by Bin Laden. He chose the target and location of the attack, selected the suicide operatives, and provided the money needed to purchase explosives and equipment. Nashiri was the field commander and managed the operation in Yemen. Khallad helped in Yemen until he was arrested in a case of mistaken identity and freed with Bin Laden's help, as we also mentioned earlier. Local al Qaeda coordinators included Jamal al Badawi and Fahd al Quso, who was supposed to film the attack from a nearby apartment. The two suicide operatives chosen were Hassan al Khamri and Ibrahim al Thawar, also known as Nibras. Nibras and Quso delivered money to Khallad in Bangkok during Khallad's January 2000 trip to Kuala Lumpur and Bangkok. In September 2000, Bin Laden reportedly told Nashiri that he wanted to replace Khamri and Nibras. Nashiri was angry and disagreed, telling others he would go to Afghanistan and explain to Bin Laden that the new operatives were already trained and ready to conduct the attack. Prior to departing, Nashiri gave Nibras and Khamri instructions to execute the attack on the next U.S.warship that entered the port of Aden.

Use a space in which you feel comfortable and free from the need to complete tasks and other stressors. Set aside designated time to meditate, preferably between twenty minutes and a couple hours, depending on your abilities and preferences. Wear comfortable clothes that are suitable for your space‚Äôs temperature. You‚Äôll want to avoid being distracted by stiff clothing or by being too hot or too cold. Don‚Äôt allow birds chirping, cars driving by, and other unavoidable external sounds to interrupt your meditation. Being aware of the world and its interconnections can actually be beneficial to meditation. However, if you live in a location, such as by a subway stop or train track, where noise is dominating your thoughts, you should consider putting on music or a mantra recording, both of which are available on Youtube and other services. To eliminate stiffness and tension in your body as you sit still to meditate, you should stretch yourself out before beginning. Take a few minutes before meditating to stretch your legs, hips, back, shoulders, and neck. While sitting, hold your legs out straight in front of you and reach for your toes to stretch your calves and hamstrings. Bend your knees while seated and bring the soles of your feet together to stretch your hips and quadriceps. Typically, one sits in a seated, cross-legged position when they meditate. Do so only if it‚Äôs comfortable for you to sit cross-legged for an extended period of time, and hold your back upright, unbowed but not unnaturally straight. However, consider sitting in a chair or with your back braced by a wall or other object if you are unable to sit cross-legged without discomfort.

Especially if you are just beginning to practice meditation, it is most important to find a distraction-free, comfortable body position. Sit on a yoga mat, a cushion, or on folded blankets or towels for more comfort. Begin your meditation with controlled breathing techniques. Be conscious of your breathing and use each breath you take to focus your intention. Breathe in slowly as you count to four, hold for four, and exhale for four. Let your awareness on your breath help you clear your mind and focus your concentration. As you inhale, consider light flowing through your essence, as life rises through your vertebrae and fills you.

As you exhale and your breath is out completely, visualize a universal pause in which your particular self vanishes and focus on your interconnectedness with everything around you.","completion":"This article provides detailed guidance on creating a comfortable, distraction-free environment, preparing your body, and using controlled breathing techniques for an effective and mindful meditation practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Introduction: Wales, despite its ambitious goals to improve educational opportunities, has encountered recent hurdles in the form of insufficient monitoring of a crucial grant designed for its most vulnerable students. The Welsh Assembly's influential education committee has expressed concerns and warnings regarding this ongoing issue.

The committee has urged the Welsh government to promptly and thoroughly evaluate its administration of the grant, measure its impact on students' performance, and transparently share the results with involved parties. Step 4: Discuss the implications of poor monitoring In this section, I will examine the potential consequences of inadequately monitoring this educational grant on affected children, schools, and the Welsh education system as a whole. Should the Welsh government fail to address the issue of insufficient monitoring, the effectiveness of the grant could continue to be undermined. Consequently, the intended benefits for the lowest achieving children may never be fully realized. Moreover, lack of transparency and evaluation might lead to a further mistrust of the educational system among parents, teachers, and administrators. Step 5: Suggest potential solutions or recommendations Finally, I will propose possible resolutions to the problem and recommend ways to enhance the monitoring process. To safeguard the purpose and success of this essential grant, the Welsh government needs to reassess its monitoring and oversight mechanisms. Collaborating more closely with schools, teachers, and local authorities could help develop better evaluative tools and improved strategies for tracking progress. Additionally, dedicating resources to promote transparency would allow parents and stakeholders to better understand the impact of the grant, which in turn encourages accountability. Conclusion: The future of Welsh children, particularly those struggling academically, depends heavily on their access to effective support systems. Addressing the current inadequacy in monitoring the educational grant is a critical step in ensuring that the most vulnerable students in Wales receive the necessary resources to succeed. As highlighted by the education committee, it is incumbent upon the Welsh government to take prompt action for a more transparent and successful grant administration and, ultimately, a brighter future for its young citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When Alexander destroyed Tyre, most of the towns on the route to Egypt quickly capitulated. A later tradition recorded his entry into Jerusalem: according to Josephus, Alexander was shown the Book of Daniel's prophecy, presumably chapter 8, which described a mighty Greek king who would conquer the Persian Empire. He spared Jerusalem and pushed south into Egypt. However, Alexander met with resistance at Gaza. The stronghold was heavily fortified and built on a hill, requiring a siege. When \\"his engineers pointed out to him that because of the height of the mound it would be impossible... this encouraged Alexander all the more to make the attempt\\". After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold fell, but not before Alexander had received a serious shoulder wound. As in Tyre, men of military age were put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. Alexander advanced on Egypt in later 332 BC, where he was regarded as a liberator. He was pronounced son of the deity Amun at the Oracle of Siwa Oasis in the Libyan desert. Henceforth, Alexander often referred to Zeus-Ammon as his true father, and after his death, currency depicted him adorned with rams horn as a symbol of his divinity.

He is best known for his mid-period allegorical landscapes which typically feature contemplative figures silhouetted against night skies, morning mists, barren trees or Gothic or megalithic ruins. His primary interest as an artist was the contemplation of nature, and his often symbolic and anti-classical work seeks to convey a subjective, emotional response to the natural world. Friedrich's paintings characteristically set a human presence in diminished perspective amid expansive landscapes, reducing the figures to a scale that, according to the art historian Christopher John Murray, directs \\"the viewer's gaze towards their metaphysical dimension\\".Friedrich was born in the town of Greifswald on the Baltic Sea in what was at the time Swedish Pomerania. He studied in Copenhagen until 1798, before settling in Dresden. He came of age during a period when, across Europe, a growing disillusionment with materialistic society was giving rise to a new appreciation of spirituality. This shift in ideals was often expressed through a reevaluation of the natural world, as artists such as Friedrich, J. M. W. Turner and John Constable sought to depict nature as a \\"divine creation, to be set against the artifice of human civilization\\".Friedrich's work brought him renown early in his career, and contemporaries such as the French sculptor David d'Angers spoke of him as a man who had discovered \\"the tragedy of landscape\\". Nevertheless, his work fell from favour during his later years, and he died in obscurity. As Germany moved towards modernisation in the late 19th century, a new sense of urgency characterised its art, and Friedrich's contemplative depictions of stillness came to be seen as the products of a bygone age. The early 20th century brought a renewed appreciation of his work, beginning in 1906 with an exhibition of thirty-two of his..., can you guess it ?

Who will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm? Bobby and Kenny are two prolific farmers from Arkansas who have ponds located down stream from their farm sites. Bobby recently received a large order of potatoes from a neighboring city. Because of this order, Bobby has dramatically increased the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. Kenny mainly grows tomatoes, which are not in season right now, so his use of fertilizer is currently low. Over the past month there has been a large amount of rain falling on both Bobby and Kenny's farms. Hint: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, it can be deduced that Kenny will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm. The reasoning behind this conclusion is as follows: 1. Bobby has recently received a large order of potatoes, which has resulted in him increasing the amount of fertilizer he is using on his farm. The increased use of fertilizer means that more nitrogen, an element found in fertilizers, will seep into the soil. 2. On the other hand, Kenny is growing tomatoes, which are not in season right now. This means that his use of fertilizer is currently low, and consequently, the amount of nitrogen released into the soil is also lesser than that of Bobby's farm. 3. As the hint explains, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, and runoff carries it away. This means that the large amount of rain falling on both farms will dissolve the fertilizer, and nitrogen will be washed away into the ponds located downstream from both farm sites. 4. Since there is more nitrogen in the water, it causes algae to grow out of control. With a higher concentration of nitrogen in Bobby's fertilizer runoff due to his increased fertilizer usage, there is a higher likelihood of excessive algae growth in the ponds near his farm. 5. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue and use up all the oxygen in the water, creating a dead zone. Again, since there is more nitrogen from Bobby's farm, the dead zones around his farm would likely be more severe. In conclusion, Kenny, with his currently low use of fertilizer, will cause less dead zones to form in the ponds near their farm compared to Bobby, whose increased fertilizer usage due to the large potato order contributes to higher nitrogen levels and more severe dead zones in the nearby ponds."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Marron Glac√© is what, preserved and coated in sugar????","completion":"Marron Glac√©, a French delicacy, refers to a chestnut (marron) that has been preserved in sugar syrup and then coated with a layer of sugar glaze. It is both a popular sweet treat and a versatile ingredient used in various desserts and confections. Marron Glac√© is enjoyed throughout Europe, particularly in France and Italy, during the Christmas season and other festive occasions. To understand the process of making a Marron Glac√©, let's break down the steps involved: 1. Selecting and preparing the chestnuts: The first step involves hand-picking and selecting premium quality chestnuts. Large, plump, and fresh chestnuts are typically chosen for their sweet and intense flavor. The chestnuts are then washed and lightly scored (a small incision made at the top) to ease the peeling process after cooking. 2. Blanching and peeling: The chestnuts are blanched in boiling water, which helps to soften their shells and inner skins. It is essential to carefully peel the chestnuts while still warm, as this ensures that the inner skin is removed without damaging the tender nut inside. 3. Preparing the sugar syrup: A sugar syrup is prepared by boiling water and sugar together, often with an additional flavoring ingredient such as vanilla beans. The syrup's concentration may vary depending on the desired sweetness and consistency of the final Marron Glac√©. 4. Candying process: The chestnuts are submerged in the sugar syrup and gently cooked over low heat for an extended time, commonly several days, while being periodically stirred. This slow process allows the sugar syrup to penetrate and preserve the chestnuts, making them tender and full of flavor. The candying process may also involve multiple cycles of simmering and resting the chestnuts in the syrup to achieve the desired texture. 5. Drying and glazing: Once the chestnuts have absorbed the maximum amount of sugar syrup, they are removed from the syrup and laid out onto a cooling rack or tray to drain and dry for a couple of hours or even up to a day. When the chestnuts are adequately dried, they get a final coat of sugar glaze, which can be made by simply reducing and thickening the reserved sugar syrup or by using a water and sugar mixture known as fondant. 6. Optional final touches: Some producers may choose to add a finishing touch to the Marron Glac√©s by dipping them in chocolate or dusting them with cocoa powder. Marron Glac√© can be enjoyed on its own as a luxurious confection or utilized in numerous dessert recipes, such as Mont Blanc (a chestnut and whipped cream dessert), ice creams, tarts, or incorporated into cakes and pastries. Overall, Marron Glac√© is a sophisticated and delightful treat that showcases the exquisite flavor of chestnuts in a delectable, candied form. The delicate and labor-intensive process of crafting Marron Glac√© is what contributes to its prized status as a gourmet indulgence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: Given the below context: Drilling fluids are necessary for borehole stability in deep cores, and can also be used to circulate cuttings away from the bit. Fluids used include water, ethanol/water and water/ethylene glycol mixtures, petroleum fuels, non-aromatic hydrocarbons, and n-butyl acetate. Water is the cheapest and cleanest option; it may be present on the glacial surface or may be created by thermal drilling. In cold ice some form of antifreeze is necessary, or heat must be reapplied by reaming the hole periodically. Ethanol and water. Ethanol acts as an anti-freeze in water; at sufficient concentrations it can reduce the freezing temperature of the mixture to well below any temperature likely to be encountered in ice drilling. The concentration must be chosen to prevent the liquid freezing and also to maintain the borehole against the ice overburden pressure. Because the density of the mixture decreases with lower temperatures, vertical convection will develop in boreholes where temperatures decrease with depth, as the lighter mixture rises. This causes slush to form in the borehole, though successful drilling is still possible. Ethanol is one of the cheapest options for a drilling fluid, and requires less storage space than other options because in use it is diluted with water. A Soviet expedition left an 800 m borehole in Antarctica filled with ethanol and water at an ice temperature of ‚àí53 ¬∞C; after 11 months the borehole remained open and drilling was resumed with no problems. A problem with this option is that the mixture will penetrate cores that have cracks. Ethylene glycol and water was used at Camp Century in 1966 in the lower part of the hole to dissolve the cuttings. Petroleum fuels. This includes diesel, jet fuel, and kerosene.

It was developed by the Russell family in the 17th and 18th centuries into a fashionable residential area. It is notable for its array of garden squares, literary connections (exemplified by the Bloomsbury Group), and numerous cultural, educational and health-care institutions. Although Bloomsbury was not the first area of London to have acquired a formal square, Bloomsbury Square, laid out in 1660 by Thomas Wriothesley, 4th Earl of Southampton, as Southampton Square was the first square to be named as such. Much of the district was planned and built by James Burton. - Herodotus (\\"Hr√≥dotos\\") was a Greek historian who was born in Halicarnassus in the Persian Empire (modern-day Bodrum, Turkey) and lived in the fifth century BC (484 425 BC), a contemporary of Socrates. He is widely referred to as \\"The Father of History\\" (first conferred by Cicero); he was the first historian known to have broken from Homeric tradition to treat historical subjects as a method of investigationspecifically, by collecting his materials systematically and critically, and then arranging them into a historiographic narrative. \\"The Histories\\" is the only work which he is known to have produced, a record of his \\"inquiry\\" (or \\"histor√≠a\\") on the origins of the Greco-Persian Wars, including a wealth of geographical and ethnographical information. Some of his stories were fanciful and others inaccurate; yet he states that he was reporting only what was told to him and was often correct in his information. Despite Herodotus' historical significance, little is known of his personal history. - Assyria was a major Mesopotamian East Semitic-speaking kingdom and empire of the ancient Near East. It existed as an independent state from perhaps as early as the 25th century BC in the form of the Assur city-state, until its lapse between 612 BC and 599 BC, spanning the Early to Middle Bronze Age through to the late Iron Age. - Reign. Astyages succeeded his father in 585 BCE, following the Battle of Halys, which ended a five-year war between the Lydians and the Medes. He inherited a large empire, ruled in alliance with his two brothers-in-law, Croesus of Lydia and Nebuchadnezzar of Babylon, whose wife, Amytis, Astyages' sister, was the queen for whom Nebuchadnezzar was said to have built the Hanging Gardens of Babylon. but due to the recent evidence, the garden was likely built by the Assyrian King Sennacherib. Married to Aryenis, the sister of King Croesus of Lydia, to seal the treaty between the two empires, Astyages ascended to the Median throne upon his father's death later that year. - Rusa II was king of Urartu between around 680 BC and 639 BC. It was during his reign that the massive fortress complex, Karmir-Blur, was constructed. - Cyaxares (\\"Uvax≈°tra\\", , ; r. 625585 BC), the son of King Phraortes, and according to Herodotus was the third and most capable king of Media. According to Herodotus, Cyaxares, grandson of Deioces, had a far greater military reputation than his father or grandfather. He was the first to divide his troops into separate sections of spearmen, archers, and horsemen. - Armenia ( tr. \\"Hayastan\\"), officially the Republic of Armenia (tr. \\"Hayastani Hanrapetutyun\\"), is a sovereign state in the South Caucasus region of Eurasia.

Little is known about his reign ; his name was inscribed on a massive granary at Armavir and on a series of bronze shields from the temple of Khaldi found at Rusahinili , now held in the British Museum . According to the Armenian historian Moses of Chorene , Rusa 's father Erimena can probably be identified with Paruyr Skayordi , who helped the Median king Cyaxares to conquer Assyria , for which Cyaxares recognized him as the king of Armenia , although the Medes ultimately reneged on this ; significantly later , during the reign of King Astyages , the Medes conquered and annexed Armenia . Rusa was the father of Sarduri IV. - A≈°≈°ur (Akkadian; 'shr; : shr : shr, Kurdish As√ªr), also known as Ashur and Qal'at Sherqat, was an Assyrian city, capital of the Old Assyrian Empire (20251750 BC), Middle Assyrian Empire (13651050 BC), and for a time, the Neo-Assyrian Empire (911605 BC).

Russia's capital Moscow is one of the largest cities in the world, other major urban centers include Saint Petersburg, Novosibirsk, Yekaterinburg, Nizhny Novgorod and Samara. - The Iron Age is an archaeological era, referring to a period of time in the prehistory and protohistory of the Old World (Afro-Eurasia) when the dominant toolmaking material was iron. It is commonly preceded by the Bronze Age in Europe and Asia with exceptions and the Stone Age in Africa. Meteoric iron has been used by humans since at least 3200 BC, but ancient iron production did not become widespread until the ability to smelt iron ore, remove impurities and regulate the amount of carbon in the alloy were developed. The start of the Iron Age proper is considered by many to fall between around 1200 BC to 600 BC, depending on the region. In most parts of the world, its end is defined by the widespread adoption of writing, and therefore marks the transition from prehistory to history. - Azerbaijan, officially the Republic of Azerbaijan, is a country in the South Caucasus region, situated at the crossroads of Southwest Asia and Southeastern Europe. It is bounded by the Caspian Sea to the east, Russia to the north, Georgia to the northwest, Armenia to the west and Iran to the south.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - Urartu, also known as Kingdom of Van (Urartian: ' Assyrian: '; Babylonian: \\"Urashtu\\"), was an Iron Age kingdom centred on Lake Van in the Armenian Highlands.

The school, though, is owned by Delassalle's teacher wife, the frail Christina (Clouzot), and Delassalle flaunts his relationship with Nicole Horner (Signoret), a teacher at the school. Rather than antagonism, the two women are shown to have a somewhat close relationship, primarily based on their apparent mutual hatred of Michel, who is physically and emotionally abusive to both.Unable to stand his mistreatment any longer, Nicole devises a plan. Though hesitant at first, Christina ultimately consents to help Nicole. Using a threatened divorce to lure Michel to Nicole's apartment building in a remote village several hundred kilometers away, Christina sedates him. The two women then drown him in a bathtub and dump his body in the school's neglected swimming pool. When his corpse floats to the surface, they think it will appear to have been an accident. Almost everything goes according to their plans until the body fails to surface, and Michel's corpse is nowhere to be found when the pool is drained.Nicole sees in the paper that the police found the corpse. Christina goes to the morgue and learns it is not Michel's body. There she meets Alfred Fichet (Vanel), a retired private detective.

The two statements share similarities, but they are not identical, and some assumptions need to be made to establish a connection between them. Let's break down the two statements and analyze them in detail to better understand their correlation: 1. \\"Two people flipping into the clean crisp water.\\" In this statement, the emphasis lies on the water being \\"clean\\" and \\"crisp.\\" The words \\"clean\\" and \\"crisp\\" serve as adjectives that provide additional information about the water's quality. The focus is not just on two people flipping into the water but also on the condition of the water. 2. \\"Two people are flipping into water.\\" This statement is a more general affirmation, stating that two people are flipping into the water but not offering any information about the water's quality. It could refer to any water body, regardless of whether it is clean and crisp, murky, stagnant, or in any other state. To consider the premise true, we need to ensure that the water being referred to in the second statement is indeed clean and crisp. If we can verify that the water quality is the same in both statements, we can make the assumption that the two statements refer to the same scenario and therefore establish their connection. In summary, the premise \\"Two people flipping into the clean crisp water.\\" can be considered true based on the scenario \\"Two people are flipping into water\\" only if we assume that the water in the latter statement is clean and crisp.

People born there would often move to find work in larger coal mines. As a result, Glenbuck became largely derelict and by the time Shankly's ghost writer John Roberts visited it in 1976, there were only 12 houses left, including a cottage owned by Shankly's sister, Elizabeth, whom Roberts described as \\"the last of the children of Glenbuck\\".

Shankly had a single season, 1932-33, at Carlisle United, then relatively new to the Football League and playing in the Third Division North, their reserve side playing in the North Eastern League. Shankly was recommended by a scout called Peter Carruthers who had seen him playing for Cronberry. He was invited for a month's trial and said it was the first time he had left Scotland. He was signed after just one trial match for Carlisle's reserves against Middlesbrough reserves, even though Carlisle reserves lost the match 6-0. A local newspaper report said that \\"Shankly played strenuously and might develop into a useful left back\\" but, in fact, he developed into a top-class right-half. Shankly made his senior debut on 31 December 1932 in a 2-2 draw against Rochdale and made 16 appearances for the first team. At the end of the season, the reserves won the North Eastern League Cup, defeating Newcastle United reserves 1-0 in the final. In his 1976 autobiography, Shankly stated: \\"I've still got the medal\\".

Preparation: Preparing pickles for frying involves relatively fewer steps than preparing onion rings. For pickles, one simply needs to slice them and pat them dry before dipping them in batter. On the other hand, onions must be peeled, sliced, and separated into individual rings before they can be battered. This can be time-consuming and complicated, especially if the onion rings are not cut uniformly, or if the outer layers of the onion tend to stick together. 2. Batter consistency: The batter used for frying pickles and onion rings can differ in terms of its consistency and adherence. In some cases, pickles may be more forgiving, allowing the batter to stick better to the pickles than the onion rings. The unique texture of pickles may also help to maintain a crisp exterior once the batter is cooked, while onions can sometimes become mushy and cause the batter to separate as they cook. 3. Frying process: Pickles and onion rings may require different frying times and techniques to achieve the desired level of crispiness. In this scenario, it appears that Mike found the frying process for pickles to be less challenging and more straightforward as compared to onion rings, likely due to the differences in preparation, batter, and the nature of the two ingredients. This led to him feeling annoyed with the onion rings rather than the pickles. 4. Personal preference and experience: Mike's annoyance could also be attributed to his personal preference and experience in frying various ingredients. If he had more practice frying pickles or simply enjoyed the task more, it's likely that the process of frying onion rings would be less enjoyable and more frustrating for him. In conclusion, frying pickles was a lot more simple for Mike than the onion rings, resulting in the onion rings being the source of annoyance for him (Option B). This could be due to factors such as preparation, batter consistency, frying process, and personal experience. Understanding these differences can help explain why Mike found one task more frustrating than the other."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write an article with the title: \\"Tower blocks haven‚Äôt only scarred city skylines - they‚Äôve ruined lives\\"","completion":"Title: Tower Blocks Haven't Only Scarred City Skylines - They've Ruined Lives Introduction Tower blocks have been a common feature of city skylines throughout the world for decades since the mid-20th century. Conceived as a solution to the housing crisis and urban overcrowding, they have now become a symbol of architectural and social failure for many. This article aims to unveil the harsh realities that residents of tower blocks face and explain how these gigantic concrete structures have not only scarred city skylines but also ruined lives. The Utopian Vision During the mid-20th century, modernist architects such as Le Corbusier dreamt of magnificent, futuristic cities with immense tower blocks providing safe, clean, and comfortable homes for thousands. This utopian vision was quickly adopted by urban planners, resulting in a construction boom of high-rise buildings that promised a better, more organized way of living. However, as time passed, these architectural marvels started revealing their dark side, as they became havens for poverty, crime, and social alienation. Disconnection and Social Alienation One of the main issues with tower blocks is that they disrupt the sense of community that is vital for human wellbeing. Traditional neighborhoods are often built around streets and public spaces, where people can interact and form connections. Tower blocks, on the other hand, with their enclosed corridors and limited communal areas, are designed to maximize the number of living units, but at the expense of human interaction. Residents in these buildings often report a sense of isolation, a feeling of being disconnected from their neighbors and the wider community, which leads to a lower quality of life compared to those living in more traditional structures. This lack of social cohesion can also contribute to high levels of crime, vandalism, and anti-social behavior, further deteriorating the conditions for those living in tower blocks. Design and Maintenance Issues Poor design, construction, and maintenance are common issues that plague tower blocks. Over time, many towers are prone to structural problems like leaking roofs, damp walls, and broken lifts, which not only make life uncomfortable for the residents but also pose serious health hazards. Inadequate insulation leads to higher energy consumption and costs, placing an additional burden on already struggling families. Moreover, the imposing height and narrow windows often create an oppressive atmosphere for those residing in the upper floors of tower blocks, resulting in a lack of natural light and fresh air. Economic and Spatial Segregation The population density within tower blocks creates a stark socio-economic divide within cities that results in clusters of poverty and social deprivation. Over time, these vast concrete structures become synonymous with substandard living conditions and a lack of access to essential services such as education, healthcare, and employment opportunities. This spatial segregation further fuels the cycle of poverty and disenfranchisement among the residents, leaving them with limited chances to break free from their circumstances. Mental Health Impact The combined effect of these factors has a significant impact on the mental health of tower block residents. Studies have shown that individuals living in high-rise buildings are more prone to stress, anxiety, and depression. The lack of green spaces and limited access to nature further exacerbates the negative effects on mental health, as residents are deprived of the calming and restorative benefits of natural environments. Conclusion The grand vision of improved living standards through the development of tower blocks has proven to be a hollow promise. Instead, these imposing structures have scarred not only city skylines but also the lives of those who inhabit them. Now, more than ever, it is crucial for architects, urban planners, and policymakers to reimagine and redesign our urban landscapes to foster community, wellbeing, and inclusivity, so that cities become more than just places to exist, but also places where people can thrive."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Question: What was painted on the top of the train? Title: Hart's War Movie plot: During World War II, U.S. Army intelligence officer First Lieutenant Thomas Hart (Farrell) is captured by German forces. While interrogating Hart, the Germans coerce him to divulge intelligence by taking away his boots, causing his feet to become frostbitten and badly injured, and leaving him, naked, in a very cold cell. He is then transferred by train to Stalag VI-A prisoner of war camp at Hemer, Germany. While en route, a P-51 Mustang attacks (the letters POW were painted on the top of the train, but got covered by thick snow). To save themselves, the POWs leave the train and spell P-O-W with their bodies and prevent further strafing. After arriving at the new POW camp, Lt. Hart is interviewed by the ranking American officer, Colonel William McNamara (Willis). When McNamara asks if he cooperated with the Germans after he was captured, Hart denies it. McNamara knows this to be a lie when Hart says he only endured three days of interrogation. McNamara does not reveal this to Hart, but sends him to bunk in a barracks for enlisted men, rather than allow him to bunk with the other officers. Two black pilots are brought to the camp and assigned to Hart's barracks. They are the only blacks in the camp, and their situation is compounded by their status as officers. Staff Sgt. Vic W. Bedford (Hauser), a racist, is their primary antagonist. One of the pilots, Lt. Lamar Archer, is executed when accused of keeping a weapon that Bedford had planted in his bunk. When Bedford himself subsequently turns up dead, the surviving pilot, Lt. Lincoln A. Scott (Howard) is accused of killing Bedford in retaliation. A law student before the war, Hart is appointed by McNamara to defend the accused pilot at his court-martial, a trial to which the camp commandant, Oberst Werner Visser (Iure√Ö¬ü) agrees. Much later, McNamara reveals to Hart that the \\"defense,\\" like the trial itself, is a sham, an elaborate distraction to hide a planned attack on a nearby ammunition plant (the U.S. Army mistakenly believes it to be a shoe factory) by...

Hypothesis: The local population is hungry.","completion":"After reading the paragraph, it is reasonable to believe that the hypothesis stating that the local population is hungry is true. The text mentions that game reserves are facing increasing threats from \\"hungry, poor, and angry local populations.\\" While the other two adjectives \\"poor\\" and \\"angry\\" are also attributed to the local populations, the use of the word \\"hungry\\" specifically implies that there is a lack of adequate food resources in the area. The paragraph outlines that Phinda, a South African-based Conservation Corporation, is promoting a people-based approach to wildlife conservation. This approach is becoming more popular as a response to the escalating issues experienced by local communities, such as scarcity of food, poverty, and anger or frustration. The connection between wildlife conservation efforts and these societal problems suggests that addressing the hunger experienced by the local population may be a key concern in implementing and sustaining effective conservation programs. This hunger that the local population is experiencing may be due to several factors. For instance, the expansion of game reserves may restrict or displace local communities from their traditional sources of food, such as hunting and gathering, or access to arable land for agriculture. Additionally, increased competition for scarce resources may aggravate the problem and exacerbate tensions among locals, which could contribute to the perceived \\"anger\\" mentioned in the text. Furthermore, the conservation efforts led by Phinda and their philosophy of a people-based approach recognize the importance of considering the needs and well-being of the local population while designing their wildlife conservation strategies. In this context, the fact that the local population is hungry indicates that Phinda's approach addresses the problem directly, by incorporating the concerns and interests of these communities within their conservation initiatives. In conclusion, the paragraph strongly suggests that the local population is hungry, as it highlights the escalating threat that game reserves face from hungry, poor, and angry locals. The people-based approach to wildlife conservation promoted by Phinda appears to be a response to these challenges, and recognises that addressing the hunger experienced by the local population is an important element in achieving long-term, sustainable conservation outcomes in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Alejo Carpentier y Valmont (December 26, 1904 - April 24, 1980) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous \\"boom\\" period. Born in Lausanne, Switzerland, Carpentier grew up in Havana, Cuba, and despite his European birthplace, he strongly self-identified as Cuban throughout his life. He traveled extensively, particularly in France, and to South America and Mexico, where he met prominent members of the Latin American cultural and artistic community. Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. The Baroque style dates back to the cultural period of the 17th and early 18th centuries. It is most often defined as \\"the dominant style of art in Europe between the Mannerist and Rococo eras, a style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion and self-confident rhetoric\\". Carpentier first became fascinated with this style in architecture and sculpture; however, he later describes el barroco as un espiritu, and not un estilo historico (\\"a spirit, not an historical style\\"). Wakefield insists that this attitude towards the Baroque stemmed from Carpentier's background in both Europe and Latin America which allowed him to take on a superior front in the face of post-colonialism and ultimately have the literary upper-hand where he could use European style to tell the Latin American story. Carpentier developed his vision of the baroque in his early works before he described himself as a baroque writer. He experimented with the technique in several developmental stages: \\"first as a cultural style of aesthetic fascination, later as a literary device to create period ambiance, and finally as a weapon of postcolonial pride, defiance and one-upmanship\\". This style strongly presents itself when comparing works such as the early Ecue-Yamba-O to the celebrated El reino de este mundo, regarding Carpentier's use of more historically eloquent vocabulary in the latter, instead of the authentic language of the ethnically-inspired characters. Here he escapes the stereotype of \\"nativism\\" by incorporating European standards, but continues to achieve a sense of normalcy without the expected use of the colloquialisms which the protagonist Ti Noel would undoubtedly use. Kaup claims that Carpentier utilizes what is known as the \\"New World Baroque\\", since Latin America didn't come into contact with the Enlightenment or \\"European modernity\\". This contraconquista (counter conquest) allows the New World authors to experiment with new identities and the manners of expressing them. As such, Carpentier observed in his 1975 essay that \\"American Baroque develop[ed] along with criollo culture ...: the awareness of being Other, of being new, of being symbiotic, of being a criollo; and the criollo spirit is itself a Baroque spirit.\\" This criollo of the New World Baroque is often seen as the dominant style of European literature emerging as a subordinate literary construction in Latin America.","completion":"This text is about Alejo Carpentier y Valmont, a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous \\"boom\\" period.

Answer:","completion":"\\"Sulfas\\" is a colloquial term that generally refers to a group of drugs known as \\"sulfonamide antibiotics.\\" These are synthetic antimicrobial agents that contain a chemical structure called the sulfonamide group. They are often simply called \\"sulfa drugs.\\" Sulfa drugs were the first widely used antibiotics, discovered in the 1930s, and played a significant role in combating bacterial infections before penicillin and other classes of antibiotics were developed. Sulfa drugs work by inhibiting the growth of bacteria by interfering with the bacterial synthesis of folic acid, which is essential for their growth and reproduction. Specifically, they act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydropteroate synthase, which is involved in the production of folic acid. As the human body doesn't synthesize folic acid and instead obtains it from dietary sources, sulfonamides selectively target bacterial cells without causing significant harm to human cells. Some common examples of sulfa drugs include: 1. Sulfamethoxazole: Often combined with another antibiotic, trimethoprim, in the drug Bactrim or Septra, which is used to treat a variety of bacterial infections including urinary tract infections, respiratory infections, and skin infections. 2. Sulfasalazine: Used to treat inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease, as well as rheumatoid arthritis. 3. Sulfadiazine: Used to treat Neisseria meningitidis infections and, in combination with pyrimethamine, for the treatment of toxoplasmosis. It's important to note that some people have an allergic reaction to sulfa drugs, which can range from mild skin rashes to more severe symptoms like difficulty breathing, swelling, or anaphylactic shock. For these individuals, alternative antibiotics are usually prescribed. In summary, \\"sulfas\\" refers to sulfonamide antibiotics, a class of synthetic antimicrobial agents that are effective against a wide range of bacterial infections. They work by inhibiting bacterial folic acid synthesis, which is essential for bacterial growth and replication. Despite the development of newer antibiotics, sulfa drugs still have a significant role in treating specific infections, especially in individuals who are allergic to other types of antibiotics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Locate anything that came with the glasses.","completion":"Title: A Comprehensive Guide to Evaluating and Assessing Your Sunglasses Introduction: Sunglasses are more than just a fashionable accessory; they play a crucial role in protecting our eyes from harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays and reducing glare. Just like any other personal possession, it's essential to evaluate and assess the overall condition of your sunglasses from time to time. In this article, we will provide you with a step-by-step guide to help you assess your sunglasses, measure them accurately, and compare them with similar models online. 1. Write Down All the Details About Your Sunglasses Begin by listing down all the essential details about your sunglasses. Key factors to include are the brand, model number, the material used for the frames, lens type (polarized or non-polarized, etc.), and any other special features. These details will be beneficial for future reference and help you keep track of your sunglasses' specifications. They will also be helpful when you research similar sunglasses or consider purchasing a new pair. 2. Assess the Overall Condition of the Glasses Next, inspect your sunglasses for signs of wear and damage. Examine the frames for any visible cracks, loose screws, or broken hinges. Check the lenses for scratches, chips, or any form of discoloration. If you notice any distortion in your vision while wearing your sunglasses, it could be a sign of damaged lenses. If there is damage beyond repair, consider investing in a new pair that offers adequate eye protection and meets your fashion preferences. 3. Measure Your Sunglasses To determine if your sunglasses still fit comfortably, measure them by following these simple steps: - Using a ruler or a measuring tape, measure the total width of your sunglasses from one end of the frame to the other. This way, you can ensure they're not too tight or too loose for your face. - Measure the temple size, which is the length of the arm that stretches from the frame to its tip. A correctly fitting pair of sunglasses should have the temples resting comfortably on your ears without causing discomfort. - Check the size of the bridge, which is the space between the lenses above your nose. A properly sized bridge will prevent your sunglasses from sliding down your nose or resting too high on your face. By measuring your sunglasses accurately, you can ensure that they provide the necessary coverage, help in reducing glare, and remain comfortable to wear for extended periods. 4. Research Similar Sunglasses Online Having the above-listed details and measurements of your sunglasses will make it easier to locate and compare similar products online. Researching prices, features, and customer reviews is a great way to evaluate the current market and help you make informed decisions when choosing a new pair of sunglasses. This step can also provide you with insights into the longevity of the specific brand or model you are owning. 5. Locate Anything That Came with the Glasses It is essential to maintain and store your sunglasses correctly. Gather any accessories that came with your sunglasses, such as a cleaning cloth, hard or soft case, warranty information, or any other relevant documentation. Storing your sunglasses in their case will help prevent any accidental damage, while proper cleaning with a microfiber cloth and cleaning solution can extend their lifespan. Keeping all these items together can make evaluating and maintaining your sunglasses significantly more manageable. Conclusion: Evaluating and assessing your sunglasses is crucial to ensure that they continue to serve their purpose of providing essential eye protection and maintaining optimal visual clarity. By following this comprehensive guide, you can gain valuable insights into your sunglasses' condition, understand their specific features, and compare them with similar products in the market. Regular evaluation and proper care will ensure your sunglasses remain in good condition and provide the necessary protection and style for years to come."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's short, and because it is, the film suffers. It could have stood to have been a good fifteen minutes to a half hour longer.

If your blinds have too much built up dirt, a simple dusting may not totally clean them. A deeper clean for wood blinds requires you to use water. Do not mix any cleaners or chemicals with the water. The chemicals in traditional cleaners can create stains and streaks that can ruin your blinds. Wood blinds that make prolonged contact with water can cause your blinds to spot and warp. To avoid this, lightly dab your cloth and wring it out before you use it. You only need a little bit of water to dampen your cloth, not totally saturate it.

Once you are done wiping one side, make sure that also wipe the other side. Make sure to scrub harder on areas with stains, using a circular motion. Water can warp, discolor, or create spotting on wood blinds. To prevent this from happening, make sure that you get all of the water off the blinds with a dry rag.

Does \\"GDP is divided in Public Administration 54.8%, Services 28.7%, Industry 10.2%, Commerce 6.1%, Agribusiness 0.2%.\\" contain the correct answer to \\"How much of Brasilia's GDP is from Agribusiness?\\"","completion":"Yes, the provided information does contain a direct answer to the question \\"How much of Brasilia's GDP is from Agribusiness?\\" According to the breakdown of GDP given, Agribusiness contributes 0.2% to Brasilia's GDP. That means out of all the income generated in Brasilia through the production of goods and services, only a very small portion of that income, specifically 0.2%, is derived from businesses that are engaged in farming or farming-related activities, including businesses that are directly involved in farming as well as businesses that supply goods and services to farmers, such as seed, equipment, and machinery providers, food and fiber processors, marketing firms, and much more. This relatively low percentage could be due to a number of reasons. It could indicate that Brasilia's economy isn't as reliant or focused on agribusiness compared to other sectors, or that other sectors like Public Administration and Services are simply much more dominant in the region. The high percentage of Public Administration at 54.8% could be because Brasilia is the federal capital of Brazil and houses many government agencies and employees. The Services sector at 28.7% is also fairly substantial, reflecting the lifestyle of the city's suburban residents. Industry and Commerce contribute 10.2% and 6.1% respectively. It's also worth noting that these percentages are specific to the time and source they are extracted from. As economic conditions change over time, the contributions of different sectors to GDP may also shift. For a more dynamic perspective, it would be beneficial to look at historical data and trends in the GDP breakdown, or make use of forecasts and predictions based on developed economic models. Lastly, it's important to remember that the GDP breakdown doesn‚Äôt necessarily reflect the economic wellbeing of the residents or the region. For instance, even though Brasilia's agribusiness sector only contributes 0.2% to the GDP, it doesn‚Äôt mean it's insignificant or not valuable. Some sectors might be smaller in terms of economic output, but could still be critical for employment, regional identity, or achieving certain environmental or social goals."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the first name of the person whose influence on successive generations of northern artists was substantial? ? Stefan Lochner (the Dombild Master or Master Stefan; c. 1410 ‚Äì late 1451) was a German painter working in the late \\"soft style\\" of the International Gothic. His paintings combine that era's tendency toward long flowing lines and brilliant colours with the realism, virtuoso surface textures and innovative iconography of the early Northern Renaissance. Based in Cologne, a commercial and artistic hub of northern Europe, Lochner was one of the most important German painters before Albrecht D√ºrer. Extant works include single-panel oil paintings, devotional polyptychs and illuminated manuscripts, which often feature fanciful and blue-winged angels. Today some thirty-seven individual panels are attributed to him with confidence. Less is known of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the historical Stefan Lochner believe he was born in Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records further indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We know that he was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major occasion for the city. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40. Lochner's identity and reputation were lost until a revival of 15th-century art during the early 19th-century romantic period. Despite extensive historical research, attribution remains difficult; for centuries a number of associated works were grouped and loosely attributed to the Dombild Master, a notname taken from the Dombild Altarpiece (in English cathedral picture, also known as the Altarpiece of the City's Patron Saints) still in Cologne Cathedral....

Prepare a large, clear area. Make a good workout playlist. Keep a water bottle handy.","completion":"Title: The Ultimate Guide to Getting Started with Aerobics Introduction: Aerobics is a great form of exercise that combines rhythmic movements with the goal of improving overall physical fitness, strength, and flexibility. It is not only fun but also offers a multitude of health benefits, making it popular among exercise enthusiasts. If you're looking to start an aerobics routine but don't know where to begin, this ultimate guide will provide you with all the necessary steps to ensure a smooth and fruitful journey towards a healthier you. Step 1: Choosing Your Aerobics Style There are various types of aerobics to choose from, such as low-impact aerobics, water aerobics, step aerobics, and dance aerobics. Take some time to research the different styles and decide which one suits your personal preferences and fitness level best. You may also want to consider participating in group classes or finding online tutorials to give you an idea of what each style entails. Step 2: Setting Aside Time The American Heart Association recommends a minimum of 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic exercise per week for adults. To meet this requirement, plan your schedule and set aside enough time for your aerobics sessions. You can break it down into shorter sessions spread throughout the week, such as 30 minutes of exercise five days per week. Step 3: Preparing a Workout Plan Before starting your aerobics routine, pre-prepare a workout plan. This plan should include a warm-up, the main aerobics session, and a cool-down. Your warm-up should consist of 5-10 minutes of gentle exercises to increase your heart rate and prepare your muscles for the main workout. The main session should vary in intensity and include a mix of different moves. Finish off with a cool-down of 5-10 minutes to help bring your heart rate back to normal and stretch your muscles to aid recovery. Step 4: Dress Appropriately Comfort is key when choosing clothes for your aerobics sessions. Wear breathable, moisture-wicking clothes that allow your body to stay cool and dry during the workout. Opt for athletic shoes that provide good arch support and cushioning for your feet, as aerobics can involve a lot of jumping and impact on your joints. Step 5: Clear the Workout Area Ensure you have a large, clear area to perform your aerobics routine. This space should be free of any obstacles that could cause injury during your workout. If you are doing a home workout, move any furniture or items that may be in the way, and consider using a yoga mat or exercise mat for added comfort and support. Step 6: Creating the Perfect Playlist A good workout playlist can help keep you motivated and energized throughout your session. Choose upbeat songs with a consistent rhythm that matches the tempo of your chosen aerobics style. This will make it easier to maintain the rhythm and flow of your movements. Step 7: Stay Hydrated Staying hydrated is essential during any form of exercise. Keep a water bottle handy so that you can easily take sips throughout your workout. Drinking water before, during, and after your session can help replenish lost fluids and prevent dehydration. Conclusion: Starting an aerobics routine can be exciting and rewarding. By following these steps, you can set yourself up for success and enjoy all the benefits aerobic exercise has to offer. Remember to consult with your doctor before beginning any new exercise program, especially if you have any health concerns or pre-existing conditions.

Hint: When the subtropical ridge in the Northwest Pacific is stronger than normal, it leads to a wet monsoon season for Asia.[18] The subtropical ridge position is linked to how far northward monsoon moisture and thunderstorms extend into the United States. Typically, the subtropical ridge across North America migrates far enough northward to begin monsoon conditions across the Desert Southwest from July to September.[19] When the subtropical ridge is farther north than normal towards the Four Corners, monsoon thunderstorms can spread northward into Arizona. When suppressed to the south, the atmosphere dries out across the Desert Southwest, causing a break in the monsoon regime.[20] The answer is:","completion":"To answer the question, let's break down the information given in the paragraph: 1. 2018 was a wet year for the Four Corners area due to the subtropical ridge. 2. 2019 was a dry year influenced by the same weather phenomenon that lacked strength. 3.

Individuals who spend a lot of time reading, working or playing at a computer, or doing other close visual work may also be more likely to develop nearsightedness. Because the eye continues to grow during childhood, myopia typically progresses until about age 20. However, nearsightedness may also develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. A common sign of nearsightedness is difficulty seeing distant objects like a movie screen or the TV, or the whiteboard or chalkboard in school. Please answer this question : Who is more likely a diabetic? Answer:","completion":"Based on the given situation and hint, we cannot definitively determine who, between John and Rick, is more likely to be diabetic. None of them shows any signs of diabetes. The hint provided explains that nearsightedness can develop in adults due to visual stress or health conditions such as diabetes. However, in the situation, John says he is nearsighted and has been for a few years. This does not mean he necessarily has diabetes, as nearsightedness often first occurs in school-age children and can be inherited or be due to visual stress. There is no mention of John having any health issues. Similarly, Rick, who does not have glasses, does not display any signs of diabetes. Hence, based on the provided details, we cannot draw a conclusion on who is more likely a diabetic. It would be inappropriate and inaccurate to make such a judgment without more specific signs or medical histories."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Not only do they test your ability to adapt and grow, but they also offer the opportunity to develop valuable problem-solving skills. Addressing these challenges effectively requires clear thinking, empathy, and perseverance. This article discusses various strategies to tackle workplace challenges, including deciding if action is required, talking to colleagues, keeping records, and considering your options. 1. Decide if Action is Required Upon encountering a workplace challenge, your initial reaction might be to jump in and resolve it. Resist this urge and take a moment to assess the situation calmly. Ask yourself whether this issue truly warrants your involvement or if it can be resolved more efficiently through another method. In some cases, it might be beneficial to allow the parties involved to handle the issue themselves, as intervening could result in increased conflict or the loss of organizational learning opportunities. 2. Talk to Colleagues When faced with a workplace challenge, don't hesitate to seek the guidance of your colleagues or supervisors. They can provide valuable perspective and advice based on their experience and understanding of the problem. Discussing the issue with multiple colleagues increases the likelihood of identifying potential blind spots in your thought process and ensures that you fully understand the challenge's scope and implications. Remember that collaboration is the foundation of a successful working environment and can yield innovative solutions. 3. Keep a Record Maintaining detailed records of workplace challenges is vital for organized problem-solving and to avoid recurring issues. Document all relevant details, including dates, involved parties, discussions, and actions taken, to create a complete picture of the situation. This information can be reviewed and analyzed in the event of future disputes, misunderstandings, or similar challenges. A thorough record helps to identify patterns, reinforces accountability, and provides evidence when support or clarification is required. 4. Consider Your Options Once you have a clear understanding of the workplace challenge, it's time to consider the potential solutions. Approach this step with an open mind, creativity, and objectivity, as there might be multiple viable options you have not initially considered. Generate a list of possible solutions, carefully weigh the advantages and disadvantages of each, and consult with your colleagues or supervisors to ensure you have considered all possible angles. It's crucial to remember that your final decision should align with your company's values and priorities, and aim to achieve a fair and positive outcome for all involved parties. Conclusion Workplace challenges can be daunting, but approaching them with a structured and empathetic mindset yields the best results. Take the time to decide if action is required, seek input from colleagues, maintain thorough records, and weigh your options carefully. By following these strategies, you can effectively manage and resolve workplace challenges, foster a supportive and collaborative working environment, and enhance your problem-solving skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Veteran K-9 officer Daniel Peabody has been accused of killing three of his dogs, two of which were K-9 police dogs. (CBS46) Daniel Peabody loved his dogs. At least, that‚Äôs the way it looked to students whenever Peabody, a hulking and heavily tattooed school cop, strode into northern Georgia classrooms with a K-9 at his side. The lieutenant loved his animal partners so much that when one dog retired, Peabody promptly adopted him. But Peabody wasn‚Äôt the dog savior he portrayed himself to be, authorities say. Instead, the veteran K-9 officer now stands accused of leaving one police dog in a roasting car to die and executing another. Cherokee Co Schools Police Lt Daniel Peabody could face animal cruelty charges. His K9 Inka died in his hot car. pic.twitter.com/OGqDGohNMz ‚Äî Matt Johnson (@MJohnsonWSB) June 11, 2016 On Tuesday, investigators announced that the remains of a third dog ‚Äî unearthed in Peabody‚Äôs back yard ‚Äî indicated the animal also had been shot, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The alleged case of animal cruelty is all the more bizarre because of the special protections police departments bestow on the expensive and highly trained animals. [‚ÄòNo choice but to start stabbing‚Äô: Family fights off retired K-9 as he mauls man who gave him water] In Georgia, for instance, it is a felony punishable by up to five years in prison to intentionally kill a K9 ‚Äî a penalty stiffened just last year after a police dog was killed in the line of duty. Few in Cherokee County could have imagined that the biggest threat to a beloved police dog was the man holding its leash. Daniel Peabody. (Cherokee County Marshal‚Äôs Office) The strange story dates to at least 2012, but only came to light last month. On June 10, Peabody and his pawed partner, Inca, a four-year-old Belgian Malinois, came home from work about 4:15 p.m. Peabody, a 16-year police veteran who had worked with K-9s for five years, rushed inside to deal with another dog, Cherokee County Marshal‚Äôs Office Maj. Jamie Gianfala told the Marietta Daily Journal. Nearly three hours later, Peabody suddenly remembered he had left Inca in his squad car. When Peabody went outside to check on the dog, she was dead, Gianfala said. Gianfala also said Peabody‚Äôs 2001 Ford Crown Victoria was not equipped for police dogs. ‚ÄúThere‚Äôs no kennel, there‚Äôs no alarms,‚Äù he added. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs basically just a Crown Vic police car.‚Äù Gorgeous K9 gone too soon.

Hunton told the Daily Journal that Peabody was visibly distraught over the dog‚Äôs death, hyperventilating so badly that he had to be taken to a hospital and passed out at one point. ‚ÄúHe is very, very upset about the death of his dog,‚Äù Hunton said. A few days later, Peabody abruptly resigned, according to the Journal-Constitution. When authorities investigated Inca‚Äôs death, however, they quickly stumbled upon other suspicious incidents involving the K-9 officer and his partners. When they asked Peabody about Dale, a yellow lab he adopted in 2012 after five years of working alongside the animal, Peabody initially said the retired dog died in a freak accident.

Peabody was charged with aggravated cruelty to animals and making a false statement to investigators. His wife, Tyler Verlander, meanwhile, was cited for operating a dog boarding and training business without a Cherokee County occupation tax certificate, according to the Journal-Constitution. She was also charged with operating a boarding and training business inside a residential district and too close to a residential property. The charges are unrelated to the K-9 deaths. On Tuesday, investigators announced yet another twist in the curious case. A forensic veterinarian had determined that the dog remains did not, in fact, belong to Dale. Instead, they belonged to a Belgian Malinois ‚Äî possibly Inca‚Äôs grandmother. The discovery brought to three the number of dogs Peabody is suspected of killing, although authorities say the development won‚Äôt affect charges facing the former school cop. Dale‚Äôs body remains unaccounted for. ||||| Just One More Thing... We have sent you a verification email. Please check your email and click on the link to activate your profile.

Investigators have found the remains of a third dog at the former Paulding County home of Daniel Peabody, who was arrested after his police K-9 officer, Inca, was found dead of heat stroke after being left inside his patrol car. Back in June, police said Peabody arrived to his home in Cherokee County and turned his patrol car off, leaving the 4-year-old dog in the back of the car. Peabody then went inside his home to deal with another dog. Peabody told police that he remembered that he left the dog in his patrol car a few hours later and when he went outside to check, he found that Inca was dead. Peabody also allegedly admitted to shooting another former K-9 partner, a yellow lab named Dale. When Dale died, Peabody reported he choked on a toy. After his arrest he changed his story and said he shot the police dog. When Cherokee County investigators began looking for Dale's remains, it lead them to Peabody's former home in Dallas where his ex-wife still lives. Cherokee County and Paulding County authorities worked together digging at the property and found the remains of a dog. The dog was not Dale. Police report this third dog is a Belgian Malinois and Inca's grandmother. It was not a police dog but believed to be Peabody's former pet. It was shot in the head. \\"The vets examined the remains and found that they were not Dale, but were those of a Belgian Malinois,\\" said Ron Huston, Chief Marshall with the Cherokee County Marshall's Office. Cherokee County Marshal's said Peabody has retained a lawyer and is no longer talking. They cannot ask him about the dead dog found in his yard or the circumstances surrounding its death. Peabody is out on bond. CBS46 went to his former home to ask about the third dog but were asked to leave the property. Copyright 2016 WGCL-TV (Meredith Corporation).

There‚Äôs something special about going to the movies: As viewers become immersed in the film, their faces relax, and their eyes widen a bit, in a moment of un-self-conscious wonder. Movies give us a capacity for awe. Good film projectionists know this, and present their audience with the best moviegoing experience possible, with a personalized touch no technology can truly replicate. But with the impending end of 35-millimeter projection, the craft is fading away. In recent years, movie theaters around the world have gone digital, and for some of us die-hard movie lovers, this transition has been really painful. We believe that a weathered film print is like a beloved vinyl record. It‚Äôs not that the pops and scratches on an old record sound good ‚Äî but there‚Äôs a romance in knowing that a film print has screened for others. A digital copy of a movie carries no history. It‚Äôs clean and new every time. It has no memory, and it has no soul. So maybe that‚Äôs what this pain is about ‚Äî a cry against so many things in our lives that are going digital. It‚Äôs a cry of longing for things to be tactile and organic. Part of the heartbreak of this digital transition is feeling the loss of yet another handcrafted profession ‚Äî of a job that took skill and precision and ingenuity. This Op-Doc video focuses on the experience of the Little Art Theatre, a beloved theater near my home in Ohio, which transitioned to digital in 2013. The theater staff can now start the movie from the lobby, by pushing a few buttons.The head projectionist has a lot less to do. The digital era is clearly here to stay, and the transition makes sense for any number of reasons (the films no longer break in the middle, digital is better for the environment and quality is consistent, to name a few). But this short documentary is my elegy to the fading days of celluloid. Steven Bognar is an independent filmmaker in Dayton, Ohio, and a former projectionist at Theater 80 St. Marks in New York City. His documentary with Julia Reichert, ‚ÄúThe Last Truck: Closing of a G.M. Plant,‚Äù was nominated for an Academy Award. Their film ‚ÄúA Lion in the House‚Äù won an Emmy Award.

See options at the end The turkey was coated with butter and pineapple to finish it off, the OPTIONS: a). butter gave it a sweeter taste.; b). pineapple gave it a sweeter taste.;","completion":"The turkey was coated with butter and pineapple to finish it off, and the combination of these two ingredients contributed unique flavors and textures to the dish. The butter provided a rich and creamy depth of flavor to the turkey, infusing it with moisture and helping the meat remain tender and juicy during the cooking process. Additionally, the butter also acted as a medium for the spices and seasoning to adhere to, ensuring an even distribution of flavor throughout the turkey. On the other hand, the pineapple gave it a sweeter taste, bringing a pleasant element of brightness to the dish. Moreover, as a tropical fruit, pineapple carries a natural acidity that helped to tenderize the turkey, ensuring the meat was succulent and easy to cut. This acidity also complemented the richness of the butter, creating a well-balanced flavor profile that delighted the tastebuds. Furthermore, the pineapple imparted a fruity and tangy flavor to the dish, harmonizing beautifully with the savory spices and herbs used in the preparation of the turkey. Incorporating pineapple into the recipe introduced an element of culinary creativity and innovation, resulting in a unique and appetizing spin on a traditional turkey dish. In addition, cooking with pineapple also offers some health benefits, as it contains a wealth of essential vitamins and minerals, such as vitamin C, vitamin A, and potassium. It is also rich in the enzyme bromelain, which is known for its anti-inflammatory properties and ability to aid digestion. In conclusion, the turkey coated with butter and pineapple to finish it off showcases a marriage of flavors, resulting in a rich and succulent dish with both savory and sweet elements. The butter ensures moisture and creaminess, while the pineapple adds a delightful sweetness and acidity, creating a harmonious and delicious taste experience. This unique combination of ingredients elevates a traditional turkey dish and offers a new and innovative way to enjoy a classic favorite."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Process: - Some of the rock in the ground is made of limestone - Over long periods of time rain can hit the limestone - And cause a acidic reaction - The limestone will slowly disintegrate - A large gap with be where the limestone was - Result in the cave. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose limestone is removed from the ground due to mining happens, how will it affect over long periods of time rain hits more limestone. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, the perturbation caused by removing limestone from the ground due to mining activities can have a direct effect on the natural cave-forming process. The process, also known as karstification, generally involves the dissolution of limestone by rainwater or other acidic water sources over long periods of time. When this occurs naturally, large gaps or voids are created where the limestone has dissolved, ultimately leading to the formation of caves. When limestone is removed from the ground due to mining, it alters the natural landscape by creating voids and gaps similar to those formed during the cave-forming process. However, these gaps and voids caused by mining are generally not as stable or secure as those formed through the natural dissolution of limestone. As a result, the following consequences may arise: 1. Increased risk of subsidence: With the removal of limestone, the ground above the area may become unstable, especially when rainwater starts to infiltrate and affect more limestone. Over time, this can lead to the ground collapsing and creating sinkholes, posing safety risks to the surrounding area and infrastructure. 2. Change in water drainage patterns: Limestone layers often serve as important aquifers, helping to store and transmit groundwater. With the removal of limestone, the natural drainage patterns of groundwater can be disrupted, which may alter the flow and distribution of water in the region. 3. Altered cave formation process: The removal of limestone due to mining can undoubtedly affect the natural cave-forming process. Caves may not form in their typical locations or may form at a slower rate due to the altered availability of limestone for dissolution. Furthermore, the mining-induced voids may lead to the development of caves in unstable and unnatural environments. 4. Destruction of existing caves and ecosystems: Mining may damage or destroy existing caves and their fragile ecosystems, which can endanger local plant and animal species that have adapted specifically to life within these subterranean habitats. In summary, the removal of limestone due to mining may indeed have a direct effect on the cave-forming process by altering the availability of limestone for dissolution, increasing the risk of subsidence, disrupting natural water drainage patterns, and potentially damaging existing caves and ecosystems."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Write highlights for this article: There's no arguing that Apple set the standard for modern mobile devices with the iPhone and the iPad. It didn't take long after those two products launched for competitors to rush out their own copycat devices. Even then, it took another few years before Android was good enough to go toe to toe with iOS, Apple's mobile operating system. But it's no longer about being just as good as Apple. You have to be better. Competitors have built upon the foundation Apple laid in mobile and are now leapfrogging it with bunch of useful features you can't find on iPhones and iPads. The evidence is everywhere, but it's most apparent in products made by Apple's biggest mobile rival, Samsung. By now, Samsung's Galaxy devices have become synonymous with Android, to the point that the manufacturer has more brand recognition than any other phone or tablet running Google's operating system. A lot of that has to do with Samsung's massive marketing budget, but you can't ignore the fact that the company has innovated a lot by creating popular new product categories that Apple is wary to try. The best example of this is the Galaxy Note, a smartphone-tablet hybrid with a giant screen. When that device first hit the United States about a year ago, critics (including me) slammed the device for being too large. It couldn't fit comfortably in your pocket. It was really thick. And it came with a stylus, that relic of the Palm Pilot era, making the Note feel like a step backward. None of that mattered. Samsung sold at least 10 million Galaxy Notes. The company came out with an updated version with an even larger screen called the Galaxy Note II a few months later and sold another 5 million (at last count), a very big achievement for a single Android device. But more importantly, Samsung created a new category of smartphone that people didn't even know they wanted, much like Apple did when it released the first iPhone. Samsung isn't afraid to tout its cool factor either. Since the first commercial debuted in late 2011, you've probably seen those \\"Next Big Thing\\" ads that make fun of starry-eyed Apple fans waiting in line for the next iPhone. Whether it's boasting about the bigger screens or sharing content by tapping phones together, Samsung seems content to blast Apple for its stuffiness while showing in a practical context what its devices can do. On the software side of things, Samsung is taking advantage of its mobile devices' processing power to layer premium features on top of Android, such as the ability to run two apps at once in a split screen or separate window. Samsung's best tablet, the Galaxy Note 10.1, can do all that plus take advantage of a stylus so you can draw and take notes on the screen. There is a downside to the split-screen thing, however. Developers have to tweak their apps to work in split-screen mode on the Note 10.1. There are only about 20 apps right now that can do it. But what's most important is how nimble Samsung has become at improving its mobile devices through software updates. The Note 10.1 launched last fall, but it received a software update with a new version of Android and a slew of other features like the voice assistant Google Now, which is a lot more impressive than Apple's original Siri. Samsung's director of product planning, Shoneel Kolhatkar, said the company takes user and reviewer feedback into account when preparing to deliver new software updates. Instead of making users wait a year for new features, Kolhatkar said Samsung can use that feedback to deliver \\"incremental innovation that keeps the product alive.\\" \\"We want to keep the product relevant to consumers,\\" Kolhatkar said. \\"It's about how to fit our devices into people's lives versus changing their behavior.\\" Samsung isn't alone, of course. Microsoft's new Windows 8 operating system is built for touchscreen devices like tablets, too, and it offers a lot of advantages over iOS. All Windows 8 apps can run in a split screen so you can run two at once, plus the main menu is capable of displaying real-time updates for stuff like news and weather. Microsoft even has its own line of Surface tablets that blur the line between PC and laptop thanks to a clever snap-on keyboard cover. Based on all this evidence, Apple feels behind. Take a look at its newest fourth-generation iPad. It has a killer processor and other great hardware features, but the operating system doesn't take advantage of any of that. The home screen is still just a grid of static icons that launch apps. Apple also isn't nearly as versatile at adding new software features to its devices. Apple usually makes users wait a year or more for a new version of iOS, and even then some older devices can't access all the latest and greatest features. Apple CEO Tim Cook likes to say tablets -- not laptops -- are the future of computing, yet it feels like Apple's software goes out of its way to limit what you can do on the machine. Meanwhile there are others, especially Samsung, that appear to be innovating at a pace faster than Apple can. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Steve Kovach.","completion":"Apple's mobile devices such as the iPhone and iPad have undoubtedly set the standard for modern mobile technology. However, competitors are now building upon Apple's foundation and offering a range of features not present in Apple products. This is particularly obvious with Samsung's Galaxy devices, which have become synonymous with Android. Part of Samsung's success is due to their willingness to innovate and create popular new product categories - the Galaxy Note, a smartphone-tablet hybrid with an oversized screen, is a prime example. Samsung is also not shy to promote its features in comparison to Apple's mobile devices, with advertisements pointing out larger screens, easy content-sharing functions and more. Moreover, Samsung is using its mobile devices' processing power to provide premium features in addition to Android, such as the ability to run two apps simultaneously in a split-screen or separate window. In contrast, Apple's more recent devices, such as the fourth-generation iPad, seem limited in their innovation and versatility, and updates to the iOS operating system are less frequent. With competitors such as Samsung investing in rapid innovation and products tailored to consumers' lives, it is suggested that Apple has now fallen behind in the race for mobile tech innovation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Villard and senior Resistance leader Spinet (Paul Bonifas), \\"I won't waste lives on paintings,\\" he has a change of heart after a cantankerous elderly engineer, Papa Boule (Michel Simon), is executed for trying to sabotage the train on his own. After that sacrifice, Labiche joins his Resistance teammates Didont (Albert R√É¬©my) and Pesquet (Charles Millot), who have been organizing their own plan to stop the train with the help of other SNCF Resistance members. They devise an elaborate ruse to reroute the train, temporarily changing railway station signage to make it appear to the German escort as if they are heading to Germany when they have actually turned back toward Paris. They then arrange a double collision in the small town of Rive-Reine that will block the train without risking the cargo. Labiche, although shot in the leg, escapes on foot with the help of the widowed owner of a Rive-Reine hotel, Christine (Jeanne Moreau), while other Resistance members involved in the plot are executed. The night after the collision, Labiche and Didont meet Spinet again, along with young Robert (the nephew of Jacques, the executed Rive-Reine station master) and plan to paint the tops of three boxcars white to warn off Allied aircraft from bombing the art train. Robert recruits railroad workers and...

Q: Context: The Wada test is a diagnostic method to anesthetize 1 cerebral hemisphere and assess the language and memory functions of awake contralateral hemisphere before temporal lobectomy in patients with epilepsy. The effects of an ipsilateral injection of etomidate on the functional properties of contralateral hemisphere are not known. Our aim was to characterize the electroencephalographic (EEG) effects after intracarotid injection of etomidate and to determine the changes in synchronization between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres.', 'We retrospectively analyzed EEG data from 15 patients who underwent Wada test with etomidate. Continuous EEG data from 4 electrodes (2 anterior [F3, F4] and 2 posterior [P3, P4]) were analyzed. After artifact rejection, we measured the amplitudes of delta (1 to 4 Hz) and alpha (7 to 13 Hz) waves and the changes in the interhemispheric synchronization before, during, and after etomidate injection.', 'Ipsilateral injection of etomidate causes EEG changes in both hemispheres with increased amplitude of delta waves anteriorly and the alpha waves posteriorly. However this effect of etomidate is not uniform. Although there was a decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves, there was no change in the synchronization of the alpha waves. Answer: Our study showed that the EEG effects of intracarotid ipsilateral injection of etomidate is not uniform in both hemispheres. Decrease in the interhemispheric synchronization of delta waves might serve as an indicator of ipsilateral effect of etomidate on the brain. Additional studies are needed to confirm our findings.

Danny owned two parcels of land. parcel A had a soil with high salinity levels, while parcel B had a rich and healthy soil. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which parcel had more plants which presented a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cell?","completion":"Based on the information given, parcel A had soil with high salinity levels. High salinity levels in soil typically cause an increase in the concentration of sodium ions (Na+) outside the plant cells. This can cause a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of plant cells. In normal conditions, the Na+/K+ ratio is maintained by the sodium-potassium pump, which actively transports sodium ions (Na+) out of the cell and potassium ions (K+) into the cell. This is crucial for various cellular functions, including maintaining cell membrane potential, protein synthesis, and overall cell growth. When a plant experiences high salinity levels, the excess sodium ions in the soil can cause difficulties for the sodium-potassium pump to maintain the ideal Na+/K+ ratio. The higher concentration of sodium ions can lead to an influx of Na+ into the plant cells, thereby disrupting the Na+/K+ balance. This condition can negatively impact the plant's overall physiological processes, leading to impaired growth, reduced yield, and in extreme cases, plant death. Hence, parcel A, with its high salinity levels, would have more plants presenting a disruption in the Na+/K+ ratio in the cytoplasm of the plant cells compared to parcel B, which had rich and healthy soil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Missing her old friends indicates her attachment to and appreciation for close social connections in her life. Due to her affection for her old friends, it is unlikely that she would choose to ignore everyone, as it seems contradictory to her personality and social inclinations. Aubrey may also understand the importance and value of friendship in enhancing her school experience, as friends provide a sense of belonging, support, and comfort that can have a significant impact on her emotional, social, and academic well-being. Therefore, the desire to have friends can be considered essential for Aubrey to successfully adapt to her new environment and feel confident in navigating new challenges that may come her way. While it is possible that Aubrey might recognize the need to study hard to excel in her new educational setting, it is likely that her sense of belonging and social support will have a significant influence on her motivation, focus, and perseverance to perform academically. By establishing friendships at her new school, Aubrey can form a strong social foundation, making it easier for her to concentrate on her studies and seek help from others when needed. In summary, Aubrey's next course of action would most likely involve making new friends at her new school.

Upon examining Motome's swords, their blades were found to be made of bamboo. Enraged that any samurai would \\"pawn his soul\\", the House of Ii forced Motome to disembowel himself with his own bamboo blade, making his death slow, agonizingly painful, and deeply humiliating. Despite this warning, Hanshir√Ö¬ç insists that he has never heard of Motome and says that he has no intention of leaving the Ii palace alive.

To understand why \\"jail\\" is the most appropriate answer among the options given - jail, floor, front door, reporter, and porch - let's analyze the context provided in the question. Context: The newspaper was his only connection to the outside world while doing time where? 1. Connection to the outside world: The statement mentions a connection to the outside world, implying that the subject is in a situation or place where they are isolated or cut off from the broader society. 2. Doing time: The phrase \\"doing time\\" is a common colloquial expression that refers to serving a sentence in a correctional facility, more specifically, a jail or prison. Considering these factors, we can analyze the given options: a) Jail: Given the limited access to the outside world and the use of the phrase \\"doing time,\\" jail is the most appropriate location fitting the context. In a jail or prison, an inmate's access to the outside world is restricted, and they may rely heavily on newspapers for information and connection to events happening in society. b) Floor: The floor doesn't fit the context as it isn't a location where one serves a sentence or has limited connection to the outside world. c) Front door: Similar to the floor, a front door is not associated with serving time or restricting access to the outside world. d) Reporter: A reporter is a person, not a place where someone serves time or has limited connection to the outside world. e) Porch: While being on a porch may allow for some limited connection to the outside world, it does not align with the phrase \\"doing time,\\" which indicates serving a sentence. Given the contextual analysis of the question, it is clear that \\"jail\\" aligns with human common sense as the most appropriate answer based on the situation described - limited access to the outside world while serving a sentence.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the full name of the person that studied at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig? ? Handel joined the Hamburg opera house when it was experiencing a period of considerable artistic success. This blossoming followed the arrival of Reinhard Keiser, who had become musical director at the G√§nsemarkt in about 1697, and in 1703 succeeded Johann Kusser as the theatre's manager. Born in 1674, Keiser had studied under Johann Schelle and probably Johann Kuhnau at the Thomasschule zu Leipzig. In 1694 he was employed as a court composer at Brunswick, where in three years he composed seven operas, at least one of which (Mahumeth) was performed in Hamburg. According to Handel's biographer Donald Burrows, Keiser was a good judge of popular taste, with a flair for writing Italian-style arias. Between 1697 and 1703, prior to Handel's arrival, about a dozen more Keiser operas had been staged at the G√§nsemarkt. Despite his on-stage successes, Keiser was an unreliable general manager, with expensive private tastes and little financial acumen, often at odds with his creditors.It is possible that Keiser, who had connections in the Halle area, had heard of Handel and was directly instrumental in securing the latter's post in the G√§nsemarkt orchestra; certainly he was a considerable influence on the younger man in the three years that Handel spent in Hamburg. Another important G√§nsemarkt colleague was the house composer and singer Johann Mattheson, who noted Handel's rapid progress in the orchestra from back-desk violinist to harpsichord soloist, a role in which, said Mattheson, \\"he showed himself a man‚Äîa thing which no one had before suspected, save I alone\\". Mattheson was less complimentary on Handel's early efforts at composition: \\"He composed very long, long arias, and really interminable cantatas\\", before, it seems, \\"the lofty schooling of opera ... trimmed him into other fashions\\".

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer the following question: Q: What is the process of making atp without oxygen called? A: Select from: (1). condensation; (2). photosynthesis; (3). Cell Division; (4). fermentation; Answer:","completion":"The process of making ATP without oxygen is called fermentation (option 4). Fermentation is an anaerobic process, meaning it occurs in the absence of molecular oxygen, and converts carbohydrates, such as glucose and other monosaccharides, into energy and other byproducts. The energy generated during this process comes in the form of ATP, Adenosine Triphosphate. ATP is the primary molecule that stores and transfers energy within cells. Since fermentation occurs in an anaerobic environment, it is essential for organisms that thrive in oxygen-deprived environments, as well as for multicellular organisms during intense physical activity, which can lead to temporary oxygen deficiency. There are two main types of fermentation: 1. Lactic acid fermentation: This type of fermentation occurs in muscles, bacteria such as Lactobacillus, and fungi. During this process, glucose is converted into lactate. Lactic acid fermentation is responsible for the sour taste in yogurt and the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles during intense exercise, leading to muscle fatigue and soreness. 2. Alcoholic fermentation: This type of fermentation occurs in yeasts and some bacteria. During this process, glucose is converted into ethanol (alcohol) and carbon dioxide. Alcoholic fermentation is used in the production of alcoholic beverages such as beer and wine, and in baking as the carbon dioxide produced helps to leaven the dough. The fermentation process begins with the breakdown of glucose through a series of chemical reactions called glycolysis, during which glucose is converted into a molecule called pyruvate and a small amount of ATP is generated. After glycolysis, the process diverges depending on the type of fermentation taking place (lactic acid or alcoholic fermentation). In lactic acid fermentation, pyruvate is converted to lactate through the action of lactate dehydrogenase, while in alcoholic fermentation, pyruvate is first decarboxylated to acetaldehyde by pyruvate decarboxylase and then converted to ethanol by alcohol dehydrogenase. Both of these processes regenerate molecules called NAD+ which can then be used in glycolysis for the generation of ATP. Though fermentation generates less ATP compared to aerobic cellular respiration, it plays a crucial role in maintaining cellular energy levels under anaerobic conditions. If oxygen is present, cells tend to switch to aerobic respiration, which generates more ATP and is more efficient. However, fermentation allows cells and organisms to survive and maintain their metabolism during temporary or permanent oxygen limitations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The conversation only provides limited information about their plans to attend a lecture and Becky's need to discuss something with Sam in person near the library.

Attending a lecture: From the conversation, we can infer that there might be a scheduled lecture that both Becky and Sam are planning to attend. The nature or topic of the lecture, however, is not clear from the dialogue. 2. Meeting location: Becky suggests that they meet near the library, indicating that the location is likely near their educational institution, such as a college or university campus. 3. Importance of face-to-face communication: Becky insists on speaking with Sam only in person and not through text or phone call. This indicates that the topic she wants to discuss is potentially sensitive, confidential, or personal. 4. Urgency: From the dialogue, the topic Becky wants to discuss might be time-sensitive or of importance, as she does not want to share it through other means of communication and prefers to discuss it before or after the lecture. To summarize, while we cannot deduce the exact topic of conversation between Becky and Sam, we can conclude that it might be related to their academic or personal lives, and is significant enough for them to discuss it in person.

He was abusive and too young to be married with a child. They got divorced shortly after. A couple years later she met a man named Rob. He was fun, loving, kind, great with me, everything she had been looking for. They dated for.. a few months I think? Maybe a year. Then they got married and we moved to Texas.

Widespread Roman interference in the Greek world was probably inevitable given the general manner of the ascendency of the Roman Republic. This Roman-Greek interaction began as a consequence of the Greek city-states located along the coast of southern Italy. Rome had come to dominate the Italian peninsula, and desired the submission of the Greek cities to its rule. Although they initially resisted, allying themselves with Pyrrhus of Epirus, and defeating the Romans at several battles, the Greek cities were unable to maintain this position and were absorbed by the Roman republic. Shortly afterwards, Rome became involved in Sicily, fighting against the Carthaginians in the First Punic War.

While professing sympathy for Sony's situation, Obama suggested he might have been able to help address the problem if given the chance. \\"You know, had they talked to me directly about this decision, I might have called the movie theater chains and distributors and asked them what that story was,\\" Obama said. Sony's CEO has disputed that the company never reached out, saying he spoke to a senior White House adviser about the situation before Sony announced the decision. White House officials said Sony did discuss cybersecurity with the federal government, but that the White House was never consulted on the decision not to distribute the film. \\"Sometimes this is a matter of setting a tone and being very clear that we're not going to be intimidated by some, you know, cyberhackers,\\" Obama said. \\"And I expect all of us to remember that and operate on that basis going forward.\\" North Korea has denied hacking the studio, and on Saturday proposed a joint investigation with the U.S. to determine the true culprit.

Hans Lundgren was born on 3 November 1957 in Spanga, the son of Sigrid Birgitta (nee Tjerneld), a language teacher, and Karl Johan Hugo Lundgren, an engineer and economist for the Swedish government. He lived in Spanga until the age of 13, when he moved to his grandparents' home in Nyland, Angermanland. Some sources wrongly state 1959 as his year of birth, but Lundgren himself has confirmed it to be 1957. He has two sisters and an older brother; he was raised in the Lutheran church. Lundgren resides in Los Angeles, California. He speaks Swedish and English, as well as smaller amounts of French, German, Italian, Japanese, and Spanish, but is not fluent in five languages as has often been reported. He is an avid football fan. He supported Everton FC when he lived in Europe, but developed more of an interest in international football tournaments (such as the UEFA European Championship and the FIFA World Cup) after moving to Los Angeles. During the 1980s, Lundgren had relationships with Jamaican singer Grace Jones and American model Paula Barbieri. In 1994, he married Anette Qviberg, a jewellery designer and fashion stylist, in Marbella. The couple decided they liked Marbella so much that they rented accommodation there for years, before eventually buying a family home there. They have two daughters: Ida Sigrid Lundgren and Greta Eveline Lundgren, both born in Stockholm. Lundgren and Qviberg have cited the reason for living away from Hollywood is that they want to give their children as normal a childhood as possible. His father died in 2000. In early May 2009, Lundgren's Marbella home was reportedly broken into by three masked burglars who tied up and threatened his wife, but fled when they found a family photo and realized that the house was owned by Lundgren. Lundgren later stated he believed the intruders to be Eastern European and had asked contacts in Bulgaria to investigate them, but to no avail. After the incident, Lundgren's elder daughter, Ida, suffered from PTSD. His wife was the \\"most traumatized\\", and as of 2011, they are divorced. Lundgren currently lives in Los Angeles, California. He broke up with his girlfriend, Jenny Sandersson, in 2014 and it was said that they were secretly engaged and married later.","completion":"This text is about Hans Lundgren, also known as Dolph Lundgren, a Swedish actor, filmmaker, and martial artist."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What's the nickname of the person that the former actor bails out? Academy Award-winning star Margaret \\"Maggie\\" Elliot is a bankrupt actress of a certain age struggling to accept her new non-wealthy reality. She is in denial, and confident she can somehow build herself up again and re-launch her career to its earlier brilliance. After suffering another big disappointment while vainly striving to get that last one good role, she gets drunk, is arrested for DUI, and spends a night in jail. She is bailed out by Jim Johannsen, a younger former actor whom she had helped in the past. Jim, now comfortably settled as the owner of a boatyard, admits that he has loved her ever since those days and, helped by Margaret's daughter Gretchen, tries to help Margaret see that her big screen days as a famous actress are already over. She reluctantly tries to work as a saleswoman in an upscale department store, but overhearing some unkind gossip from two customers wounds her pride and she runs out. Her old agent manages to get her a screen test for a role in a film she'd always wanted to play. She is offered and takes a screen test for a supporting role, believing that if she plays that character as a sexy younger woman -- rather than the middle-aged frump she is seen as by the studio -- she might be able to win the more coveted lead role.

Each year on February 2nd, there is special festival called Groundhog Day ( )' forecasting event in Punxsutawney, Pennsylvania. When it comes, people from around the world, including 5,000 in the small town today, watch this tongue-twisting small town for a sign from one groundhog that supposedly predicts when that years' spring will arrive. If it's a cloudy day outside when the groundhog _ from its cave, then spring will arrive early that year. However, if it is sunny outside, the groundhog will supposedly be scared by its own shadow, hiding underground for six more weeks of cold weather. Of course, Punxsutawney Phil's prediction is no more able to guarantee the extended forecast than your local weatherman. ABC News reports that an analysis by the National Climate Data Center found that Phil's predictions are more often wrong than right. Philis is also found to have made some unpleasant predictions. Ever since 1887, he has predicted 99 extended winters and just 16 early springs .Nine of the years' predictions were unavailable, according to ABC. The holiday began as a German tradition in 18th century and became even more of a cultural phenomenon after the 1993 film Groundhog Day starring Bill Murray. Punxsutawney Phil has become a celebrity in his own right. Each year, the fatter animal with long teeth is watched by millions as he emerges from a cave in the town he is named after.

To clarify, the boy's attire, consisting of a golden crown and a white robe, could signify several possibilities. These include: 1. Cultural dressing: The boy might be wearing the attire because it is traditional or cultural clothing in his community. It could represent a celebration or ceremony, and the attire might have symbolic significance in local customs. In this case, the boy might not be pretending to be a prince. 2.

Question: suppose calm weather patterns happens, how will it affect More rocks will turn into minerals. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect Answer:","completion":"In the given process, wind and water play a critical role in breaking down rocks into smaller pieces and depositing them as sediment. The eventual formation of new rocks from these sediments relies on these weather patterns that contribute to the wearing and transportation of rock particles. Supposing calm weather patterns occur, the frequency and intensity of wind and water erosion processes will be significantly reduced. Calm weather patterns generally translate to less wind, precipitation, and wave activity, which subsequently means that fewer small pieces will be broken off from rocks. This decrease in erosion due to calm weather patterns will directly affect the amount of sediment being deposited and available for the formation of new rocks. As a result of the calm weather patterns, less sediment will be produced, and therefore, fewer layers of sediment will be pressed together by other layers on top. This reduction in the number of layers being compacted will lead to a decrease in the number of new rocks formed, and ultimately, a reduction in the amount of minerals created from these rocks in the given process. To address the second effect mentioned, which involves the dissolving of minerals from the rocks in the sediment and their role in gluing the sediment together into a single rock, the calm weather patterns will have a clear impact. With less sediment being deposited due to the quieter weather conditions, there will be fewer rocks undergoing the process of dissolution and mineralization. This will lead to a reduction in the amount of minerals available to glue the sediment together, thus resulting in fewer new rocks being formed. Therefore, the supposed perturbation of calm weather patterns will have a \\"less\\" effect on the second part of the process mentioned, as it is directly influenced by the amount of sediment being deposited, which in turn is significantly impacted by the weather conditions. The reduction in weather-driven erosion processes will lead to a decrease in sediment production, ultimately resulting in a diminished quantity of minerals being formed from rocks and less new rock formation overall."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - The goblet drum (also chalice drum, tarabuka, tarabaki, darbuka, debuka, doumbek, dumbec, dumbeg, dumbelek, tablah, toumperleki or zerbaghali, / ALA-LC: \\"darbkah\\") is a single head membranophone with a goblet shaped body used mostly in the Middle East, North Africa, South Asia, and Eastern Europe. The African djembe-wassolou is also a goblet membranophone. This article focuses on the \\"Eastern\\" and \\"North-African\\" goblet drum. - The Bambara are a Mand√© people living in west Africa, primarily in Mali but also in Guinea, Burkina Faso and Senegal. They are considered to be amongst the largest Mand√© ethnic groups, and are the dominant Mand√© group in Mali, with 80% of the population speaking the Bambara language, regardless of ethnicity. - A djembe or jembe (; from Malinke \\"jembe\\" ) is a rope-tuned skin-covered goblet drum played with bare hands, originally from West Africa. According to the Bambara people in Mali, the name of the djembe comes from the saying \\"Anke dj√©, anke b√©\\" which translates to \\"everyone gather together in peace\\" and defines the drum's purpose. In the Bambara language, \\"dj√©\\" is the verb for \\"gather\\" and \\"b√©\\" translates as \\"peace.\\" - West Africa, also called Western Africa and the West of Africa, is the westernmost subregion of Africa. West Africa has been defined as including 18 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the island nation of Cape Verde, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Ivory Coast, Liberia, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, the island of Saint Helena, Senegal, Sierra Leone, S√£o Tom√© and Pr√≠ncipe and Togo. - The Bambara (Bamana) language, Bamanankan, is a lingua franca and national language of Mali spoken by perhaps 15 million people, 5 million Bambara people and about 10 million second-language users.

A dunun is a rope - tuned cylindrical drum with a rawhide skin at both ends , most commonly cow or goat . The drum is played with a stick . Depending on the region , a plain straight stick , curved stick with flat head ( similar to the stick used for a tama ) , or a straight stick with a cylindrical head attached at right angles near one end may be used to strike the skin . Traditionally , the drum is played horizontally ( placed on a stand or worn with a shoulder strap ) . For a right - handed player , the right hand plays the skin and the left hand optionally plays a bell that may be mounted on top of the drum or held in the left hand . The latter style is popular in Mali and originally from the Khassonk√© people . Three different sizes of dunun are commonly played in West Africa . The dundunba ( also spelled dununba ) is the largest dunun and has the lowest pitch . Typical size is 60 -- 70 cm ( 24 -- 28 in ) in length and 40 -- 50 cm ( 16 -- 20 in ) in diameter . \`\` Ba '' means \`\` big '' in the Malink√© language , so \`\` dundunba '' literally means \`\` big dunun '' . The sangban is of medium size , with higher pitch than the dundunba . Typical size is 50 -- 60 cm ( 20 -- 24 in ) in length and 30 -- 40 cm ( 12 -- 16 in ) in diameter . The kenkeni is the smallest dunun and has the highest pitch . Typical size is 45 -- 50 cm ( 18 -- 20 in ) in length and 25 -- 35 cm ( 10 -- 14 in ) in diameter .

A mall Santa had a heart attack at work and was rushed to the Emergency Room in full cardiac arrest. Let me explain that a person playing Santa is generally a certain age (white beard) and body type (round) that is predisposed to cardiac disease. We did everything we could but ultimately our efforts were futile. The mall Santa rode his sleigh into the great beyond. A mother, there to visit another patient, was insistent that her 7‚Äì8 year old son be allowed back to visit his grandmother. We had a strict 12 year old age limit visitation policy. I was called to speak with her. ‚ÄùWhy do you have such a stupid Draconian policy?‚Äù She insisted. ‚ÄúThe Emergency Room is no place for a child ma‚Äôam. Besides, the germs and infections he may be exposed to, there are things he may see or hear that a child would have a hard time processing,‚Äù I explained. ‚ÄúLike what?‚Äù She argued. ‚ÄúWell, there are people in pain moaning,‚Äù I answered. ‚ÄúAnd drunks cursing at the staff. It‚Äôs a tough place.‚Äù ‚ÄúHe‚Äôs fine,‚Äù she insisted. ‚ÄúI think I know how to parent. I don‚Äôt need you to worry about what my son is able to handle.‚Äù I caved in and allowed her back. As we passed the room with the dead Santa, a tech exited and opened the curtain. Her child looked in and saw Santa‚Äôs lifeless body, ET tube sticking out of his throat, boots still on but costume cut to shreds and strewn across the room. The child lost it! ‚ÄúMom, Santa Claus is Dead!‚Äù He cried. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not going to get anything for Christmas.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy would someone open the curtain?‚Äù The mother demanded. ‚ÄúI warned you,‚Äù I said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs why we have a 12 years and above visitation policy.‚Äù She was not happy. Come to find out the child had his picture made with that very Santa a few days prior. Very ironic.

The Smothers Brothers are Thomas (\\"Tom\\" - born February 2, 1937) and Richard (\\"Dick\\" - born November 20, 1939), American singers, musicians, and comedians. The brothers' trademark double act was performing folk songs (Tommy on acoustic guitar, Dick on string bass), which usually led to arguments between the siblings. Tommy's signature line was, \\"Mom always liked you best!\\" Tommy (the elder of the two) acted \\"slow\\", and Dick, the straight man, acted \\"superior\\". The brothers were both born on Governors Island in New York Harbor, where their father, Thomas B. Smothers, Jr., a West Point graduate and U.S. Army officer, was stationed. Tom was born on February 2, 1937, and Dick was born on November 20, 1939. Major Smothers served in the 45th Infantry Regiment (United States) and died during World War II, while being transported from a Japanese prisoner of war camp in Fukuoka, Japan, to a POW camp in Mukden, Manchukuo. They were raised by their mother in the Los Angeles area. They graduated from Redondo Union High School in Redondo Beach, California, and attended San Jose State University. After a brief time in a folk group called the Casual Quintet, the brothers made their first professional appearance as a duo in February 1959 at The Purple Onion in San Francisco. They were a popular act in clubs and released several successful top 40 albums for Mercury Records, the most successful being Curb Your Tongue, Knave! in 1964. Their first national television appearance was on The Jack Paar Show on January 28, 1961. The brothers appeared in a segment of the television series Burke's Law, in 1964, in which they played two compulsive hoarders. Their first television series was a situation comedy, The Smothers Brothers Show (1965-1966). Tom played an angel come back to earth to oversee his brother Dick, who played a swinging bachelor.

Q: Question: Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control what? Answer: transcription A:","completion":"Task: In this task, you need to generate supporting facts that explain how regulatory proteins binding to regulatory elements control transcription. Here are the guidelines on how to do this: 1. Understand the question: The question is about the mechanism by which regulatory proteins control transcription by binding to regulatory elements. 2. Define key terms: - Regulatory proteins: These are proteins involved in the regulation of gene expression. - Regulatory elements: These are DNA sequences that influence the expression of one or multiple genes. - Transcription: It is the process of copying a segment of DNA into RNA, which will then be further processed or translated into a protein. 3. Research and generate supporting facts: - Fact 1: Regulatory proteins, also known as transcription factors, bind to specific regulatory element sequences in the DNA, allowing them to turn gene expression on or off. - Fact 2: Transcription initiates when RNA polymerase binds to a specific DNA sequence called the promoter, assisted by regulatory proteins. - Fact 3: Depending on their function, regulatory proteins can either enhance or inhibit transcription. Activators enhance transcription by recruiting the RNA polymerase to the promoter, while repressors hinder the binding of RNA polymerase, inhibiting transcription. - Fact 4: In eukaryotic cells, transcription factors can also modify the structure of chromatin, making the DNA more or less accessible to RNA polymerase, thus regulating transcription. - Fact 5: Regulatory elements and transcription factors are crucial in controlling gene expression, making sure that the right genes are expressed in the correct amount and the right time during an organism's development and in response to environmental stimuli. 4. Use these supporting facts to explain the given answer: - Regulatory proteins bind to regulatory elements to control transcription because they can act as activators or repressors, influencing the binding of RNA polymerase to the promoter, and therefore determine whether a gene will be actively transcribed or not. Their actions are essential in coordinating gene expression in response to various cellular and environmental signals."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Plot Summary: Abigail, a well-respected psychiatrist, and Gordon, her childhood friend, dive head-first into a whirlwind of conspiracy, deceit, and supernatural occurrences when their small town is suddenly struck by a wave of inexplicable events. As the town crumbles, their friendship is put to the ultimate test. Plot: Act I: Abigail, a highly-touted psychiatrist with a seemingly perfect life, resides in the idyllic coastal town she and Gordon, her childhood friend, grew up in. Abigail has dedicated her career to helping others, and as a result, she is highly respected by her peers and the community as a whole. Gordon, on the other hand, is a struggling writer who often finds solace in the supernatural and has developed an obsession with the occult. One day, a series of inexplicable events begin to unfold in the town. Mysterious disappearances, unnatural deaths, and supernatural occurrences shake the community to its core. Media frenzy and paranoia grip the town as the locals start to point fingers, searching for a source, human or otherwise, to explain these terrifying events. Act II: As the hysteria spreads, Abigail's calm demeanor and concrete reasoning allow her to bat away accusations of any supernatural involvement. However, Gordon's roots in the seemingly obscure occult make him an easy target for the townspeople's suspicion. In an attempt to clear both their names, Abigail and Gordon team up, using their unique skills and insights to delve into the core of the bizarre, dark phenomena engulfing their town. Their investigation uncovers a hidden network of secret societies and dark forces operating in their town, which aims to control the inhabitants for nefarious purposes. Abigail and Gordon discover that the society members participate in sacrificial rituals, made in exchange for their safety and prosperity. They soon narrow down the possible culprits and confront the society's leaders, hoping to expose the truth to the town. In a shocking turn of events, they find out that Abigail's late mentor, Dr. Lancaster, was a core member of this shadowy group. Act III: As the conspiracy unravels, new pieces of evidence start to point toward Abigail's connection to the society. Gordon finds out about Abigail‚Äôs mentor's involvement in the group and begins to suspect her motives. Abigail denies any involvement, but doubts begin to seep into their friendship. The trust between Abigail and Gordon starts to recede as Abigail struggles to maintain her innocence. In the climactic confrontation with the secret society's leader, it is revealed that Dr. Lancaster had passed on the leadership mantle to Abigail before his death. Abigail, however, was unaware of this responsibility and had no knowledge of her mentor's dark side. Realizing the web of lies surrounding her, she is left to confront her fate. Feeling utterly betrayed and lost, Gordon turns against Abigail, leaving her to fend for herself against the town's rage and the secret society's deadly ambitions. As their friendship falls apart, Abigail must choose between accepting the leadership role within the secret society or risking everything to fight back, save the town from the darkness, and heal the rift between her and Gordon. The Reckoning of Abigail is a riveting psychological thriller packed with deceit, conspiracy, and the supernatural, forcing two friends to question the very nature of their relationship and morality itself. As old secrets are laid bare, and an entire town's fate hangs in the balance, the plot takes each character on a treacherous journey to expose the truth, even at the cost of their friendship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We have the equation: 75 * w + 83 * w + 937 - 147 = 0 First, let's add 75 * w and 83 * w together because they both have w. 75w + 83w is like having 75 apples plus 83 apples, for a total of 158 apples. So, we get: 158 * w + 937 - 147 = 0 Now, let's deal with the numbers: 937 - 147. Imagine you have 937 candies and you ate 147 candies. You will be left with 790 candies. So, our equation now looks like: 158 * w + 790 = 0 Now, we want to get w all by itself. To do this, let's get rid of the 790 by subtracting 790 from both sides: 158 * w = -790 Now we have only one step left. We need to find out what number, when multiplied by 158, will give us -790. To find w, divide both sides by 158: w = -790 √∑ 158 When we divide -790 by 158, we get: w = -5 And there we have it! The answer is -5. So, w is equal to -5. It's like saying you have -5 toy cars, which means you owe someone 5 toy cars."},{"prompt":"Given the following passage \\"Commensalism describes a relationship between two living organisms where one benefits and the other is not significantly harmed or helped.

Review: I really dislike religious creationism in a scientific wrapping. When people try to remove scientific facts because of their religious belief, I find it a very serious matter. All people are welcome to express their religious beliefs, but when proven facts are denied just because of a persons religion, this is very serious for science and society. How is science thought to be possible when religious ideas are replacing proven facts?The creationists are making movies just to spread their words. Ok, but then I will have the right to oppose these people! Modern genetics show the origin and relations between species, and is very hard to put aside. I will be carefull to keep away from creationist propaganda like this in the future. Answer: Answer:","completion":"Based on the content and tone of the review, it seems negative. The reviewer strongly expresses dissatisfaction and disagreement with the religious creationist themes which they perceived in the movie. They also state their intention to avoid similar content in the future. Their main issue appears to stem from the perceived denial or overlooking of proven scientific facts in favor of religious beliefs.

Given the question: A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the last name of the person who named Winnipeg the Bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg?, using the article: Winnipeg was named the Cultural Capital of Canada in 2010 by Canadian Heritage. As of 2012, there are 26 National Historic Sites of Canada in Winnipeg. One of these, The Forks, attracts four million visitors a year. It is home to the City television studio, Manitoba Theatre for Young People, the Winnipeg International Children's Festival, and the Manitoba Children's Museum. It also features a 30,000-square-foot (2,800 m2) skate plaza, a 8,500-square-foot (790 m2) bowl complex, the Esplanade Riel bridge, a river walkway, Shaw Park, and the Canadian Museum for Human Rights. The Winnipeg Public Library is a public library network with 20 branches throughout the city, including the main Millennium Library.Winnipeg the Bear, which would become the inspiration for part of the name of Winnie-the-Pooh, was purchased in Ontario by Lieutenant Harry Colebourn of the Fort Garry Horse. He named the bear after the regiment's home town of Winnipeg. A. A. Milne later wrote a series of books featuring the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh. The series' illustrator, Ernest H. Shepard, created the only known oil painting of Winnipeg's adopted fictional bear, displayed in Assiniboine Park.The city has developed many distinct dishes and cooking styles, notably in the areas of confectionery and hot-smoked fish. Both the First Nations and more recent Eastern Canadian, European, and Asian immigrants have helped shape Winnipeg's dining scene, giving birth to dishes such as the desserts schmoo torte and wafer pie.The Winnipeg Art Gallery is Western Canada's oldest public art gallery, founded in 1912.

The Cardinal informs Lamont (who has had some experience at exorcism, and has been exposed to Merrin's teachings) that Merrin is up on posthumous heresy charges due to his controversial writings.

Background: Hunter was born in New York City, the son of Gertrude (nee Gelien) and Charles Kelm. His mother, from Hamburg, was a German Roman Catholic immigrant, and his father was Jewish. Hunter's father was reportedly abusive, and within a few years of his birth, his parents divorced. Tab grew up in California with his mother, older brother Walter, and maternal grandparents, John Henry and Ida (nee Sonnenfleth) Context: Hunter had a 1957 hit record with the song \\"Young Love,\\" which was No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart for six weeks (seven weeks on the UK Chart) and became one of the larger hits of the Rock 'n' Roll era. It sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. He had the hit, \\"Ninety-Nine Ways,\\" which peaked at No. 11 in the US and No. 5 in the UK. His success prompted Jack L. Warner to enforce the actor's contract with the Warner Bros. studio by banning Dot Records, the label for which Hunter had recorded the single (and which was owned by rival Paramount Pictures), from releasing a follow-up album he had recorded for them. He established Warner Bros. Records specifically for Hunter. Hunter's acting career was also at its zenith. William Wellman used him again in a war film, Lafayette Escadrille (1958). Columbia Pictures borrowed him for a Western, Gunman's Walk (1958), a film that Hunter considers his favorite role. Hunter starred in the 1958 musical film Damn Yankees, in which he played Joe Hardy of Washington, D.C.'s American League baseball club. The film had originally been a Broadway show, but Hunter was the only one in the film version who had not appeared in the original cast. The show was based on the 1954 best-selling book The Year the Yankees Lost the Pennant by Douglass Wallop. Hunter later said the filming was hellish because director George Abbott was only interested in recreating the stage version word for word. He also starred in They Came to Cordura (1959), with Gary Cooper and Rita Hayworth. Sidney Lumet starred him opposite Sophia Loren in That Kind of Woman (1959). Question: Did he have any other hits?

Dwight Clark caught the pass thrown by which quarterback known as \\"Joe Cool\\" in the play known simply as \\"The Catch\\"? Answer:","completion":"The pass that Dwight Clark caught, famously known as \\"The Catch,\\" was thrown by quarterback Joe Montana. Joe Montana is internationally acclaimed for his American football skills; he is often referred to as \\"Joe Cool,\\" reflecting his under-pressure performance in the football field. This legendary play took place on January 10, 1982, during the National Football Conference (NFC) Championship between the Dallas Cowboys and the San Francisco 49ers. This was a crucial play with just 58 seconds left on the clock. The 49ers were trailing 27-21 against the Cowboys. If the 49ers had failed to score a touchdown, they would have lost the game and their chance at the Super Bowl. The 49ers were on the third down with 3 yards to go for a touchdown from the Dallas Cowboys' 6-yard line. Joe Montana took the snap and rolled to his right. Initially, it appeared as though Montana was going to be sacked or forced out of bounds. However, he ended up throwing the ball toward the back of the end zone. The throw looked like it was going out of bounds. This is when Dwight Clark made his athletic leap, reaching around 10 feet into the air. He managed to catch the football with his fingertips, securing the touchdown. The 49ers won the game with the extra point, taking the score to 28-27. This memorable touchdown came to be simply known as \\"The Catch,\\" and it sealed the 49ers‚Äô victory in what would be a long line of successes during the 1980s. Joe Montana's calm composure under immense pressure gave him his nickname \\"Joe Cool.\\" This pass is a perfect instance demonstrating why he earned this title. His roles in 'The Catch' and his ability to remain emotionally unswerving in high-pressure, high-stakes situations have forever solidified Montana's place in sporting history. This awesomely executed play ultimately led to the 49ers' Super Bowl victory that season and marked the beginning of their tremendous run in the 1980s."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

These can help you understand the significance of the color in your dream. For example, if you have a significant memory of wearing a red dress to an important event, that memory might be influencing the meaning of your dream. Step 4: Reflect on current emotions or situations in your life Consider any current emotions or situations in your life that may be related to the color red or the overall theme of the dream. For example, if you recently encountered a dangerous or emotionally charged situation, the color red might symbolize that experience in your dream. Step 5: Cross-reference the dream with your dream diary Consult your dream diary for any recurring themes, images, or situations involving the color red. This can help illuminate any patterns or deeper meanings behind the red present in your recent dream. Step 6: Interpret the dream Based on the contextual information from your dream, your research on common meanings of the color red, and your personal associations with the color, interpret your dream as accurately as possible.

Step 1: Identify the structure of the sentence. The sentence structure is: \\"There's + (noun) + (prepositional phrase).\\" Step 2: Analyze the syntax (the arrangement of words and phrases to create well-formed sentences). - \\"There's\\" is a contraction for \\"There is\\" and is used to indicate the existence or presence of something. - \\"everything\\" is a pronoun, used to refer to all things included or involved in a prior statement or action. - \\"Mary had asked for\\" is a relative clause referring to a request or desire previously expressed by Mary. - \\"in this store\\" is a prepositional phrase, providing information about where the requested items can be found. The syntax appears to be correct. Step 3: Analyze the semantics (the meaning of the sentence). The sentence states that all the items which Mary had requested can be found in the store.

Viking metal is a style of heavy metal music characterized by a lyrical and thematic focus on Norse mythology, Norse paganism, and the Viking Age. Viking metal is quite diverse as a musical style, to the point where some consider it more a cross-genre term than a genre, but it is typically seen as black metal with influences from Nordic folk music. Common traits include a slow-paced and heavy riffing style, anthemic choruses, use of both sung and harsh vocals, a reliance on folk instrumentation, and often the use of keyboards for atmospheric effect. Viking metal emerged from black metal during the late 1980s and early 1990s, sharing with black metal an opposition to Christianity, but rejecting Satanism and occult themes in favor of the Vikings and paganism. It is similar, in lyrics, sound, and thematic imagery, to pagan metal, but pagan metal has a broader mythological focus and uses folk instrumentation more extensively. Most Viking metal bands originate from the Nordic countries, and nearly all bands claim that their members descend, directly or indirectly, from Vikings. Many scholars view Viking metal and the related black, pagan, and folk metal genres as part of broader modern Pagan and neo-v√∂lkisch movements as well as part of a global movement of renewed interest in, and celebration of, local and regional ethnicities. Though artists such as Led Zeppelin, Yngwie Malmsteen, Heavy Load, and Manowar had previously dealt with Viking themes, Bathory from Sweden is generally credited with pioneering the style with its albums Blood Fire Death (1988) and Hammerheart (1990), which launched a renewed interest in the Viking Age among heavy metal musicians. Enslaved, from Norway, followed up on this burgeoning Viking trend with Hordanes Land (1993) and Vikingligr Veldi (1994). Burzum, Emperor, Einherjer, and Helheim, among others, helped further develop the genre in the early and mid-1990s. As early as 1989 with the founding of the German band Falkenbach, Viking metal began spreading from the Nordic countries to...

Q:Given the following context: George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame. answer the following question: What is the last name of the person who decided to devote themselves to portrait painting in 1856?

But some researchers say that is what persons from thirteen to nineteen years old are doing. While teenagers can look all grown up, studies have shown that their brains are still developing. How much this explains their behavior, though, is a subject of debate. Jay Giedd of America's National Institutes of Health is a leader in this area of research. Doctor Giedd has been studying a group of young people since 1991. They visit him every two years for imaging tests of their brains. He says considerable development continues in young people from the teenage years into the twenties. A part of the brain called the dorsal-lateral prefrontal cortex appears especially undeveloped in teenagers. Researchers believe that this area controls judgment and consideration of risk. So, its underdevelopment may explain why young people seem more willing to take risks like driving too fast. Laurence Steinberg is a psychology professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. He says stronger laws and stronger parental control are needed to protect teens from themselves. That includes raising the age for driving. He says research shows that teenage brains are not fully equipped to control behavior. Other researchers, however, say there is not enough evidence to make a strong case for such findings. Psychologist Robert Epstein is a visiting scholar at the University of California in San Diego. Mr. Epstein notes that teen behavior differs from culture to culture. He says behavior depends for the most part on socialization. He believes that teenagers will demonstrate better, safer behavior if they spend more time with adults, and are treated more like them. But is that always true? Mike Males works at the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice in San Francisco. He suggests that all of this talk lately about brainless teens could be an attempt to take away attention from the reality. Writing in the New York Times, he says it is middle-aged adults whose behavior has worsened. In his... Options: A Because they can all look grown up in that way.

Wells' The War of the Worlds Movie plot: This authentic movie adaptation of the H. G. Wells classic novel follows the story of humanity at the turn of the 20th century as a large cylinder from space falls on the English countryside.Set in England in the early 1890s, the first part of the film follows the experience of a journalist from Woking, England known as \\"the writer\\" (Anthony Piana), gets involved with the discovery of a \\"falling star\\" on Horsell Common which later turns out to be a Martian Cylinder. The writer and a fellow astrometer named Mr. Ogilve travel to the impact site along with several other people to view the mysterious Cylinder. The Cylinder opens and a large, multi-tenticled creature emerges. After a minute, the Martian retreats back into the Cylinder and then a small dish-shaped device appears on the top of the cylinder. The Martians start killing people with a \\"heat ray\\"; a type of weapon that incinerates everyone and everything in its path. Dozens of people, including Ogilve, are burned alive. The writer discovers his house is in range of the Heat Ray and decides to take his wife (Susan Gorforth) and her maid to the comparable safety of her cousins in the nearby town of Leatherhead. He does not stay with them after promising to return the horse-drawn cart to the landlord of The Spotted Dog Inn near his home. However, when he returns the horse and cart, the owners and most of the population of that town is dead; killed not by a heat ray but by a chemical weapon known as the \\"black smoke\\"; a lethal type of poison gas that kills people and animals instantly.As the writer returns to Leatherhead, his wife and housekeeper are gone, having left behind a note that they are going to London to find help and safety.

Article: Mosquitoes lay their eggs in stagnant water, so the first step to reducing the number of mosquitoes on your property is to eliminate as much stagnant water from your property as possible. Remove any unnecessary basins you may have in your yard, including wheel barrows, buckets, and temporary swimming pools. If these items must remain outside, turn them upside down when not in use. Clear your gutters frequently. They often get clogged with leaves and other debris, which can hold small amounts of water. Even leaves on your lawn can provide enough water for mosquito larvae, so be sure to rake them up promptly. Add topsoil to low areas that tend to accumulate water. In extreme cases, you may need to regrade your yard to improve drainage. If any of your trees have rotted areas where water accumulates, fill the holes with mortar. Sometimes it is not possible to eliminate all standing water. If you have a bird bath or a pond, for example, you can treat the water with larvicides that you can purchase at most gardening or home improvement stores. Most of these products contain either methoprene or Bacillus thuringiensis israelensis, neither of which are believed to be toxic to humans, pets, fish, or birds when used appropriately. Read the directions carefully to determine how often you must reapply the larvicide. Protection can last for a month or more, but it depends on the amount of water being treated. If you have a swimming pool, be sure to treat the water that accumulates on the cover during the off-season. If you have sources of water that cannot be treated, be sure to dump the water out and refill it every few days in order to interrupt the mosquito life cycle. Adult mosquitoes can emerge in less than two weeks after eggs are laid, so never let the water sit for longer than that. If you have items such as outdoor tarps that accumulate small amounts of water, tend to them regularly to ensure that water never stands for more than a few days at a time. If you are aware of possible mosquito breeding grounds that are not on your property, you should report them to the appropriate agency. Many cities and counties have vector control agencies, which are responsible for controlling the populations of disease-spreading pests. If your area does not have such an agency, report the issue to your local public health department. Whether the area is on public land or private property, the appropriate agency in your area may be able to take steps to remedy the problem. What is a summary of what this article is about?","completion":"This article is about how to reduce the number of mosquitoes in your yard by getting rid of stagnant water where they lay their eggs. You can do this by removing containers that hold water, clearing gutters, raking leaves, and improving yard drainage.

Article: Parents whose children think the latest Nike or Adidas shoes may be better than buying old-fashioned plimsolls because they encourage a healthier style of running, researchers said. Big companies, like Nike and Adidas, make millions of dollars from selling highly-cushioned shoes both as fashion and sports shoes. The researchers warn that wearing such shoes from an early age can make it difficult to run in a healthy way. Once we have grown used to running in this kind of shoes, it is very difficult to change our technique, even if we remove our shoes, it can raise the risk of injury. Children should be encouraged to wear shoes with thin soles such as plimsolls from a young age to help them develop a natural \\"barefoot\\" running style, experts said. Dr Mick Wilknson, who did the research, told the British Science Festival in Newcastle, \\"If I would advise someone on what to give their child, I would say don't go and buy them expensive Adidas or Nike, just get them a pair of flexible, flat shoes. Give them basic foot-ware, nothing fancy, nothing particularly cushioned.\\" Running in flat shoes, barefoot, encourages the runner to use the front of their foot which is a better technique for running, especially long distances as the human was designed to do. Around the world, and in particular in the US, running barefoot is becoming more and more popular with many long distance runners training without shoes. Dr Mick Wilknson believes that training and running barefoot or in flat running shoes can help reduce injuries to runners, he said: \\"Injury rates in running have not changed since the 1970s, despite claims of improvements in running shoes. That has led some to conclude that barefoot running is better.\\" Question: Why are people advised to wear plimsolls? - They have a new fashion - They have better quality. - They are healthier - They are cheaper.

Context: Called the PURE (Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology) study, this was a very large observational study looking at the link between fat and carbohydrate consumption and longevity in 18 countries across 5 continents. Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn‚Äôt cardiovascular disease they were dying from. What those other causes of death were exactly is unclear. Perhaps getting hit by a car running for a Mars Bar was one of them as a recent commenter on my Facebook page theorised. A paradigm shift?

How to make homemade vanilla frosting Measure and pour the ingredients into a medium sized bowl. Beat the ingredients. Use either a hand mixer or a whisk to fully incorporate the ingredients until they are smooth. Available options: 1). The more flour, butter, and salt you use, the smoother the frosting will become. When you are done, you will have a smooth and uniform shape. 2). As you beat the ingredients, consider adding a few drops of food coloring into the mixture until you have a rich color. Vanilla extract tends to come out messier after ten minutes, so you may want to allow it to simmer longer or stop beating and see if it adds flavor. 3). Keep whipping the ingredients until you achieve a fluffy and smooth texture. If the frosting seems too runny, add more powdered sugar. 4). You can also use a fork to beat the sugar, vanilla and baking soda together until well combined. Place the softened mix in a 8 x 8 1/4 \\" sized container and refrigerate it overnight.","completion":"After using either a hand mixer or a whisk to fully incorporate the ingredients until they are smooth, you have several options to continue making your homemade vanilla frosting: 1) Adjust the frosting's texture: If you'd like a smoother frosting, you can experiment with the proportions of flour, butter, and salt in the recipe. A higher ratio of these ingredients generally results in a smoother mixture. Once you've adjusted the ingredients and mixed them well, the frosting should be smooth and have a uniform appearance. 2) Add food coloring: To give your frosting a vibrant color, consider incorporating a few drops of food coloring as you beat the ingredients. Be cautious as the more food coloring you use, the darker the color will be. Keep in mind that vanilla extract might create a slightly messier look after ten minutes of beating, so you might want to allow it to simmer longer or stop beating and see if it adds the desired amount of flavor. 3) Achieve the desired consistency: Whip the ingredients continuously until you reach the fluffy and smooth texture that you're aiming for. If your frosting appears too runny, gradually add more powdered sugar to thicken it up. Make sure to mix the powdered sugar thoroughly to prevent any lumps from forming in the frosting. 4) Alternative mixing method: If you don't have a hand mixer or whisk, you can use a fork to beat the sugar, vanilla, and baking soda together until they're well combined. Once you've achieved a smooth mixture, transfer it to an 8 x 8 1/4\\" sized container and cover it with plastic wrap or a lid. Refrigerate the frosting overnight to allow it to set properly. After following one or more of these suggestions, you should have a delicious, smooth, and colorful homemade vanilla frosting that's ready to be used for decorating cakes, cupcakes, or other desserts. Before using the frosting, you may want to give it a quick stir to ensure its consistency is even throughout. Remember to always store the unused frosting in the refrigerator to maintain its freshness and stability.

LCS is a sequence of elements that appears in the same order in both lists (A and B), while not necessarily being consecutive elements. To find the LCS for the given lists, we can use dynamic programming. We can create a 2D matrix (dp) with dimensions (len(A)+1) x (len(B)+1). The matrix will store the lengths of LCS for different substrings of A and B. Here are the steps to fill the matrix and find the LCS: 1. Initialize the first row and first column of the matrix dp with 0. This is because if either A or B is an empty list, the LCS length is 0. 2. Loop through the elements of list A (outer loop) and list B (inner loop), comparing the elements at specific positions i and j respectively. 3. If the elements are equal (A[i-1] == B[j-1]), then the LCS includes this element, so we update the dp matrix by adding 1 to the value from the diagonal (dp[i-1][j-1] + 1). 4. If the elements are not equal, then the LCS does not include this pair of elements, and we take the maximum of the previous elements in either row or column (max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])). 5. The value of dp[len(A)][len(B)] will be the length of the longest common subsequence. 6. To find the subsequence itself, we can backtrack through the dp matrix starting from the bottom-right corner, following the appropriate diagonal, left, or up moves depending on the values in the matrix. In the example given, using these steps, we will find the following LCS for lists A and B: ['D', '7133', 'B', 'd', '9235', '2309', 'c', '2707', 'm', 'N', '7615', '1699', 'A']"},{"prompt":"Question: Read the article and select the best answer.

However, consuming excessive amounts of food during breakfast can lead to overeating, which is not a healthy habit. Overeating can have several negative consequences, including weight gain, discomfort, sluggishness, and increased risk of chronic health issues like diabetes and heart disease.

After getting here,her large family worked hard to build a new life in America. They never had much money but were rich in love. One day,when I was about 5 or 6 years old, my parents and brothers went on a trip. It was just me and Nanny in the house for the weekend. Nanny seemed so happy to be taking care of me all by herself. She made me a special breakfast that first morning. However, all I could do was to complain about how the food was not how Mom always made it. Nanny quietly put down the plate and went into the living room. I followed a minute later and saw that she had tears in her eyes. It was the first time I had ever seen my strong and proud grandmother cry and I was the one who had caused it. I walked over to Nanny, climbed on her lap, and for the first time in my short life I did something else too. I apologized without being told to and asked Nanny to forgive me. She smiled, rubbed my head, and told me I was a good boy even though I didn't feel like one then. That memory just like my Nanny's love will stay in my heart forever. It is a sign of both strength and wisdom. Asking for forgiveness helps us to learn, to grow, and to love.

Step 1: Identify the main point of the statement. The short movie review says, \\"should come with the warning 'for serious film buffs only!'\\" Step 2: Analyze the tone and focus of the statement. In this statement, the critic seems to be emphasizing that the movie is specifically tailored for serious film buffs; meaning that it's potentially not suitable or enjoyable for a more general audience. Step 3: Assess the implication of the statement. The critic's use of the word \\"warning\\" suggests that there is a cautionary element to the review. This implies that the movie may not be universally well-received or enjoyed by everyone. Step 4: Determine the overall sentiment of the statement. Based on my analysis, it appears that the critic has a somewhat mixed or neutral view of the movie. While they acknowledge that the movie might be appreciated by a niche audience of serious film buffs, the language and tone of the review also carry a slightly negative undertone due to the inclusion of a warning. Conclusion: The critic's thinking leans more towards the negative side, as the use of the warning suggests caution for potential viewers who are not serious film buffs.

She has no idea that her husband, Del (Aaron Eckhart), a car salesman, is having an affair with his secretary and that he intends to leave Betty to pursue a relationship with her. She also doesn't know that her husband supplements his income by selling drugs out of the car dealership. When Betty calls to leave a message about borrowing a Buick LeSabre for her birthday, her husband tells her to take a different car, as the LeSabre (unknown to Betty) has stolen drugs hidden in the trunk. Two hitmen, Charlie and Wesley (Morgan Freeman and Chris Rock), show up at the house with Betty's husband. The hitmen torture Betty's husband into revealing that he has hidden the drugs in the trunk of a car, but Wesley scalps him anyway. Betty witnesses the murder and experiences a fugue state, escaping the reality of murder into the comforting fantasy of the soap opera. In her mind, she assumes the identity of one of the characters in the daytime drama, a nurse. That evening, Sheriff Eldon Ballard (Pruitt Taylor Vince), local reporter Roy Ostery (Crispin Glover), and several policemen examine the crime scene while Betty calmly packs a suitcase. She seems oblivious to the murder, even with the investigation going on right in her house. At the police station, a psychiatrist examines her. Betty spends the night at her friend's house, sleeping in a child's bedroom with the innocence of a little girl. In the middle of the night, she gets into her car and drives off.

Have a hangout with your friends, get walking directions to a fantastic new restaurant, or get an update on that delayed flight. Take advantage of the Glass voice commands. Glass can free your hands up to do other things like golfing, cooking, or juggling flaming torches while balancing on a beach ball (but also see Don‚Äôts #2). This is great for looking up how many ounces in a cup while you cook, or taking a one-of-a-kind photo from your unique perspective. Ask for permission. Standing alone in the corner of a room staring at people while recording them through Glass is not going to win you any friends (see Don‚Äôts #4). The Glass camera function is no different from a cell phone so behave as you would with your phone and ask permission before taking photos or videos of others. Use screen lock. Glass screen lock works like your smartphone‚Äôs screen lock: it passcode-protects your device to help prevent others from using it. If you ever lose your device or have it stolen by a budding online resale entrepreneur, you can turn off Glassware and perform a remote wipe (e.g. factory reset) of the device, removing all your information from the device. All you need to do is go to your MyGlass page on your browser, or the MyGlass App on your phone. Be an active and vocal member of the Glass Explorer Community. The Explorer Program was created in order to have a place where our Explorers can give feedback, share content and communicate with the Glass team. It‚Äôs been hugely successful over the past year and this is due to our wonderful group of Explorers. They are constantly sharing their worlds with us and with each other, allowing us to hear and work on all the great feedback and stories our Explorers give us (and, wow, do they give us a lot!). DON‚ÄôTS: Glass-out. Glass was built for short bursts of information and interactions that allow you to quickly get back to doing the other things you love. If you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you‚Äôre probably looking pretty weird to the people around you. So don‚Äôt read War and Peace on Glass. Things like that are better done on bigger screens. Rock Glass while doing high-impact sports. Glass is a piece of technology, so use common sense. Water skiing, bull riding or cage fighting with Glass are probably not good ideas. Wear it and expect to be ignored. Let‚Äôs face it, you‚Äôre gonna get some questions. Be patient and explain that Glass has a lot of the same features as a mobile phone (camera, maps, email, etc.). Also, develop your own etiquette. If you‚Äôre worried about someone interrupting that romantic dinner at a nice restaurant with a question about Glass, just take it off and put it around the back of your neck or in your bag. Be creepy or rude (aka, a ‚ÄúGlasshole‚Äù). Respect others' privacy and if they have questions about Glass don‚Äôt get snappy. Be polite and explain what Glass does and remember, a quick demo can go a long way. In places where cell phone cameras aren‚Äôt allowed, the same rules will apply to Glass. If you‚Äôre asked to turn your phone off, turn Glass off as well. Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers. ||||| Google employees train users in Glass basics at a \\"Basecamp\\" event in Los Angeles in 2013. Philip Montgomery / Google Google is officially putting the users of its Glass headset on notice with a set of do's and don'ts ‚Äî not least among which is an unambiguous warning not to be \\"creepy or rude (aka, a \\"Gla**hole).\\" This isn't the first guide to Glass etiquette ‚Äî ours came out last May ‚Äî but it is the first such document from Google. Other than basic tutorials and promotional materials, the company hadn't really weighed in on what you should and shouldn't be doing with the technology. That's probably because it has been waiting to hear back from its many Glass Explorers, the first cohort of cyber-cyclops to wear the devices out in public. The do's and don'ts are assembled from this group's feedback. Do use Glass voice commands to look up how many ounces are in a cup while your hands are covered in dough ‚Äî but don't do that while on a date. Do wear Glass on your morning jog or bike commute ‚Äî but don't wear it \\"water skiing, bull riding, or cage fighting.\\" And, of course, don't \\"be creepy or rude\\": \\"Respect others and if they have questions about Glass don't get snappy... In places where cell phone cameras aren't allowed, the same rules apply to Glass... Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other explorers.\\" Perhaps Google was inspired to publish the list by recent stories of Glass users being asked to leave Seattle bars or ambushed by federal agents in a movie theater. Apparently we still have a lot to learn. ||||| Google, perhaps mindful of some negative reactions to its revolution, offers a dos and don'ts guide. The don'ts mostly revolve around human behavior. Explorers need etiquette? (Credit: Google) It's hard being misunderstood. Sometimes you have to ask yourself: \\"Is it these desperate ingrates who don't see my genius? Or might it be me?\\" Why did this thought enter my troubled day? Oh, because Google has just released a guide to help its Explorers behave. In the past, Google has been happy to let its pioneers do their thing. Now, after one or two got a pie in the ear, Google is keen to help the nerds assimilate with the world as it sadly is. The guide is a series of dos and don'ts. Naturally, the don'ts are more interesting. The first seems something of a reaction to fears that prolonged use of the device might not be wise. Last week, Google Glass enthusiast Chris Barrett told me how he'd experienced severe headaches when he wore it for any length of time. The first of Google's new don'ts tells users not to \\"Glass-Out.\\" It explains: \\"Glass was built for short bursts of information and interactions that allow you to quickly get back to doing the other things you love.\\" And \\"things you love\\" shouldn't include eight hours of creepy photography. Still, this guide doesn't mention health reasons. Rather: \\"If you find yourself staring off into the prism for long periods of time you're probably looking pretty weird to the people around you.\\" As if you don't already look pretty weird to the people around you. While it's helpful of Google's guide to remind people not to wear Glass when playing contact sports, it's clear the company is most concerned about social reaction. Its third don't reminds Explorers that they will, indeed, be stared at and begs them to be polite. The last don't seems like the most significant. Don't \\"be creepy or rude (aka, a \\"Glasshole\\").\\" This might remind the owners of the Lost Lake Cafe in Seattle of the customer who didn't appreciate being asked to take his device off and the fuss that ensued. Not only was he asked to leave, but the restaurant then described him and his kind as \\"man children stinkin up the joint.\\" Google seems concerned that Glassholes are stinkin' up the company's hopefully addictive joint. As the guide explains: \\"Breaking the rules or being rude will not get businesses excited about Glass and will ruin it for other Explorers.\\" What next?

How ‚ÄòClueless‚Äô changed my life I honestly don‚Äôt remember the first time I saw ‚ÄúClueless,‚Äù but I know it wasn‚Äôt in a theater in 1995, when I was 6 and the PG-13 film, which turns 20 this week, became that summer‚Äôs runaway hit. What I can tell you is that I‚Äôve watched it around a bazillion times since then ‚Äî on VHS, DVD, Netflix ‚Äî and to it I owe an infant love of fashion that blossomed into a grown-up career. Before ‚ÄúClueless,‚Äù clothes were just things my mom bought to help me not be naked. I had no concept of ‚Äúfashion‚Äù ‚Äî that is, the system and language of clothing ‚Äî until Cher Horowitz & Co. showed me the way. One of the most important lessons I learned is in the first two minutes of the film: the famous virtual closet scene. As decadent as Cher‚Äôs touch-screen proto-app seemed when I was the 10-year-old owner of maybe five T-shirts, at some point I realized the sequence isn‚Äôt as much about the excesses of a Beverly Hills rich girl as it is about giving a damn when getting dressed. The yellow tartan ensemble she ends up choosing reflects effort, an eye for coordination and an attention to detail. Her method is preternatural power-suiting, but the message is simpler: Take pride in your everyday appearance. That unspoken motto shows up in the central narrative as Cher and Dionne‚Äôs earnest effort to glamorize the new kid, Tai. ‚ÄúCher‚Äôs main thrill in life is a makeover,‚Äù Dee says ‚Äî and in one jaunty montage we see a grungy misfit turned into a candidate for Most Popular Girl in School. Of course, popularity is hardly the point. From her makeover Tai gains confidence, and I grasped the reality of personal branding. ‚ÄúClothes don‚Äôt make the man‚Äù? As if! With the right aesthetic and attitude, you can be anyone you want to be. (Just ask Madonna, Caitlyn Jenner or Marky ‚Äî err ‚Äî Mark Wahlberg.) Then there are the designer brands. Via ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù I came to understand labels, and that the names attached to the stuff you put on are of actual people, and they use clothes to communicate ideas. Cher‚Äôs white date-night slip, for instance, is Calvin Klein minimalism ‚Äî and sex-tinged controversy ‚Äî at its best. That her father, Mel, questions its legitimacy as a dress only furthers the fact. Oh, and Ala√Øa? Cher was right: the Tunisian-born couturier is way important ‚Äî and, given his price points, perhaps worth taking a gunshot for. On a surface level, the relationship I have with this female-centric comedy is not exactly the one relished by some of my (real and metaphoric) sisters. I‚Äôve always found shopping a bit tedious, and as a socialized cis boy growing up in the suburbs, there was never a potent drive to wear ‚Äî at least outside my head ‚Äî the plaid skirts, sheer shirts, knee-high socks and mini backpacks the film made into trendy must-haves. Thankfully, there was Christian, Cher‚Äôs crush, the Cake Boy with timeless style that took a back seat. As a gay man who was closeted until the age of 17, it‚Äôs impossible to fully articulate my appreciation for his role ‚Äî a homosexual teen free of identity struggle, who unabashedly dressed better than the prettiest girls and who was accepted by all of his peers. The voluminous pleated pants and tucked-in tees I champion now are no doubt a subconscious ode to the would-be James Jean. ‚ÄúHe always wants things to be beautiful and interesting,‚Äù Cher says of her friend in a series of sweet epiphanies at the end. This is why, two decades later, ‚ÄúClueless‚Äù still resonates: I don‚Äôt care what anyone says ‚Äî she was talking about me. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article describes how the movie \\"Clueless\\" significantly influenced the author's life and sparked their interest in fashion.

Marion Post is a New York philosophy professor past the age of 50 on a leave of absence to write a new book. Due to construction work in their building, she sublets a furnished flat downtown to have peace and quiet. Her work there is interrupted by voices from a neighboring office in the building where a therapist conducts his analysis. She quickly realizes that she is privy to the despairing sessions of another woman, Hope, who is disturbed by a growing feeling that her life is false and empty. Her words strike a chord in Marion, who begins to question herself in the same way. She comes to realize that, like her father, she has been unfair, unkind and judgmental to the people closest to her: her unsuccessful brother Paul and his wife Lynn, who feel they embarrass her; her best friend from high school Claire, who feels eclipsed by her; her first husband Sam, who eventually committed suicide; and her stepdaughter Laura, who admires her but resents her high-handedness. She also realizes that her marriage to her second husband, Ken, is unfulfilling and that she missed her one chance at love with his best friend Larry. She finally manages to meet the woman in therapy as she contemplates a Klimt painting called \\"Hope\\". Although she wants to know more about the woman, she ends up talking more about herself, realizing that she made a mistake by having an abortion years ago and that at her age there are many things in life she will not have anymore. She leaves Ken after catching him having an affair. She resolves to change her life for the better, and takes steps to repair her relationship with Paul and Laura. By the end of the film, she reflects that, for the first time in years, she feels hopeful.

Options: *Add a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster. *Add a few pieces of cat litter to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster.","completion":"To determine which of these solutions is better for the given goal, I will compare both options and assess their potential effects on wrinkle reduction. Option 1: Add a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster. Step 1: Adding ice cubes to the laundry machine. The ice cubes will quickly melt in hot water (or even warm water) and turn into cold water. Step 2: Assessing the potential effects of cold water on wrinkle reduction. Cold water may help set fabrics in a more relaxed state, which can potentially reduce wrinkles. Additionally, cold water is less likely to shrink clothes, which is a factor when it comes to wrinkling. Option 2: Add a few pieces of cat litter to the laundry machine before starting it to get rid of wrinkles faster. Step 1: Adding cat litter to the laundry machine. Cat litter consists of small pieces that are meant for absorbing liquids and capturing odors, in a controlled environment, such as in a litter box. Step 2: Assessing the potential effects of cat litter on wrinkle reduction. Adding cat litter to the laundry machine doesn't seem to have any direct effect on wrinkle reduction. Moreover, it may actually cause issues like clogging the machine or leaving residue on the clothes. Based on the assessments, Option 1 (adding a few ice cubes to the laundry machine before starting it) seems to be a better solution for the goal of getting wrinkles out of clothes faster. While its effects might not be substantial, it is more likely to contribute positively to wrinkle reduction compared to adding cat litter, which may lead to other issues."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \\"Ghost\\".

The Daily Mail has uncovered appalling cases of patients dying while on waiting lists or being forced to move to England for life-saving treatment. Over the next few days, our investigation will expose horrifying neglect and a political establishment in denial. Scroll down for video. Health campaigners have demanded an investigation into the Labour-run Welsh NHS. Ed Miliband intends to place running NHS at heart of Labour's election campaign next May - despite the party's dismal record. Despite his party‚Äôs dismal record in Wales, Ed Miliband wants to place the running of the NHS at the heart of Labour‚Äôs election campaign next May. Yet families whose loved ones have suffered in Welsh hospitals say the situation is even worse than the Mid Staffordshire scandal. The British Medical Association, the Conservatives, Plaid Cymru nationalists and Labour MP Ann Clwyd are all demanding an independent inquiry. And a survey out today shows that seven out of ten voters agree. The Mail‚Äôs investigation will reveal that:. Yesterday another scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients. The British Medical Association warned last month that the NHS in Wales was facing ‚Äòimminent meltdown‚Äô and called for an independent investigation. Last year the College of Emergency Medicine wrote to the Welsh health minister warning that casualty units were putting patients at risk. Labour MP Ann Clwyd is among those demanding an independent inquiry into the situation in hospitals. And Sir Bruce Keogh of NHS England wrote to his Welsh counterpart last November warning six hospitals should be probed over ‚Äòpersistently high‚Äô mortality rates. Today‚Äôs survey, commissioned by the Welsh Conservatives, found that a third of people with recent experience of hospital treatment had encountered problems and nearly one in five felt their concerns were not taken seriously. It found that 71 per cent back an independent inquiry into the NHS and 60 per cent believe their health service has deteriorated over the past five years. Respondents included a retired nurse who complained that senior managers were too afraid to act on bad practice. An orthopaedic consultant who answered the questionnaire said Wales‚Äôs NHS was ‚Äòon the verge of becoming a third-world health service‚Äô. The research was based on 3,295 responses to a survey posted online and sent to 5,000 homes chosen at random. Gareth Williams has campaigned to expose failings at the Abertawe Bro Morgannwg University health board in South Wales after his mother Lilian suffered neglect before her death in hospital. ‚ÄòI believe the indifference of government ministers in Cardiff is callous,‚Äô said the 54-year-old retired teacher. ‚ÄòThey can no longer hold up the pretence that there are only isolated concerns in ABMU or Wales. In Wales we are still in denial. I think we are where England was when the Mid Staffs scandal broke.‚Äô Hundreds of patients died through neglect at Stafford Hospital. Mr Williams said he and fellow campaigners have been contacted by seven whistleblower nurses. Miss Clwyd has described how her husband died like a ‚Äòbattery hen‚Äô at University Hospital Wales in October 2012. She highlighted high mortality rates at some Welsh hospitals and long waiting times for diagnostic tests. A scandal erupted at the Glan Clwyd Hospital in Rhyl, North Wales, yesterday where police are investigating claims that staff used furniture to restrain dementia patients. A spokesman for the Cardiff administration said: ‚ÄòThe vast majority of people in Wales receive excellent care from our NHS, which is more open, transparent and is subjected to a higher level of scrutiny than any other health service in the UK.

Let's compare the two sentences in detail. 1. The use of awakening drains the colors from the surrounding objects, and the less colorful an object is, the harder it is to apply awakening to it. In this sentence, the first part (before the comma) explains that the use of awakening directly causes the colors to be drained from the surrounding objects. The second part of the sentence then introduces a relationship between the color of an object and the difficulty of applying awakening to it. It states that the less colorful an object is, the harder it is to apply awakening, implying that more colorful objects are relatively easier subjects for awakening application. 2. Use of Awakening drains the colors from surrounding objects and the more colorful an object is, the less difficult it is to apply Awakening to it. The first part of this sentence (before the \\"and\\") essentially conveys the same idea as the first part of the previous sentence ‚Äì that using awakening results in drained colors from nearby objects. The second part of the sentence, however, presents the relationship between the color of an object and the difficulty of applying awakening to it slightly differently. By stating that more colorful objects are less difficult to apply awakening to, the emphasis is placed on the fact that colorful objects are easier to work with, in comparison to the first sentence, which focused on the increased difficulty of working with less colorful objects. To summarize, both sentences establish that using awakening drains colors from surrounding objects and that there is a relationship between an object's color and the ease or difficulty of applying awakening to it. However, the first sentence emphasizes the increased difficulty with less colorful objects, while the second sentence stresses the relative ease of working with more colorful objects.

The first records about growing roses on Bulgarian land go back many centuries. The Rose Valley developed in the area between the cities of Kazanlak and Karlovo in central Bulgaria. The roses seem to love the soil and weather there. The rose is the most important plant grown in Bulgaria, which could be called the country on the roses. The rose plantations in the Rose Valley are the largest in the world. Much of the population in the Rose Valley works in the rose industry. In Bulgaria, we produce rose oil, rose water and other products. Rose oil is used in high-quality perfumes produced in many countries. The main flower grown is the Kazanlak rose, which is famous around the world. The oil is prepared by distillation . Each flower is picked by hand, and you need 3,000 kilos to make one kilo of rose oil. That means about 30 flowers for just one tiny drop oil. So you can understand why it is so expensive and is called liquid gold. Each year on the first weekend in June, during the harvest, there is a Festival of Rose in Kazanlak with many performances. Judges choose the Queen of Roses as part of the summer festival. After this, she honors the most skillful picker of roses in the harvest. This festival is an old tradition and goes back more than a century. Today it also includes an International Folklore Festival and attracts many tourists.

When negotiations between him and the law fail, Marion Cobretti (codenamed \\"Cobra\\") (Sylvester Stallone), a member of an elite division of the Los Angeles Police Department known as the \\"Zombie Squad\\", is summoned to the scene. Cobretti infiltrates the store, locates, and negotiates with him. During the negotiation, the criminal speaks of the unknown \\"New Order\\", a group of social darwinist radicals that despise modern society and believe in killing the weak, leaving only the strongest and smartest to rule the world. Cobretti then kills the gunman by throwing a knife at his abdomen and firing shots at him. As the bodies are removed from the supermarket, Cobretti is admonished by Detective Monte (Andrew Robinson) for his seeming disregard for police procedures and protocols. Harassed by reporters, Cobretti admonishes them for failing to put the safety of potential victims first. Little does everyone realize at the time is that the supermarket hostage crisis is only one of a string of recent and seemingly unconnected acts of violence and murder that have broken loose in Los Angeles, perpetrated by the same supremacist group the supermarket gunman mentioned. After witnessing several individuals going on a spree killing, including the New Order leader, only identified as 'The Night Slasher' (Brian Thompson), model and businesswoman Ingrid Knudsen (Brigitte Nielsen) becomes the group's main target due to her being the only living witness to their crimes. After a failed attempt on her by the group, she is placed under the protective custody of Cobretti and his partner, Sergeant Tony Gonzales (Reni Santoni). Several more attempts are made on their lives by various people connected to the Order.

I would like to start this review by saying that I have been coming to Ken's Nails and Spa for a few years now for several different services and - in the past - have always had great service and results. I have always been greeted immediately and have never had to wait more than a couple minutes before I am taken back for services. It truly has been my go-to in the past and I am super sad that I am going to stop frequenting this business. I am not exactly sure what has changed but my last few visits have been anything but pleasant. First, a couple weeks ago I came in for my normal eyebrow wax. Usually I am in and out in a couple minutes with perfectly manicured brows. This time I left with my eyebrows on FIRE. I went to the Albertson's following my appointment and bought some cooling aloe gel for relief but nothing helped. The area ended up breaking out in blisters that last at least a week. I had several people ask me if I had suffered a burn. Yikes! it was not good and extremely painful. I let the bad eyebrow wax slide and thought maybe it was a fluke accident and went back last night for a mani-pedi. I feel bad because I am not sure the tech who was working on me really understood some of the things I was trying to communicate to her. At one point I asked her to file my nails slightly shorter and she said \\"ok\\" but then just moved on. That wasn't really the worst part though. During both the mani and pedi she repeatedly hurt me while removing my cuticles. I can be a wuss so I know sometimes it is just me being a baby but this was ridiculous. At one point I gasped and pulled my foot away and the nail tech next to her actually had to scold her and tell her to take it easy.

If you live in a walking city, like Chicago, it is one of the best strollers; it is excellent on the sidewalks, great for jogging, light weight, handling with one hand. The stroller comes with ALL the accessories, unlike most strollers. Our daughter enjoys the comfort of the Quinny Buzz; it is her little hybrid car.

I can‚Äôt f‚Äìkin‚Äô believe I‚Äôm gonna be f‚Äìkin‚Äô 80.‚Äú So says Larry King, who on a recent Thursday afternoon was sitting under the lights of Keith Olbermann‚Äôs ESPN studio in Times Square. ‚ÄúWhen I was a kid, no one was 80. People died when they were 67.‚Äù King doesn‚Äôt look 80‚Äîor 79, for that matter, since the pivotal birthday arrives on Nov. 19‚Äîso much as he looks like Larry King. For 30 years, Larry King has looked like Larry King: aquiline, suspendered (Turnbull and Asser, the same outfit that dresses the English royals), more head than torso. He‚Äôs got a mug on the desk, and iced coffee in that mug. Olbermann was out in Atlanta on assignment, hosting TBS‚Äôs studio coverage for the MLB playoffs, so ESPN executive editor John Walsh, an old pal, tapped King to fill in for three shows. Thursday, for his last show, his guests are Athletics manager Bob Melvin and Lions running back Reggie Bush, both appearing via satellite, and the co-hosts of ESPN‚Äôs First Take, Skip Bayless and Stephen A. Smith, both in studio. ‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to do it again. It‚Äôs been a hoot,‚Äù King says. When Olbermann hosts, the show airs live at 11 p.m. King‚Äôs version instead tapes piecemeal between 3 and 5 p.m. He first tapes the bumpers, the brief segments on either side of a commercial break, then the Melvin remote. After that, he pops on a brown Borsalino and gets to talking about gambling, for his opening monologue. ‚ÄúLast year I had a great run picking games on my Twitter account. I got 2,600,000 followers. I hit 80 percent ‚Äî with the points!‚Äù He tells some wild stories about the 1970s Dolphins, and a pal of his who lost 20 grand on an NFL bad beat. From quick glances at his teleprompter, I can tell that all the color in King‚Äôs monologue comes straight from his head. (‚ÄúI‚Äôm flying on a plane with Don Shula‚Ä¶‚Äù) Only the skeleton of the story is laid out before him. He finishes the bit with a flourish, tossing a newspaper behind him. (PHOTOS: Broadcast Giant Larry King) ‚ÄúCal: that work?‚Äù King‚Äôs asking one of the men in his retinue, Esquire‚Äôs Cal Fussman. Fussman wrote two books with King, and brought him the hat today. (An early present for King‚Äôs 80th.) Fussman points back with both hands. ‚ÄúLarry‚Äôs like John Coltrane. No broadcaster can improvise like he can.‚Äù Next comes the Reggie Bush interview. The satellite feed keeps freezing, sticking temporarily on a delayed image of Bush. (Because it‚Äôs a Thursday night, the busted video poses a special problem: NFL rules prohibit the use of game highlights while a game plays on another channel.) But King thinks it went well, he tells his producer. He was especially happy with the question he asked about being a running back‚Äî‚ÄùWhat‚Äôs it like, for you, when you see that opening? When you know, there it is?‚Äù ‚Äî even though it elicited a giggle from its subject. To King, it‚Äôs a signature question, something no one else would ever ask on television. ‚ÄúWe coulda done Bush longer,‚Äù King says. ‚ÄúWell, there was the visual problem,‚Äù his producer replies. ‚ÄúThere was one little glitch.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, there were a lot.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt notice a lot,‚Äù King replies. ‚ÄúI did. It‚Äôs not your fault. It‚Äôs our fault.‚Äù ‚ÄúWhy didn‚Äôt I see that here?‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know. You should have. It‚Äôs bad.‚Äù The producer departs. ‚ÄúGod, I said I thought it happened once.‚Äù King moves on. He‚Äôs got a bunch of typed notecards laid out before him for the Bayless and Smith interview, the last thing he‚Äôll tape for ESPN. The cards are his ‚Äúblanket.‚Äù He plans to freewheel otherwise. He and Smith are friendly; he knows Bayless‚Äôs newspaper work well; and he watches their show often. ‚ÄúI love it. They‚Äôre a married couple gone astray,‚Äù he says. Smith bounds in from makeup, and King greets him with all kinds of hype. ‚ÄúThere he is! The dapper Dan! The suave one! My man!‚Äù ‚ÄúLarry! How ya doin, buddy? Long time no speak.‚Äù ‚ÄúAre you still writing? I think Kornheiser writes once a week for the Post. Does Wilbon still write?‚Äù Soon they get to comparing watches. King‚Äôs is modest, with a leather band. Smith‚Äôs is gaudy as can be. King wants a closer look. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just a Bulova. That‚Äôs all it is, Larry.‚Äù ‚ÄúA Bulova? Come on. That‚Äôs a Rolex.‚Äù ‚ÄúNo, trust me, when I‚Äôm trying to tell you. I don‚Äôt make your money, man.‚Äù ‚ÄúBulova? Please. That thing is signaling ships.‚Äù But Bayless is taking a while with his makeup, running behind Smith, and King is getting impatient. ‚ÄúCan we get started, guys? I‚Äôve gotta run do an interview from here. I‚Äôm doing Brian Williams‚Äô daughter today.‚Äù King still does a half-hour interview show on Ora.TV, a venture he started with Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. ‚ÄúI‚Äôve never seen Girls. But I hear it‚Äôs good!‚Äù ‚ÄúWhere is Skip? Hey, Cal, do you see Skip? I got a time problem here. Is he comin‚Äô?‚Äù Smith: ‚ÄúMy sisters take a shorter time. Good lord.‚Äù Finally Bayless turns up. ‚ÄúBayless! Thanks for humbling us with your appearance.‚Äù They quickly get to taping. It‚Äôs a relaxed discussion, detached from the shtick that characterizes First Take. They explain their partnership, how Bayless stood up for Smith when ESPN had soured on him. In Larry King‚Äôs presence, they almost turn genuine. When Skip, Stephen A., and Larry have exhausted much of their time together, he wants to ask about something else. King: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt you miss newsprint, though? Real paper?‚Äù Smith: ‚ÄúOf course you miss it, but‚Ä¶ in two seconds, you can find out what‚Äôs going on 3,000 miles away. The newspaper, the print, they‚Äôre printing the night before. You‚Äôve got it on your doorstep, but you don‚Äôt have the up-to-date news that happened an hour ago or even five minutes ago.‚Äù King: ‚ÄúBut they‚Äôve got background.‚Äù Smith: ‚ÄúAnd you can use them for background. But you can go online and get background, too.‚Äù King, an early pioneer of national talk radio and cable television who makes his living broadcasting online these days and has nearly as many Twitter followers as Jamaica has islanders, isn‚Äôt ready to leave print behind. ‚ÄúI miss USA Today. Boy, I had such fun with that once a week. 20 years I did that column.‚Äù ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs sad, isn‚Äôt it?‚Äù he asks Bayless and Smith. The two scribes-turned-TV-pundits are not so elegiac. King wraps up the segment with a few questions for the pair about surprises in the NFL, and their World Series predictions. Then it‚Äôs over, and the three leave the stage. While Smith and Bayless chat with assembled guests, Larry King says his goodbyes and slips off. He‚Äôs in a hurry.

Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15‚Äì33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The eyes possess the sense of vision.

In the popular mind, the history of Hong Kong, long the entryway to China for Westerners, begins in 1841 with the British occupation of the territory. However, it would be wrong to dismiss the long history of the region itself. Archaeologists today are working to uncover Hong Kong's past, which stretches back thousands of years. You can get a glimpse into that past at Lei Cheng Uk Museum's 1,600-year-old burial vault on the mainland just north of Kowloon. In 1992, when construction of the airport on Chek Lap Kok was begun, a 2,000-year-old village, Pak Mong, was discovered, complete with artifacts that indicated a sophisticated rural society. An even older Stone Age site was discovered on Lamma Island in 1996. While Hong Kong remained a relative backwater in early days, nearby Guangzhou (Canton) was developing into a great trading city with connections in India and the Middle East. By a.d. 900, the Hong Kong islands had become a lair for pirates preying on the shipping in the Pearl River Delta and causing a major headache for burgeoning Guangzhou; small bands of pirates were still operating into the early years of the 20th century. In the meantime, the mainland area was being settled by incomers, the \\"Five Great Clans\\": Tang, Hau, Pang, Liu, and Man. First to arrive was the Tang clan, which established a number of walled villages in the New Territories that still exist today. You can visit Kat Hing Wai and Lo Wai, villages with their walls still intact. Adjacent to Lo Wai is the Tang Chung Ling Ancestral Hall, built in the 16th century, which is still the center of clan activities. The first Europeans to arrive in the Pearl River Delta were the Portuguese, who settled in Macau in 1557 and for several centuries had a monopoly on trade between Asia, Europe, and South America. As Macau developed into the greatest port in the East, it also became a base for Jesuit missionaries; it was later a haven for persecuted Japanese Christians. While Christianity was not a great success in China, it made local headway, evidenced today by the numerous Catholic churches in Macau's historic center. Intermarriage with the local Chinese created a community of Macanese, whose culture can still be seen in Macau's architecture and cuisine.

Ahmed Merabet is reportedly a Muslim whose parents came from North Africa. The Charlie Hebdo attackers shot him in the head as he lay wounded in the street. Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Tragic Loss of Ahmed Merabet: A Heroic Muslim Policeman during the Charlie Hebdo Attack On January 7, 2015, the world was shaken as two masked gunmen targeted the offices of the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, France. In a horrific act of violence, the attackers killed a total of twelve people and injured eleven others. Among the victims was Ahmed Merabet, a 42-year-old Muslim police officer who has since become a symbol of bravery, tolerance, and unity in the face of terror. His tragic death exemplifies the complexity of religion and identity within acts of terrorism, as well as the broader issues of belonging and loyalty. Ahmed Merabet was a dedicated police officer, serving at the 11th arrondissement police station for eight years. He proudly wore his uniform, applying his knowledge and skills to safeguard the citizens of Paris. To his friends and family, Merabet embodied a loving, open-minded individual who sought to bridge the gap between different communities. Born in Livry-Gargan in the northeastern suburbs of Paris, Merabet's parents hailed from North Africa, symbolizing the rich tapestry of cultures woven together in France. As a practicing Muslim, he reconciled his religious beliefs with his commitment to law enforcement, dispelling the stereotype often perpetuated that Islam is incompatible with Western values. To many, Merabet served as a poignant reminder that terrorism does not define an entire faith, community, or ethnicity. The gruesome video of Merabet's death circulated online, further fueling shock and outrage as the attackers callously executed him while he lay wounded on the pavement. The cold-blooded and heartless nature of his killing stands as a stark reminder of the brutality and savagery shown during the Charlie Hebdo attack. Despite the senseless violence employed by those claiming to act in the name of their religion, Merabet's memory lives on as a testament to the core values of unity, brotherhood, and humanity that are at the heart of Islam. It is crucial to not let the actions of extremists dictate the narrative or overshadow the strength and resilience demonstrated by individuals like Merabet. Unity was explicitly displayed when, in the aftermath of the attack and Merabet's death, the hashtag #JeSuisAhmed (‚ÄúI Am Ahmed‚Äù) trended on social media, alongside #JeSuisCharlie (‚ÄúI Am Charlie‚Äù). The global population‚Äîincluding fellow Muslims‚Äîstood in solidarity with the families and communities of the victims, collectively denouncing extremism and violence under the banner of a shared humanity. Ahmed Merabet's sacrifice carries a powerful message‚Äîthat we must guard against allowing the actions of a few to vilify or isolate entire communities. His life serves as a reminder that within every faith and culture, there are those who strive for a world based on tolerance, understanding, and love. As we look to honor Merabet's memory, let us recognize the importance of fostering cross-cultural dialogue and inclusivity, shunning any attempts to sow division or animosity. Ahmed Merabet's legacy is an eternal symbol of humanity's shared values, transcending the barriers of religion, ethnicity, and nationality. His spirit of harmony serves as both a challenge and a call to action, urging us to confront hate and intolerance with acts of kindness, compassion, and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Young undocumented immigrants seeking permanent status in the United States received an unexpected boost Thursday on Capitol Hill as a small group of House Republicans mounted a last-minute effort to bring up an immigration vote in Congress. The group of eight Republicans ‚Äî some freed from political considerations by upcoming retirements and others facing tough re-elections races ‚Äî defied their own party leadership, quickly persuading 10 more Republicans to sign on to a petition that would force debate on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program. With all 193 Democrats expected to sign on, Republicans will have to persuade just seven more members of their own party to join the petition to trigger a vote on several immigration bills on the House floor. But Republican leadership said the effort would be wasted if the end result is a presidential veto. \\"I think it's important for us to come up with a solution that the president can support,\\" House Speaker Paul Ryan told reporters Thursday. These types of petitions are rare and seen as a threat to leadership's ability to direct legislative action. \\"It's better to use the legislative process,\\" Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters Wednesday. But that argument appears to be losing sway with House members who see an opportunity for legislative action in a mid-term election year. The growing group of House Republicans are joining Democratic colleagues who have long criticized Ryan for not bringing immigration bills up for a vote. \\"This is about making sure we're not consolidating power in the White House,\\" said Representative Mia Love, a Republican from Utah and one of the first lawmakers to sign petition. The immigration issue had all but died after an effort to pass a DACA fix collapsed in the U.S. Senate earlier this year.

(Associated Press) On social media and the online Marathon Swimmers Forum, long-distance swimmers have been debating whether Nyad got a boost from the boat that was accompanying her _ either by getting in it or holding onto it _ during a particularly speedy stretch of her swim. They also question whether she violated the traditions of her sport _ many follow strict guidelines known as the English Channel rules _ by using a specialized mask and body suit to protect herself from jellyfish. \\"When you know how hard it is, you kind of want those details,\\" said Andrew Malinak, a Seattle long-distance swimmer who crunched the data available from the GPS positions tracked on Nyad's website and concluded that he didn't trust what he saw. Nyad's navigator and one of the swim's official observers told The Associated Press this weekend that Nyad didn't cheat and that she was aided during the rapid part of her swim by a swift current. And neither Nyad nor her team ever said she would follow English Channel rules, developed for swimming the waters between England and France. Those rules outlaw neoprene wetsuits and contact with a support boat. Nyad wore a full non-neoprene bodysuit, gloves, booties and a silicone mask at night, when jellyfish are a particular problem, and removed the suit once she got over the reef on her approach to Key West. According to Nyad's team, she finished the swim Monday afternoon after roughly 53 hours in the water, becoming the first to do so without a shark cage. It was her fifth try, an endeavor apparently free from the boat troubles, bad weather, illnesses and jellyfish encounters that have bedeviled Nyad and other swimmers in recent years. Nyad's progress was tracked online via GPS by her team, and some critics say they think information is missing. Many wonder about a roughly seven-hour stretch when Nyad apparently didn't stop to eat or drink, recalling her 2012 attempt when she got onto the boat for hours during rough weather. Nyad eventually got back into the water to try finishing, but her team was criticized for delaying the release of that information to the public. Malinak said the hours-long spike in Nyad's speed after 27 hours of swimming is particularly questionable _ she went from her normal pace of roughly 1.5 mph to more than 3 mph, then slowed down again as she approached Key West. Nyad's spokeswomen did not immediately return telephone calls this weekend, but her navigator and Janet Hinkle, one of the official observers for the swim, told the AP that Nyad didn't cheat. Navigator John Bartlett said the increased speed was due to the fast-moving Gulf Stream working in her favor, nothing more. \\"At some points we were doing almost 4 miles an hour,\\" Bartlett said. \\"That's just the way it works. If the current is in your favor at all, that explains it.\\" The data collected by Bartlett and two observers will be submitted to three open-water swimming associations and the Guinness World Records for verification, Bartlett said. An oceanographer not affiliated with Nyad's team said the swimmer couldn't have picked a more perfect current to get from Havana to Key West. Mitch Roffer of Melbourne-based Roffer's Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service Inc. said he got an email questioning whether Nyad's swim was a hoax, so he decided to look at the charts for himself. What he saw convinced him that she could do it. \\"Many times that current runs west-east and you're constantly fighting the current if you're swimming north. In this case, it was in the shape of an S, and the angle was almost exactly from Havana to Key West,\\" Roffer said. Janet Hinkle, a Key West boat captain and acquaintance of Nyad's, was called to be an observer for the swim when Steve Munatones, a former U.S. national open-water coach, was unable to make it. \\"I can say unequivocally she swam every stroke without question,\\" Hinkle said. Critics have said Hinkle was too close to Nyad to be an independent observer of her swim. Hinkle has in the past helped Nyad by providing housing for her when the swimmer stayed in the Florida Keys, but she said she remained on the periphery of Nyad's team. \\"I think anyone who knows me knows me as a person of high integrity. I believe that's why Diana asked me, and I took my job very seriously,\\" Hinkle said. \\"She was giving her all and I would give her my best.\\" Since none of the various open-water swimming associations dictate how someone should swim from Cuba to Florida _ officially accomplished only by Nyad and Susie Maroney, who used a shark cage _ Nyad just had to follow generally accepted rules about not getting out of the water or using equipment such as fins. Australian Chloe McCardel followed English Channel rules in her attempt to swim the Florida Straits in June. She had to be pulled from the water after 11 hours after being stung jellyfish. \\"Generally the rules are: You walk in, you swim across and you walk out, and you do it under your own power,\\" said Munatones, who consulted with Nyad for this swim and observed her attempts in 2011 and 2012. The elaborate, full-body suit and protective mask Nyad wore to protect herself from venomous jellyfish actually weighed her down, Munatones said. \\"To put that on is like putting on a wedding gown in the ocean,\\" he said. \\"It's different from the English Channel rules, but the water is different from the English Channel.\\" To many, it seems Nyad hasn't exactly endeared herself to those in the marathon swimming community. Some consider her primarily concerned with gaining the spotlight instead of helping others advance the sport. At her post-swim news conference on Tuesday, Nyad admitted that she had not been rooting for McCardel and that she was miffed some members of her team would jump ship to work for a competitor. McCardel said she was disappointed to hear Nyad call those crew members \\"traitors.\\" \\"One of the greatest things, I believe, about international marathon swimming is how people across the world support crew for and mentor each other. I wouldn't change this aspect of our sport for the world!\\" McCardel posted on her Facebook page. ___ Follow Jennifer Kay on Twitter at http://www.twitter.com/jnkay. ||||| ‚ÄúThey want to know how the facts came down so they can understand it. They have every right to ask all these questions, and we have every intention to honor the accurate information.‚Äù Advertisement Continue reading the main story Her swim was not documented by independent news media, as were her previous attempts. Nyad acknowledged that the news media had wearied of the story because she had failed so often. Nor did members of Nyad‚Äôs crew take continuous video of the swim, a strange decision to some marathoners. ‚ÄúIf I was doing a swim that had never been done before and everyone thought impossible, I‚Äôd have a video camera on me continuously,‚Äù said Evan Morrison, the San Francisco founder of Marathonswimmers.org, an online community of more than 700 athletes. But Steven Munatones, a former marathon swimmer and swimming official who has served on Nyad‚Äôs earlier crews, said he had no doubts. ‚ÄúI am 100 percent satisfied based on the GPS data, marine information, written information and personal interviews that she did the swim,‚Äù said Munatones, of Huntington Beach, Calif. Munatones said he intended to review all the data from Nyad‚Äôs crew with a panel of other swimming experts, including the president of the Catalina Channel Swimming Federation, so they could answer all the questions being raised. The federation president, Forrest Nelson, said he had agreed. Munatones‚Äôs involvement has added to the pique voiced by some marathon swimmers ‚Äî a notoriously independent lot who cross waterways of 10 miles or more. Several have asked how Munatones and Nyad‚Äôs official observers could be impartial, because they all knew Nyad before the swim and Munatones had served on her previous crews. (Munatones says he considers observers part of any swimmer‚Äôs crew, a contention that many would fault.) Marathoner online forums have buzzed with speculation as to whether Nyad got a power boost by climbing aboard her boat. (She says no.) They have posited that by helping her don a protective silicone mask for jellyfish and a special suit to ward off stings, her crew helped her in ways that other channel associations would prohibit. (Nyad says the crew never buoyed her, and thus the swim was ‚Äúunassisted.‚Äù) The biggest source of grousing pertains to Nyad‚Äôs speed and distance covered and the amount of push she got from the currents. Her previous attempts were undone by bad weather and uncooperative currents, which tend to sweep eastward toward the Bahamas. Nyad is a plodder; she says she averages less than 2 miles per hour. She swam at 1.7 m.p.h. when she left Cuba on Aug. 31 and again when she neared Key West. Advertisement Continue reading the main story One marathon swimmer, Andrew Malinak of Seattle, used Firebug, a Web development tool that inspects code, to glean Nyad‚Äôs GPS data from the swimmer‚Äôs official Web site. He surmised that Nyad was traveling at an increasingly speedy clip on the swim‚Äôs second day ‚Äî from 2 m.p.h. to more than 6 m.p.h. around 31 hours into the swim. After her crew made the data available with time stamps, Malinak revised his work and said that Nyad‚Äôs top speed was nearly 4.5 m.p.h. for a stretch. The pace was inconsistent, he said, with surges and then valleys, plunging her times to 2 m.p.h. ‚ÄúThe rapid increase and two subsequent rapid decreases in her speed, combined with the already fast pace, still leave me skeptical of her swim‚Äôs authenticity,‚Äù said Malinak, a geotechnical engineer in Seattle, who has swum around Manhattan. Photo Fellow swimmers have asked if it is possible that Nyad was on a boat when those surges happened. Nyad and some on board her flotilla said no. Her navigator, John Bartlett, a custom boat builder in the Florida Keys, says the fast water flows were predicted by a Connecticut physical oceanographer. Some of the fastest currents unfolded around noon on the swim‚Äôs second day, moving at 3.8 knots, close to 4 m.p.h. ‚ÄúThey‚Äôre always that fast in the axis, the center of the flow,‚Äù said Bartlett, who crewed for Nyad on earlier attempts. ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt record our speed per se at given moments,‚Äù Bartlett said about his written logs. ‚ÄúI was doing an average speed ‚Äî calculated from the beginning.‚Äù Bartlett said that currents varied, and that the team had worked Nyad sideways and northward through the currents, a technique called crabbing. ‚ÄúEveryone is saying, Wow, she was going fast; how is that possible?‚Äù Bartlett said. ‚ÄúThe currents were going fast.‚Äù The currents eased up to 1.4 knots on Day 3, but the direction was more northern, and thus more helpful to Nyad. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs how the speed increased,‚Äù Bartlett said. ‚ÄúThe direction of the current was better.‚Äù Advertisement Continue reading the main story Nyad said: ‚ÄúWe were definitely traveling north at a faster speed than what I can do on my own. I just got lucky.‚Äù Besides getting fair weather, with just a short squall to slow her, Nyad also benefited from great currents, which she hit at the ideal time, said Mitchell Roffer, a biological oceanographer and owner of Roffer‚Äôs Ocean Fishing Forecasting Service in West Melbourne, Fla. Roffer, who independently checked the currents after the swim when the criticisms mounted, said Nyad was swept along by a moving gyre, a large counterclockwise rotating current that moves from the Gulf of Mexico into the Keys, taking Nyad on a fast ride. It forms less than once a month, he said. ‚ÄúShe hit it at the ideal time,‚Äù Roffer said. ‚ÄúRather than angle and have to fight it, in this case she actually rode with the current.‚Äù Bartlett, her navigator, cautioned the people crunching numbers. GPS data culled by Malinak from what was recorded by spot trackers set on the deck of the escort boat is far less reliable than the information from the professional GPS units Bartlett used. The spot trackers are ‚Äúdesigned to be a convenience so the public can watch the progress, but they‚Äôre not infallible and not precise,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúIf there‚Äôs a discrepancy between what I have on paper and the spot trackers, you can just disregard the spot trackers.‚Äù Critics say the observers ‚Äî typically people who have never met the athlete ‚Äî are unknown in the swimming community, odd for such a high-profile event. Munatones was supposed to observe the swim. On earlier outings with Nyad, Munatones said he ‚Äúdid everything including getting sponsors, organizing the crew, blogging, and jumping in the water and helping feed her.‚Äù But when the team decided that the conditions were perfect, Munatones was on a plane to Tokyo. Nyad said she had to scramble to find two substitutes, both Key West locals who did not have a history of swimming or observing record crossings. One, Janet Hinkle, a licensed Key West boat captain, said she got the call at the last minute. She said she had met Nyad in 2011, providing her with a home to live in before a swim. Hinkle had never observed any swim, but she said she got tips from Munatones and said she was unbiased. ‚ÄúI believe she asked me because I would be an objective observer,‚Äù Hinkle said. She said she never observed Nyad getting on board the boat during the swim or being pulled by a craft. Nyad‚Äôs fans have called the critics ‚Äúhaters‚Äù who are jealous. Nyad has long been a lightning rod among swimmers who object to the publicity she seeks and the tactics she employs ‚Äî like letting her crew remove her stinger suit and apply lotions.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose less acid rain lands happens, how will it affect MORE waste being removed from the body. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? The answer is:","completion":"Step 1: Understand the question and identify the process and perturbation hypothesis. - Process: The process in question is the way our kidneys filter waste and fluid. - Perturbation Hypothesis: The hypothesis states that if less acid rain occurs, there will be an effect on more waste being removed from the body. Step 2: Analyze the process and its components. - Fluid and waste enter the kidneys. - A processing moment in the kidneys allows waste and fluid to pass. - The kidneys prevent larger molecules from passing. - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream. - Bad waste is removed. - The final product is turned into urine. Step 3: Determine whether the perturbation hypothesis is related to the process. In this case, the perturbation hypothesis (less acid rain) does not seem to have a direct connection to the kidney's waste removal process. Acid rain is an environmental phenomenon resulting from air pollution, and its effects are generally more related to ecological systems and structures. Step 4: Evaluate the potential indirect effects of the perturbation hypothesis on the process. Although acid rain is not directly related to the waste removal process in the kidneys, there could be indirect effects. For example, if acid rain affects the quality of drinking water or food sources, it might have consequences for human health, leading to changes in the waste produced by the body. However, this is a speculative connection and would require further research to establish a definitive link. The answer is: The supposed perturbation of less acid rain does not have a direct effect on the process of waste removal in the kidneys. However, there could be indirect effects related to the quality of water and food sources, but these connections are speculative and would require further investigation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If the lettuce is marked ‚Äúready-to-eat,‚Äù the FDA has certified that it is clean and can be eaten as it is, but some experts recommend washing it again when you get home. Remove the outer layers of leaves, until you get to a layer where you can't see any visible dirt or wilted edges. Grasp the entire head of lettuce and run it under running water. Gently scrub the exterior of the lettuce with your fingers to remove any traces of dirt or pesticides. Do not soak your lettuce in a sink filled with water ‚Äì this will not remove the dirt. The stalk of the lettuce tends to be tough and can have a bitter taste. Remove the pale, hard tip of the head and discard it. Also discard any of the outer leaves that appear wilted or discolored. Put the lettuce on a clean chopping board and use a sharp kitchen knife to cut the head in half, through the root (or stalk). A classic chef's knife with an 8 to 10 inch (20 ‚Äì 25 cm) blade is recommended for chopping lettuce and most other vegetables. Set each half of the lettuce, cut side down, on the cutting board. Slice each half in half, through the root (stalk). Place the lettuce quarter-section on the cutting board with the outer leaves against the board and the cut edges facing up. Position the knife at the far, right edge of the lettuce and begin cutting with a back and forth sawing motion until you reach the cutting board. Move over approximately 1/4-inch and begin sawing again. The last piece of the head segment may be too small to slice safely. Reposition the small piece on the cutting board so that it lays flat, and finish slicing. Move onto the other half of the lettuce if a lot of shredded lettuce is desired. Slice only what you will need for your meal, and return the remaining uncut portions of lettuce to the refrigerator. Shredded lettuce will brown and wilt more quickly than lettuce that is left intact.

Just after 6 p.m. Friday, a pipeline failure was reported around Monmouth Road near the Riverview Bar in Decatur. The pipeline company, Buckeye Pipe Line Company, confirmed Saturday that the leaked resulted in a spill of around 195 barrels (8,190 gallons) of jet fuel into the St. Marys River. A safety warning was issued Friday night from the Decatur Police Department, and residents in Decatur were warned to avoid the area and avoid smoking or using open flames near the river. The pipeline was shut down immediately, and crews from Buckeye's Emergency Response Team were continuing to clean up the area and remediate any environmental impact. On Wednesday, crews were still on the scene working to clear fuel from the river. Officials are booming the river at W 900 N in Adams County to stop the spread of the leak, and also at the Allen County line. Private contractors were also called in to assist. The company said it was working with public safety officials as well as state and federal authorities to address the situation quickly and safely. Adams County EMA Director John August said the Environmental Protection Agency came from Indianapolis to check the air quality. August said residents could smell something but there won't be any danger. Drinking water was not contaminated in Decatur because this won't affect well water, only river water, he added.

Now, we have 140 apples (or in this case, 140*r) as a result. So, our new equation looks like this: 1540 = 140*r. Now, to find what \\"r\\" is, we need to divide both sides of the equation by 140. So, we need to find out how many times 140 can fit into 1540. Let's do some division: 1540 √∑ 140 = 11. So now we know that \\"r\\" is 11! Final answer: r = 11."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is the premise \\"Girl wearing black headscarf walks in desert.\\" true if \\"The girl is walking outside.\\"?","completion":"Well, little buddy, let's break it down. The first part says \\"Girl wearing black headscarf walks in desert.\\" That means the girl has a black headscarf on her head, and she's walking in a place with lots of sand called a desert. Now, the second part says \\"The girl is walking outside.\\" That means she's not inside a building, but outside in the fresh air. To know if the first part is true, you need to check two things: (1) is the girl wearing a black headscarf? and (2) is she walking in the desert? If both of these things are happening, then the first part is true. But if only one or none of them are happening, then the first part isn't true. The second part only tells us that the girl is walking outside, but it doesn't say anything about the black headscarf or the desert. So, we can't say for sure that the first part is true, just because we know she is walking outside."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

After spending half the book about nothing - just descriptive and empty introduction, nothing hands on - exactly the type the beginner has no use for, the author writes examples that cannot be used. If you want to learn practical way (usable and meaningfull examples with hands on approach, what a beginner needs) this is not a book for you. It is certainly not for an expert either. Shortly - worthless. Add here bug full source from web site and you really have a headache. Learning curve - none, you won't learn anything, is that easy. Answer:","completion":"The customer appears to be very dissatisfied with the purchase, based on the content of the review given. From the review, we can derive several reasons why it's evident that the customer is displeased. First, the reviewer uses terms like \\"worthless\\" to describe the book, which clearly suggests strong dissatisfaction. Second, the reviewer points out that half of the book's content is described as \\"empty introduction\\" which the reviewer felt served no useful purpose, particularly for a beginner. This expresses dissatisfaction towards the organization and content of the book, and disappointment due to the failure to meet the expected utility. Further, the reviewer deems the examples provided by the author as unusable, denoting that the book did not provide the practical, hands-on learning experience they were hoping for. This demonstrates dissatisfaction with the book's ability to fulfill its educational purpose. Also, the reviewer indicates that the book is not suitable for experts either, implying that the content doesn't appear advanced or challenging enough for those with a high level of knowledge in the field. Lastly, the reviewer also mentions about the presence of bug full source from the book's associated website, causing additional inconvenience while trying to use supplements provided for the book. The reviewer ends by saying the learning curve is nonexistent since \\"you won't learn anything\\". All these points strongly reflect a level of dissatisfaction with the book. In conclusion, based on the customer's review, it's clear that they are highly dissatisfied with the product, feeling that both its content and support materials failed to meet expectations on numerous fronts."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A friend asked me to answer this question: What is the full name of the person who has devised and elaborate scheme against Lufton with Pindalest?, using the article: Cowboy drifter Jim Garry is summoned by his friend, smooth-talking Tate Riling. Garry rides into an Indian reservation and finds himself in the middle of a conflict between a cattle owner and some homesteaders. He meets cattle owner John Lufton, and eventually his daughters Amy and Carol. The Luftons suspect that Garry is on Riling's side and are initially hostile, especially Amy. Garry readily admits that he is going to work for his friend. Riling tells Garry that he and Indian agent Jake Pindalest have devised an elaborate scheme to force Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. Pindalest has gotten the government to order Lufton to remove his cattle from the reservation in a week. Meanwhile, Riling has organized the homesteaders into blocking the move, conning them into believing that he is working in their best interests. With no other option, Lufton would have to sell his herd at bargain prices or lose everything. Lufton would never sell to Riling, but he would to a stranger like Garry. Pindalest would then see that the government buys the herd at an inflated price. Garry would get 10,000 for his part in the swindle. Lufton manages to outsmart Riling and move his herd unimpeded, but Riling and his men stampede and scatter the cattle back onto the reservation. It would take several days to gather the herd, more time than Lufton has before the deadline. Garry becomes disgusted when a man is killed in the stampede, and he switches sides. Amy still does not trust him. She suspects Garry of betraying the contents of a letter to Riling, unaware that Carol is enamored with Riling and is the one passing information to him. Eventually, Amy comes to trust (and fall in love with) Garry, especially after he defends her father from two of Riling's men., what would be the answer ? The answer to this question is:","completion":"The full name of the person who has devised an elaborate scheme against John Lufton with Jake Pindalest is Tate Riling. In the article, it describes how Tate Riling, a smooth-talking individual and friend of Jim Garry, works with Indian agent Jake Pindalest to force cattle owner John Lufton into selling his herd cheaply. They plan to achieve this through a combination of manipulating government orders via Pindalest and organizing the homesteaders to block the cattle's movement under the guise of working in their best interests. Ultimately, they hope to purchase Lufton's herd at a bargain price, sell it to the government at an inflated rate, and make a significant profit, with Garry receiving 10,000 for his part in the swindle. However, Garry switches sides when he becomes disgusted with the scheme's consequences, leading to various conflicts and resolutions involving the characters involved in this complex plot."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer a question about this article. If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\". Where is Bir Tawil located?","completion":"Bir Tawil is located between Egypt and Sudan in Northeast Africa. It is a small, uninhabited piece of land that covers an area of approximately 800 square miles, or 2,060 square kilometers. Despite its position on African soil, it is a peculiar case of a territory that is unclaimed by any state. This unique situation is due to a historical dispute over the border delineation between Egypt and Sudan. Known for its arid desert landscape, Bir Tawil is of little strategic or economic value, even to its neighboring countries, and so it has remained as a terra nullius, unclaimed by any recognized sovereign nation. Bir Tawil's specific location falls just south of the 22nd parallel north, making it geographically distinct from both Egypt's and Sudan's mutually claimed territory of Hala'ib, which lies to the northeast. An interesting fact about this unclaimed territory is that even though neither Egypt nor Sudan exercises any authority or administration over this land, several individuals from various parts of the world have declared their own claims to 'kingship' or 'ownership' of Bir Tawil, mainly for symbolic or artistic reasons, but these assertions, however, are not recognized by the international community. Even though Bir Tawil isn't permanently inhabited or developed due to its harsh desert conditions, it serves as a unique example of disputed taxonomy and political geography in our modern world. Despite being sandwiched between two nations, it remains unrecognized and unclaimed, becoming an exception in terms of global political boundaries."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Write an article based on this summary: Luka Modric scored a stunning late goal to give Real Madrid a 2-1 win at struggling Granada and keep their fading La Liga title hopes alive. Article:","completion":"Title: Luka Modric's Spectacular Late Goal Earns Real Madrid Crucial 2-1 Victory over Struggling Granada, Sustaining La Liga Title Ambitions In an intense and gripping fixture, Luka Modric emerged as the hero for Real Madrid as he scored a sensational late goal to secure a hard-fought 2-1 victory for Los Blancos against Granada at the Nuevo Estadio de Los C√°rmenes. The win ensured that the team's La Liga title hopes, albeit slim, were kept alive as they continue to chase the leaders in the Spanish top-flight. The match began with Real Madrid, knowing full well the importance of this encounter to their title aspirations, starting strong and dominating the initial proceedings. However, Granada, currently battling at the lower end of the La Liga table, displayed great resilience and were determined not to give up without a fight. The home side remained steadfast in their defensive duties, frustrating Real's attackers while launching their own counter-attacks with intent. The breakthrough finally arrived in the 56th minute when the ever-reliable Karim Benzema, Real Madrid's talismanic forward, found the back of the net after a well-placed pass from the impressive Federico Valverde. It seemed at this point that the visitors would take control of the match, but Granada had other plans. Against the run of play, a combination of defensive errors and a tenacious effort from the home side saw Granada striker Jorge Molina pounce on the opportunity to level the score in the 71st minute, setting up a nervy final 20 minutes for both teams. Real Madrid coach Zinedine Zidane, sensing the urgency of the situation, brought on crucial reinforcements in the form of Vinicius Junior, Rodrygo, and Isco, in an attempt to unlock Granada's stubborn defense. However, it was left to Luka Modric, the 2018 Ballon d'Or winner, to deliver the decisive blow. In the 85th minute, he collected a loose ball outside the box and unleashed a powerful, curling shot that left Granada goalkeeper Rui Silva with no chance as it sailed into the top corner. The visiting Real Madrid contingent erupted in joy, fully aware of the importance of Modric's stunning strike. As the full-time whistle blew, Real Madrid walked away with a vital 2-1 victory which kept their fading La Liga title hopes alive. While the odds might still be against them, this result sends a clear message that Los Blancos are not giving up their pursuit of another league trophy without a spirited fight. Meanwhile, Granada will take heart from their spirited and dogged display, knowing that replicating such performances in their remaining matches could well see them avoid the treacherous drop to the second division. In conclusion, the match between Granada and Real Madrid was a thrilling contest that showcased the tenacity, determination, and quality of both teams. Luka Modric's late goal was the highlight of the evening and an apt reflection of Real Madrid's unwavering commitment to their La Liga title ambitions. As the season reaches its climax, the fascinating battle at both ends of the table continues to offer nail-biting finishes and memorable moments."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Review: No Strings Attached is one of Carlos Mencia's best performances to date. Mencia is known for poking and making fun of racial issues. However, he does more than that in this stand-up performance, which took place in San Francisco. In general, Mencia's material does not only make you laugh but it also makes you think about what is really wrong with society today. In this hour long performance, Mencia talks about such things as illegal immigration, what women really mean when they ask for equality in the workplace, terrorism, his opinion of Mel Gibson's Passion of the Christ and an argument that he got into with a woman regarding whether or not he is affected by Jesus, and how society should treat those that are physically or mentally handicapped. Mencia even discusses whether or one should have the right to speak out and tell a joke. Carlos Mencia is not afraid to offend, which at many times gets him trouble with his critics. For example, he does go somewhat far (and he admits it) with a joke regarding Pope John Paul II and what he is most likely doing in heaven right now. Mencia's main message in all of his performances is that we all have have a voice and that we should use that voice to speak what we feel and not be afraid to offend. He reminds us that we have a right to free speech and that we must use this right as Americans. If you enjoy this performance, I definitely recommend watching Mind of Mencia, his show on Comedy Central. Now, what is this review like?

SEOUL ‚Äî North Korea‚Äôs recent threat to pull out of the upcoming nuclear summit with the U.S. has added new urgency to South Korean President Moon Jae-in‚Äôs visit to Washington next Tuesday. President Moon has played a key role in facilitating the meeting between North Korean leader Kim Jong Un and U.S. President Donald Trump scheduled to be held in Singapore June 12. At the recent inter-Korean summit Moon got Kim to affirm a broad commitment to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and that opened the door for Trump and Kim to negotiate a more detailed agreement to end North Korea‚Äôs nuclear program. However, uncompromising positions recently voiced by U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton demanding the North‚Äôs unilateral disarmament, and by North Korea in response canceling further talks with the South and threatening to pull out of the U.S.-North Korea summit, have put the prospects for continued diplomatic progress in jeopardy. President Trump has tried to reassure the North Korean leadership that a nuclear deal would not weaken the Kim government, but would bolster it. ‚ÄúHe'd be in his country, he'd be running his country. His country would be very rich.‚Äù Trump said Thursday while meeting with NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg in the White House. President Moon, who will meet with Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has said he will try to moderate differences between the U.S. and North Korea over how to achieve denuclearization, while also giving the Kim government the security guarantees and sanctions relief it wants. But the convergence of interests that have brought Moon, Trump and Kim to all agree to give diplomacy a chance seems to be diverging over how to bridge the gap between the U.S. demand for complete denuclearization prior to offering any concessions, and the North‚Äôs insistence on a step by step process that would ease sanctions early on for incremental measures, such as giving up some nuclear material and allowing in outside inspectors.

About half of the piece is destroyed, but the remaining part hits the South Atlantic at 200 times the speed of sound. The sea boils and a huge hole is made in the seabed. Huge waves are created and spread outwards form the hole. The wall of water, a kilometer high, rushes towards southern Africa at 800 kilometers an hour. Cities on the African coast are totally destroyed and millions of people are drowned . Before the waves reach South America, the second piece of the comet lands in Argentina. Earthquakes and volcanoes ash set off in the Andes Mountains. The shock waves move north into California and all around the Pacific Ocean. The cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco and Tokyo are completely destroyed by earthquakes. Millions of people in the southern half of the earth are already dead, but the north won't escape for long. Because of the explosions, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, temperatures around the world fall to almost zero. Crops are ruined. The sun won't be seen again for many years. Wars break out as countries fight for food. A year later, no more than 10 million people remain alive. Could it really happen? In fact, it has already happened more than once in the history of the earth. The dinosaurs were on the Earth for over 160 million years. Then 65 million years ago they suddenly disappeared. Many scientists believe that the Earth was hit by a piece of object in space. The dinosaurs couldn't live through the cold climate that followed and they died out. Will we meet the same end? Question: Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long? Options: A: Because the land is covered with water. B: Because the light and heat form the sun cannot reach the earth. C: Because people there cannot live at the temperature of zero. D: Because wars break out among countries. A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"Why can't the northern half of the earth escape for long?\\" is B: Because the light and heat from the sun cannot reach the earth. In the article, it is mentioned that after the comet impact, the sun is hidden by clouds of dust, causing temperatures around the world to fall to almost zero. This implies that the sun's light and heat cannot reach the Earth, which affects global temperatures and crop growth. As a result, the adverse effects of the comet's impact, including the extreme cold and lack of food, will eventually affect the northern half of the Earth as well.

News article: Fossil by fossil, scientists over the last 40 years have suspected that their models for the more immediate human family tree ‚Äî the single trunk, straight as a Ponderosa pine, up from Homo habilis to Homo erectus to Homo sapiens ‚Äî were oversimplified. The day for that serious revision may be at hand. The discovery of three new fossil specimens, announced Wednesday, is the most compelling evidence yet for multiple lines of evolution in our own genus, Homo, scientists said. The fossils showed that there were at least two contemporary Homo species, in addition to Homo erectus, living in East Africa as early as two million years ago. Uncovered from sandstone at Koobi Fora, badlands near Lake Turkana in Kenya, the specimens included a well-preserved skull of a late juvenile with a relatively large braincase and a long, flat face, which has been designated KNM-ER 62000 (62000 for short). It bears a striking resemblance to the enigmatic cranium known as 1470, the center of debate over multiple lineages since its discovery in the same area in 1972. If the 62000 skull showed that 1470 was not a single odd individual, the other two specimens seemed to provide a vital piece of evidence that had been missing. The specimen 1470 had no mandible, or lower jaw. The new finds included an almost complete lower jaw (60000) ‚Äî considered to be the most complete mandible of an early Homo yet found ‚Äî and a part of another lower jaw (62000). The fossils were collected between 2007 and 2009 by a team led by Meave and Louise Leakey, the mother-and-daughter paleoanthropologists of the Koobi Fora Research Project and members of the famous African fossil-hunting family. Dr. Meave Leakey is the wife of Richard Leakey, a son of Louis and Mary Leakey, who produced the early evidence supporting Africa‚Äôs central place in early human origins. Mr. Leakey divides his time between Stony Brook University on Long Island, where he is a professor of anthropology, and the Turkana Basin Institute in Kenya. After looking ‚Äúlong and hard‚Äù for fossils to confirm the intriguing features of 1470‚Äôs face and show what its teeth and lower jaw were like, Dr. Meave Leakey said this week, ‚ÄúAt last we have some answers.‚Äù The real crux of matter, said Susan C. Ant√≥n of New York University, a member of the team, is how the discovery shapes the interpretation of 1470‚Äôs place in the early world of Homo. ‚ÄúThese fossils are anatomically like 1470, and we now have some teeth,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúWe are more certain that 1470 was not a one-off, and not everything 1470 is big.‚Äù In their first formal report, Dr. Leakey and her colleagues wrote in the journal Nature, ‚ÄúThese three specimens will greatly aid the reassessment of the systematics and early radiation of the genus Homo.‚Äù They, however, chose not to assign the fossils to any existing or new species until more analysis is conducted on contemporary hominids. The 1470 specimen was two million years old; the new face and fragmentary jaw are 1.9 million to 1.95 million years old; the better-preserved lower jaw is younger still, at 1.83 million years old. Fred Spoor, a member of the discovery team who directed the laboratory analysis, said in a news teleconference that the research showed clearly that ‚Äúhuman evolution is not this straight line it was once thought to be.‚Äù Instead, East Africa, he said, ‚Äúwas quite a crowded place, with multiple species‚Äù with presumably different diets. Dr. Spoor is a paleoanthropologist at University College London and the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany. The lab work was supported by the institute. The fieldwork was financed by the National Geographic Society, and the dating of the fossils, mainly by Craig S. Feibel of Rutgers University, was supported by the Leakey Foundation. Although a few specialists in human origins questioned whether the still sparse evidence was sufficient to back the new conclusions, Ian Tattersall of the American Museum of Natural History in New York City, who was not involved in the new discovery, concluded, ‚ÄúThis new material certainly substantiates the idea, long gathering ground, that multiple lineages of early Homo are present in the record at Koobi Fora.‚Äù Dr. Tattersall continued, ‚ÄúAnd it supports the view that the early history of Homo involved vigorous experimentation with the biological and behavioral potential of the new genus, instead of a slow process of refinement in a central lineage.‚Äù Bernard Wood of George Washington University, who has studied the early Homo fossil record, wrote in a companion article in Nature, ‚ÄúIn a nutshell, the anatomy of the specimens supports the hypothesis of multiple early Homo species.‚Äù ||||| Our family tree may have sprouted some long-lost branches going back nearly 2 million years. A famous paleontology family has found fossils that they think confirm their theory that there are two additional pre-human species besides the one that eventually led to modern humans. A team led by Meave Leakey, daughter-in-law of famed scientist Louis Leakey, found facial bones from one creature and jawbones from two others in Kenya. That led the researchers to conclude that man's early ancestor had plenty of human-like company from other species. These would not be Homo erectus, believed to be our direct ancestor. They would be more like very distant cousins, who when you go back even longer in time, shared an ancient common ancestor, one scientist said. But other experts in human evolution are not convinced by what they say is a leap to large conclusions based on limited evidence. It is the continuation of a long-running squabble in anthropology about the earliest members of our own genus, or class, called Homo _an increasingly messy family history. And much of it stems from a controversial discovery that the Leakeys made 40 years ago. In their new findings, the Leakey team says that none of their newest fossil discoveries match erectus, so they had to be from another flat-faced relatively large species with big teeth. The new specimens have \\"a really distinct profile\\" and thus they are \\"something very different,\\" said Meave Leakey, describing the study published online Wednesday in Nature. What these new bones did match was an old fossil that Meave and her husband Richard helped find in 1972 that was baffling. That skull, called 1470, just did not fit with Homo erectus, the Leakeys contended. They said it was too flat-faced with a non-jutting jaw. They initially said it was well more than 2.5 million years old in a dating mistake that was later seized upon by creationists as evidence against evolution because it indicated how scientists can make dating mistakes. It turned out to be 2 million years old. For the past 40 years, the scientific question has been whether 1470 was a freak mutation of erectus or something new. For many years, the Leakeys have maintained that the male skull known as 1470 showed that there were more than one species of ancient hominids, but other scientists said it wasn't enough proof. The Leakeys' new discoveries are more evidence that this earlier \\"enigmatic face\\" was a separate species, said study co-author Fred Spoor of the Max Planck Institute in Germany. The new bones were found between 2007 and 2009 about six miles (10 kilometers) away from the old site near the fossil-rich Lake Turkana region, Leakey said. So that would make two species _ erectus and the one represented by 1470. But it's not that simple. The Leakey scientific team contends that other fossils of old hominids _ not those cited in their new study _ don't seem to match either erectus or 1470. They argue that the other fossils seem to have smaller heads and not just because they are female. For that reason, the Leakeys believe there were three living Homo species between 1.8 million and 2 million years ago. They would be Homo erectus, the 1470 species, and a third branch. \\"Anyway you cut it there are three species,\\" study co-author Susan Anton, an anthropologist at New York University. \\"One of them is named erectus and that ultimately in our opinion is going to lead to us.\\" Both of the species that Meave Leakey said existed back then went extinct more than a million years ago in evolutionary dead-ends. \\"Human evolution is clearly not the straight line that it once was,\\" Spoor said. The three different species could have been living at the same time at the same place, but probably didn't interact much, he said. Still, he said, East Africa nearly 2 million years ago \\"was quite a crowded place.\\" And making matters somewhat more confusing, the Leakeys and Spoor refused to give names to the two non-erectus species or attach them to some of the other Homo species names that are in scientific literature but still disputed. That's because of confusion about what species belongs where, Anton said. Two likely possibilities are Homo rudolfensis _which is where 1470 and its kin seem to belong _ and Homo habilis, where the other non-erectus belong, Anton said. The team said the new fossils mean scientists can reclassify those categorized as non-erectus species and confirm the earlier but disputed Leakey claim. But Tim White, a prominent evolutionary biologist at the University of California Berkeley, is not buying this new species idea, nor is Milford Wolpoff, a longtime professor of anthropology at the University of Michigan. They said the Leakeys are making too big a jump from too little evidence. White said it's similar to someone looking at the jaw of a female gymnast in the Olympics, the jaw of a male shot-putter, ignoring the faces in the crowd and deciding the shot-putter and gymnast have to be a different species. Eric Delson, a paleoanthropology professor at Lehman College in New York, said he buys the Leakeys' study, but added: \\"There's no question that it's not definite.\\" He said it won't convince doubters until fossils of both sexes of both non- erectus species are found. \\"It's a messy time period,\\" Delson said. ___ Seth Borenstein can be followed at http://twitter.com/borenbears ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"Scientists have discovered three new fossil specimens that provide compelling evidence for multiple lines of evolution in the Homo genus.

However, Jesse refused access, not wanting to see the swamp destroyed. However, this has made the rest of the townsfolk angry with him, as the new theme park means new jobs, and revenue for Hazzard County.

If the Governor General of Canada is unable to give assent, it can be done by either the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada‚Äîthe Chief Justice of Canada‚Äîor another justice of the Supreme Court of Canada. It is not actually necessary for the governor general to sign a bill passed by a legislature, the signature being merely an attestation. In each case, the parliament must be apprised of the granting of assent before the bill is considered to have become law. Two methods are available: the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament; alternatively, each house may be notified separately, usually by the speaker of that house. However, though both houses must be notified on the same day, notice to the House of Commons while it is not in session may be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons, whereas the Senate must be sitting and the governor general's letter read aloud by the speaker. If each house of parliament is notified seperately, what regulation applies?","completion":"When each house of parliament is notified separately about the granting of assent to a bill by the Governor General of Canada or his deputy, certain regulations apply. Firstly, both houses must be notified on the same day. The method of notification differs between the two houses. For the House of Commons, should it not be in session at the time, notification can be given by way of publishing a special issue of the Journals of the House of Commons. This serves as an official record that the House of Commons has been apprised of the granting of the assent. Meanwhile, for the Senate, it must be in session for the notification to take place. Further, the Governor General's letter has to be read aloud by the speaker in the Senate. This ensures that all the members of the Senate are aware of the granting of the assent. This approach is the alternative to the method in which the sovereign's representatives may grant assent in the presence of both houses of parliament. Despite the two methods available, if the parliament is not apprised of the granting of assent, the bill will not be considered to have become law. All of these regulations are important to ensure clarity, transparency, and democracy within the legislative process. They aim to make sure that all parties involved - the two houses of parliament in particular - are equally informed about the processes necessary to convert a bill into law, one of them being the granting of assent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

(nee Haring) and Donald Tyler Rohrabacher. He attended elementary school locally, and during his college years, he lived in Sunset Beach. Rohrabacher graduated from Palos Verdes High School in Palos Verdes Estates, California, attended Los Angeles Harbor College, and earned a bachelor's degree in history at California State University, Long Beach in 1969. He received his master's degree in American Studies at the University of Southern California. Rohrabacher doubts that global warming is caused by humans. During a congressional hearing on climate change on February 8, 2007, Rohrabacher mused that previous warming cycles may have been caused by carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere by \\"dinosaur flatulence\\": \\"In fact, it is assumed at best to be unproven and at worst a liberal claptrap, trendy, but soon to go out of style in our new Congress.\\" Politico and the New York Times reported that on May 25, 2011, Rohrabacher expressed further skepticism regarding the existence of man-made global warming and suggested that, if global warming is an issue, a possible solution could be clear-cutting rain forests, and replanting. These reports sparked strong criticism by some scientists, including Oliver Phillips, a geography professor at the University of Leeds. They noted the consensus that intact forests act as net absorbers of carbon, reducing global warming. In response, Rohrabacher stated, Once again those with a global agenda have created a straw man by misrepresenting the position of their critics. I do not believe that CO2 is a cause of global warming, nor have I ever advocated the reduction of CO2 through the clearing of rainforests or cutting down older trees to prevent global warming. But that is how my question to a witness during my subcommittee hearing on May 25th is being reported. I simply asked the witness, Dr. Todd Stern, who is a supporter of a global climate treaty that would dramatically hurt the standard of living for millions of human beings, if he was considering a policy that would address naturally emitted carbon dioxide, which makes up over 90% of emissions. To suggest that I'm advocating such a radical approach instead of simply questioning the policy is a total misrepresentation of my position. Rohrabacher does not believe that global warming is a problem.

Article:Insolvency experts have predicted that more people who are short of money are going to turn to payday lenders - who can be found on the High Street and the internet - for a short-term loan. Some debt charities and consumer groups have warned that such lenders can lure the unwary into taking on debt that balloons out of control. An official study in 2010 said they provided a legitimate, useful, service that helped to cover a gap in the market. But in early 2013, the Office of Fair Trading said that there was widespread irresponsible lending in the industry. And by the end of the year, the government said there was \\"growing evidence\\" in support of a cap on the cost of a loan, including the fees and interest rates. How do payday loans work? Typically someone will borrow a few hundred pounds from a payday loan firm for a short time, to tide them over until they receive their next wage or salary cheque. The borrower will usually offer a post-dated cheque to the lender to cover the eventual repayment of the money borrowed, plus interest. The cash is often emergency borrowing to pay an urgent unexpected bill, or rent or utility bills. How many people use them? There are no official figures on how many people use this sort of borrowing. But Consumer Focus estimated last year that 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million loans in 2009. In 2008, √Ç¬£900m was was taken out in the form of payday loans, according to the Office of Fair Trading in a formal review of all \\"high-cost\\" credit businesses in 2010. But it said the value of the loans was growing rapidly. As a result of its most recent inquiries, which led to an interim report in November 2012, the OFT thinks that as much as √Ç¬£1.8bn a year may now be being lent by payday lenders. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said that about two million people in the UK used payday loans. Who uses them? The OFT found that the typical borrower of a payday loan was \\"more likely to be a young male, earning more than √Ç¬£1,000 monthly, and in rented accommodation. Many are unmarried with no children\\". But the borrowers are not normally unemployed or without a bank account. They sometimes see the short-term loan as a sensible alternative to running up an unauthorised bank overdraft. Some have turned to these lenders because household budgets are being squeezed and banks have restricted their credit offers. How many firms offer them? The OFT said in November 2012 that there were about 240 payday loan firms altogether in the UK, with the top 50 accounting for most of the lending. Its previous research suggested there were about 2,000 High Street payday loan shops, some of which are part of large national chains, such as The Money Shop. Some were also pawnbrokers as well, operating out of the same premises. There were also thought to be more than 100 online firms offering cash too, which were much more expensive. Across the whole consumer credit industry there are 72,000 lenders, the PAC says, but this includes credit card firms and door-to-door lenders. Are they regulated? Yes. Any lender, whether it be a big High Street bank or a one-outlet payday loan shop needs a consumer credit licence from the Office of Fair Trading (OFT). What is the problem? The loans are very expensive with very high rates of interest. But in the eyes of the borrower that is often not relevant. What matters is the cash cost of repaying the loan. That can be acceptable to the borrower if the payday loan is more convenient than an overdraft, or some other sort of arranged loan, and is taken for just a few days. The problem for a borrower starts to build up quickly if he or she cannot in fact repay the loan as planned, and it gets extended, or rolled over. The interest then builds up rapidly and can soon swamp the size of the original loan. Should anything be done? Despite the negative publicity surrounding payday loan firms, the OFT said in 2010 that these and other high-cost credit businesses - such as pawn brokers or home-credit lenders - should not have their interest charges restricted. It concluded that they provided a useful service for some people who would not otherwise be able to borrow legitimately and who might thus be forced to borrow from illegal loan sharks. But it changed its tune in its November 2012 report specifically on payday lenders. It referred the industry to the Competition Commission and has told individual lenders to improve how they deal with customers. However, the PAC was scathing of the OFT's record, accusing it of being \\"timid and ineffective\\" in regulating the sector in a report published in May 2013. The Consumer Finance Association, a trade body representing some payday lenders, says some of the biggest firms have signed up to a code of conduct. However, the government has proposed going further with a cap on payday loan interest rates and charges. The regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority, will make recommendations on how this should work. Previously the government had said such a cap was not needed. More information is available from a series of charities about how to cope with debt problems. Summarize the main points of that article.","completion":"The article discusses how insolvency experts predict that more people short of money will turn to payday lenders for short-term loans.

Approximately 1.2 million people took out 4.1 million payday loans in 2009, a number that continues to increase.

It is the densest planet in the Solar System and the largest of the four terrestrial planets. - The Tharsis Montes are three large shield volcanoes in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. From north to south, the volcanoes are Ascraeus Mons, Pavonis Mons and Arsia Mons. Mons (plural \\"montes\\") is the Latin word for mountain. It is a descriptor term used in astrogeology for mountainous features in the Solar System. - Biblis Tholus is an extinct Martian volcano located at 2.55 ¬∞ N 235.62 ¬∞ E , one of two volcanoes near the center of the Tharsis volcanism . Along with Ulysses Tholus , it is almost midway between Olympus Mons and the Tharsis Montes . It is approximately 170 kilometers ( 110 mi ) long and 100 kilometers ( 62 mi ) wide , rising about 3 kilometers ( 1.9 mi ) from its surroundings . In the middle of the volcano is a caldera , named Biblis Patera , believed to have formed as the result of collapse of the magma chamber during eruptions of the volcano . The caldera is 53 kilometers ( 33 mi ) in diameter and four kilometers ( 2.5 miles ) in depth . - A mountain is a large landform that stretches above the surrounding land in a limited area, usually in the form of a peak. A mountain is generally steeper than a hill. Mountains are formed through tectonic forces or volcanism. These forces can locally raise the surface of the earth. Mountains erode slowly through the action of rivers, weather conditions, and glaciers. A few mountains are isolated summits, but most occur in huge mountain ranges. - Lava is the molten rock expelled by a volcano during an eruption. The resulting rock after solidification and cooling is also called \\"lava\\". The molten rock is formed in the interior of some planets, including Earth, and some of their satellites. The source of the heat that melts the rock within the earth is geothermal energy. When first erupted from a volcanic vent, lava is a liquid usually at temperatures from . - Mount Everest, also known in Nepal as Sagarmth and in China as Chomolungma/, is earth's highest mountain. Its peak is above sea level. Mount Everest is in the Mahalangur Range. The international border between China (Tibet Autonomous Region) and Nepal runs across Everest's summit point. Its massif includes neighbouring peaks Lhotse, ; Nuptse, , and Changtse, . - Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet in the Solar System, after Mercury. Named after the Roman god of war, it is often referred to as the \\"Red Planet\\" because the iron oxide prevalent on its surface gives it a reddish appearance. Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. - A magma chamber is a large underground pool of liquid rock found beneath the surface of the Earth. The molten rock in such a chamber is under great pressure, and given enough time, that pressure can gradually fracture the rock around it creating outlets for the magma. If it finds a way to the surface, then the result will be a volcanic eruption; consequently many volcanoes are situated over magma chambers. Magma chambers are hard to detect, and most of the known ones are therefore close to the surface of the Earth, commonly between 1 km and 10 km under the surface. In geological terms, this is extremely close to the surface, although in human terms, it is considerably deep underground. - The Tharsis quadrangle is one of a series of 30 quadrangle maps of Mars used by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) Astrogeology Research Program. The Tharsis quadrangle is also referred to as MC-9 (Mars Chart-9). - Ascraeus Mons is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the northernmost and tallest of three shield volcanoes collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The volcano's location corresponds to the classical albedo feature Ascraeus Lacus. - A volcano is a rupture in the crust of a planetary-mass object, such as Earth, that allows hot lava, volcanic ash, and gases to escape from a magma chamber below the surface. - Olympus Mons (Latin for Mount Olympus) is a very large shield volcano on the planet Mars. By one measure, it has a height of nearly 22 km (13.6 mi). Olympus Mons stands about two and a half times as tall as Mount Everest's height above sea level. It is the youngest of the large volcanoes on Mars, having formed during Mars's Hesperian Period. It is currently the largest volcano discovered in the Solar System and had been known to astronomers since the late 19th century as the albedo feature Nix Olympica (Latin for \\"Olympic Snow\\"). Its mountainous nature was suspected well before space probes confirmed its identity as a mountain. - A space probe is a robotic spacecraft that leaves Earth orbit and explores space. It may approach the Moon; enter interplanetary space; flyby, orbit, or land on other planetary bodies; or approach interstellar space. - Magma (from Ancient Greek (\\"m√°gma\\") meaning \\"thick unguent\\") is a mixture of molten or semi-molten rock, volatiles and solids that is found beneath the surface of the Earth, and is expected to exist on other terrestrial planets and some natural satellites. Besides molten rock, magma may also contain suspended crystals, dissolved gas and sometimes gas bubbles. Magma often collects in magma chambers that may feed a volcano or solidify underground to form an intrusion. Magma is capable of intruding into adjacent rocks (forming igneous dikes and sills), extrusion onto the surface as lava, and explosive ejection as tephra to form pyroclastic rock. - Pavonis Mons (Latin for \\"peacock mountain\\") is a large shield volcano located in the Tharsis region of the planet Mars. It is the middle member of a chain of three volcanic mountains (collectively known as the Tharsis Montes) that straddle the Martian equator between longitudes 235¬∞E and 259¬∞E. The volcano was discovered by the Mariner 9 spacecraft in 1971 and was originally called Middle Spot. Its name formally became Pavonis Mons in 1973. - Ulysses Tholus is a Martian volcano. It is located in the Tharsis quadrangle at 2.89¬∞ north latitude and 121.55¬∞ west longitude. It is 58 km across and is named after a classical albedo feature name. Ulysses Tholus is immediately east and slightly north of another volcano, Biblis Tholus. - Mount Olympus (also transliterated as Olympos, and on Greek maps, Oros Olympos) is the highest mountain in Greece and the second highest mountain in the Balkans. It is located in the Olympus Range on the border between Thessaly and Macedonia, between the regional units of Pieria and Larissa, about southwest from Thessaloniki. Mount Olympus has 52 peaks, deep gorges, and exceptional biodiversity. The highest peak \\"Mytikas\\", meaning \\"nose\\", rises to . It is one of the highest peaks in Europe in terms of topographic prominence. - Tharsis is a vast volcanic plateau centered near the equator in the western hemisphere of Mars. The region is home to the largest volcanoes in the Solar System, including the three enormous shield volcanoes Arsia Mons, Pavonis Mons, and Ascraeus Mons, which are collectively known as the Tharsis Montes. The tallest volcano on the planet, Olympus Mons, is often associated with the Tharsis region but is actually located off the western edge of the plateau. The name Tharsis is the Greco-Latin transliteration of the biblical Tarshish, the land at the western extremity of the known world. - Arsia Mons is the southernmost of three volcanos (collectively known as Tharsis Montes) on the Tharsis bulge near the equator of the planet Mars. To its north is Pavonis Mons, and north of that is Ascraeus Mons. The tallest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons, is to its northwest. Its name comes from a corresponding albedo feature on a map by Giovanni Schiaparelli, which he named in turn after the legendary Roman forest of Arsia Silva. - Tarshish occurs in the Hebrew Bible with several uncertain meanings, most frequently as a place (probably a large city or region) far across the sea from the Land of Israel and Phoenicia. Tarshish was said to have supplied vast quantities of important metals to Israel and Phoenicia. The same place-name occurs in the Akkadian inscriptions of Esarhaddon (the Assyrian king, d. 669 BC) and also on the Phoenician inscription on the Nora Stone, indicating that it was a \\"real\\" place; its precise location was never commonly known, and was eventually lost in antiquity. Legends grew up around it over time so that its identity has been the subject of scholarly research and commentary for more than two thousand years. Its importance stems in part from the fact that Hebrew biblical passages tend to understand Tarshish as a source of King Solomon's great wealth in metals - especially silver, but also gold, tin and iron (Ezekiel 27). The metals were reportedly obtained in partnership with King Hiram of Phoenician Tyre (Isaiah 23), and the fleets of Tarshish-ships. However, Solomon's Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians, thus archaeological evidence has been difficult to uncover.

Willem Westerhof found 17 vulnerabilities in inverters, which convert electricity produced by the panels so it can be used on the grid. He said internet-connected inverters could be targeted by hackers. One manufacturer said that only \\"a small fraction\\" of its devices were affected. After discovering vulnerabilities in devices produced by a range of manufacturers, Mr Westerhof carried out a field test near Amsterdam on two inverters made by SMA. He told the BBC the test showed it would be possible for an attacker to remotely control the devices and alter the flow of power. Because energy equipment on the grid needs to balance supply with demand, overloading the system could result in a power cut. \\"If an attacker does that on a large scale, that has serious consequences for the power grid stability,\\" said Mr Westerhof. Energy researcher Iain Staffell, at Imperial College London, told the BBC, \\"It's certainly a risk to electricity supply and could stress grid operations.\\" However, he did not believe it could cause blackouts and he pointed out that a large number of inverters would have to be attacked at once for any significant effect to occur. SMA responded by pointing out the limitations to such an attack: \\"The security of our devices has highest priority for SMA in all respects,\\" the company said in a statement. \\"We already assessed the mentioned issues on a technical basis and [are working] intensively on the correction.\\" It added that it would publish further responses to Mr Westerhof's research in the coming days and that it was working on a report about the security of its products with the Dutch National Cyber Security Centre. Asking users to change passwords was a way of pushing liability away from the manufacturer, said cyber-security researcher Tom van de Wiele, at F-Secure. \\"The vulnerabilities are real,\\" he said, though he agreed with SMA that not all inverters would be open to attack. \\"Just because you bought one of their products and a solar array, [it does not mean] that you are vulnerable.\\" He added that he had seen similar security issues in other industrial products. Mr Westerhof discovered the security flaws while working on his undergraduate thesis and detailed the research in a talk at the SHA2017 security conference in the Netherlands on Monday. He said he had decided not to release full details of potential attacks on the inverters, to avoid encouraging malicious hackers. \\"Solar producers should seek to isolate the products from the internet ASAP,\\" said Dave Palmer, director of technology at cyber-security company Darktrace. \\"And [they should] also review their physical access security to reduce the risk of a local attack from someone physically breaking into their facilities.\\" Summary:","completion":"A researcher found that hackers could target internet-connected inverters, which are used to convert electricity from solar panels for use on the grid, potentially causing power cuts and stressing grid operations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Durand Durand is the inventor of the Positronic Ray, a weapon that Earth leaders fear will fall into the wrong hands. Barbarella crashes on the 16th planet of Tau Ceti and is soon knocked unconscious by two mysterious girls, who take Barbarella to the wreckage of a spaceship. Inside the wreckage, she is tied up and several children emerge from within the ship. They set out several dolls which have razor-sharp teeth. As the dolls begin to bite her, Barbarella faints but is rescued by Mark Hand, the Catchman, who patrols the ice looking for errant children. While Hand takes her back to her ship, Barbarella offers to reward Mark and he suggests sex. She says that people on Earth no longer have penetrative intercourse but consume exaltation-transference pills and press their palms together when their \\"psychocardiograms are in perfect harmony\\".

Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms.

He served as the head football coach at The College of William & Mary (1969-1971), North Carolina State University (1972-1975), the New York Jets (1976), the University of Arkansas (1977-1983), the University of Minnesota (1984-1985), the University of Notre Dame (1986-1996), and the University of South Carolina (1999-2004), compiling a career record of 249-132-7. Holtz's 1988 Notre Dame team went 12-0 with a victory in the Fiesta Bowl and was the consensus national champion. Holtz is the only college football coach to lead six different programs to bowl games and the only coach to guide four different programs to the final top 20 rankings. Context: After two seasons as a commentator for CBS Sports, Holtz came out of retirement in 1999 and returned to the University of South Carolina, where he had been an assistant in the 1960s. The year before Holtz arrived, the Gamecocks went 1-10, and the team subsequently went 0-11 during Holtz's first season. In his second season, South Carolina went 8-4, winning the Outback Bowl over the heavily favored Ohio State Buckeyes. The eight-game improvement from the previous year was the best in the nation in 2000 and the third best single-season turnaround in NCAA history. It also earned National Coach of the Year honors for Holtz from Football News and American Football Coaches Quarterly. In his third season, Holtz's success continued, leading the Gamecocks to a 9-3 record and another Outback Bowl victory over Ohio State. The nine wins for the season were the second highest total in the history of the program. Under Holtz's leadership, the Gamecocks posted their best two-year mark in school history from 2000 to 2001, going 17-7 overall and 10-6 in SEC play. After consecutive 5-7 campaigns in 2002 and 2003, Holtz finished his South Carolina tenure on a winning note with a 6-5 record in 2004. Holtz's time in Columbia saw the resurrection of Gamecock Football, as the program had only one bowl win and no Top 25 finishes in the ten years before his hire. Upon his exit, USC had posted AP Top 25 finishes in 2000 and 2001 (#19 and No. 13 respectively) and had made consecutive New Year's Day bowls for the first time in its history. Holtz finished his six-year tenure at South Carolina with a 2-4 record versus his former team, Arkansas, beating the Razorbacks in Columbia, SC in 2000 and 2004. In 2005, the NCAA imposed three years probation and reductions in two scholarships on the program for ten admitted violations under Holtz, five of which were found to be major. The violations involved improper tutoring and off-season workouts, as well as a lack of institutional control. No games were forfeited, and no television or postseason ban was imposed. Holtz issued a statement after the sanctions were announced stating, \\"There was no money involved. No athletes were paid. There were no recruiting inducements. No cars. No jobs offered. No ticket scandal.\\" Question: What other note worthy games did he coach with South Carolina? Answer:","completion":"Louis Holtz coached many noteworthy games while at South Carolina, but let me tell you about a couple important ones that kids like you would enjoy hearing about! 1. Outback Bowl in 2001: In just his second season at South Carolina, Coach Holtz led the team to the Outback Bowl against a strong Ohio State team. Everyone thought Ohio State would win, but surprise! South Carolina won the game, 24-7. It was a big accomplishment for the team and Coach Holtz. 2. Outback Bowl in 2002: South Carolina had another great season and went to the Outback Bowl again, facing Ohio State for the second time. Like in a movie, history repeated itself and South Carolina won the game again, this time 31-28. It was a close and exciting game, and it made Coach Holtz even more popular. These are just two examples of the memorable games that Coach Holtz coached while at South Carolina.

The Third Reich is a term that refers to a period in Germany's history, when they were under the rule of a very bad leader named Adolf Hitler. This was a very sad time because Hitler and his friends, called Nazis, were very mean and did terrible things to many people. This happened a long time ago, between 1933 and 1945. Now, about the First and the Second Reich. Yes, there were two earlier times in Germany's history called the First and Second Reich.

And I also have a good habit: Asking whenever I have a question. I must make it clear by asking our English teacher. How happy I am when I understand! Besides this, I often read English stories, jokes and easy novels. They help me understand a lot of things. So to do more reading is an important way to learn English well. And I also write English diaries. English has become a close friend of mine. Question: The sentence \\"I got a very good mark\\" means _ .

Well when the hubbs wanted to come up to watch our Mets take in the Blue Jays at Stade Olympique I made it a point to come here for dinner. I do have to say Jewish Deli is my #1 favorite type of food. The reason for this has to come from my Grandmothers next door neighbor who IMHO made the best sour dill pickles EVER!!!! But I digress, but will get to their pickles in a bit. Let me start off with the place. We get there and it is tiny with maybe 8 tables I could see that were chocked full of people. Also facing the food was a bar that had stools you could sit at. When we got there (9 on a Saturday night) the only two places to sit were at the bar which were fine by us. Now as I have said before I love Deli food so when it comes to the meat I am a little picky. I do prefer a more fatty cut of meat and they deliver. You have your choice of three levels of fattiness which is a nice option as not everyone enjoys the fatty part of brisket. The fries are amazing as they are whole potatoes that look like they are cut in house. An order is large enough to split although I tried valiantly to not hog them all but failed miserably. Ok now the star of the meal for me was the pickles. They were so good that I let the husband have the rest of the fries so that I could have his pickle. Putter is the brand name of them and I really wish that they had them on this side of the border. How would this review be described in terms of sentiment?","completion":"The sentiment of this review can be characterized as predominantly positive. This is derived from the reviewer's enthusiastic and detailed feedback about her dining experience. Starting from her itemized dining experience, she goes on to mention her love for Jewish Deli food, setting up an anticipation for the quality of the smoked meat sandwich she will experience in Montreal. Once she arrives at the restaurant, she vividly describes the ambiance which is filled with diners and a bar. She also appreciates the option to choose levels of fattiness for the meat sandwich, pointing to her preferences and the establishment's flexibility. Her absolute admiration for the fries and pickles served is also a critical part of her positive experience. Her confession of hogging most of the fries and bartering for her husband's pickle indulges the audience in a playful food experience. While she did not explicitly give a rating or definitive positive adjective, her vivacious narration of the food and atmosphere, alongside her anticipation and satisfaction, unmistakably imply a positive sentiment. However, it's worth noting that the review is also slightly nostalgic and personal, given her mention of her Grandmother's pickles and the special preference for Jewish Deli, which adds warmth and a personal touch to her positive review."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer based on context: Hoping to rebound from their blowout loss at Green Bay, the Broncos returned home for an AFC West duel with the San Diego Chargers. The Chargers took the early lead in the first quarter, with a 24-yard field goal by placekicker Nick Novak. The Broncos grabbed the lead, when cornerback Cassius Vaughn returned an interception off Chargers' quarterback Philip Rivers 55 yards for a touchdown. The Chargers responded, with a 32-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos extended their lead in the second quarter, with a 32-yard field goal by placekicker Matt Prater. However, the Chargers would re-claim the lead, with a 2-yard touchdown run by Rivers, a 28-yard field goal by Novak, followed by a 42-yard touchdown pass from Rivers to wide receiver Malcom Floyd, giving San Diego a 23-10 halftime lead. The Broncos benched quarterback Kyle Orton in favor of Tim Tebow. After a scoreless third quarter, the Chargers added to their lead, with a 51-yard field goal by Novak. The Broncos responded, when Tebow scrambled for a 12-yard touchdown (with a two-point conversion run by running back Willis McGahee), then threw a 28-yard touchdown pass to running back Knowshon Moreno (with a failed two-point conversion attempt), to pull the Broncos to within 26-24 with just over three minutes left in the game.

User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. In one sentence, describe what the following article is about: Ideally, you want at least 6 players per team for a competitive game. However, if you're playing with a group of friends, keep the same number of players on each side. You should have 2 rows of players, with the first row closest to the net and the back row closest to the rear boundary of the court. The player in the back right corner will serve the ball. You can rotate players around the court so that you will have a new server for each service game. If you are rotating players out, rotate clockwise -- looking at the net, the player closest to it on the right side would rotate out, allowing for many players to play. Toss a coin or form an agreement to find out who will begin the game. If you serve from in front of the line it will be a point for the other team. This is known as a foot fault. The ball has to go over the net (but it can touch), and it has to land within the court for the serve to be good. The player on the right-hand side at the back of the court serves. Each player will only receive one service attempt per serve rotation; you may serve as many times as you can get the ball in the other teams court. The ball is good even if it lands on a line. Thus the rally has begun! A typical play will be bump, set, spike -- but as long as it goes over within three hits, it's good. Technically, you can hit the ball with any part of your body so long as the ball does not come to a rest. Players may go over the lines, but the ball may not. If a player on your team hits it out of bounds, you may run to retrieve it -- successfully so if it doesn't touch the ground. This could be because of any one of the following: The ball hits the ground. This can cause the serving team to score 1 point for their team. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the serving team, then the other team has the opportunity to serve. If the ball hits the ground on the side of the receiving team, then the serving team can serve again. The point is awarded to the team that did not allow the ball to hit the ground. The ball goes out of bounds. The team that hits the ball out of bounds loses the point. Someone touches the net. If a player on one team touches the net, then the opposing team picks up a point. Someone's foot goes under the net. When this happens, the opposing team receives the point. Someone hits the ball 2 consecutive times. Players can't strike the ball twice in a row, unless a strike is in the block. A block does not count as a touch. A team hits the ball 4 or more times without sending it over. 3 is the maximum. Catching the ball without bumping it on the acceptance from play. Letting the recipient team receive the ball bump from anything besides their arms or hands can cause the serving team to pick up a point. Returning the ball without allowing the ball to cross over the top of the net will score one point for the serving team. The team that won the last point gets to serve the ball. If you're rotating, rotate now. If your team has the ball, it's common for the rows to back up a bit. The idea here is to get ready for an attack. If you don't have the ball, move forward. The idea instead here is to make the attack. Teams who produce an error or send the ball out-of-play will automatically send the ball over to the other team to serve. No extra score must be added to the \\"new\\" serving team. NO penalty may be given in any situation where the ball touches the net then goes over to the other side to be played. The ball continues to be live and playable (unless it comes back towards the recipient team on the volley). You can decide how many points you will allow for each game. For instance, you can start a new game when a team earns 15 points. Recent rules state that regulation games go to 25 points, with the third game (in a set of three) going to 15. Sometimes, games may take the form of ending with a certain time limit but this must be agreed upon - generally, this time limit will be eight minutes, but may be longer or shorter dependent on situation for the game. A standard match is three games long. Each team should switch sides at the start of a new game. The loosing team during each service should have the chance to serve in the next game of the match. A game must be won by two points. 25-26 will not cut it; it must be 25-27. Because of this, close games can go on much longer.

Voting is a civic duty Come up with some evidence to support this claim.","completion":"Voting as a civic duty has been a widely debated and discussed concept throughout recent history. The idea of civic duties refers to the responsibilities every citizen has towards their country and its democratic system. Voting, in this context, is often seen as a crucial way for individuals to contribute to and maintain the functioning of a democratic society. The following evidence supports the claim that voting is a civic duty: 1. Upholding democratic principles: In a democratic society, one of the fundamental principles is the right to participate in the decision-making process. Voting is an expression of this right. When citizens exercise their right to vote, they are actively participating in the democratic processes and contributing to the decision-making that affects their lives. By voting, individuals help ensure that these democratic principles are preserved and respected. 2. Representation and accountability: Voting gives citizens the opportunity to express their voice and choose their representatives. Elected officials are accountable to their constituents and are expected to serve the best interests of the people who voted them into office. When citizens participate in the voting process, they help to ensure that their needs and interests are considered by those in power. Moreover, high voter turnout can lead to greater political efficacy and responsiveness from elected officials. 3. Voting as an act of social responsibility: Part of being a responsible member of society is being informed about and involved in the issues that directly or indirectly affect one's life. Voting allows citizens to get informed about current events and policies and, in turn, contribute to their country's overall well-being. Therefore, voting may be seen as an aspect of social responsibility, wherein individuals contribute collectively to the decision-making process based on their knowledge and opinion. 4. Strengthening political institutions: When citizens regularly participate in elections and abide by the rules and regulations surrounding voting, they help build and maintain trust in the political institutions. High voter turnout is considered a sign of a healthy democracy, demonstrating that citizens are engaged and have confidence in the system. Consequently, voting can play a role in maintaining the credibility and legitimacy of a country's political system. 5. Encouraging political engagement and civic education: Voting, as a civic duty, is often accompanied by discussions, debates, and education on various issues, candidates, and policies. This fosters a well-informed and civically conscious population that is more likely to engage actively in the political process. Citizens are encouraged to be critical thinkers, evaluate candidates and political parties, and make informed choices based on their research and judgment. 6. Historical and global context: Throughout history, many groups have fought for and gained the right to vote. This right has not always been accessible to everyone, and exercising it is an acknowledgement of the sacrifices made by those who fought for this right. Voting is also an expression of solidarity and support for democratic processes around the world. In many countries, people are still fighting for the ability to vote, and participating in elections is a way to affirm our shared commitment to democracy across the globe. In conclusion, the evidence suggests that voting is indeed a civic duty, as it upholds democratic principles, promotes representation and accountability, emphasizes social responsibility, strengthens political institutions, fosters political engagement and civic education, and recognizes the historical and global context of the right to vote. By participating in elections, citizens play a vital role in the functioning and maintenance of a democratic society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Acknowledge your part in the drama: As mentioned earlier, humility is one of the best ways to diffuse drama, as it takes the energy out of someone's drama. By explaining where the mishap or misunderstanding occurred on your end, you can begin to diffuse the drama. 2. Remain calm and composed: Keep your emotions in check, and do not escalate the situation by recriminations or angry responses. Instead, maintain a composed demeanor, and calmly express your thoughts and opinions without attacking the other person involved in the drama. 3. Listen actively: Show empathy and genuine interest in the other person's feelings and thoughts. Give them the opportunity to express their concerns fully. Listening can help people feel heard, understood, and validated, which may help reduce the intensity of the drama. 4. Set boundaries: In some cases, it may be necessary to set limits on what you are willing to discuss or tolerate during a conversation. Make it clear that you will not accept disrespectful behavior or language and that you are willing to walk away if the drama continues to escalate. 5. Pick your battles: Not every situation requires confrontation. Sometimes it's better to let go of small disagreements in order to maintain healthy relationships and avoid unnecessary drama. 6. Seek mediation or support: If the drama involves a group of people or a situation that requires an outside perspective, consider seeking help from a trusted friend, counselor, or mediator. This person can offer an unbiased viewpoint and help facilitate communication between those involved in the drama. 7. Reflect on the situation: After the drama has cooled down, take some time to reflect on your own actions and reactions during the conflict. Identify areas where you may have overreacted or could have handled things differently, and consider how you might handle similar situations in the future. 8. Channel your emotions into productive activities: Instead of engaging in destructive patterns and behaviors, find a healthy outlet for your emotions, such as journaling, exercise, or creative pursuits. This can help alleviate the stress associated with drama and allow you to process your thoughts and feelings without further stirring up the situation. 9. Communicate openly and honestly: Open communication is key to resolving drama and moving forward. Be honest about your feelings, but also be willing to listen and consider the perspective of others. 10. Forgive and move on: Once the drama has been resolved, it's essential to let go of any lingering resentment or ill feelings and focus on moving forward with a sense of understanding and compassion for those involved. Remember that everyone makes mistakes, and we can all learn valuable lessons from these experiences.

Paragraph : The more an elastic object is stretched or compressed, the greater its elastic potential energy is. Question: What will happen to the amount of elastic potential energy in Jim's rubber band if he expands it more potential energy or less potential energy? A:","completion":"If Jim expands the rubber band more, the amount of elastic potential energy within the rubber band will increase. This is due to the fact that as the rubber band is stretched further, the elastic object (in this case, the rubber band) undergoes a greater amount of deformation. This increased deformation leads to an increase in the amount of stored energy within the rubber band's molecular structure. The elastic potential energy of an object is directly proportional to its deformation, according to Hooke's Law. Hooke's Law states that the force needed to extend or compress a spring by a certain distance is proportional to that distance, and is represented by the formula F = kx, where F is the force, k is the spring constant (a measure of the object's elasticity), and x is the displacement or change in dimension of the object. As a result, when Jim stretches the rubber band more, this increases the displacement (x) in the formula, which in turn increases the force (F) required to maintain the rubber band's new shape. Since elastic potential energy (E) is given by the formula E = (1/2)kx^2, increasing the displacement (x) will cause an increase in the elastic potential energy stored within the rubber band. Therefore, the answer is that if Jim expands his rubber band more, the rubber band will have more elastic potential energy."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Cardigan, Aberaeron and New Quay councils have already decided not to pay for CCTV coverage from April. Ceredigion council decided to stop funding the system to save ¬£150,000. It was part of its aim to plug a budget deficit of ¬£9.6m during the next financial year. The local authority then asked the five community councils if they were willing foot the bill from 1 April. Following the decision on Monday night, Aberystwyth town and Ceredigion county councillor, Ceredig Davies, said: \\"It was completely unfair of the county council to expect Aberystwyth town council to pay for CCTV coverage in the town. \\"We decided not to pay for the service because we felt that this was a matter for the local authority and the police to pay for the eight cameras in Aberystwyth.\\" Lampeter town councillors will discuss future provision of the town's six cameras on Thursday. The Mayor, Dorothy Williams, said the council was prepared to pay up to ¬£15,400 for a 12-month contract to continue CCTV coverage in the town. It has contributed ¬£7,500 towards the town's CCTV system during the last financial year. She added: \\"We have started discussions with Trinity St David's University in Lampeter regarding setting up a monitoring system there.\\" Aberystwyth: 8 Lampeter: 6 Cardigan: 4 Aberaeron: 3 New Quay: 2 Source: Dyfed-Powys Police One supervisor and two operators based at Aberystwyth have monitored the 23 town centre surveillance cameras in the county but that will cease on 1 April. \\"We have been told that we would have to pay almost ¬£22,000 if we are on our own so we will have to wait and see what happens at Thursday night's meeting,\\" said Mrs Williams. Last week Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire councils were asked to help fund a review of CCTV services to tackle crime in the Dyfed-Powys area. The force's Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon said the police and the local authorities would benefit from a \\"more consistent\\" provision of CCTV to tackle crime. He added that the cost of the review would be split between the councils and the force. Officers made 414 arrests with the help of evidence from CCTV footage in Carmarthenshire between April and December 2013 - a 61% increase for the same period the previous year. A Ceredigion council spokesman said that council leader, Ellen ap Gwynn, was in communication with Mr Salmon following earlier discussions on the future delivery of CCTV throughout the region.","completion":"The provision of CCTV camera coverage in the town of Lampeter, Wales, is under decision by the town's councillors following Ceredigion council's cessation of funding for the system in an attempt to save ¬£150,000 as part of their aim to alleviate a budget deficit of ¬£9.6 million. Other councils, including Cardigan, Aberaeron, and New Quay, have already decided against independently funding CCTV coverage, taking a stance that such funding should be the responsibility of the local authority and the police. The Ceredigion council had requested five community councils to help finance the CCTV system following the withdrawal of their own funding. However, Ceredig Davies, a town and county councillor for Aberystwyth, criticised the county council's expectation for Aberystwyth to self-fund the CCTV cover for their town, which involves the operation of eight cameras. Discussions are ongoing in Lampeter, with the town council set to discuss funding for its six CCTV cameras. Mayor Dorothy Williams indicated the town council's willingness to contribute a maximum of ¬£15,400 towards a 12-month contract to ensure CCTV coverage continuity. This would mark a financial increase from the previous fiscal year, during which the council input ¬£7,500 towards the local CCTV system. Potential partnerships are also under discussion, including a potential monitoring system set-up with Trinity St David's University in Lampeter. Currently, Aberystwyth's 23 town centre surveillance cameras are monitored by a team of three, although this is set to end on April 1. The cost to continue such a service independently would be a hefty ¬£22,000, prompting hesitant sentiments from Mayor Williams who aims to evaluate the decision in an upcoming Thursday meeting. Last week, Ceredigion, Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire councils were requested to assist in funding a review of CCTV services tackling crime in the Dyfed-Powys area. This proposition was made by Police and Crime Commissioner Christopher Salmon, who advocates for a \\"more consistent\\" approach to crime prevention via CCTV. Assurances were given that the cost of the evaluation would be distributed between the councils and the police force. This followed the achievement of 414 arrests made with the assistance of CCTV evidence in Carmarthenshire between April and December of 2013 - a 61% increase compared to the same period from the previous year. A spokesperson confirmed that Ellen ap Gwynn, leader of Ceredigion council, is in negotiations with Commissioner Salmon regarding the future of CCTV in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Where was the specific location of the nuclear accident in the USA in 1979????","completion":"The specific location of the nuclear accident in 1979 in the USA, widely known as \\"Three Mile Island accident\\", was at the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station. The Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station is situated on Three Mile Island near Harrisburg, in Londonderry Township, Dauphin County, Pennsylvania. This island is located on Pennsylvania's Susquehanna River, which is south of the state's capital, Harrisburg. Opened in 1974 (Unit 1) and 1978 (Unit 2), the Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station consisted of two separate nuclear power plants, known as \\"units\\". The actual accident occurred in the second unit (TMI-2). On March 28, 1979, a partial nuclear meltdown took place in the TMI-2 reactor at the nuclear power plant. A combination of equipment malfunctions, design-related issues, and operator errors led to coolant being drained from the reactor core, causing it to overheat and, in turn, caused part of its nuclear fuel to melt. This event marked the most severe nuclear accident in U.S. history. Radiation leak was not substantial outside the plant; however, the event resulted in no immediate deaths or injuries. The long-term effects of the incident on the health of the surrounding population also appear to be minimal, but an increase in cancer and infant mortality rates has been claimed, to some extent, by some reports. Nonetheless, there's no consensus among scientific research whether these increases are directly attributable to the accident or simply random variance. The incident led to sweeping changes in how Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) regulates nuclear power plants, changes in emergency response planning, reactor operator training, and more importantly, it turned nuclear power into a major issue in public debates, influencing and shaping legislation and energy policies, transforming the future of nuclear power in the United States."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In 1979, the locomotive was renumbered \\"1881\\", painted black with silver stripes, and leased to a Hollywood company for use in the filming of the horror movie Terror Train (1979), starring Jamie Lee Curtis. In 1980, the locomotive was repainted with a color scheme used by Canadian Pacific in the 1930s. The black, gold, and Tuscan red paint job was popular with railroad enthusiasts and photographers. The number 1293 was also restored to the engine. In February 1982, the headlights, handrails, and cab roof of 1293 were damaged when the roof of a Steamtown storage building gave way to heavy snow.Although the Steamtown Special History Study reasoned that, since this type of locomotive had historically operated in New England, perhaps as far south as Boston, it qualified to be part of the federal government's collection, the Canadian native sat unused for 12 years following the move to Scranton. Ohio Central Railroad System purchased it in 1996, and it underwent a 13-month restoration. As of July 2010, Ohio Central Railroad has lost control of most of its holdings, but former owner, Jerry Joe Jacobson, maintained a collection of vintage equipment including CPR 1293 and her sister, CRP 1278, which is also a veteran of Steamtown, U.S.A. operational locomotives. No. 1293 is still operational as of October 2011.Canadian Pacific Railway No. 1278, like her sister, CPR 1293, was also built by Canadian Locomotive Company in 1948, and is a type 4-6-2, class G5d light-weight \\"Pacific\\" locomotive.

Blount had planned to renumber all three of the series 1200 CRP locomotives in his collection from 1246, 1278, and 1293 to 124, 127 and 129 respectively, but 1278 was the only one of the three that underwent the change. The new number remained on the locomotive from 1966 until 1973, when its former number was restored. The locomotive was leased to the Cadillac and Lake City Railroad in Michigan from 1970 to 1971.

One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \\"child\\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work. When Morley shows Baxter a photograph of the baby (actually a picture of his partner as a child), Baxter notices a resemblance to Holmes and assumes he is the father. To placate him, Morley arranges for Holmes to start dating Patsy. In the process, however, he becomes jealous, having fallen in love without realizing it. Answer:","completion":"The last name of the person who named their fake child Cyrus is Douglas. Patsy Douglas is the one who pretends to have a baby, using a doll, and names the fake child after Cyrus Baxter."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Movie title: Step Brothers Context: 39-year-old Brennan Huff and 40-year-old Dale Doback are men-children still living at home. Brennan lives with his mother, Nancy; and Dale has been living with his father, Robert; the parents meet and fall in love. Robert and Nancy get married, forcing Brennan and Dale to live with each other as step brothers. Brennan and Dale dislike each other, blaming the other for interfering with their lifestyles. Brennan plays Dale's drum set and a brawl on the front lawn ensues. They are grounded for a week and they must find jobs within a month or they will be forced out of the house. When Brennan's younger brother Derek, a helicopter leasing agent, comes to visit with his family, he mocks their unsuccessful lives and being spoiled brats, which entices Dale to punch him in the face. Brennan is awed that Dale stood up to Derek, while Derek's wife Alice finds Dale's courage a turn on, beginning a sexual affair between the two. Brennan and Dale use the incident to discover their shared interests and develop a brotherly friendship. Robert schedules several job interviews for Brennan and Dale, who offend the interviewers with their disrespectful attitudes.

Answer:","completion":"In the movie \\"Step Brothers,\\" Brennan Huff and Dale Doback initially blame each other for interfering with their lifestyles. As both men are used to living with their respective single parents, they view their new step-sibling as an intrusion on their previously comfortable lives. Their resentment for one another leads to confrontations and fights, including Brennan playing Dale's drum set and a physical altercation on the front lawn. However, throughout the film, they realize they share common interests and experiences, leading to the development of a brotherly bond. In a broader sense, Brennan and Dale could also blame their parents' marriage for disrupting their lifestyles. The marriage of Nancy and Robert brings the two adult children together, forcing them to adjust to new living arrangements and eventually prompting their parents to demand that they find jobs and move out of the house. Later in the movie, Brennan and Dale start blaming each other again for their parents' decision to divorce; nonetheless, after some introspection, they realize that they both bear some responsibility for the situation and decide to move on and become mature adults."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Should I validate this answer? A:","completion":"While the suggested answer provides relevant information about Stevie Ray Vaughan's (also known as SRV) musical career, it does not specifically answer the question about his birthdate. Stevie Ray Vaughan was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas. He was an influential American blues guitarist, singer, and songwriter. To provide some context about his musical journey, Stevie Ray Vaughan's passion for music started at an early age, and he eventually formed a band called Triple Threat Revue with vocalist Lou Ann Barton, bassist W.C. Clark, and drummer Fredde Pharoah Walden in 1975. Later, in 1977, the band underwent multiple changes and evolved into Double Trouble, named after the Otis Rush song \\"Double Trouble.\\" With the new band, Vaughan continued to perform around Austin, Texas, and gained widespread recognition as one of the leading musicians in the Texas blues scene. In 1982, Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble were discovered by David Bowie and John Hammond, which led to Vaughan playing guitar on Bowie's album \\"Let's Dance\\" and signing a record deal with Epic Records. In 1983, the band's debut album, \\"Texas Flood,\\" was released, earning them both critical acclaim and commercial success. Tragically, Vaughan passed away in a helicopter crash on August 27, 1990, cutting his promising career short. As a result, while the suggested answer provides a glimpse into Vaughan's career, it is not an accurate validation of the question regarding his birth. To conclude, Stevie Ray Vaughan was born on October 3, 1954, in Dallas, Texas, and that would be the correct answer to the question asked."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Little did we know that we were about to have one of the most amazing dining experiences of our lives! From the moment we stepped inside, everything about [Restaurant Name] screamed quality, comfort, and exceptional service. Our reservation was for 8:00 PM, and we were promptly seated at a cozy, intimate table for two. The atmosphere was warm and inviting, with dimmed lighting and soft background music that created the perfect ambiance for our date night. We were greeted by our server, Jane, who was attentive, knowledgeable, and made excellent recommendations throughout the night. She ensured that our water glasses were always full and that our courses were seamlessly served without delays. The menu was diverse, with a wide array of mouth-watering dishes to choose from. We decided to follow Jane's advice and opted for the chef's tasting menu, which was a delightful choice. We started with a heavenly amuse-bouche consisting of a slice of perfectly seared scallop on a bed of creamy cauliflower pur√©e, topped with microgreens. This immediately set the tone for the impeccable food quality we were about to experience. Next, we sampled an appetizer of fresh, succulent oysters that were beautifully presented with a tangy mignonette sauce, followed by a refreshing, zesty watermelon salad that complemented the oysters perfectly. As we moved on to the entr√©es, we couldn't help but marvel at the expertise and creativity of the chef. Our first entr√©e was a melt-in-your-mouth sous vide beef tenderloin with garlic mashed potatoes and seasonal vegetables, all drizzled with a rich, flavorful demi-glace. The beef was cooked to perfection, with an exquisite, velvety texture that left us craving more. The second entr√©e, a pan-seared Chilean sea bass served atop a bed of creamy risotto and asparagus, was equally divine. The fish was tender and flaky, with a delicate, buttery flavor that simply melted in our mouths. Finally, our meal concluded with a decadent chocolate lava cake that was accompanied by a scoop of homemade vanilla ice cream. The cake was warm, gooey, and bursting with rich, chocolaty goodness, while the ice cream provided a cool, refreshing contrast to the indulgent dessert. In addition to the food, the selection of wines at [Restaurant Name] was impressive, featuring a wide variety of options that catered to different palates and budgets. Our server recommended a medium-bodied pinot noir that paired exquisitely with our meal. Overall, our experience at [Restaurant Name] was truly unforgettable, and it has set the bar exceptionally high for future dining experiences. From the attentive staff and remarkable attention to detail, to the incredible flavors and artful presentation of each dish, we highly recommend [Restaurant Name] to anyone looking for a dining experience that will leave a lasting impression. We will undoubtedly return and can't wait to sample more of the culinary delights that [Restaurant Name] has to offer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Answer this question: who played the baby in babys day out??","completion":"In the 1994 family comedy film \\"Baby's Day Out,\\" directed by Patrick Read Johnson and written by John Hughes, the role of Baby Bink, the movie's central character, was played by twins Adam Robert Worton and Jacob Joseph Worton. Adam and Jacob were born on November 16, 1992, in Newark, Delaware. They were only about a year and a half old when they starred in \\"Baby's Day Out\\" as Baby Bink. Since identical twins were cast to play the role, the filmmakers were able to work around child labor laws, which limit the number of hours a child can work each day. This allowed the film to progress at a smoother pace without overworking a single child actor. \\"Baby's Day Out\\" tells the story of Baby Bink, a wealthy baby who gets kidnapped by three bumbling criminals (played by Joe Mantegna, Joe Pantoliano, and Brian Haley). Throughout the movie, Baby Bink continuously outsmarts his captors and embarks on a thrilling adventure across Chicago, following the story of his favorite book, \\"Baby's Day Out,\\" while the kidnappers, police, and his family attempt to catch up with him. The film did not receive favorable reviews from critics upon its release but has since become a cult classic, particularly loved by younger audiences who were captivated by the resourceful and cute protagonist, Baby Bink. As for the Worton twins, \\"Baby's Day Out\\" remains their most significant contribution to the world of film, and they have since decided to live a life away from the limelight."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In sign of Chinese frustration with North Korea, ‚ÄòDaily Show‚Äô clip mocking Kim racks up 2.8 million Chinese views ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äù is not big in China. But when the popular Chinese Web portal Sina posted an eight-minute segment from the show discussing the latest North Korean provocations, it racked up an astounding 2.8 million views and counting, as well as tens of thousands of comments, many of them praising the show. That appears to make it one of the most-watched ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù clips ever. It also raises questions about whether China‚Äôs flagging support for North Korea might reflect popular sentiment as well as Beijing‚Äôs own geopolitical calculus. On ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äôs‚Äù own Web site, the segment received 102,000 views for its first half and 58,000 for the second. That‚Äôs normally a respectable audience. In ‚ÄúThe Daily Show‚Äôs‚Äù history, only one video on the show‚Äôs official Web site has ever attracted more views: a 2008 segment about Fox News‚Äôs coverage of Sarah Palin and gender issues. The clip pokes fun at a photo of Kim Jong Un that we‚Äôd noted the week before, an apparently photoshopped propaganda image, and at North Korean military technology. It also mocks North Korea‚Äôs over-the-top state media and portrays Kim as an adolescent girl, in a reference to the poster for the 2006 film ‚ÄúLittle Miss Sunshine.‚Äù The clip is full of other references that might not be obvious to a Chinese viewer: South by Southwest, Windows 95. Others, such as a sense of U.S. national fatigue after the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, would seem to better resonate in the American context than the Chinese. China is not mentioned once. In other words, it‚Äôs not the sort of thing you‚Äôd expect to go massively viral in China. So what explains the enormous popularity? The ‚ÄúDaily Show‚Äù segment, without meaning to, may have hit on growing frustration among Chinese citizens, particularly middle-class urbanites, with their misbehaving ally. Chinese state media, though it has allowed some measured disapproval of Kim‚Äôs latest threats, has held back from so roundly mocking the country and its supremely mockable regime. The voraciousness with which Chinese viewers are watching the segment suggests that their appetite for such coverage, for publicly criticizing an ally that has become something of an embarrassment, far exceeds what they‚Äôre getting. China is more than just North Korea‚Äôs most important ally: Kim‚Äôs regime relies economically and politically on Beijing, which provides everything from fuel to international support. But, as the Beijing-based journalist Helen Gao wrote last year, there is a strong feeling of disapproval in China toward its longtime ally, a sense that this ‚Äúungrateful‚Äù country is taking and taking from Beijing and, in return, only embarrassing a China that is very concerned with how it‚Äôs perceived abroad. Chinese President Xi Jinping made some thinly veiled but pointed criticism of North Korea in a speech over the weekend, saying that no single country should be allowed to threaten global stability. Analysts have taken this as a sign that China is showing greater willingness to publicly chastise North Korea and rein in its ally, although they also find no sign that China appears willing to change its overarching strategy of propping up the Kim regime. It‚Äôs the decision makers in Beijing who will ultimately decide policy toward North Korea and who, in some ways, are the people outside of Pyongyang with the most ability to influence how the country behaves. Still, even if they are not directly accountable to their billion-plus citizens, popular attitudes do enter into their calculus. And it certainly appears that a certain class of the Chinese public could be even more upset with Kim, and even more willing to move away from North Korea, than even Xi did in his speech. Given how deeply Kim relies on China, he should be worried.

It was seen 2.8 million times by Chinese people and had many comments about how funny it was. This shows that some people in China are not happy with North Korea and are making fun of its leader. Chinese leaders have also been criticizing North Korea lately, but they still support it. However, the people's feelings matter, and the leader of North Korea should be worried that many people in China don't like him."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A 1968 single by Toots and the Maytals \\"Do the Reggay\\" was the first popular song to use the word \\"reggae,\\" effectively naming the genre and introducing it to a global audience. While sometimes used in a broad sense to refer to most types of popular Jamaican dance music, the term \\"reggae\\" more properly denotes a particular music style that was strongly influenced by traditional mento as well as American jazz and rhythm and blues, especially the New Orleans R&B practiced by Fats Domino and Allen Toussaint, and evolved out of the earlier genres ska and rocksteady. Reggae usually relates news, social gossip, and political comment. Reggae spread into a commercialized jazz field, being known first as Rudie Blues, then Ska, later Blue Beat, and Rock Steady. It is instantly recognizable from the counterpoint between the bass and drum downbeat, and the offbeat rhythm section. The immediate origins of reggae were in ska and rock steady; from the latter, reggae took over the use of the bass as a percussion instrument.
