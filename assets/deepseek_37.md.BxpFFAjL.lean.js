Article: If the rose can be said to be a special flower, then the apple can be said to be a special fruit. It is very important in American culture. American stories speak of Johnny Appleseed, who went throughout America collecting apple seeds and planting apple trees. He had a great love for nature and went through fields and farms adding richness and beauty to the country. One of the first sayings taught to school children is, \\"An apple a day keeps the doctor away.\\" This short saying encourages children to eat fresh fruit to keep healthy. If someone always says good words to a person, people will call him an _ . This, however, is not a good name. If someone is very dear to us, we say that he or she is the \\"apple of our eye\\". Most people believe that the fruit which Eve gave to Adam was an apple, even though the Bible never says so. The apple, therefore, is a deep part of the language and stories of America. An apple is also delicious. Apples can be cooked in many ways, used as a dessert , and made into sweet juice. In many parts of the country during the harvest season, a popular activity is to go into an apple garden to pick apples. Washington, D. C. and New York are both famous for their apples. Finally, when it's time to take a vacation to American cities, one can always visit New York, which is \\"the biggest apple\\" of all the American cities.

Movie title: Friday the 13th Part VII: The New Blood Movie plot: As a young child, Tina Shepard witnesses her alcoholic father physically abusing her mother. The emotional trauma unlocks Tina's previously latent telekinetic powers, which result in her father's death at the bottom of Crystal Lake. Ten years later, Tina, now a teenager, is still struggling with the guilt surrounding the death of her father. Tina's mother, Amanda, takes her to the same lakeside residence so that her powers can be studied (and unknowingly exploited) by her psychiatrist, Dr. Crews. Dr. Crews begins a series of experiments (verbal assaults) designed to agitate Tina's mental state, forcing her powers to become more pronounced. After a particularly upsetting session with Dr. Crews, Tina runs from the cabin and to the dock thinking about her father's death. While thinking about him, she wishes he would come back. Instead, Tina's psychic powers breaks the chain around the neck of Jason Voorhees, the undead Crystal Lake serial killer. Tina's torment from her powers is increased as Jason emerges from the lake and his reign of terror descends on the area once again. Next door to the Shepard residence is a group of teens who are throwing a birthday party for their friend Michael: preppy Russell and his girlfriend Sandra, Ben and his girlfriend Kate, science fiction writer Eddie, stoner David, perky Robin, shy Maddie, and snobby socialite Melissa. Michael's cousin Nick, who has arrived just for the party takes a liking to Tina, much to the jealousy of Melissa, who bullies Tina. Tina tells Nick about Jason and has a vision of Jason murdering Michael. Meanwhile, Jason kills Michael in real life, along with Jane, and later kills another couple camping in the woods. While Tina goes off to find her mother and Nick goes with her, Jason proceeds to kill the other teens. Russell is killed with a hatchet to the face, and Sandra is pulled underwater while she is skinny-dipping. Jason stalks Maddie and kills her in the barn with a scythe, and then crushes Ben's skull with his bare hands before shoving a party horn... The answer is:","completion":"Tina runs from the cabin due to the emotional turmoil and distress caused by Dr. Crews' experiments (verbal assaults) that were designed to agitate her mental state and force her telekinetic powers to become more pronounced. The sessions with Dr. Crews were causing Tina immense emotional pain, and in a moment of desperation to escape this torment, she fled the cabin and went to the dock. This escape to the dock leads her to think about her father's death and triggers a series of events that result in her accidental resurrection of Jason Voorhees instead of her father. As Jason emerges from the lake and starts his killing spree, Tina becomes more distraught about the consequences of her actions, further complicating her reasons for fleeing the cabin initially. In summary, Tina runs from the cabin due to the emotional stress caused by Dr. Crews' experiments and an attempt to escape her past and current pain. This triggers a series of unintended consequences that lead to the resurrection of Jason Voorhees and the subsequent violence and deaths in the movie."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Article: Whenever you wish to find the derivative of the square root of a variable or a function, you can apply a simple pattern. The derivative will always be the derivative of the radicand, divided by double the original square root. Symbolically, this can be shown as: If f(x)=u{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {u}}}, then f′(x)=u′2u{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {u^{prime }}{2{sqrt {u}}}}} The radicand is the term or function underneath the square root sign. To apply this shortcut, find the derivative of the radicand alone. Consider the following examples: In the function 5x+2{displaystyle {sqrt {5x+2}}}, the radicand is (5x+2){displaystyle (5x+2)}. Its derivative is 5{displaystyle 5}. In the function 3x4{displaystyle {sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, the radicand is 3x4{displaystyle 3x^{4}}. Its derivative is 12x3{displaystyle 12x^{3}}. In the function sin(x){displaystyle {sqrt {sin(x)}}}, the radicand is sin⁡(x){displaystyle sin(x)}. Its derivative is cos⁡(x){displaystyle cos(x)}. The derivative of a radical function will involve a fraction. The numerator of this fraction is the derivative of the radicand. Thus, for the sample functions above, the first part of the derivative will be as follows: If f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=5denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {5}{text{denom}}}} If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x3denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {12x^{3}}{text{denom}}}} If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)denom{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {cos(x)}{text{denom}}}} Using this shortcut, the denominator will be two times the original square root function. Thus, for the three sample functions above, the denominators of the derivatives will be: For f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=num25x+2{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {5x+2}}}}} If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=num23x4{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}} If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=num2sin⁡(x){displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {text{num}}{2{sqrt {sin(x)}}}}} Put the two halves of the fraction together, and the result will be the derivative of the original function. For f(x)=5x+2{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {5x+2}}}, then f′(x)=525x+2{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {5}{2{sqrt {5x+2}}}}} If f(x)=3x4{displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {3x^{4}}}}, then f′(x)=12x323x4{displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {12x^{3}}{2{sqrt {3x^{4}}}}}} If f(x)=sin⁡(x){displaystyle f(x)={sqrt {sin(x)}}}, then f′(x)=cos⁡(x)2sin⁡(x){displaystyle f^{prime }(x)={frac {cos(x)}{2{sqrt {sin(x)}}}}} What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of a longer text or information.

Context: Zinc deficiency is crop plants' most common micronutrient deficiency; it is particularly common in high-pH soils. Zinc-deficient soil is cultivated in the cropland of about half of Turkey and India, a third of China, and most of Western Australia, and substantial responses to zinc fertilization have been reported in these areas. Plants that grow in soils that are zinc-deficient are more susceptible to disease. Zinc is primarily added to the soil through the weathering of rocks, but humans have added zinc through fossil fuel combustion, mine waste, phosphate fertilizers, pesticide (zinc phosphide), limestone, manure, sewage sludge, and particles from galvanized surfaces.

Question: Given the below context: Massenet was a fluent and skilful orchestrator, and willingly provided ballet episodes for his operas, incidental music for plays, and a one-act stand-alone ballet for Vienna (Le carillon, 1892). Macdonald remarks that Massenet's orchestral style resembled that of Delibes, \\"with its graceful movement and bewitching colour\\", which was highly suited to classical French ballet. The Méditation for solo violin and orchestra, from Thaïs, is possibly the best known non-vocal piece by Massenet, and appears on many recordings. Another popular stand-alone orchestral piece from the operas is Le dernier sommeil de la Vierge from La Vierge, which has featured on numerous discs since the middle of the 20th century.A Parisian critic, after seeing La grand' tante, declared that Massenet was a symphonist rather than a theatre composer. At the time of the British premiere of Manon in 1885, the critic in The Manchester Guardian, reviewing the work enthusiastically, nevertheless echoed his French confrère's view that the composer was really a symphonist, whose music was at its best when purely orchestral. Massenet took a wholly opposite view of his talents. He was temperamentally unsuited to writing symphonically: the constraints of sonata form bored him. He wrote, in the early 1870s, \\"What I have to say, musically, I have to say rapidly, forcefully, concisely; my discourse is tight and nervous, and if I wanted to express myself otherwise I would not be myself.\\" His efforts in the concertante field made little mark, but his orchestral suites, colourful and picturesque according to Grove, have survived on the fringes of the repertoire. Other works for orchestra are a symphonic poem, Visions (1891), an Ouverture de Concert (1863) and Ouverture de Phèdre (1873). After early attempts at chamber music as a student, he wrote little more in the genre. Most of his early chamber pieces are now lost; three pieces for cello and piano survive.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Information: - Niobium, formerly columbium, is a chemical element with symbol Nb (formerly Cb) and atomic number 41. It is a soft, grey, ductile transition metal, which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral, the main commercial source for niobium, and columbite. The name comes from Greek mythology: \\"Niobe\\", daughter of \\"Tantalus\\" since it is so similar to tantalum. - Stibnite, sometimes called antimonite, is a sulfide mineral with the formula SbS. This soft grey material crystallizes in an orthorhombic space group. It is the most important source for the metalloid antimony. The name is from the Greek \\"stibi\\" through the Latin \\"stibium\\" as the old name for the mineral and the element antimony. - Pyrochlore (Na,Ca)NbO(OH,F) is a mineral group of the niobium end member (pyrochlore supergroup). - A metalloid is any chemical element which has properties in between those of metals and nonmetals, or that has a mixture of them. There is neither a standard definition of a metalloid nor complete agreement on the elements appropriately classified as such. Despite the lack of specificity, the term remains in use in the literature of chemistry. - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - A mineral is a naturally occurring chemical compound, usually of crystalline form and abiogenic in origin. A mineral has one specific chemical composition, whereas a rock can be an aggregate of different minerals or mineraloids. The study of minerals is called mineralogy. - Antimony is a chemical element with symbol Sb (from ) and atomic number 51. A lustrous gray metalloid, it is found in nature mainly as the sulfide mineral stibnite (SbS). Antimony compounds have been known since ancient times and were powdered for use as medicine and cosmetics, often known by the Arabic name, kohl. Metallic antimony was also known, but it was erroneously identified as lead upon its discovery. In the West, it was first isolated by Vannoccio Biringuccio and described in 1540. - Vannoccio Biringuccio, sometimes spelt Vannocio Biringuccio (c. 1480 c. 1539), was an Italian metallurgist. He is best known for his manual on metalworking, \\"De la pirotechnia\\", published posthumously in 1540. Biringuccio is considered by some as the father of the foundry industry as \\"De la pirotechnia\\" is the first printed account of proper foundry practice. It also gives details of mining practice, the extraction and refining of numerous metals, alloys such as brass, and compounds used in foundries and explosives. It preceded the printing of \\"De re metallica\\" by Georgius Agricola by 14 years. - In chemistry and physics, the atomic number of a chemical element (also known as its proton number) is the number of protons found in the nucleus of an atom of that element, and therefore identical to the charge number of the nucleus. It is conventionally represented by the symbol Z. The atomic number uniquely identifies a chemical element. In an uncharged atom, the atomic number is also equal to the number of electrons. - A chemical element or element is a species of atoms having the same number of protons in their atomic nuclei (i.e. the same atomic number, \\"Z\\"). There are 118 elements that have been identified, of which the first 94 occur naturally on Earth with the remaining 24 being synthetic elements. There are 80 elements that have at least one stable isotope and 38 that have exclusively radioactive isotopes, which decay over time into other elements. Iron is the most abundant element (by mass) making up Earth, while oxygen is the most common element in the Earth's crust. - Stibiconite is an antimony oxide mineral with formula : Sb3O6 ( OH ) . Its name originates from Greek \`\` stibi '' ( antimony ) and \`\` konis '' ( powder ) , alluding to its composition and habit . It is a member of the pyrochlore super group . What is the relationship between 'stibiconite' and 'pyrochlore supergroup'? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Stibiconite (Sb3O6(OH)) is a mineral that belongs to the pyrochlore supergroup. The pyrochlore supergroup is a large and diverse group of minerals, characterized by their complex crystal structures, which are primarily composed of A-site and B-site cations, along with oxygen or hydroxide anions. In the case of stibiconite, antimony (Sb) is the primary B-site cation present in the complex structure. The relationship between stibiconite and the pyrochlore supergroup lies in their crystal structure and chemical composition. Both stibiconite and the pyrochlore group of minerals share the general formula A2B2O6(O, OH, F), with variations in A and B cations giving rise to a wide range of mineral compositions. The incorporation of antimony (Sb) into the crystal structure is a notable characteristic of stibiconite, which sets it apart from other minerals in the pyrochlore supergroup. Furthermore, the pyrochlore supergroup is known for its diverse range of physical and chemical properties, arising from the different arrangement of ions within the crystal structure. In stibiconite, this results in a mineral characterized by its antimony oxide composition, distinctive from other minerals in the group. In summary, stibiconite is a member of the pyrochlore supergroup, which shares the same complex crystal structure and general chemical composition with other minerals in the supergroup. The relationship between stibiconite and the pyrochlore supergroup highlights the diversity within the group, with stibiconite exhibiting its unique properties due to the presence of antimony in its structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

ATLANTA, Georgia (CNN) -- The Atlanta Falcons have \\"relinquished their contractual rights\\" to Michael Vick, one of the highest-paid players in professional sports before his conviction on dogfighting charges, the Falcons manager said Friday. Michael Vick will be confined to this Hampton, Virginia, house for the rest of his sentence. In a statement posted on the football team's Web site, General Manager Thomas Dimitroff said, \\"Michael remains suspended by the NFL [National Football League]. However, in the event NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell decides to reinstate Michael, we feel his best opportunity to re-engage his football career would be at another club. The quarterback was drafted by the","completion":"Atlanta Falcons in 2001 as the first overall pick and quickly emerged as one of the most talented and dynamic players in the league. With his electrifying style of play, Vick became a cultural icon and earned millions in endorsements. However, his dogfighting scandal tarnished his reputation and resulted in a 23-month federal prison sentence, as well as an indefinite suspension from the NFL. After serving his time and demonstrating remorse for his actions, Vick was eventually reinstated by Commissioner Goodell in 2009. The Philadelphia Eagles signed Vick to a one-year contract with an option for a second year, knowing the risk of public backlash but also recognizing his potential to positively contribute both on and off the field. Michael Vick demonstrated significant progress during his time with the Eagles, becoming an advocate for animal rights and working to rehabilitate his image. Vick continued to strive for redemption, as he played with the New York Jets, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and served as a coaching intern with the Kansas City Chiefs in 2017. In each of these teams, Vick tried to impart his experiences and lessons learned from his past mistakes to help mentor and guide younger players. His competitive spirit and desire to prove himself were evident, and he continued to display impressive skills, though they were not as dominant as they were during his prime with the Falcons. Throughout his career, Vick faced many challenges including injuries, legal issues, and public scrutiny. He faced his mistakes head-on and worked hard to atone for them and become a better person. Upon retiring from the NFL in 2017, Vick continued to stay involved in football, working with networks like Fox as an analyst and engaging in community outreach programs. In conclusion, Michael Vick's journey after his conviction on dogfighting charges showcases the possibility of redemption and second chances in both a professional capacity and personal growth. His career after being released by the Atlanta Falcons demonstrated that opportunities can still present themselves for individuals willing to accept responsibility for their past actions and work diligently to correct their mistakes. Although he may never be able to erase the stigma attached to his name, Vick earned the respect of many by continuing to fight for a better future for himself and those he impacted with his actions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Since then, they have suffered from strong competition from specialist stores. Most recently the competition has intensified with the advent of larger-scale superstores (Jones et al. 1994; Merrilees and Miller 1997). Competition was not the only reason for the department stores' weakening strength; the changing structure of cities also affected them. The compact and centralized 19th century city with its mass transit lines converging on the downtown was a perfect environment for department store growth. But as residents moved out of the downtown areas to the suburbs, the large, downtown department stores became inconvenient and lost business to the newer suburban shopping malls.

The first question, \\"How will I improve my spoken English?\\" seems to seek advice on ways to enhance one's English speaking skills. In contrast, the second question, \\"How do I speak Fluent English?\\" appears to focus more on achieving fluency, or the ability to speak the language smoothly and effortlessly. Therefore, while the questions are related, they are not exactly the same. Now, let us address each question with a detailed and long answer. 1. How to improve your spoken English: Improving your spoken English involves practicing regularly, increasing your vocabulary, and working on pronunciation and grammar skills. Here are some recommended strategies: a. Practicing speaking: Engage in conversations with native speakers or join English-speaking groups where you can practice speaking the language. Listening is equally important for improving your speaking – watch English movies, listen to podcasts, and practice imitating the accents and speaking styles. b. Expanding vocabulary: Learn new words every day and practice using them in sentences. You can maintain a journal to keep track of your progress. Reading articles, books, or watching English movies and shows can also help you discover new words and phrases. c. Improving pronunciation: Pronunciation plays a vital role in spoken English. There are online resources and videos that demonstrate the correct pronunciation of words. You can use these resources to perfect your pronunciation, or even use a voice recording app to monitor your progress. d. Working on grammar: To improve spoken English, it is essential to have a solid understanding of grammar. Take some time to study different grammatical concepts and practice applying them when speaking. e. Seeking feedback: Have your conversations assessed by a native speaker or a language expert to identify areas of improvement. This way, you can work specifically on those areas and continually enhance your language skills. 2. How to speak fluent English: Fluency in spoken English requires mastering elements such as vocabulary, grammar, and flow. To achieve fluency, consider the following tips: a. Think in English: To speak fluently, you need to train your brain to process information in English. Practice thinking in English before expressing your thoughts, which will eventually help you form your ideas and sentences more accurately and efficiently. b. Develop confidence: Fear of making mistakes may hinder your fluency. Be confident and don't be afraid to make errors, as it's a part of the learning process.

Answer:","completion":"A physical change is a process in which the substance undergoes a transformation without altering its chemical composition, while a chemical change involves the formation or breaking of chemical bonds, leading to the formation of a new substance with a different chemical composition. An example of a physical change but not a chemical change is the melting of ice into water. In this process, the ice (solid-state) absorbs heat from its surroundings and undergoes a phase transition from a solid state to a liquid state, turning into water. The molecules of water in the solid state are arranged in a rigid lattice structure, held together by hydrogen bonds. As energy is absorbed, these hydrogen bonds are weakened, and the molecules gain sufficient energy to break free from the lattice structure and move more freely, transitioning from the solid state to the liquid state. It is important to note that the chemical composition of the substance does not change during this process. The chemical formula for both the ice and the water remains H2O, and no new molecules or bonds are formed or broken during the melting process. This is why the melting of ice is an example of a physical change but not a chemical change. The substance undergoing the transformation maintains its chemical identity throughout the process, and the change is only evident in its physical properties, such as its state of matter, appearance, and temperature. Other examples of physical changes include the boiling of water into steam, the cracking of a glass, or the dissolution of salt or sugar in water. In each of these cases, the substance may appear different or exhibit different properties, but its chemical composition remains unchanged during the process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: Witnesses said the rocket was only briefly visible before making its way into the clouds. The launch was made from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida. The rocket booster successfully landed on the ground nine minutes after taking off. The touchdown is part of the company's strategy of returning rockets to earth so they can be reused rather than jettisoning them in the ocean after a single launch. Moments after the rocket landed, the SpaceX Dragon supply ship successfully reached orbit, prompting cheers inside the SpaceX Mission Control room. The Dragon is now making its way to the International Space Station, and is expected to arrive on Wednesday. On 14 January SpaceX resumed flights by launching a Falcon 9 vehicle from the Vandenberg Air Force Base on the California coast. It was the first mission by the company since one of its vehicles exploded on the launch pad in September. Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX, wants his company to be at the forefront of the race involving several companies to deploy satellite-based internet services over the next few years. The company also has a long queue of customers all waiting for a ride to orbit - including America's civil space agency (Nasa), the US military and multiple outfits in the commercial sector.

(KBAK/KBFX) — A banquet room at The Mark Restaurant was filled with guests having dinner when patrons and workers alike noticed someone in distress. \\"Next thing you know, my server J.R. hears, 'She's choking! She's choking!'\\" described Bo Fernandez, restaurant general manager and executive chef. Former Kern County Supervisor Pauline Larwood, along with her husband Tom, had joined others Monday at the downtown spot for dinner after having attended a symposium on valley fever. Larwood began choking on a piece of steak. \\"Somebody tried to give her the Heimlich maneuver, and they weren't big enough,\\" said Fernandez. Restaurant supervisor J.R. Gonzalez also tried to help, but to no avail. Fortunately for Larwood, there were numerous doctors in the house because of the Valley Fever Symposium. Among the diners was Dr. Royce Johnson, chief of infectious diseases at Kern Medical Center. Johnson sprang into action to perform an emergency tracheotomy with makeshift tools he had at his disposal. \\"The doctor said, 'Let's put her on the ground,'\\" Fernandez described, \\"and he made an incision with a knife.\\" Fernandez motioned how the doctor inserted the knife to Larwood's throat area. Johnson then inserted the hollow cylinder of a pen to act as a breathing tube, according to Fernandez. \\"It took a little bit, but finally their gasp comes,\\" he said. Also helping out during the procedure were Dr. Tom Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Paul Krogstad, who were participants at the Valley Fever Symposium, according to The Bakersfield Californian. Larwood is recovering at a local hospital. ||||| The dramatic incident took place at a restaurant where top officials had gathered after leaving the landmark symposium on valley fever held in Bakersfield on Monday and Tuesday. Some of the nation’s most accomplished physicians were in the room. A local doctor is being hailed as a hero after he used a folding pocket knife and pen to perform an emergency tracheotomy on a former Kern County supervisor at a downtown Bakersfield restaurant Monday night. Pauline Larwood, who was Kern County’s first female supervisor and currently serves as a community college trustee, was eating dinner at The Mark restaurant with some of the doctors, experts, politicians and others in town for the symposium when she began choking. After the Heimlich maneuver failed to open Larwood’s airway, witnesses said, Dr. Royce Johnson, professor of medicine at UCLA and Kern Medical Center’s chief of infectious diseases, used a friend’s knife to make an incision in Larwood’s throat to allow the insertion of the hollow cylinder of a pen as a breathing tube. The procedure succeeded and Larwood was rushed to Mercy Hospital Downtown. By Tuesday, her son said, she was doing fine. Johnson had appeared onstage Monday at the valley fever conference with Dr. Thomas Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health. The CDC chief monitored Larwood’s pulse during the incident. Collins was also present at the dinner. Following a forum and survivors reception, about 55 people dined together in the downtown restaurant’s banquet room, including farming and business moguls Lynda and Stewart Resnick, and Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Bakersfield, said The Mark’s General Manager Ro Fernandez. At least two members of McCarthy’s security detail were also present. The entrees had just been served — steak, chicken or salmon — but Fernandez said he wasn’t sure which dish Larwood had chosen. Assemblywoman Shannon Grove, R-Bakersfield, said she was seated at a table with the Larwoods when the incident occurred. She said her husband, Rick Grove, and state Sen. Jean Fuller, R-Bakersfield, were seated on the other side of the table. Grove said her husband suddenly jumped up, ran to Pauline Larwood and tried to perform the Heimlich maneuver. He called for a doctor and Johnson attempted the technique as well. “She had already started turning a real like blue, her fingers and her lips,” Grove said. As Grove called 911, she watched in amazement as Larwood was laid back in a chair and Johnson began performing the emergency procedure. “He didn’t scream; he just said, ‘I need a knife,’” Grove said. Grove called Johnson a hero. “It was really unreal how calm (the situation) was,” she said. The folding knife Johnson used came from Dr. Thomas Farrell Jr., a retired physician and friend of Johnson’s, who said he always carries the knife. Farrell said Larwood’s skin turned blue and she lost consciousness. Her teeth were clenched so tightly he could not work to clear the blockage. As several physicians gathered around Larwood, Dr. Paul Krogstad, a professor of pediatrics and pharmacology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said someone called for a pen, and when one was handed to him, he broke it in half and placed it in the incision Johnson had made. “I was sort of looking at her breathing, Royce is blowing into this tracheotomy that he performed and the CDC director (Frieden) is checking her pulse,” Krogstad said. “She came around.” \\"She was fortunate that somebody as bold as Dr. Johnson jumped in,” he added. “By the time I got there, he already had a plan going and Dr. Frieden and I just assisted.\\" Nevertheless, the doctors worked as a team. Frieden called out that Larwood did not need chest compressions and that she had a good pulse, Krogstad recalled. “I've never seen that done in public before but it made good sense,” Krogstad said of the tracheotomy. It was ”a pretty drastic measure,” he added, but “everyone knew what they were doing.” Before the ambulance even arrived, Larwood was sitting up, talking and fully conscious, Krogstad said. “She pinked up, her skin looked good pretty quickly,” said David Larwood, Tom and Pauline Larwood's son. Throughout the incident, Tom Larwood remained absolutely calm. Johnson declined to comment. David Larwood said his mother was taken to Mercy Hospital, where she stayed overnight. He said his father was with her Tuesday and she would probably be able to go home later that day. Larwood, 71, served on the Kern County Board of Supervisors from 1983 to 1994. She currently serves on the Kern Community College District’s board of trustees, another elected position. Meanwhile, on Tuesday, Fernandez complimented McCarthy’s security detail for keeping people calm and allowing rescuers to do what they needed to do. The crisis and the arrival of an ambulance brought an early end to the evening, Fernandez said. But everyone was relieved that Larwood appeared to be OK. “It must have been quite an evening for all of them,” he said. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"In a restaurant, there was a woman named Pauline Larwood who started choking on a piece of steak.

Sean Spicer, arguably the world’s most famous White House press secretary, is developing a talk show with the tentative title of “Sean Spicer’s Common Ground,” in which the former spokesman for President Trump interviews notable people in an informal setting. A pitch sheet for the show’s pilot, obtained by The New York Times, describes Mr. Spicer hosting “some of the most interesting and thoughtful public figures for a drink and some lite conversation at a local pub or cafe.” “The relaxed atmosphere is an ideal setting for Sean to get to know his guests as they discuss everything from the media to marriage,” the pitch continues. “They might even tangle over the merits of making your bed or the value of a great point guard.” No network is attached to the project, but the pilot episode, to be filmed in July, is backed by heavy hitters in the realm of unscripted television. Debmar-Mercury, the syndicator of daytime series including “The Wendy Williams Show” and “Family Feud,” is co-producing with Pilgrim Media Group, which has developed basic-cable staples like “American Chopper.” ||||| Sean Spicer may be entering the TV business. President Donald Trump's former spokesman is teaming with Lionsgate-owned Debmar-Mercury (The Wendy Williams Show) and Pilgrim Media Group (American Chopper) to develop a talk show called Sean Spicer's Common Ground, sources confirmed to The Hollywood Reporter. The potential series — a network is not yet attached — would see Spicer interviewing notable people in an informal setting, according to The New York Times, which first reported the news. The Times, which acquired a pitch sheet for a potential pilot for the series, reported that the show would feature Spicer hosting public figures for a drink and light conversation at a local pub or cafe.

The car would not fit inside of the garage despite numerous attempts because the","completion":"dimensions of the car exceeded the space available in the garage. In order to resolve this issue, several steps had to be taken. Step 1: Analyze the Problem First, it was essential to accurately measure the dimensions of both the car and the garage. It was discovered that the car's length and width exceeded the garage's dimensions, leaving no room for proper maneuvering. Since it was apparent that the car could not be physically altered to fit, the solution had to focus on modifying the garage or finding an alternative storage solution. Step 2: Research Potential Solutions Two main potential solutions were identified in this step: either increasing the size of the garage or elevating the car horizontally and using the available vertical space. Option A: Increasing the size of the garage This approach involved finding a contractor to expand the internal space of the garage, which would enable the car to be parked inside easily. It would require obtaining the necessary permits or approvals, as well as choosing the right construction materials. Option B: Elevating the car horizontally Another possibility was to employ a car lift system that could elevate the car above the ground, allowing for additional storage space beneath it. This solution would utilize the available vertical space within the garage, while still permitting the car to be stored inside, and could be a more budget-friendly option compared to expanding the garage. Step 3: Evaluate and Choose a Solution After considering the pros and cons of both options, it was decided that the most feasible and cost-effective solution was Option B - installing a car lift system. This choice was based on the fact that it did not require any alterations to the garage structure, and no permits or approvals were needed. Additionally, this solution would not only accommodate the current car but could also be helpful if the owner decided to acquire larger vehicles in the future. Step 4: Implement the Chosen Solution After consulting with a local supplier, a suitable car lift system was selected and installed in the garage. The system was properly tested to ensure it could adequately support the weight of the car and function correctly. Following the installation, the owner was able to store the car in the garage by elevating it horizontally, fully utilizing the vertical space available. By following these steps and taking a methodical approach to the problem, a feasible and efficient solution was identified and implemented, resulting in a garage that could finally accommodate the oversized car."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Question: suppose humans build more factories and plants happens, how will it affect MORE damage by acid rain. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"more effect. Here's my justification: The situation described above suggests a cause-effect relationship of industrial activities causing acid rain, which subsequently harms natural and man-made objects. Step 1: The increased establishment of factories and plants (if supposed perturbation refers to an increase in industrial activities) would likely lead to a corresponding increase in the production of chemical compounds (assuming these factories are of the kind that produce these compounds). Step 2: These additional chemical compounds would then rise into the air (following the process described). Step 3: The additional airborne chemical compounds would mix with elements in clouds, creating more instances of the chemical reactions that result in acid rain. Step 4: More of this 'affected rain' (i.e. acid rain) would fall to the earth. Step 5: Given the described harmful effects of this acid rain, we can infer an increase in the amount of rain would consequently lead to more harm to natural and man-made objects. Hence, there would be more damage by acid rain. The influence on the second effect mentioned - 'The affected rain can harm natural and man-made objects because of its acidic content'- would be greater (more effect) because of the increased industrial activities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sports; (3). Business; (4). Science/Tech;","completion":"(2). Sports This passage is clearly related to the sports category, as it discusses a specific match in a soccer competition. The UEFA (Union of European Football Associations) Cup is a prestigious club soccer competition held in Europe. Group A represents one of the initial stages of the tournament, where clubs are competing not only for points but also for a chance to move on to the final knockout stages. The match result, Feyenoord's 2-1 victory over Schalke, is notable as it secured their place in those advanced stages of the competition. To provide more context and detail, the UEFA Cup (now known as the UEFA Europa League) is an annual soccer competition contested by European club soccer teams. It is the second most prestigious tournament in Europe after the UEFA Champions League. The format of the competition includes a group stage composed of multiple groups with multiple teams in each group. Each team in the group plays each other in a round-robin format, in which they gather points based on wins, losses, and draws. Feyenoord and Schalke are both well-known soccer clubs in Europe with a rich history. Feyenoord is a Dutch club founded in 1908 and based in Rotterdam, the Netherlands. They have a long tradition of success, both domestically in the Eredivisie, which is the Netherlands' top soccer division, and internationally in the European competitions. Schalke, on the other hand, is a German club founded in 1904 and hailing from Gelsenkirchen. The club has also enjoyed domestic success in the Bundesliga, Germany's top soccer division, as well as international recognition. In the match mentioned in the initial passage, Feyenoord managed to secure a victory against Schalke at their home ground. This win was crucial for Feyenoord, as it assured their progression to the final knockout stages of the UEFA Cup, where the competition switches to a home-and-away elimination format. The knockout stages often feature high-stakes and intense matches between top European clubs as they vie for the opportunity to advance to the final of the tournament. This snippet of information is relevant and of interest for soccer enthusiasts and sports fans, as it provides a glimpse of the ongoing club soccer competition and the journey of respective teams in their quest for European glory. Furthermore, it aligns well with the sports category since it focuses on club soccer and the progress of these two well-known European clubs in the UEFA Cup."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write some highlights for the following article: If it is still true that a strong Yorkshire makes for a strong England then Alastair Cook can look forward to a golden era, with the White Rose at the forefront of both the international game and the chase for domestic honours. Yorkshire’s march towards the county championship title, which can be confirmed if they avoid defeat against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge this week, could be the start of something big at Headingley and beyond. Not only are Yorkshire on the verge of clinching the greatest prize in the domestic game but they are doing it with a squad crammed with potential England players and an academy bulging with many more top prospects. Champions elect: Jason Gillespie's Yorkshire could clinch the title this week. At the forefront of Yorkshire’s rise towards their first title in 13 years is an ex-Australian Test bowler who has made it his mission to provide the old enemy with as many aspiring internationals as possible. What’s more, Jason Gillespie is making sure that a county once known for their divisive internal politics have a smile on their face as they march forward with young players very much to the fore. ‘Since I’ve been at the club all I’ve done is tell the lads to back themselves and play the brand of cricket we want to play,’ said Gillespie ahead of Tuesday’s showdown with their biggest rivals for the county title. ‘Be positive, go out with a smile and enjoy the game. ‘I coach because I love cricket and I love helping lads achieve their dreams. And spectators come and watch because they love the game too. For me it’s all about enjoyment. If you’re not enjoying it why are you doing it?’ Homegrown: Sheffield-born Joe Root has gone on to be a key player for England. All-rounder: Gary Ballance is another player from the county to break into the international set-up. It is an ethos that has seen Yorkshire achieve that elusive balance of competing for trophies while recognising their duty to give opportunities to young English players. Joe Root, Gary Ballance and Liam Plunkett, rejuvenated after his move from Durham, have all played for England this season while openers Adam Lyth and Alex Lees and leg-spinning all-rounder Adil Rashid head the queue of those who could join them. Jonathan Bairstow, meanwhile, has recovered from a nightmare winter in Australia to provide hope that he too could once again represent his country. And this summer’s England Under 19 team included five Yorkshiremen. ‘We’re always keen to give our young lads a crack as often as possible,’ said Gillespie, who is quick to credit the role of director of cricket Martyn Moxon and his support staff for Yorkshire’s rise. ‘I’m a big believer in if they’re good enough they’re old enough. I like to drip feed the young lads into first-team cricket. Prospect: Opener Adam Lyth has become a key player for Yorkshire. ‘As a county we do have a duty to produce as many players for England as we can. At the same time this county is ambitious and wants to win trophies, absolutely. So it’s finding that balance. All counties want to win but we all have to look at the bigger picture.’ The bigger picture for Gillespie is trying to ensure that the likes of Lyth, Rashid and Lees, considered by England to be the best prospect of the lot, join Root and Ballance in competing for the Ashes next summer. Surely that would provide divided loyalties? ‘No question I’d be proud if these guys line up against the Aussies next year,’ said a man who took 259 Test wickets for Australia and hit a Test double hundred. ‘First and foremost I’m the coach of Yorkshire and part of my job is to help my players represent England. I’ll be absolutely chuffed if they are there and I’ll be supporting them. ‘Don’t get me wrong, I love my country and that will never change. Last time in the Ashes there were a few Yorkies playing and I was really hoping they’d do well as well as wanting my country to do well. It can be a tough one but my priority is seeing Yorkshire players succeed.’ Front foot: Youngster Alex Lees has piled on the runs in 2014. Comeback: Spin king Adil Rashid could return to the England set-up for the first time in five years. Yorkshire’s biggest problem may be keeping hold of their 39-year-old coach. Gillespie has already been sounded out by Darren Lehmann for a role within Australia’s set-up, without success, while Michael Vaughan, for one, believes he could be the next England coach. For now Gillespie is very happy as an adopted Yorkshireman and his wife and four children are settled in Leeds. ‘It’s a fantastic job, a dream job, at a big club with lots of challenges,’ he said. ‘I like to think I’ve got a good rapport with everyone I work with and I love working with this group of lads. ‘I’ll never quite get the accent but my kids are all talking like Yorkshiremen. My four-year-old boy just sounds like one and my older two have both got the twang. There’s no hope of my two-year-old daughter having an Aussie accent whatsoever! ‘Look, we’re very happy here and I feel I owe the club. They took a bit of a punt on me. I’d done some coaching in Zimbabwe but my CV wasn’t strong and I’m thankful for the opportunity to repay their faith. I just want to help them achieve their goals.’ Victory over Notts this week would be the perfect start.","completion":"Yorkshire's cricket team is close to winning the county championship title, and their success is thanks to a talented group of young players and the guidance of their coach, Jason Gillespie. He encourages the players to enjoy the game and helps them achieve their dreams. Some of Yorkshire's players, like Joe Root, Gary Ballance, and Liam Plunkett, have already played for the England team, and others like Adam Lyth, Alex Lees, and Adil Rashid are close to joining them. Yorkshire's focus is on developing young English players, and their success may lead to a stronger England cricket team in the future."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

I couldn’t tell my daughter because I didn’t want to upset her and take her mind off her studies and impending graduation. Once our Vet determined that there was nothing further that could be done she showed me how to give pain meds and fluids at home to keep her comfortable in hopes that she would live long enough to allow my daughter to say goodbye after her graduation. The entire week I stayed with our cat around the clock. She had completely stopped eating and drinking and was slowly dying before my eyes. She slept most of the time except when I had to put the needle in between her shoulder blades to give her fluids. Then she would cry quietly and look at me with pleading eyes. Her breathing was becoming so shallow that I had to get close to her and listen to see if she was still alive. After a week of this I began to realize that the most unselfish thing I could do for this beautiful creature was to let her go. I wrapped her in her favorite blanket and and drove her to our Vets office after they had closed for the day. She was so skinny and frail but when I held her close she still purred. I thanked her for the 14 years she had been one of my daughter’s closest companions and I held her as she took her last breath. I was afraid my daughter was going to be angry with me when I told her that i made the decision with out giving her time to say goodbye.

Short movie review: delineate the cost of the inevitable conflicts between human urges and an institution concerned with self-preservation Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"Title: The Paradox of Humanity The movie, \\"The Paradox of Humanity,\\" delves into the intricate and complex relationship between inherent human desires and the constraints imposed by the self-preserving institutions that govern society. Directed by a visionary filmmaker who passionately captures the essence of this struggle, the movie's narrative weaves an intricate tapestry of emotionally charged confrontations and the subtle nuances of power dynamics between individuals and institutions. The cinematography in \\"The Paradox of Humanity\\" is undeniably breathtaking, with sweeping panoramic shots illustrating the vastness and grandeur of the world the characters inhabit. It evokes a sense of longing and an unspoken yearning for freedom, a poignant reflection of the central theme of the movie. The musical score is equally impressive, haunting and enchanting, leaving a lingering impression on the audience and effectively contributing to the movie's emotional depth. The plot revolves around a group of individuals who are caught between their pursuit of personal desires and the expectations imposed upon them by the institutions in which they are situated. The protagonist, a rebellious artist, boldly challenges the societal norms upheld by the governing body of their tightly controlled community. This defiance sets in motion a chain of events that exposes the vulnerability of the individual when faced with the might of a self-preserving institution. As the protagonist's journey unfolds, viewers witness the gradual erosion of their spirit and the diminishing of their once unwavering resolve, ultimately revealing the devastating emotional toll that such conflicts can take upon an individual. The brilliant performances delivered by the ensemble cast convey the raw, visceral agony of the characters, who find themselves shackled by the very systems that were meant to protect them. However, the movie is not without its flaws. While the narrative is powerful and thought-provoking, it at times struggles to maintain a coherent pace, which may leave some viewers feeling disconnected from the story. Additionally, certain supporting characters are underdeveloped, resulting in a lack of emotional investment in their respective arcs. But even with these shortcomings, \\"The Paradox of Humanity\\" remains an impactful and unforgettable cinematic experience. It boldly exposes the inevitable cost of conflicts between human desires and institutional preservation, serving as a cautionary tale of the repercussions that such struggles can inflict upon the individual and society as a whole. Based on the review, the critic seems to think positively of the movie overall. While acknowledging its shortcomings, the critic clearly appreciates the film's thought-provoking subject matter, strong performances, stunning visuals, and compelling music. The movie's potent exploration of the battle between human urges and institutional self-preservation appears to have resonated with the reviewer, suggesting a positive outlook on the film's purpose and impact."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Robert is a meat lover.;","completion":"[2]. Robert is a meat lover. It is clear that Robert's favorite food is bacon, which implies that he enjoys meat products. Bacon is a popular meat product that is often enjoyed as a breakfast staple, snack, or incorporated into various dishes for additional flavor and texture. As this particular food item is derived from pigs, it is considered a meat product, and thus people who enjoy it can be reasonably categorized as meat lovers. On the other hand, Donald never eats bacon, so the information provided does not support the conclusion that he is a meat lover. There may be several reasons for this. Perhaps Donald avoids bacon for dietary reasons, health concerns, or ethical choices. He may even be a vegetarian or vegan, where eating meat products goes against his beliefs and lifestyle. Moreover, it is important to recognize that even if Donald does consume other types of meat, not eating bacon, in this case, highlights a specific preference or aversion to this particular type of meat. So, labeling him as a meat lover may not accurately capture his dietary inclinations and tastes. In conclusion, the most appropriate option among the two given is that \\"[2]. Robert is a meat lover.\\" as it has been directly mentioned that bacon is Robert's favorite food. As for Donald, there is no sufficient information to identify him as a meat lover, and so option [1] does not accurately describe his preferences."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ludwig Jr. On 29 November 2002 (the first anniversary of Harrison's death), he performed \\"Photograph\\" and a cover of Carl Perkins' \\"Honey Don't\\" at the Concert for George held in the Royal Albert Hall, London. Early the following year, he released the album Ringo Rama, which contained a song he co-wrote as a tribute to Harrison, \\"Never Without You\\". Also in 2003, he formed Pumkinhead Records with All-Starr Band member Mark Hudson. The label was not prolific, but their first signing was Liam Lynch, who produced a 2003 LP entitled Fake Songs.Starr served as an honorary Santa Tracker and voice-over personality in 2003 and 2004 during the London stop in Father Christmas's annual Christmas Eve journey, as depicted in the annual NORAD tracks Santa program. According to NORAD officials, he was \\"a Starr in the east\\" who helped guide North American Aerospace Defense Command's Santa-tracking tradition. His 2005 release Choose Love eschewed the star-guests approach of his last two studio albums but failed to chart in the UK or the US. That same year, Liverpool's City Council announced plans to demolish Starr's birthplace, 9 Madryn Street, stating that it had \\"no historical significance\\". The LCC later announced that the building would be taken apart brick by brick and preserved.Starr released the album Liverpool 8 in January 2008, coinciding with the start of Liverpool's year as the European Capital of Culture. Hudson was the initial producer of the recordings, but after a falling out with Starr, he was replaced by David A. Stewart. Starr performed the title track at the opening ceremony for Liverpool's appointment, but thereafter attracted controversy over his seemingly unflattering comments about his city of birth.

I can use this background: In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Now, I have a new situation: Usain was once a competitive swimmer, but he became bored with the sport and decided to start running very frequently instead. Usain tried to convince his brother, Asafa, to take up running as well. Asafa didn't really like running, though, so he hardly ran much at all. Answer this question please: Who will increase the strength of their cardiac muscles less? A:","completion":"Usain B: Asafa Based on the background information given, cardiac muscle strength and efficiency increases with exercises like running that require the heart to pump more blood. Therefore, between Usain who runs very frequently and Asafa who hardly runs at all, Asafa will increase the strength of his cardiac muscles less. This is because he is not providing the necessary stimulus (frequent running) for his cardiac muscles to get stronger and more efficient. Therefore, the answer is B: Asafa."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old.

Given the question: Process: - Fluid - Waste enters the kidneys - A processing moment in the kidneys let waste and fluid pass - Prevents larger molecules to pass - Fluid goes back to the bloodstream - Bad waste is removed - The final product is turned into urine. Question: suppose less energy is absorbed by lands happens, how will it affect LESS waste being removed from the body. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect The answer is:","completion":"Based on the given question and process, we can identify that the process under consideration is related to the functioning of the kidneys and urinary system. The process helps to remove waste and toxins from the body through the production and excretion of urine. The stated perturbation is the scenario in which less energy is absorbed by lands. The question that arises from this perturbation is how it will affect the efficiency of waste removal from the body. It is important to clarify the link between the absorption of energy by lands and the functioning of the kidneys. The kidneys play a vital role in waste removal and the regulation of water and electrolyte balance in the body. They achieve this by filtering blood through nephrons, which are specialized tubule structures designed to separate waste products, excess water, and electrolytes, like sodium and potassium, from the bloodstream. The primary source of energy for the Earth's ecosystems is sunlight, which plants convert into chemical energy through the process of photosynthesis. This energy is then transferred through the food web, as organisms consume plants and one another. However, the direct relationship between the energy absorbed by lands and waste removal seems to be indirect. Nevertheless, under the assumption that less energy absorption by lands might have some impact on waste removal, we can analyze the factors that could be involved and their potential consequences. One possibility is that less energy absorption by lands may lead to decreased primary production at the foundational level of the ecosystem, affecting the availability of resources, such as food and water. This could impact human populations, causing malnourishment and dehydration, which subsequently may result in less waste being produced by the body. In this case, the kidneys would have a decreased load of waste and excess fluids to process, effectively resulting in less waste being removed from the body. In this regard, the perturbation of less energy absorption by lands could lead to a less efficient waste removal system. However, the human body is a highly adaptable system, capable of adjusting to different environmental conditions. In the case of malnourishment and dehydration, the kidneys can regulate the amount of water and electrolytes in the blood, concentrating waste products in the urine to minimize water loss, and synthesizing more waste-processing enzymes to handle any changes in waste composition. In this context, it could be said that the kidneys have the ability to adapt to less available energy, and their waste removal function may not necessarily be negatively affected. In conclusion, the direct link between the absorption of energy by lands and kidney function is not readily apparent. Nevertheless, assuming that less energy absorption might lead to changes in ecosystem structure and resource availability, it could potentially result in less waste removal from the body. However, the human body's adaptability, particularly the kidneys' capability to regulate their function based on changing environmental conditions, suggests the effect might vary depending on individual adaptability and could range from no effect to less efficient waste removal. Given the complexity of these interactions, further research would be necessary to determine the precise impact of this perturbation on the waste removal process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Choices: A). yes. B). it is not possible to tell. C). no. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. To analyze these sentences, let's first breakdown their meanings: Sentence 1: \\"They'd have been published at once.\\" This sentence implies that if some conditions were met, a work (article, book, or other media) would have been published immediately. There could be various reasons for this immediate publication; it could be due to the urgency, importance, or quality of the work. However, the sentence does not explicitly mention anything about the reputation of the publication platform. Sentence 2: \\"This is one of the most prestigious publications in existence.\\" This sentence describes the stature and prestige of a particular publication platform. It implies that the publication in question holds a high level of importance, influence, or authority within its domain, but it does not relate to the immediacy of the publication process. Now, let's analyze the relationship between these sentences based on the given choices: A). Yes: This would mean that the second sentence is a direct logical consequence of the first one. However, there is no information in the first sentence to clearly indicate any connection to the prestige of the publication. B). It is not possible to tell: This would imply that given the information provided, we cannot discern with certainty whether the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence or not. Although we might be tempted to pick this option, it's not quite accurate. We can, in fact, reasonably assess that the first sentence doesn't concern the reputation of the publication platform. C). No: This means that the second sentence is not a direct logical consequence of the first sentence. The first sentence deals with the immediacy of publication, while the second sentence concerns the prestige of the publication platform. Based on this analysis, we can conclude that C) no, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. They are addressing two different aspects – the immediacy of the publication process and the reputation of the publication platform – without explicitly connecting the two aspects."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. What is the answer to this question? with https data are encrypted using a protocol called the?","completion":"The answer to the question is: with https data are encrypted using a protocol called the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) or its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS). HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is an extension of the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) that is used to establish secure, encrypted communication between a user's browser and a web server. This encrypted communication is essential for situations where sensitive data, such as logins, personal data, or financial transactions, need to be transmitted between the client and the server. To encrypt and protect data transmitted over HTTPS, SSL or TLS protocols are employed. Let's delve deeper into these protocols. 1. SSL (Secure Sockets Layer): SSL was introduced by Netscape in the early 1990s to secure communication between web clients and servers. SSL essentially works by creating a secure channel where data packets are encrypted before being transmitted over the network. SSL uses a combination of public and private key cryptography, along with symmetric key encryption, to ensure the privacy, integrity, and authentication of the data being exchanged. SSL has seen a few iterations since its inception, with SSL 3.0 serving as the last version of the protocol. 2. TLS (Transport Layer Security): TLS was developed as the successor of SSL and is considered a more secure and improved version of the protocol. TLS 1.0 was introduced in 1999 by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as an upgrade to SSL 3.0. The newer TLS versions (1.1, 1.2, and 1.3) were subsequently released, each offering improved security features, greater performance, and support for new cryptographic algorithms. Like SSL, TLS also employs public key, private key, and symmetric key encryption for data protection and verification during communication. The transition from SSL to TLS brought multiple enhancements to the table, including better protection against man-in-the-middle attacks, support for stronger and more secure cryptographic algorithms, and improved performance and efficiency.

However, the star of today's story is neither an actor nor musician, but a whopping 150-pound tortoise spotted leisurely strolling in an LA suburb. The residents of the tranquil neighborhood were left stunned by the sight of this giant reptile, leaving everyone with questions about where he came from and how he ended up wandering the streets. It was a typical sunny afternoon in the picturesque Los Angeles suburb when a gentle stroll by one of its residents took a surprising turn. Lianne Beck, a local resident, was taking a leisurely walk when she came across a massive tortoise trundling its way down the street. Beck, in her bewildered state, quickly called the local authorities to report the unusual sighting. The tortoise was discovered to be an African spurred tortoise (Centrochelys sulcata), one of the largest species of tortoises in the world. These magnificent creatures can live over 100 years and, as their size suggests, can weigh up to 200 pounds. Native to the Sahara Desert, the African spurred tortoise is primarily herbivorous and feeds on grasses and other vegetation. Upon receiving Beck's call, the local animal control was quick to respond and worked tirelessly to safely corral the wandering tortoise. It was later identified that the tortoise had a name — \\"Samson.\\" Samson's identity was determined through a lost pet notice shared by his distraught owners. They had been searching for their beloved pet since he managed to escape from their backyard, taking advantage of an unsecured fence. The reunion between Samson and his owners was heartwarming, as this gentle giant was evidently missed by his family. Samson's owners were extremely grateful for the efforts of the animal control team and the continuous support from the local community during the search. While this story had a happy ending for Samson and his owners, it serves as an important reminder to pet owners regarding the proper care and management of their exotic pets. African spurred tortoises can make fascinating additions to a family but come with specific dietary and environmental requirements that need to be met to ensure their well-being. It is essential for those who wish to keep exotic pets to thoroughly research and understand the needs of their chosen species. Proper housing, the appropriate diet, and the long-term care implications should all be considered. Additionally, environmental enrichment and maintaining a secure enclosure should be prioritized to prevent escapes and potential harm to the animals or local communities. For those who are interested in adopting or caring for exotic animals, it is crucial to reach out to local experts, veterinarians, and wildlife organizations. They can provide valuable guidance and resources to ensure that these extraordinary creatures receive the attention and care they need. In conclusion, the unusual sighting of Samson, the 150-pound tortoise, highlights that our neighborhoods might sometimes surprise us with unexpected guests. His safe return to his loving family is nothing short of heartwarming, and his tale serves as both a cautionary reminder and an inspiring display of community support for exotic pet ownership and responsibility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It's important to identify any similarities and differences that may affect whether the claim is logically consistent or contradictory. The initial statement tells us: - A man and a woman are sitting together. - They are on the same side of a table. - There are bikes in the background. The claim states: - The man and woman sit on the grass. - The scene takes place in a park. Step 4: Determine if the claim logically follows from the provided information Upon comparing the claim with the provided information, we find that the claim does not logically follow from the initial statement. While the presence of bikes in the background might suggest an outdoor setting, it is not sufficient to assume that the scene takes place in a park. Moreover, the original statement explicitly says that the man and woman are sitting on the same side of a table, while the claim states that they are sitting on the grass.

First, I found the relative speed of the trains as they are approaching each other. Since they're going towards each other at 60 mph each, their combined speed would be 120 mph (60 + 60). Next, I converted the speed from miles per hour to miles per second by dividing by 3600 (1 hour is 3600 seconds): 120mph / 3600 = 1/30 miles per second. Afterward, I determined the total length of both trains together: 1/6 mile + 1/6 mile = 1/3 mile. Finally, I divided the total length (1/3 mile) by the relative speed (1/30 miles per second) to find the time it takes for them to pass each other completely: (1/3) / (1/30) = 10 seconds.

Henry David Thoreau (see name pronunciation; July 12, 1817 - May 6, 1862) was an American essayist, poet, philosopher, abolitionist, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, and historian. A leading transcendentalist, Thoreau is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay \\"Civil Disobedience\\" (originally published as \\"Resistance to Civil Government\\"), an argument for disobedience to an unjust state. Thoreau's books, articles, essays, journals, and poetry amount to more than 20 volumes. Among his lasting contributions are his writings on natural history and philosophy, in which he anticipated the methods and findings of ecology and environmental history, two sources of modern-day environmentalism. Thoreau contracted tuberculosis in 1835 and suffered from it sporadically afterwards. In 1860, following a late-night excursion to count the rings of tree stumps during a rainstorm, he became ill with bronchitis. His health declined, with brief periods of remission, and he eventually became bedridden. Recognizing the terminal nature of his disease, Thoreau spent his last years revising and editing his unpublished works, particularly The Maine Woods and Excursions, and petitioning publishers to print revised editions of A Week and Walden. He wrote letters and journal entries until he became too weak to continue. His friends were alarmed at his diminished appearance and were fascinated by his tranquil acceptance of death. When his aunt Louisa asked him in his last weeks if he had made his peace with God, Thoreau responded, \\"I did not know we had ever quarreled.\\" Aware he was dying, Thoreau's last words were \\"Now comes good sailing\\", followed by two lone words, \\"moose\\" and \\"Indian\\". He died on May 6, 1862, at age 44. Amos Bronson Alcott planned the service and read selections from Thoreau's works, and Channing presented a hymn. Emerson wrote the eulogy spoken at the funeral. Thoreau was buried in the Dunbar family plot; his remains and those of members of his immediate family were eventually moved to Sleepy Hollow Cemetery (42deg27'53''N 71deg20'32''W) in Concord, Massachusetts. Thoreau's friend William Ellery Channing published his first biography, Thoreau the Poet-Naturalist, in 1873. Channing and another friend, Harrison Blake, edited some poems, essays, and journal entries for posthumous publication in the 1890s. Thoreau's journals, which he often mined for his published works but which remained largely unpublished at his death, were first published in 1906 and helped to build his modern reputation. A new, expanded edition of the journals is under way, published by Princeton University Press.

Please answer the following question: Question: Who does Billy Bremner get into a fight with? If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: The Damned United Context: After failing to qualify for the 1974 FIFA World Cup, England manager Alf Ramsey is replaced by Don Revie (Colm Meaney), the highly successful manager of Leeds United. Revie's replacement at Leeds is Brian Clough (Michael Sheen), the former manager of Derby County and a fierce critic of Leeds, because of their violent and physical style of play under Revie's management. Furthermore, Clough's longtime assistant, Peter Taylor (Timothy Spall), has not joined him. The roots of Clough's conflict with Leeds are depicted as happening in a 1968 FA Cup match between Leeds, the leaders of the First Division[3] and Derby, who were struggling near the bottom of the Second Division. Clough, assuming Revie to be a similar man to himself, as they grew up in the same part of Middlesbrough and both played for Sunderland, made many preparations for the match; come the day of the match however, Revie failed to even acknowledge Clough upon entering the Baseball Ground. Derby eventually lost 2â0.[4] Although Clough initially blames the brutality of the Leeds players, he and Taylor recognise that their side are not good on a technical level. So they sign veteran Dave Mackay (Brian McCardie), along with several other young players. Chairman Sam Longson (Jim Broadbent) is extremely anxious about the investment, as well as the fact that Clough did not consult him before signing Mackay. However, in 1969 Derby are promoted. They once again face Leeds, only to lose 5â0. The club win their first ever League championship in 1972, meaning a European Cup campaign the following year. They go through to the semi-finals against Juventus. Unfortunately, against Longson's advice, Clough uses his best squad in the last match before the semi-final, against Leeds, purely out of pride and determination to beat Revie. They suffer injuries and Billy Bremner (Stephen Graham) sarcastically wishes Clough well for the semi-final. Juventus defeat them 3-1, and Clough publicly lambasts Longson.[5] Taylor then suffers a heart attack, and Clough tries to...

New Zealand easily chased down 105 to complete an eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka and make it five Test-match victories in a year for the first time. Captain Brendon McCullum became the first New Zealander to hit 1,000 Test runs in a calendar year when he made a rapid 195 in the first innings in Christchurch. But he was not needed in the second as Kane Williamson and Ross Taylor knocked off the runs required once opening pair Tom Latham and Hamish Rutherford had been dismissed. New Zealand's captain Brendon McCullum continued his rich Test scoring streak with 195 against Sri Lanka With his century in","completion":"the first innings, McCullum not only established a new personal best but also solidified his position as a prolific run scorer in the Test arena for New Zealand. His leadership both on and off the field, combined with his aggressive style of play, inspired his teammates to perform at their best, as demonstrated by the success of Williamson and Taylor in the second innings in Christchurch. Kane Williamson, a talented batsman with a vast array of shots, played a crucial role in the chase, exhibiting strong technique and great temperament throughout his innings. His partnership with the experienced Ross Taylor ensured stability and the momentum needed for a successful run chase. Taylor's aggressive approach and outstanding stroke play consistently put pressure on the Sri Lankan bowlers, making it difficult for them to settle into a consistent rhythm. The Sri Lankan bowling attack, led by Suranga Lakmal and Nuwan Pradeep, struggled to make an impact against the formidable New Zealand batting lineup. While they managed to claim a few early wickets in both innings, they could not maintain the pressure and couldn't capitalise on the breakthroughs. The lack of a potent spin bowler to exploit the pitch conditions also proved to be an advantage for the New Zealand batsmen. Apart from their batting prowess, what truly stood out for the Kiwis was their outstanding fielding and bowling efforts. The seamers, led by Trent Boult and Tim Southee, consistently bowled a tight line, making it difficult for the Sri Lankan batsmen to score freely. In addition to their bowling exploits, both Boult and Southee showcased their athletic abilities in the field, resulting in spectacular catches and run-outs that further fuelled the New Zealand side. As New Zealand celebrated their fifth Test-match victory of the year, the team reflected on their steady progression to becoming one of the cricket world's elite sides. The growth in confidence, the presence of several world-class players, and a strong team culture facilitated by their experienced captain, has set them up for continued success in the coming years. For Sri Lanka, this series served as a reminder of the need to adapt and develop a more consistent and disciplined approach to Test cricket, especially when playing away from home. Developing a potent bowling lineup capable of exploiting various pitch conditions, coupled with a batting lineup that can hold their own against top-quality seam attacks, will be Sri Lanka's primary focus moving forward. In conclusion, New Zealand's eight-wicket victory over Sri Lanka symbolised the rise of a team capable of dominating the longer format of the game. Led by a captain who made history in the process, this match exemplified the depth and skill present within the New Zealand squad. For Sri Lanka, the defeat underscored the need for improvement and growth to once again compete at the highest level in Test cricket. As cricket fans, we eagerly await the future duels between these two sides and the exciting cricket that will undoubtedly unfold."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Movie plot title: The Terror Movie plot: Set in 1806, the film tells the story of a lost French soldier in the Confederation of the Rhine named Andre Duvalier (Jack Nicholson) who is saved by a strange young woman named Helene (Sandra Knight). She looks like Ilsa, the wife of the baron (played by Boris Karloff), who died twenty years before. Investigating who the woman really is, Andre stumbles upon a hidden secret of the Baron: After he found Ilsa sleeping with another man named Eric, the Baron killed his wife while his servant killed Eric, or so he explains. All the while, the phantom of Ilsa remained under the control of a peasant witch (Dorothy Neumann), who has commanded the ghost to torment the Baron for the previous two years. Over the course of the film, Ilsa's ghost beseeches the Baron to kill himself, so they could be together. After much hesitation, the Baron decides to do so, perhaps to atone for his crimes. During the climactic scenes, Andre, as well as the Baron's butler Stefan (Dick Miller), try to stop him, eventually forcing the witch into compliance. Here it is revealed that the witch Katrina is in fact the mother of Eric, who she believes was killed by the Baron twenty years before, and that is why she has tried to make him commit suicide and damn his soul to hell. In a stunning revelation, Stefan reveals that Eric never died, that it was the Baron who was killed. Eric then took the Baron's place, living his life until he deluded himself into thinking he was the Baron. Katrina, realizing her folly only too late, goes with the two men to stop Eric from flooding the castle crypt and killing himself. However, she is unable to go into the mausoleum and ends up being struck by lightning and burning to death to the ground as she tries to escape.

Summarize the following: The diaphragm is a muscle that sits like an upside-down bowl just beneath your ribs, contracting and relaxing to move air through your lungs. Deep \\"belly breathing\\" that visibly moves your abdomen in and out helps strengthen this muscle and improve your endurance. If your belly stays flat and your chest pumps up and down, you're taking shallow \\"chest breaths,\\" and will fatigue sooner. This will help ensure that you are getting enough oxygen to your body, and is the best way to prevent muscle and lung fatigue. It also helps increase endurance by getting proper oxygen circulation to your muscles. Your mouth is wider than your nostrils, allowing you to take deeper breaths of air. Allow air to enter through both your mouth and your nose. Most experienced runners coordinate their breath with their steps, such as the popular \\"inhale for three steps, exhale for two\\" (or simply \\"3–2\\"). This helps you breathe more consistently. You may also be forced to switch to a different pattern (such as \\"2–1\\") at higher speeds, which helps you keep track of the intensity of your run. There are several popular alternatives to these patterns, such as \\"2-2\\" or \\"2-3.\\" Experiment with different breathing patterns to find the right one for you. You should be able to form full sentences while running without huffing and puffing.","completion":"The diaphragm, an essential muscle for respiration, is situated just below the ribs, resembling an inverted bowl. It contracts and relaxes to facilitate airflow in and out of the lungs. Engaging in deep \\"belly breathing,\\" characterized by abdominal movements, aids in strengthening the diaphragm and improving endurance. Shallow \\"chest breaths,\\" on the other hand, may lead to quicker exhaustion. Optimizing oxygen intake is crucial for preventing muscle and lung fatigue while also enhancing endurance through sufficient oxygen circulation in the muscles. Breathing through the mouth, which is wider than the nostrils, allows for deeper inhalation. Combining mouth and nose breathing is recommended for maximum efficiency. Seasoned runners often synchronize their breathing with their strides. A common pattern is \\"inhale for three steps, exhale for two\\" (or \\"3-2\\"). Such coordination enables consistent breathing and can be adjusted to different patterns, like \\"2-1,\\" depending on the running speed and intensity. Other popular alternatives include \\"2-2\\" or \\"2-3.\\" Trying various breathing patterns assists in determining the most suitable one for an individual. A good indicator of proper breathing while running is the ability to speak full sentences without gasping for air. Overall, focusing on diaphragmatic breathing, combining mouth and nose inhalation, and finding the right breathing pattern can significantly improve running performance and endurance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The film was directed by Mark Romanek from a screenplay by Alex Garland. Never Let Me Go is set in an alternative history and centres on Kathy, Ruth and Tommy portrayed by Carey Mulligan, Keira Knightley and Andrew Garfield respectively, who become entangled in a love triangle. Principal photography began in April 2009 and lasted several weeks. The movie was filmed at various locations, including Andrew Melville Hall. The film was produced by DNA Films and Film4 on a US15 million budget. Is this statement correct \\"is never let me go a true story\\"?","completion":"No, sweetie, \\"Never Let Me Go\\" is not a true story. It is a fictional story, which means it's made up.

Premise: \\"The graveyard has some extremely ornate and fascinating tombs, replete with skulls and croseones and other symbols of death.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"There are symbols of death on several of the tombs.\\"?","completion":"If the given premise is true, stating \\"The graveyard has some extremely ornate and fascinating tombs, replete with skulls and croseones and other symbols of death,\\" it directly supports and entails the hypothesis \\"There are symbols of death on several of the tombs.\\" The premise indicates that there is a graveyard with tombs that are not only ornate and fascinating in design, but also incorporate specific symbolism related to death. The use of skulls, croseones (likely a misspelling or variant of \\"crossbones\\"), and mention of \\"other symbols of death\\" confirm that these tombs indeed display representations and motifs connected to death. Considering the premise as true, we can analyze the hypothesis more in-depth. \\"There are symbols of death on several of the tombs\\" is a statement that can be directly inferred from the premise's information. The presence of skulls, crossbones, and other death-related symbols on the tombs indicates that this hypothesis aligns with the given premise, further solidifying the hypothesis's validity when accepting the premise as true. In conclusion, the given premise directly entails the presented hypothesis. If we accept the premise that states the graveyard has tombs with ornate designs and various symbols of death, then it logically follows that there would be symbols of death on several of the tombs.

Having a conversation about sexual issues can be difficult and awkward, especially if you are both feeling the lack of sexual chemistry in the bedroom. Don’t spring the conversation on your partner when you’re having dinner at a restaurant or surrounded by friends. Look for a time when you are both alone, in a private space, to bring up the topic. A good time may be when you are both getting ready for bed, or after you have dinner together at home. A big part of strengthening the sexual relationship between you and your spouse is maintaining open and honest communication between you and your spouse. Bringing up the sexual issues in your marriage will show you are trying to make sex a priority in your relationship, instead of an occasional occurrence. Perhaps you have grown distant from your spouse or your spouse has grown distant from you. Regardless, be proactive and get the conversation started. Let your spouse know that you realize it’s important to have an intimate connection in a relationship, especially in a marriage. Tell your spouse that you realize you have both been unhappy with your love life and that you want to try to do something about it. If your partner responds with, “Well, I’ve heard that before”, don’t take it personally. Instead, ask your partner how you can meet their needs, sexual and otherwise. Discuss what your partner feels is lacking in your sexual relationship and what you feel is lacking, as well. Often, couples with sexual problems also have other emotional issues that have not been worked out and are hovering over the relationship. You could be lacking sexual chemistry due to boredom in the bedroom, a low sex drive (for you or your partner), a negative body image (for you or your partner), exhaustion due to the stresses of life, or a lack of connection mentally and emotionally. Try to work together to identify possible causes of your lack of sexual chemistry. It can be difficult to talk about issues around sex. But as partners, you owe it to each other to be honest and to share any concerns around intimacy and sex. Don’t interrupt your partner when your partner is sharing any feelings or concerns. Focus on listening before you respond or speak. Try to get to the root of your issues. Don’t be afraid to be specific about your concerns, as this can lead to solutions to address them. If your partner brings up a feeling of boredom in the bedroom, think of ways to spice up your usual sex routine. Maybe your partner is feeling exhausted by their workday, or experiencing a negative image of their body. Discuss possible solutions to these issues, like taking less hours at work, going on a vacation just the two of you, or taking up exercise together. Summary:","completion":"Talk about sexual issues in a private space with your partner, listen to each other's concerns and feelings, and work together to find solutions for better intimacy and connection in your relationship."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: The prefix = st1 /USgovernment has announced plans to list polar bears as a threatened species because of concerns that the ice where they live is melting. But as the BBC's Owen Clegg reports, theUSplans are also important for other reasons. It's estimated that there are no more than twenty-five thousand polar bears living in the wild, and this number could go down by a large amount as the floating ice upon which the bears survive melt away. Now, without admitting the cause of this melt, the US Fish and Wildlife Services are reviewing the bear's living conditions. That action is being taken at all, and marks an important change for the Bush administration; for the first time, it may be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species. Such a conclusion by an unwilling Bush administration could force far wider changes inWashington's policy towards the environment. This review only came about after a union of environmental groups brought a legal case against the government to take action. Environmentalists, like David Doniger, believe that by calling on the protections of the Endangered Species Act, theUSgovernment may finally be forced to cut back on its sending out greenhouse gases: \\"It is a very important thing today to have the Bush administration notice that global warming is threatening the existence of the polar bear. Now, it's up to the administration to do something to stop the global warming that's threatening the polar bear.\\" ( David Doniger) The United States is the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases which are blamed for trapping heat from the sun and changing the earth's climate. Since taking office in 2001, President Bush has refused to make the link with global warming, but the bad, serious situation of the polar bear may force that position to change. Question: What is the significance of US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions? Answer: The answer is:","completion":"The significance of the US Fish and Wildlife Services' reviewing the bear's living conditions lies in its potential implications on the broader United States environmental policy. The review marks a meaningful change for the Bush administration as it might, for the first time, be forced to acknowledge a link between global warming and its effect on a species - in this case, polar bears.

Surely the best thing about colomba, the Easter equivalent to panettone, is the sugared, toasted almond topping that covers the whole thing and crumbles when you cut it, so you sort of have no choice but just to pick up the crusty sugary bits and eat those on their own. I’d always thought that colomba would make a very good baking project but was somewhat intimated by getting the right shape — it’s vaguely in the shape of a dove, if you use your imagination — and texture — wonderfully soft, fluffy, sweet yeasted bread. I had attempted making panettone (this fig, walnut and date panettone) a few years ago with fair results — absolutely delicious results, actually, they were just not as fluffy and bouncy as expertly made ones from your favourite pastry shop where panettoni are hung upside-down to maintain their height and airiness. But when I came across the familiar brown and gold paper forms for making colomba at the supermarket, I thought I’m only ever going to get a chance to make this now! Like the panettone, I referred to my favourite baking book for Italian specialties, Carol Field’s The Italian Baker. Field recounts a bit of history behind the colomba, which I’m sure is little known to anyone these days. Colomba is a fixture at Easter tables all around Italy (and is often given as presents), even though it comes from the north of Italy, Pavia. It is one of those traditions that are now a given, where a slice of colomba, perhaps eaten with pieces of a cracked chocolate Easter egg and an espresso or a glass of dessert wine, is a welcome end to the meal (or indeed breakfast the next day). But the legend behind it is a medieval one and rather disturbing — maybe it was made up to encourage young girls to learn how to bake their own colomba (and make sure it was good) to get themselves out of sticky, undesirable situations. According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: What did the author probably do with the colomba she made from the Field's recipe?

Given the question: What's the last name of the man that will pay for Eliza's lessons, if successful? Answer the above question based on the context below: In London, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of phonetics, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society (\\"Why Can't the English?\\"). At Covent Garden one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or duchess at an embassy ball, even the young woman with a strong Cockney accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to sell them flowers. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible (\\"Wouldn't It Be Loverly\\"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives (\\"I'm an Ordinary Man\\"). Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a dustman, learns of his daughter's new residence (\\"With a Little Bit of Luck\\"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5.

Solve -63597 = 22*z - 63399 for z.. What is the answer??","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step! We have: -63597 = 22*z - 63399 First, we want to move the -63399 from the right side to the left side to get z alone on the right side. We do this by adding 63399 to both sides. -63597 + 63399 = 22*z - 63399 + 63399 Now, -63597 + 63399 = -198, so our equation becomes: -198 = 22*z Now, we want to find out how many times 22 will fit into -198. We do this by dividing -198 by 22. -198 ÷ 22 = z When we divide -198 by 22, we get: z = -9 So the answer is z = -9! And that's our final answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If graves disease increases the rate of metabolism in cells, then what increases the rate of metabolism in cells? Answer choices: - heat energy - heating liquids - Smoking - adding heat - cigarettes - smoking cigarettes - Graves disease - Dehydration","completion":"Graves' disease is the main factor that increases the rate of metabolism in cells among the answer choices provided. Graves' disease is an autoimmune disorder that causes hyperthyroidism or an overactive thyroid gland. This condition leads to an increase in the production of thyroid hormones, which play a vital role in regulating cellular metabolism. When there is an excess of thyroid hormones in the body, it causes an overall increase in metabolic rate, leading to a wide range of symptoms and complications. Out of the other options, none are primary factors increasing cellular metabolism: 1. Heat energy and adding heat may have some indirect or temporary effect on metabolism, but they are not primary drivers. 2. Heating liquids would not directly increase cellular metabolism. 3. Smoking and smoking cigarettes can have negative impacts on overall health, but they do not specifically increase cellular metabolism. In fact, the toxins in cigarettes can cause harm to various cellular functions. 4. Dehydration can also have adverse effects on the body, but it hinders cellular function rather than increasing metabolism.

Sentence 1: Otherwise--Well, I guess I can do it on my own. Sentence 2: I can't do it alone. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"No, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence. Entailment in linguistic terms refers to a relationship between two sentences, where the truth of one sentence (the entailing sentence) guarantees or implies the truth of the other sentence (the entailed sentence). If one sentence is true, then the other must also be true in order for the relationship to be considered entailment. In this case, the two sentences have different meanings and do not guarantee or imply each other's truth. Let's analyze each sentence separately: 1. \\"Otherwise--Well, I guess I can do it on my own.\\" This sentence suggests that the speaker is considering two options or scenarios, one of which involves doing the task \\"on their own,\\" i.e., without help or support from others. It implies that the speaker is capable of handling the situation independently. The use of \\"well\\" and \\"guess\\" in the sentence may indicate a degree of uncertainty or hesitation, but the speaker still concludes that they can do it on their own. 2. \\"I can't do it alone.\\" This sentence has a different meaning, as it involves the speaker admitting that they are not capable of accomplishing the task by themselves. They need help or support from others in order to complete the task successfully. Here, the speaker expresses a clear inability to do the task alone. Based on these interpretations, the two sentences convey different meanings and do not entail each other. If anything, they express contradictory positions regarding the speaker's capability to handle the task independently. The first sentence implies that the speaker can potentially do the task on their own, whereas the second sentence directly states the speaker's inability to do it alone. Thus, the second sentence is not entailed by the first sentence, as their meanings do not guarantee or imply each other's truth, and they, in fact, express opposite viewpoints."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The word \\"Vlach\\" is etymologically derived from the ethnonym of a Celtic tribe, adopted into Proto-Germanic *Walhaz which meant \\"stranger\\", from *Wolka- (Caesar's Latin: Volcae, Strabo and Ptolemy's Greek: Ouolkai). Via Latin, in Gothic, as *walhs, the ethnonym took on the meaning \\"foreigner\\" or \\"Romance-speaker\\", and was adopted into Greek Vlahi (Blakhoi), Slavic Vlah, Hungarian olah and olasz, etc. The root word was notably adopted in Germanic for Wales and Walloon (German: Welsch), and in Poland Wlochy became an exonym for Italians. Via both Germanic and Latin, the term started to signify \\"stranger, foreigner\\" also in the Balkans, where it in its early form was used for Romance-speakers, but the term eventually took on the meaning of \\"shepherd, nomad\\". The Romance-speaking communities themselves however used the endonym (they called themselves) \\"Romans\\". During the early history of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans, there was a social class of Vlachs in Serbia and Macedonia, made up of Christians who served as auxiliary forces and had the same rights as Muslims. In Croatia, the term became derogatory, and Vlasi was used for the ethnic Serb community. Romanian scholars have suggested that the term Vlach appeared for the first time in the Eastern Roman Empire and was subsequently spread to the Germanic- and then Slavic-speaking worlds through the Norsemen (possibly by Varangians), who were in trade and military contact with Byzantium during the early Middle Ages (see also Blakumen). The term \\"Vlach\\" is used in scholarship for the Romance-speaking communities in the Balkans, especially those in Greece, Albania and Macedonia. Answer this question \\"Was it considered derogative?\\" by extracting the answer from the text above.","completion":"Yes, in certain contexts, the term \\"Vlach\\" was considered derogative.

Her full name is Jane Ives, later changed to Jane Hopper when Chief Jim Hopper became her adopted father. She is portrayed by the talented young actress Millie Bobby Brown. Eleven, also known as \\"El\\" among her friends, was born with psychokinetic and telepathic abilities due to her mother, Terry Ives, being unknowingly subjected to experimentation while she was pregnant with her. As a result, the young Eleven was taken from her mother at birth and raised within the confines of the Hawkins National Laboratory, where she was subjected to a series of experiments and tests. Eleven's backstory forms a crucial part of the narrative of \\"Stranger Things.\\" Throughout the series, we see Eleven largely isolated from the outside world, with virtually no exposure to the norms of society or interaction with individuals other than her captors and handlers. In Season 1, she escapes from the laboratory and comes across a group of young boys - Mike Wheeler, Dustin Henderson, and Lucas Sinclair. They help her and eventually form a strong bond with her, teaching her about friendship and the outside world. Eleven's character arc sees her grow from a sheltered and frightened girl into a brave and powerful young woman, who plays a pivotal role in saving her friends and the town of Hawkins from supernatural threats originating from the \\"Upside Down,\\" a dark parallel universe. Over the course of the series, Eleven's gender identity is not questioned, although her androgynous appearance initially confuses the boys when they first meet her. Eleven's personal journey includes her discovering what it means to be a girl, as she experiences various milestones such as shopping for clothes, being a sister figure to Will's (Mike's younger brother) younger sister, Holly, and later having romantic feelings for Mike Wheeler, one of her friends from the group. In conclusion, not only is Eleven from \\"Stranger Things\\" a girl, but her character development also incorporates the exploration of her identity and femininity despite the adverse circumstances she was raised in.

Summarize this article: A referendum has been called for 5 July, with Greeks being asked to decide whether or not to accept a series of reforms set out by their government's international creditors. Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras is backing a No vote and a succession of European leaders are describing the referendum as a choice between staying in the euro or leaving it. So what are the main scenarios now? One route certainly preferred by the creditor side - the eurozone countries, the IMF and the European Central Bank - is a political breakthrough: a deal is done and Greece will stay in the eurozone and pay its debts. But a deal that lets Greece receive the funds in time to make the â‚¬1.6bn payment due to the IMF by 22:00 GMT on Tuesday now looks virtually impossible. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was said to have made a last-ditch offer to the Greek prime minister late on Monday on condition that he backed a Yes vote, but the Athens government's initial response was negative. Still, contacts are continuing and there appears to be some possibility of an agreement in the coming days. For a deal to go through, the eurozone would have to agree to resuscitate the bailout agreement that also expires on Tuesday. But if that were the price of keeping Greece in the fold, most eurozone governments would probably grudgingly pay it, though some would have to deal with truculent national parliaments. Another possible route to that same destination is a Yes vote in the Greek referendum next weekend. That would raise the same questions about the agreement and it would mean a difficult political problem for Syriza, which is recommending a No. The leftist party has the backing of its nationalist coalition partner, Independent Greeks, as well as the far-right Golden Dawn. Mainstream opposition parties such as the centre-right New Democracy are backing a Yes vote. Two opinion polls suggest more Greeks want a deal than a split from the eurozone, but the surveys were conducted before the referendum was announced. One problem for both these scenarios is that even if the Syriza-led government were to commit itself to an economic policy programme acceptable to the eurozone, would its other 18 members trust Greece to implement it? If Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, who has staked his reputation on a No vote, were to lose the referendum, his credibility would be damaged and he might resign. What's the point of the Greek referendum? The puzzle of the Greek referendum question This scenario would herald a long period of uncertainty and crisis, ending with Greece departing the eurozone and bringing back its own national currency, presumably with the same name as the old one, the drachma. This would be a very messy series of events. It would probably involve the European Central Bank deciding to pull the plug on all or most lending to the Greek banks on the grounds that it considered them insolvent. In the run-up to that it is likely there would be a considerable period of restrictions on access to and use of bank accounts - more of what started this week. It would be very disruptive for the Greek economy, which is already back in recession. The government would decide to start supplying national currency - electronic and hard cash - to get the banking system up and running. What would happen to the restored drachma? The general assumption is it would lose value. That would also pose a danger of inflation as import prices would rise. There would be disputes about financial aspects of contracts: which currency would apply - euros or drachmas? Perhaps the government would legislate quickly in an attempt to settle the question. What are capital controls? Greek debt jargon explained Another scenario is a negotiated exit from the euro. That might be somewhat less disruptive. But it would still leave bank customers looking at their money being converted into drachma. One issue with both no-vote scenarios is what happens to Greece's European Union membership. According to one of the ECB's lawyers, writing in 2009, \\"a Member State's exit from EMU, without a parallel withdrawal from the EU, would be legally inconceivable\\". But what if Greece did not want to leave, as currently seems likely? There's no expulsion procedure and in any case might the others at least want it inside the EU even if they have given up on keeping it in the eurozone? They could change the EU treaties, but that is a very difficult process with all sorts of bear traps, including referendums in some member states. Or they could just muddle through with a situation that has no legal basis. If Greece does leave, what are the implications for the integrity of the rest of the eurozone? In 2012, when the possibility was in the air, other countries with stretched government finances felt the impact through the bond market, where government debt is traded. Their borrowing costs rose to painfully high levels. Would it happen this time? The risks are probably less, due to actions taken by the governments concerned, eurozone governments collectively and especially by the European Central Bank. In the longer term the significance might be that a Greek departure would send the message that membership of the euro is not forever, as it was intended to be. So a country getting into difficulty in the future might then find the pressure in the financial markets on their borrowing costs more severe because of what had happened in the case of Greece. Will Europe catch Greek 'flu? Is Grexit inevitable? Summary:","completion":"A Greek referendum on whether to accept a series of reforms set out by international creditors has been scheduled for July 5th. With payment of &euro;1.6bn due to the IMF on June 30th, it appears virtually impossible for Greece to receive bailout funds in time to make the payment. If no agreement is reached, Greece would face a long period of uncertainty, crisis, and departure from the eurozone, potentially leading to the reintroduction of the drachma as its national currency. A negotiated exit from the eurozone is another possible scenario, but would still entail financial disruption. If Greece leaves the eurozone, other countries with stretched government finances may experience rising borrowing costs in the bond market, though the risks are likely less than in 2012."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Choices: - irrigation - plowing - sowing - crop rotation A: Answer:","completion":"The agricultural practice of restoring nitrogen to the soil as mentioned in the question is crop rotation. Crop rotation is a technique that has been used for centuries by many different civilizations to maintain soil fertility and ensure a productive harvest. This method involves systematically changing the type of crop planted in a specific area over a period of time. By doing so, the soil's nutrients are better balanced, and soil exhaustion is prevented. Nitrogen is a crucial element for plant growth, as it is a primary component of chlorophyll, which is necessary for photosynthesis. It is also a major component of amino acids, which are the building blocks of proteins. Unfortunately, certain crops like corn or rice tend to deplete the nitrogen content in the soil, thereby affecting the productivity of the land. Crop rotation helps to restore nitrogen levels in the soil by including nitrogen-fixing plants, such as legumes, in the rotation cycle. Legumes (for example, beans, peas, and clover) have a unique ability to fix nitrogen from the atmosphere using bacteria that form nodules on their roots. These bacteria convert atmospheric nitrogen into ammonia, a form that can be absorbed by plants. When legumes are grown as part of a crop rotation system, they add nitrogen back into the soil, making it available for other crops. Apart from restoring nitrogen, crop rotation also offers several other benefits: 1. Pest and disease control: Different crops attract different types of pests and diseases. By changing the crop planted in a specific area, the pest and disease cycles are disrupted, helping to reduce their impact. 2. Improved soil structure and fertility: Continuously planting the same crop leads to soil depletion and decreased soil health. Crop rotation allows the soil to recover from the demands of a specific crop, reducing the need for chemical fertilizers and promoting healthy soil ecosystems. 3. Weed control: Different crops compete with weeds differently. Including crops with allelopathic properties, which produce chemicals that inhibit the growth of competing plants, can help suppress weeds in the long run. 4. Diversifying farm income: By growing different types of crops, farmers can reduce their reliance on a single cash crop, thereby reducing income fluctuations and ensuring better economic stability. In conclusion, crop rotation is the agricultural practice primarily used for restoring nitrogen to the soil. This technique not only maintains soil fertility but also has numerous other benefits, such as pest and disease control, improved soil structure, weed management, and diversification of farm income."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In Sheffield, England, young Ruth Beckett & Jimmy Kemp are out in the country above Sheffield when a U.S. F-4 Phantom flies past overhead from the nearby R.A.F. Finningley base. Sheffield, the 4th-largest city in Britain, is close to a prominent R.A.F. Base and also has a major component of steel, energy & chemical production. Jimmy flicks through the car's radio stations, missing a brief news story about a Soviet invasion of Iran in his attempt to find the broadcast of the latest football game. Ruth chastises him for his lack of taste, but after he gets out of the car & comes back with a flower the two start to kiss.Later that week, the BBC runs a story about a Soviet convoy moving through northern Iran. The convoys had apparently been spotted by U.S. satellites, traversing 3 of the mountain passes leading from the USSR. The story goes on to say the Soviet foreign minister had defiantly defended the invasion, and it soon becomes obvious that the Soviets are hoping to convert Iran to yet another Soviet satellite state. During this time frame Ruth also reveals to Jimmy she is pregnant, and wants to keep the baby. When Jimmy informs his parents his father reacts somewhat harshly; his mother tries to point out all the options available to them. Jimmy informs his parents that he & Ruth plan to get married and have the child. Jimmy works for a carpentry firm; it is not clear what Ruth works as. Michael, Jimmy's annoying younger brother, humiliates him in front of his sister Alison by mentioning the upcoming pregnancy, which provokes an angry reaction from both Jimmy and his mother.Soon after, the U.S. states it will send troops to Iran if the USSR doesn't cease its invasion. The Soviets apparently ignore the warning, and soon after U.S. paratroops go in near the Soviet base at Moshad in northern Iran. Hoping the USSR will back off, the British prime minister issues a statement of support for the U.S. action. Unfortunately the USSR ignores the international condemnation, and as Ruth & Jimmy's...

Step 1: Identify the forces involved In this case, the downward force exerted by the bowling ball on the table is the action force. This force is due to the ball's weight (mass * acceleration due to gravity). Step 2: Apply Newton's third law According to Newton's third law, the table must exert an equal and opposite force in order to balance the force exerted by the bowling ball. Step 3: Determine the force exerted by the table The force exerted by the table must be equal in magnitude to the force exerted by the bowling ball, but in the opposite direction. Since the bowling ball is exerting a downward force, the table must exert an upward force.

By Jill Reilly PUBLISHED: 10:05 EST, 10 May 2013 | UPDATED: 19:31 EST, 10 May 2013 Jimi Hendrix wanted Sir Paul McCartney to form a supergroup with him – and be its bass player. He sent a telegram inviting the Beatle to join forces with him, jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and drummer Tony Williams in 1969, as the Fab Four were breaking up. It read: ‘We are recording and (sic) LP together this weekend. How about coming in to play bass?’ It was sent to McCartney at The Beatles’ Apple Records HQ in London on October 21, 1969, and told him to get in touch with producer Alan Douglas. It is not clear either how McCartney's melodic, subtle bass playing would have made its presence felt in a band that included Hendrix' guitar and","completion":"Davis' trumpet, but the prospect of such a collaboration is intriguing. While the telegram paints a picture of an impromptu recording session, it's likely that Hendrix, Davis, and Williams had discussed the idea beforehand. Unfortunately, McCartney never received the telegram in time. According to McCartney's aide Peter Brown, he was on holiday and didn't see the message until he returned. By that point, the weekend had already passed, and the recording session never materialized. The story ends with a sense of wonder and curiosity about what might have been had the supergroup come together. As history unfolded, each musician went on to achieve continued success in their individual careers. Hendrix, tragically, died less than a year later, in September 1970, at the age of 27. Davis and Williams both passed away in the 1990s, leaving McCartney as the sole surviving member of this group of legendary musicians. Fans can only speculate on the incredible music that might have been created if the original plan had come to fruition."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

And the answer is...","completion":"To solve the given equation, 10*x - 21*x + 198 = -158 + 37, we will follow these steps: 1. Simplify the equation. 2. Solve for x. Step 1: Simplify the equation. Combine the like terms on both sides of the equation. On the left side, we have two x terms, 10*x and -21*x. On the right side, we have two constants, -158 and 37. 10*x - 21*x + 198 = -158 + 37 Combine the x terms: (10 - 21)*x + 198 = -158 + 37 -11*x + 198 = -158 + 37 Combine the constants: -11*x + 198 = -121 Step 2: Solve for x. Now, we will isolate x by following these sub-steps: a. Subtract 198 from both sides of the equation to move the constant term to the right side of the equation. b. Divide both sides of the equation by -11 to solve for x. Sub-step a: -11*x + 198 - 198 = -121 - 198 -11*x = -319 Sub-step b: -11*x / -11 = -319 / -11 x = 29 And the answer is x = 29."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Johnston was born on 23 September 1994 in Dumfries, Scotland, the son of Andrew Johnston and Morag Brannock. He was given the extensive name Andrew Aaron Lewis Patrick Brannock John Grieve Michael Robert Oscar Schmidt Johnston. Johnston's parents separated when he was eight months old, and from that time he lived with his mother and three older siblings in Carlisle, Cumbria, in the north of England, where he attended Trinity School. Johnston tried out for Carlisle Cathedral Choir at the age of six at the recommendation of Kim Harris, a teacher at his primary school. He was auditioned by the choirmaster Jeremy Suter and accepted into the choir at the age of seven. Johnston's mother, who had no previous association with the cathedral, described her feelings of being overwhelmed by emotion at having her boy singing in such a \\"stunning building among those extraordinary voices\\". His mother also described Johnston's busy regimen of practice four times a week and all day Sundays, saying that it took up all of their spare time. However, she said that the cathedral staff became like a family to her son, and that \\"it was such a lovely, safe, close feeling for him\\". Johnston, who attended Trinity School, was subject to abuse and threats from bullies which drove him to contemplate quitting the choir, but he was helped through the ordeal by his choirmaster and the dean and canons of the cathedral. By the time of his participation in Britain's Got Talent, Johnston was head chorister.In September 2008, after his appearance on Britain's Got Talent but before the release of his first album, Johnston embarked on a tour of Norway with the choir, performing at Stavanger Cathedral and Utstein Abbey, among other places. The tour was conceived because the Diocese of Stavanger is connected with the Diocese of Carlisle through the Partnership for World Mission. This was Johnston's last tour with the choir.

However, the theory could not be implemented until advances in computing of the 1960s. He also created the field of cellular automata without the aid of computers, constructing the first self-replicating automata with pencil and graph paper. The concept of a universal constructor was fleshed out in his posthumous work Theory of Self Reproducing Automata. Von Neumann proved that the most effective way of performing large-scale mining operations such as mining an entire moon or asteroid belt would be by using self-replicating spacecraft, taking advantage of their exponential growth. His rigorous mathematical analysis of the structure of self-replication (of the semiotic relationship between constructor, description and that which is constructed), preceded the discovery of the structure of DNA. Beginning in 1949, von Neumann's design for a self-reproducing computer program is considered the world's first computer virus, and he is considered to be the theoretical father of computer virology.

Article: When prehistoric man arrived in new parts of the world, something strong happened to the large animals; they suddenly became extinct. Smaller species survived; the large, slow-growing animals were easy game, and were quickly hunted to extinction. Now something similar could be happening in the oceans. That the seas are being over-fished has been known for years and researchers such as Ransom Myers and Boris Worm have shown how fast things are changing. They have looked at half a century of data from fisheries around the world. Their methods do not attempt to estimate the actual biomass (the amount of living biological matter) of fish species in particular parts of the ocean, but rather changes in that biomass over time. According to their latest paper published in Nature, the biomass of large predators (animals that kill and eat other animals) inanes fishery is reduced on average by 80% within 15 years of the start of exploitation. In some long-fished areas, it has halved again since then. Dr. Worm acknowledges that these figures are conservative . One reason for this is that fishing technology has improved. Today's vessels can find their prey using satellites and sonar, which were not available 50 years ago. That means a higher proportion of what is in the sea is being caught, so the real difference between present and past is likely to be worse than the one recorded by changes in catch sizes. In the early days, too, longlines would have been more saturated with fish. Some individuals would therefore not have been caught, since baited hooks would have been available to trap them, leading to an underestimate of fish stocks in the past. Furthermore, in the early days of longline fishing, a lot of fish were lost to sharks after they had been hooked. That is no longer a problem, because there are fewer sharks around noise. Dr. Myers and Dr. Worm argue that their work gives a correct baseline, which future management efforts must take into account. They believe the date support an idea current among marine...

More gun violence plays out on the big screen in movies open to all ages than in R-rated box office blockbusters, reports FastCo.Exist. Researchers found that gun violence in PG-13 action movies is on the rise with Hollywood increasingly relying on shoot-'em-up scenes to fill seats. Building on an earlier study, they sampled 30 top-grossing films between 2012 and 2015 to determine the number of five-minute segments in which a character fires a gun at someone. Writing in the journal Pediatrics, they report the rate of gun violence in PG-13 movies in 2012 equaled that of R-rated films, restricted to 17 and older, and outpaced those films in later years. Kids of all ages are allowed into cinemas showing PG-13 movies, though parents are \\"strongly cautioned.\\" Some of the most violent PG-13 films were some of the most popular like 2015's Star Wars: the Force Awakens.\\" (See the full list here.) Of note: The authors say films often remove the consequences of gunplay. Thus, children and their parents are being \\"desensitized\\" to these effects, they contend, comparing on-screen bloodshed to behaviors like smoking and drinking that can young people often imitate. Previous research has shown that repeated exposure to violence on screen can make kids more aggressive. \\"We know less about the potential effects of films that glorify the use of guns,\\" the authors write. Until more is known, they say, pediatricians should advise parents \\"to be cautious about exposing their children\\" to violent films. (Violent superheroes can make kids more aggressive.)","completion":"Sometimes people think that PG-13 movies are less violent than R-rated movies. But guess what? That's not always true! Researchers found out that there is more gun violence in PG-13 movies than in R-rated ones. This means that even though kids of all ages can watch PG-13 movies, they can still see lots of violence. Researchers picked 30 popular movies from 2012 to 2015 to see how many times a character shoots a gun at someone. They found out that in 2012, PG-13 movies had as much gun violence as R-rated ones. In later years, there was even more gun violence in PG-13 movies. Star Wars: The Force Awakens is an example of a very popular but also violent PG-13 movie. The authors, or people who did this research, noticed that movies often don't show the bad things that happen because of guns. This can make kids and their parents less worried about gun violence. They compared it to how kids often copy behaviors like smoking and drinking that they see in movies. Studies have shown that watching violence on screen can make kids more aggressive. The authors wanted to make sure parents and doctors knew about this. They said that until we know more, parents should be careful about letting their kids watch violent movies. And doctors should talk to parents about this too. So, it's important to remember that even PG-13 movies can have a lot of violence and we should be careful about what we watch!"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

But now I want you to be among the first to know that I have made plans to renew and revive the Smashing Pumpkins. I want my band back, and my songs, and my dreams\\". Corgan and Chamberlin were verified as participants in the reunion, but there was question as to whether other former members of the band would participate.In April 2007 Iha and Auf der Maur separately confirmed that they were not taking part in the reunion. Chamberlin would later state that Iha and Wretzky \\"didn't want to be a part of\\" the reunion. The Smashing Pumpkins performed live for the first time since 2000 on May 22, 2007, in Paris, France. There, the band unveiled new touring members: guitarist Jeff Schroeder, bassist Ginger Reyes, and keyboardist Lisa Harriton. That same month, \\"Tarantula\\" was released as the first single from the band's forthcoming album. On July 7, the band performed at the Live Earth concert in New Jersey.The band's new album, Zeitgeist, was released that same month on Reprise Records, entering the Billboard charts at number two and selling 145,000 copies in its first week. Zeitgeist received mixed reviews, with much of the criticism targeted at the absence of half of the original lineup. The album divided the Pumpkins' fanbase. Corgan would later admit, \\"I know a lot of our fans are puzzled by Zeitgeist. I think they wanted this massive, grandiose work, but you don't just roll out of bed after seven years without a functioning band and go back to doing that\\". Corgan and Chamberlin continued to record as a duo, releasing the four-song EP American Gothic in January 2008 and the singles \\"Superchrist\\" and \\"G.L.O.W.\\" later that year. That November, the group released the DVD If All Goes Wrong, which chronicled the group's... Answer:","completion":"If All Goes Wrong"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Officers Benjamin Deen, 34, and Liquori Tate, 25, were killed in Hattiesburg city, said police spokesman Lt Jon Traxler. Local media say that both men died from their injuries in the hospital on Saturday night. Four people have been arrested over the killings, ending a manhunt of several hours. Warren Strain, spokesman for the Mississippi Department of Public Safety, said that 29-year-old Marvin Banks and 22-year-old Joanie Calloway had both been charged with two counts of capital murder. Cornelius Clark, 28, was arrested later and charged with obstruction of justice, the Mississippi Highway Patrol said, according to the Associated Press. Mr Strain said that Curtis Banks, the younger brother of Marvin Banks, had also been charged with being an accessory to the crimes. It's not clear what warranted those charges. Mr Strain told The Associated Press that Marvin Banks had tried to escape in a police car after the shooting. \\"He didn't get very far, three or four blocks and then he ditched that vehicle.\\" According to his mother, Mary Smith, Mr Banks has mental problems in addition to a drug addiction. She said that her son smoked \\"spice\\" daily and had been hearing voices ever since he was attacked and hit in the head with a pipe several years ago. She told AP that she has no doubt that Marvin killed the officers and said he looked high in photos after his arrest. \\"You could tell something was wrong with him,\\" she said, speaking on the steps of the courthouse, where she had come to find out more information about her sons' arrest. \\"I hate it for these families that he wasn't in his right mind.\\" The shootings took place after one of the police officers pulled over a car on Saturday, local reports say. \\"All I know right now is that there was a traffic stop and someone started shooting at them and both of the officers were struck,\\" Lt Traxler told AP. The number of shots and who fired them were still under investigation, he added. He did not explain why the car had been pulled over by police. Attorney General Loretta Lynch said Monday that the officers' deaths \\"is made even more tragic by the fact that, on the day they were killed this past Saturday, the country began observing Police Week - a time when we pause to remember and honour the more than 20,000 law enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of duty\\". The incident comes after the killing of a New York police officer last week. Brian Moore, 25, was shot in the head while attempting to question a suspect from his police car. In December, two officers were shot dead in their car in New York by a man who then committed suicide. The latest shootings come amid heightened tensions in the US over the police's use of force. Riots erupted in Baltimore earlier this month after the death of a 24-year-old black man in police custody. Six officers have since been charged over the death of Freddie Gray.

After the 1998 embassy bombings, the U.S. government tried to develop a clearer picture of Bin Laden's finances. A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering.

Answer the following question: Q: For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive what? Read this paragraph and choose the correct option from the provided answers: Nerve Impulse Transmission within a Neuron For the nervous system to function, neurons must be able to send and receive signals. These signals are possible because each neuron has a charged cellular membrane (a voltage difference between the inside and the outside), and the charge of this membrane can change in response to neurotransmitter molecules released from other neurons and environmental stimuli. To understand how neurons communicate, one must first understand the basis of the baseline or ‘resting’ membrane charge. Neuronal Charged Membranes The lipid bilayer membrane that surrounds a neuron is impermeable to charged molecules or ions. To enter or exit the neuron, ions must pass through special proteins called ion channels that span the membrane. Ion channels have different configurations: open, closed, and inactive, as illustrated in Figure 35.9. Some ion channels need to be activated in order to open and allow ions to pass into or out of the cell. These ion channels are sensitive to the environment and can change their shape accordingly. Ion channels that change their structure in response to voltage changes are called voltage-gated ion channels. Voltage-gated ion channels regulate the relative concentrations of different ions inside and outside the cell. The difference in total charge between the inside and outside of the cell is called the membrane potential.

You may not be interested in volunteering or attaining a job—that's okay. Helping out others is only a recommendation. However, many volunteers report that their work makes them feel good; some volunteer work can even help with self-development. Consider the benefits and drawbacks of volunteer work or jobs, and use this to decide whether you'll help others out. You don't have to get a job when you're a teenager—and when you're under a certain age, it's nearly impossible to find one—but that doesn't mean that you're unable to help out! Consider volunteering, doing odd jobs for others, or helping someone to learn something they don't know. This can do wonders to help other people! It will be helpful for future employment after college to have a job or volunteer so you can have valuable work experience. . Volunteering doesn't have to happen outside of the home. If you have an internet connection, you can volunteer online—for example, editing wikiHow articles about your favorite subjects. Are you interested in animals? Volunteer at an animal shelter or collect supplies for your local non-profit shelter. Are you good with people? Find a job or volunteer work that's oriented around talking to others. Can you design complex web pages with minimal effort? Offer to help others learn web design. Take your talents and interests and find something you can do based around those. It can be a great help to volunteer or work, and have fun at the same time! If one of your talents is that you're an all-A's scholar, see if there's a program at your school that allows you to tutor struggling students. If not, try asking families that have younger kids or advertising a tutoring service—you may get some great opportunities! It's okay to turn down a tutoring offer. If you can't tutor the neighbor's son because he's too loud and disruptive, or if you aren't good at a subject that somebody needs help with, it's okay to politely say, \\"I'm sorry, I can't do that job\\" or \\"I don't think your child and I work together very well\\". You can either choose to get paid for tutoring or do it for free. If you do choose to make it a job, however, don't overcharge. Few people will hire you if you charge ten dollars an hour! Some organizations will host activities to donate to certain causes—for example, walks to support cancer research collect money and donate it to groups that do cancer research. Other activities seek to spread awareness of illnesses, or acceptance of disabled people. Consider participating in these. Be sure you know what group the activity is supporting. Some groups are well known for being surrounded by controversy. Do careful research on an organization before participating in any of their events. You don't want to support something that causes more harm than good. You don't need to participate in giant volunteer organizations to make a difference. Consider doing basic things to help people have a brighter day—compliment your classmate's poem, tell someone they look fantastic, help somebody pick up their things if they drop them, hold the door open for others who are struggling to carry things, and so forth. Something that seems little to you can turn someone else's entire day around. Get out there, and help to make the world a better place by making others' lives more enjoyable!","completion":"The article encourages readers to consider the benefits of volunteering and helping others, suggesting various ways to contribute based on personal interests and talents while being aware of the organizations supported and understanding it's okay to decline if they feel unable to fulfill a task."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Despite her personal fears, Samantha would still tag along with Felicia because she could sense how much her friend enjoyed the lake boardwalk and the lively atmosphere it offered. It was a warm and sunny afternoon as the birds chirped softly in the backdrop of the laughter that filled the air. Felicia and Samantha sat on a wooden bench facing the clear turquoise water, which sparkled under the golden sun. Felicia stretched her legs, enjoying the warmth of the sun on her skin, as she watched children playing on the sandy beach and people splashing each other while on paddle boats, creating ripples like tiny waves across the calm surface. \\"The lake is so beautiful today,\\" Felicia sighed with contentment. Samantha simply nodded, though her grip on the edge of the bench was so tight that her knuckles had turned white. Felicia frowned, sensing her friend's unease, and decided it was high time to find a way to help Samantha get past her fears. \\"Hey, Sam?\\" Felicia began, her voice gentle and full of concern. \\"You know, I've been thinking. We've been coming to the lake so many times, and I've noticed how it makes you feel. I was wondering if you want to talk about it?\\" Samantha swallowed hard but didn't say anything right away, her eyes still fixated on the water.

I just want you to know that I'm here for you, no matter what.\\" Samantha let out a shaky breath, her shoulders slightly relaxed as she spoke. \\"When I was little, maybe six or seven, my family came to the lake for a picnic. I wandered off to explore and got too close to the edge of the water… and I slipped in.\\" She shuddered at the memory, her face turning pale. \\"I didn't know how to swim, and I panicked as the water closed over my head. I was so sure I was going to drown.\\" Tears began to well up in Samantha's eyes, but she continued. \\"My dad pulled me out, but from then on, I've always been scared of the lake… of any being near open water.\\" Felicia looked at her friend with a mix of sympathy and determination. \\"Sam, I'm so sorry. I had no idea. But you know what? I think we can work on this together.\\" Samantha raised an eyebrow, a hint of curiosity shining through her apprehension. \\"How are we going to do that?\\" Samantha asked, her voice barely above a whisper. \\"Let's start small. Let's just take off our shoes and socks and put our feet in the water. That's it. I'll be right beside you the whole time, I promise,\\" Felicia said reassuringly. Samantha looked hesitant, but after a few deep breaths, she agreed to give it a try. Together, the two friends walked to the water's edge, their hands linked for support.

So it’s all unfortunate. One dumb thing led to another .... and then becomes a big incendiary story.” Casale, 67, apologized after TMZ.com published the photos Monday and reported that real box cutters like the kind Al Qaeda terrorists used were given out as favors. “I understand why those pictures would offend people,” he told The News. “The cake was such bad taste.” Best known as a founding member of the pioneering post-punk rock band Devo, Casale said earlier a friend showed up with the cake and that it was a \\"surprise.\\" \\"I joked and said Krista and I are like the twin towers of love and love conquers all and we're going to resurrect those towers,\\" said Casale, who is 41 years older than his 26-year-old bride. Casale on Tuesday would not give up the name of the pal with the horrific sense of humor. “I don’t think he meant something bad,” he said. “It was a bad taste idea, but he obviously went to the effort to do something custom. Bad choice.” Deep apologies for all offended. There is a real explanation and its not what you think. Surprise cake and pix to TMZ was a set up. TBC... Asked whether in hindsight he should have immediately nixed the cake, Casale said “I don’t know what I would have done.” “Maybe no photos,” he said. “Let’s just get this out of here, get it cut up and move on.” ON A MOBILE DEVICE?

Sir David Frederick Attenborough (UK: ; born 8 May 1926) is an English broadcaster and naturalist. He is best known for writing and presenting, in conjunction with the BBC Natural History Unit, the nine natural history documentary series that form the Life collection, which form a comprehensive survey of animal and plant life on Earth. He is a former senior manager at the BBC, having served as controller of BBC Two and director of programming for BBC Television in the 1960s and 1970s. He is the only person to have won BAFTAs for programmes in each of black and white, colour, HD, 3D and 4K. Attenborough has been featured as the subject of a number of BBC television programmes. Life on Air (2002) examined the legacy of his work and Attenborough the Controller (2002) focused on his time in charge of BBC Two. He was also featured prominently in The Way We Went Wild (2004), a series about natural history television presenters, and 100 Years of Wildlife Films (2007), a special programme marking the centenary of the nature documentary. In 2006, British television viewers were asked to vote for their Favourite Attenborough Moments for a UKTV poll to coincide with the broadcaster's 80th birthday. The winning clip showed Attenborough observing the mimicry skills of the superb lyrebird. Attenborough was named the most trusted celebrity in the UK in a 2006 Reader's Digest poll, and in 2007 he won The Culture Show's Living Icon Award. He has also been named among the 100 Greatest Britons in a 2002 BBC poll and is one of the top ten \\"Heroes of Our Time\\" according to New Statesman magazine. In September 2009, London's Natural History Museum opened the Attenborough Studio, part of its Darwin Centre development. In December 2013, he was awarded the freedom of the city of Bristol. In 2012, Attenborough was among the British cultural icons selected by artist Sir Peter Blake to appear in a new version of his most famous artwork - the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover - to celebrate the British cultural figures of his life. The same year, Attenborough featured in the BBC Radio 4 series The New Elizabethans to mark the diamond Jubilee of Queen Elizabeth II. A panel of seven academics, journalists and historians named him among the group of people in the UK \\"whose actions during the reign of Elizabeth II have had a significant impact on lives in these islands\\". In May 2016, it was announced that a new British polar research ship will be named RRS Sir David Attenborough in his honour. While an Internet poll suggesting the name of the ship had the most votes for Boaty McBoatface, Science Minister Jo Johnson said there were \\"more suitable names\\", and the official name was eventually picked up from one of the more favoured choices. However, one of its research subs will be named \\"Boaty\\" in recognition of the public vote.","completion":"This text is about Sir David Frederick Attenborough, an English broadcaster and naturalist."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Does this mean that \\"The cloud was out.\\"? Available options: (a). no (b). yes","completion":"(a). No \\"The sun was covered by a thick cloud all morning, but luckily, by the time the picnic started, it was out.\\" This sentence does not mean \\"The cloud was out.\\" Rather, it suggests that the sun was out, implying the cloud that had been blocking the sun for the entire morning had either dissipated or moved, thereby allowing the sun to shine. \\"The cloud was out\\" is not equivalent to the original sentence because having the cloud \\"out\\" generally means that the cloud is present or visible, potentially blocking the sun. In the context of the sentence provided, instead, there's a change in the conditions; the cloud ceases to cover the sun by the time the picnic starts, suggesting the sunshine is now visible. The phrase \\"it was out\\" refers back to the noun \\"sun\\" rather than the \\"cloud.\\" This is due to the principle of proximity, which states that pronouns generally refer to the closest preceding singular noun. In conclusion, interpreting \\"The sun was out\\" as \\"The cloud was out\\" would be incorrect. The original sentence conveys the idea that weather conditions improved by the time of the picnic, with the sun becoming visible rather than being obscured by clouds, making the setting presumably more suitable and enjoyable for a picnic."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the person that made recorded works by more than fifty composers? ? Monteux made a large number of recordings throughout his career. His first recording was as a violist in \\"Plus blanche que la blanche hermine\\" from Les Huguenots by Meyerbeer in 1903 for Pathé with the tenor Albert Vaguet. It is possible that Monteux played in the Colonne Orchestra's 20 early cylinders recorded around 1906–07. His recording debut as a conductor was the first of his five recordings of The Rite of Spring, issued in 1929. The first of these, with the OSP, is judged by Canarina to be indifferently played; recordings by Monteux of music by Ravel and Berlioz made in 1930 and 1931, Canarina believes, were more impressive. Stravinsky, who also recorded The Rite in 1929, was furious that Monteux had made a rival recording; he made vitriolic comments privately, and for some time his relations with Monteux remained cool.Monteux's final studio recordings were with the London Symphony Orchestra in works by Ravel at the end of February 1964. In the course of his career he recorded works by more than fifty composers. In Monteux's lifetime it was rare for record companies to issue recordings of live concerts, although he would much have preferred it, he said, \\"if one could record in one take in normal concert-hall conditions\\". Some live performances of Monteux conducting the Metropolitan Opera, and among others the San Francisco Symphony, Boston Symphony, BBC Symphony and London Symphony orchestras survive alongside his studio recordings, and some have been issued on compact disc. It has been argued that these reveal even more than his studio recordings \\"a conductor at once passionate, disciplined, and tasteful; one who was sometimes more vibrant than the Monteux captured in the studio, and yet, like that studio conductor, a cultivated musician possessing an extraordinary ear for balance, a keen sense of style and a sure grasp of shape and line.\\"Many of Monteux's recordings have remained in the catalogues for decades, notably his RCA Victor recordings with the Boston Symphony and Chicago Symphony orchestras;...

With Josh McCown getting the start at quarterback, the Raiders began their 2007 campaign at home in an interconference fight with the Detroit Lions. After a scoreless first quarter, Oakland trailed early as Lions QB Jon Kitna completed a 13-yard TD pass to WR Roy Williams. Detroit would increase its lead before halftime with kicker Jason Hanson getting a 46-yard field goal. In the third quarter, the Lions continued with their early lead as Kitna completed a 16-yard TD pass to WR Calvin Johnson. Afterwards, the Raiders began to come back as McCown completed a 4-yard TD pass to WR Ronald Curry, followed by RB LaMont Jordan getting a 12-yard TD run. In the fourth quarter, Detroit responded with Hanson kicking a 46-yard field goal, while Oakland took the lead with McCown completing a 7-yard TD pass to FB Justin Griffith. However, as it seems to be for the Raiders, their lead wouldn't hold as the Lions scored 17 unanswered points (32-yard TD pass from Kitna to WR Shaun McDonald, Hanson getting a 23-yard field goal, and RB Tatum Bell getting a 14-yard TD run) to end the game.

James Buchanan Jr. was born in a log cabin in Cove Gap, Pennsylvania (now Buchanan's Birthplace State Park), in Franklin County, on April 23, 1791, to James Buchanan, Sr. (1761-1821), a businessman, merchant, and farmer, and Elizabeth Speer, an educated woman (1767-1833). His parents were both of Ulster Scottish descent, the father having emigrated from Milford, County Donegal, Ireland, in 1783. One of eleven siblings, Buchanan was the oldest child in the family to survive infancy. In March 1860, the House created the Covode Committee to investigate the administration for evidence of offenses, some impeachable, such as bribery and extortion of representatives in exchange for their votes. The committee, with three Republicans and two Democrats, was accused by Buchanan's supporters of being nakedly partisan; they also charged its chairman, Republican Rep. John Covode, with acting on a personal grudge (since the president had vetoed a bill that was fashioned as a land grant for new agricultural colleges, but was designed to benefit Covode's railroad company). However, the Democratic committee members, as well as Democratic witnesses, were equally enthusiastic in their pursuit of Buchanan, and as pointed in their condemnations, as the Republicans. The committee was unable to establish grounds for impeaching Buchanan; however, the majority report issued on June 17 exposed corruption and abuse of power among members of his cabinet, as well as allegations (if not impeachable evidence) from the Republican members of the Committee, that Buchanan had attempted to bribe members of Congress in connection with the Lecompton constitution. (The Democratic report, issued separately the same day, pointed out that evidence was scarce, but did not refute the allegations; one of the Democratic members, Rep. James Robinson, stated publicly that he agreed with the Republican report even though he did not sign it.) Buchanan claimed to have \\"passed triumphantly through this ordeal\\" with complete vindication. Nonetheless, Republican operatives distributed thousands of copies of the Covode Committee report throughout the nation as campaign material in that year's presidential election. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: What year was this created?","completion":"The Covode Committee was created in March 1860."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Options: - crash - accelerate - turn around - catch on fire - carry freight Explain why a human would choose \\"accelerate\\" to answer the question above:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the question and the options given. The question is asking what an airplane does before it takes off. The options provided are: crash, accelerate, turn around, catch on fire, and carry freight. Step 2: Eliminate the options that are not related to the airplane's takeoff process. - Crash: Crashing is an unwanted accident and not something an airplane does deliberately before takeoff. - Catch on fire: Fire is also an accident and not a part of the normal takeoff process. Step 3: Evaluate the remaining options. - Turn around: While airplanes may sometimes need to turn around on the runway or taxiway, it is not the primary action that precedes takeoff. - Carry freight: Airplanes do indeed carry freight as part of their function, but it is unrelated to the specific takeoff process. Loading freight occurs well before the airplane is even on the runway. Step 4: Identify the most appropriate option. - Accelerate: Accelerating is the action in which an airplane increases its speed on the runway, which allows it to generate enough lift and become airborne. This is the most accurate description of what an airplane does right before takeoff. Conclusion: A human would choose \\"accelerate\\" to answer the question because it is the most accurate and appropriate option that describes the primary action an airplane does just before taking off. Acceleration allows the airplane to generate enough lift to become airborne, which is the intended goal of the takeoff process."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

What is it about football that you find boring? Joe: I don't know exactly. I guess it's just that football feels repetitive to me. Essentially, you're just running, kicking, and aiming to score, and then doing it all over again. The whole thing just doesn't capture my interest like some other activities do. Peter: I can understand where you're coming from, but have you considered that there's a lot of strategy and teamwork involved too?

The hypothesis talks about a 5% population increase in that year. Explanation: In this case, both sentences are related to the population, but the hypothesis refers to a 5% increase, which is not explicitly mentioned in the premise. Part #4: Compare and classify the relationship. Usage: Classify the relationship as \\"Neutral\\". Explanation: Since there is no direct information in the premise to support or refute the 5% increase in population, the relationship between the premise and the hypothesis cannot be considered as \\"Entailment\\" or \\"Contradiction,\\" so it should be classified as \\"Neutral\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Although both questions concern the concept of gender, they are not paraphrases of each other. The first question asks whether the world would be better without gender roles, which are societal expectations and norms associated with specific genders (e.g., women are expected to be caretakers, while men are expected to be breadwinners). Eliminating such roles would lead to a more equal society, where individuals would have more freedom to act independently of societal expectations based on their gender. The second question, on the other hand, asks about a world without genders, which refers to eliminating the concept of gender entirely, not just the roles associated with each gender. In this world, there would be no distinction between male, female or other gender identities.

The Glory of Melaka: In the early days, if you were not a pirate or a mosquito, Melaka was not much of a place to live. The land was infertile, just a swampy plain, the river small and sluggish. But it had a sheltered harbor, protected from the monsoons by neighboring Sumatra. Later, the strategic location and deep-water channel close to the coast brought in the bigger vessels of the trade-wind traffic crossing the Indian Ocean. The first to realize the larger commercial potential, as so often throughout the country's subsequent history, were the Chinese. In 1409, under a new directive from Emperor Chu Ti to pursue trade in the South Seas and the Indian Ocean, a Chinese fleet of 50 ships headed by Admiral Cheng Ho called in at Melaka. They made Parameswara an offer he could not refuse: port facilities and an annual financial tribute in exchange for Chinese protection against the marauding Thais. In 1411, Parameswara took the money to Beijing himself, and the emperor gratefully made him a vassal king. Twenty years later, the Chinese withdrew again from the South Seas trade. The new ruler of Melaka, Sri Maharajah, switched his allegiance to the Muslim trading fraternity by marrying into the Muslim faith, wedding the daughter of a sultan in Sumatra. Islam won its place in Malaya not by conquest — as had been the case in North Africa and Europe — but by trade, dynastic alliances, and peaceful preaching. Bengali peddlers had already brought the faith to the east coast. In Melaka and throughout the peninsula, Islam thrived as a strong, male-dominated religion of individuality, offering dynamic leadership and preaching brotherhood and self-reliance — all qualities ideally suited to the coastal trade. At the same time, Sufi mystics synthesized Islamic teaching with local Malay traditions of animistic magic and charisma, though Islam did not become the state religion until Muzaffar Shah became sultan of Melaka (1446–1459). But the key figure in the sultanate was Tun Perak, bendahara (prime minister) and military commander. He expanded Melaka's power along the west coast and down to Singapore and the neighboring Bintan islands. He also had orang laut pirates patrolling the seas to extort tribute from passing ships. After Ailied district chiefs had repelled assaults from Thai-controlled armies from Pahang, Tun Perak personally led a famous victory over a Thai fleet off Batu Pahat in 1456.

Options: - eternal - religious - unpredictable - holy - monastic Explain why a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" to answer the question above: Answer:","completion":"A human might choose \\"unpredictable\\" to answer the question above because the question's context is centered around the potential outcomes of a particular method of raising an AI. In this scenario, James is concerned about the results of giving an AI a non-secular upbringing, and \\"unpredictable\\" best captures his concerns. Here's a detailed explanation as to why a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" among the provided options: 1. Eternal: This option doesn't refer to the various possible outcomes, but rather to their duration. In this context, \\"eternal\\" would erroneously suggest that the AI's behavior would have unchanging implications, which isn't the primary concern of the question. Thus, a human might dismiss \\"eternal\\" as it doesn't address James's worry about potential outcomes. 2. Religious: While religion is related to the issue at hand – a secular vs. non-secular upbringing – this option doesn't directly address James's concern about the results of the alternative, which in this case is a non-secular upbringing. Instead, it describes a characteristic of that upbringing, making it an unsuitable answer for the question. 3. Unpredictable: In this context, \\"unpredictable\\" pertains to the range and variability of results that could stem from a non-secular upbringing for an AI. This option implies that if an AI is taught religious values, there might be unforeseen consequences due to the diverse nature of religious beliefs and interpretations. These consequences could be positive or negative, but the uncertainty is what drives James's preference for a secular upbringing. As a result, a human might choose \\"unpredictable\\" as the most accurate answer to the question. 4. Holy: Similar to \\"religious,\\" this option mainly describes a characteristic of a non-secular upbringing rather than addressing the concern of potential outcomes. \\"Holy\\" simply denotes a religious or sacred aspect, but doesn't capture the essence of unpredictability that James worries about. 5. Monastic: This option, again, doesn't tackle the core issue of the question. \\"Monastic\\" is related to the lifestyle of monks and religious practices, but the term itself does not convey James's concern about unpredictable results stemming from a non-secular upbringing for the AI. In conclusion, a human would choose \\"unpredictable\\" as the answer to the question presented because it best encapsulates the primary concern: uncertainty about the range and variability of outcomes resulting from a non-secular upbringing for an AI.

Summarize the following: Bankruptcy is the process of eliminating some or all of your debts in exchange for either regular payments or a seizing of your property. Although it may not seem like an enviable option, it's the smartest way out of an underwater mortgage for many homeowners. When you file for bankruptcy, the foreclosure proceedings can be stopped with an automatic stay. In order to qualify for bankruptcy, you have to complete a means test, pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, as well as acquire the correct paperwork such as tax documents. There are essentially 2 different kinds of bankruptcy declarations, each with their own unique rules and specifications. As they relate to stopping a foreclosure, they are briefly described below: In chapter 7 bankruptcy, you ask to have most, if not all, of your debts discharged by the courts. In exchange for this discharge, the courts can take any property not exempt from collection, sell it, and distribute the proceeds to your creditors. With chapter 7, you won't be able to keep your house, but you will be able to stall the foreclosure for at least a couple of months. For chapter 7 bankruptcy, you will be able to keep your home if it is the only property you own and if you currently reside there. Though the debt will be discharged, you must continue to make payments on the home in order to keep it. If you do not make the payments, the lender can foreclose on the property. In some states, you will be able to discharge the debt and move out without any recourse, but in other states the lender may be able to come after you for the debt. In chapter 13 bankruptcy, you agree to a plan to pay back all or most of your debts over a certain period of time. The time you have to repay the debt, as well as the repayment plan itself, depends on how much you earn, as well as the types of debt you currently own. With chapter 13, you should be able to keep your home, especially if you think you'll be able to make payments in the future. The repayment plan usually lasts three to five years. S. Bankruptcy Court. Meet with a lawyer and declare your bankruptcy. Start making payments. After a while, attend a meeting of the creditors. This is a meeting between you and a bankruptcy trustee. However, your creditors may also attend. This meeting will give you a better sense of where foreclosure proceedings are at. Bankruptcy attorneys usually collect their fees before a bankruptcy begins because they don't want you to go bankrupt as a result of their fees. The fees could cost 1500 to 3000 or more depending on how complicated your situation is. Find an attorney who charges a flat fee and who has experience with bankruptcies.","completion":"Bankruptcy is a legal process designed to help individuals or businesses eliminate some or all of their debts, often as a last resort to manage their financial situation. Filing for bankruptcy can potentially halt foreclosure proceedings on a property through an automatic stay provision. This process involves completing a means test, attending pre-bankruptcy credit counseling, and providing necessary paperwork such as tax documents. There are two primary types of bankruptcy declarations relevant to foreclosure: Chapter 7 and Chapter 13. In Chapter 7 bankruptcy, the debtor seeks to have most, if not all, of their debts discharged by the court. As a result, the court may seize and sell non-exempt property to distribute the proceeds among creditors. Filing for Chapter 7 can delay foreclosure for a few months, but the debtor typically cannot keep their house unless it is their only property and they continue making payments. Chapter 13 bankruptcy involves creating a repayment plan where the debtor agrees to pay back all or most of their debts over a specified period (usually three to five years). The repayment amount and plan depend on the individual's income and the types of debt they have. With Chapter 13 bankruptcy, debtors are more likely to keep their home as long as they can continue making payments as stipulated in their repayment plan. To declare bankruptcy and stop a foreclosure, it's essential to consult a lawyer experienced in bankruptcies. They can assist with filling out and filing the proper paperwork, working out a feasible repayment plan, and representing the debtor during a meeting of creditors, which involves a bankruptcy trustee and possibly the debtor's creditors. Fees for bankruptcy attorneys typically range from 1,500 to 3,000 or more but vary depending on the complexity of the case. It's crucial to find a lawyer who charges a flat fee to avoid surprise costs or complications during the bankruptcy process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

As the Spice Girls prepare to reunite briefly next week for the premiere of their new musical Viva Forever! and a major new TV show, there’s a growing prospect this might not be the final chapter for the world’s most successful girl group. The pressure to get back together is being driven by Melanie Brown — Scary Spice — who has been in Australia judging a version of The X Factor there. In her first interview about the stage production and highly anticipated ITV Christmas special, she reveals: ‘I keep saying to the girls, “Let’s reunite and tour again!” I’m up for it and I’m always championing it.’ Getting back together? The Spice Girls - from left to right, Mel B, Mel C, Geri Halliwell, Emma Bunton and Victoria Beckham - could be considering a longer-term reunion. While Victoria Beckham was believed to have ruled out performing with her bandmates — Mel B, Melanie Chisholm, Emma Bunton and Geri Halliwell —again, their well-received outing at the closing ceremony of London 2012 may have changed that. ‘We didn’t get paid for the Olympics — we funded it ourselves, costumes and everything. It just goes to show how much we do get on and do like each other. But it’s easier said than done with our schedules,’ Mel adds. 'We're like sisters': Melanie Brown is said to be pushing for the group to get back together. ‘We’re like sisters. We can bicker and make comments to each other. We go through highs and lows together. We go through fallouts and make-ups and break-ups. That’s just the way we are.‘We’re five very passionate, creative girls. But we love each other and we’re like family. Well, the family you want to have.’ Mel could be referring to her high profile rift with her mum Andrea, who, I revealed, will not feature in the ITV documentary. ‘Not all the Spice Mums did the documentary,’ Mel says. ‘All I said during filming was that I adore my family. All of us love our mothers.’ ITV’s cameras followed Mel for a ‘few days’ and she found it emotional looking back at the band’s career. ‘It was really nice to be able to reflect,’ she says. ‘It makes you feel humble and appreciative of where you come from. I owe everything to the Spice Girls. I wouldn’t be able to live or travel like I do if it wasn’t for those four other girls.’ The world premiere of Viva Forever! on Tuesday at London’s Piccadilly Theatre will see the Spice Girls attend with their partners, including David Beckham. Victoria’s husband’s attendance has excited ITV producers because it means he will now feature in the Spice TV show. A star audience: David Beckham, left, will be joining his wife Victoria Beckham, right, at the premiere of Viva Forever! His schedule had. been up in the air as he planned his football future after LA Galaxy. But he has assured his wife, who will become Posh Spice again for the. evening, that he will be by her side. ‘Victoria’s. nervous about entering Spice World again, but she’s very proud of the. musical, so it’s important for her to have David there,’ my source. explains. For weeks, viewers have asked why Strictly Come Dancing’s judges have given Olympic gymnast Louis Smith tougher scores and critiques than his rivals. It was only after his near-flawless performance on Saturday that Len Goodman, Craig Revel Horwood, Bruno Tonioli and Darcey Bussell began to award him marks comparable to front-runner Denise Van Outen. I’m told that’s because staff on the show are well aware the heart-throb has been topping the viewers’ phone vote for weeks and is almost assured a place in the final on December 22. Tough critics: Olympic gymnast Louis Smith pictured with dancer Flavia Cacace on Strictly Come Dancing. My Strictly source reveals: ‘It’s been known behind the scenes for weeks now that Louis is a sure bet for the final. As a result, the judges knew there was no point giving him nines and tens every week because it would allow him no progression throughout the series. ‘To be truthful, they have marked him harder than the other dancers because he is a gymnast who has a natural advantage over a rival like Lisa Riley.’ While I don’t want to see the judges going easy on the celebs, it’s been clear to me they’ve been marking Louis, 23, down unfairly for weeks. If anything, that has only increased his support with the public. Barring a huge surprise over the next two weeks, it’s hard to see a scenario where he won’t become this year’s king of the dancefloor. ITV will premiere The McFly Show tomorrow night — a 1970s-style variety programme fronted by the popular boyband. If it’s a success, the one-off edition could be developed into a weekly series, featuring comedy sketches and performances. ‘It’s something we’ve been working on for a long time and we hope it could become something more regular,’ drummer and last year’s Strictly winner Harry Judd tells me.

The freshman took over the placekicking duties after Mike Fassel injured a hamstring during the offseason. But instead of shying away from collisions, Ohliger has made two tackles in three games.","completion":"Topic: Ryan Ohliger's performance as a freshman placekicker for Boston College and his tackling abilities. Ryan Ohliger, a freshman placekicker for the Boston College football team, has undoubtedly surprised many with not only his kicking abilities but also with his tackling skills, especially considering the circumstances under which he became the Eagles' starting kicker. Mike Fassel, the previous starting placekicker, had injured his hamstring during the offseason, and that is when Ryan Ohliger took his golden opportunity to showcase his talent on the field. Despite being relatively new to the college football circuit and having the added pressure of replacing an experienced player, Ryan Ohliger has demonstrated his skills to the fullest. His willingness to make tackles and avoid collisions in just three games into his college career has been an unexpected but impressive aspect of his playing style. Typically, kickers tend to avoid making tackles at all costs, and their primary focus is on accuracy and consistency in kicking. Ryan Ohliger has stepped up his game by showcasing his tackling abilities, having made two tackles in just three games played. This physical aspect of his game is noteworthy as it displays his fearlessness and confidence. In football, these attributes are essential for any player at any position, as it can significantly impact their performance on the field. Moreover, it is worth mentioning that Ohliger's tackling skills show his strategic understanding of the game. By handling the situation diligently, he is capable of sensing when the opposing team's returner is about to exploit a hole in the coverage. Implementing his tackles in these crucial moments reduces the chances of the opposition scoring a touchdown on the kickoff. The presence of a placekicker with such tackling abilities is not only admirable but can also have a positive impact on the team's overall performance. It provides an additional line of defense to the kickoff coverage, which can give coaches more options when strategizing and planning their playbook. Furthermore, Ryan Ohliger's willingness to get involved physically serves as a morale boost for the entire team. His teammates will respect and support a player who continuously pushes beyond expectations and contributes to the team's success. In conclusion, Ryan Ohliger's performance as a freshman placekicker for Boston College portrays a true embodiment of dedication, hard work, and the importance of seizing opportunities. His tackling abilities, while unexpected from a placekicker, have proven to be an essential aspect of his gameplay and contribute significantly to the team's overall performance. Ryan Ohliger's fearlessness and determination have set the tone for a promising college football career, and his tackling skills have become an invaluable addition to the Boston College football team."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Who did Fluffy protect? Answer the above question based on the context below: The story opens with Lazlo missing, and Clam and Raj relating the tale up to this point. The first segment reveals how Raj and Clam meet. They meet a common enemy, Edward, who is the camp bully. Most of the other campers follow Edward's lead and after a scuffle, Lazlo makes his appearance. What follows builds Edward's growing resentfulness towards Lazlo, and Lumpus' dissatisfaction with the three new scouts' behavior. After choosing to name their cabin after the jelly bean, Lazlo builds a totem pole to decorate their new cabin, when Lazlo hears an animal in distress. Given Lazlo's nature, he goes to help it, while Clam and Raj choose not to accompany him. Lazlo finds a bear with a pinecone stuck in his nose, and pulls it out, earning the bear's gratefulness. The bear, now named Fluffy, follows Lazlo home and he hides it in his cabin. When Edward tells Lumpus that Lazlo has left camp, they both attempt to confront Lazlo, but are instead met by Fluffy. Protecting Lazlo, Fluffy attacks Edward and Lumpus. While everyone hides in Lumpus' cabin, Lazlo follows Fluffy out of the camp; when Lazlo's torn Bean Scout cap is later found in a gory, flesh-like mess the next day, the others assume that Lazlo was eaten by the bear. When Edward can find neither the bear nor Lazlo, he concocts a story about how he scared Fluffy off by his \\"skills\\" after witnessing the bear devour Lazlo, and demands the camp's respect. The next series of scenes deal with both Edward spinning a web of lies, and Lumpus trying to come to grips with Lazlo's disappearance, but only due to his fear of Commander Hoo-Ha, not over any concern for the missing scouts.

He moved quickly to eliminate his strongest rivals, crushing them in 1600 at the great Battle of Sekigahara (near modern Nagoya). During its subsequent two and a half centuries of rule from the new capital established at Edo, the Tokugawa organized a tightly controlled coalition of some 260 daimyo in strategic strongholds throughout the country. The allegiance of this highly privileged and prestigious group was ensured by cementing their ethical principles in the code of bushido, \\"The way of the warrior\\": loyalty to one's master, defense of one's status and honor, and fulfillment of all obligations. Loyalty was further enforced by holding the vassals' wives and children hostage in Edo. All roads into Edo, the most famous being the Tokaido Highway, had checkpoints for guns coming in and for wives going out. One of the most effective ways of keeping a tight rein on the country was to cut it off from the outside world, to keep Japan Japanese. At first, Ieyasu Tokugawa was eager to promote foreign trade. He wanted silk and encouraged the Dutch and British as good, nonproselytizing Protestants just interested in trade. But he didn't like the Portuguese and Spanish Catholic missionaries, who he felt were undermining traditional Japanese values. He banned their activities in 1612 and two years later ordered the expulsion of all missionaries and unrepentant Japanese converts. Executions and torture followed. Converts were forced to renounce their faith by trampling crucifixes and effigies of Jesus and Mary. The Catholic Church has counted 3,125 martyrs in Japan from 1597 (beginning under Hideyoshi) to 1660. In 1635 the Japanese were forbidden, on pain of death, to attempt to travel abroad, and Japanese citizens already overseas were prevented from returning, in case they brought back subversive Christian doctrines. Western books were banned, as were Chinese books that mentioned Christianity.

Short movie review: take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture , and he 'll be your slave for a year Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic seems to be thinking positively about the movie. By stating \\"take any 12-year-old boy to see this picture, and he'll be your slave for a year,\\" the critic implies the movie holds a strong appeal for a specific demographic, in this case, 12-year-old boys. Although the review is brief, it conveys the impression that the film might be highly entertaining or engaging for the young audience, so much so that the experience might lead the boy to be immensely grateful or appreciative - metaphorically, 'a slave for a year'. This phrase doesn't mean that the critic necessarily thinks the movie has artistic merit or that it would be enjoyable for diverse audiences; it could be that it's seen as a film that primarily appeals to younger tastes due to its content, themes, and execution. However, within this context, the critic seems to endorse the film positively. They could be suggesting that the movie captures the youthful imagination, sense of adventure, or passion for a specific genre (like science fiction, fantasy, or action) that is often strong in boys of this age. However, it's important to delve deeper for a full appreciation. In the absence of specific details about the film's plot, style, performances, or other aspects, we can't be sure about the critic's view of the movie in a broader sense. For instance, does the movie have qualities that adults can appreciate? Is it well-made and original, or is it derivative but still exciting for younger viewers? What makes it so appealing to a younger demographic - Is it the action sequences, humor, or the spirit of adventure? These unknowns prevent us from forming a blanket judgement about the critic's overall view. In a comprehensive evaluation, therefore, while the original statement suggests a positive reception for a particular audience (12-year-old boys), it doesn't provide a complete picture of the critic's thoughts on the film's wider appeal, artistic value, or overall quality."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Conservatives are still the biggest party on Herefordshire council but they've lost their overall majority to a combination of independent candidates. When voters go to the polls on 7 May, they'll have a wide range of independent candidates to choose from on their local ballot paper, but when they look at their general election slip it will be a much narrower choice: Conservative, Lib Dem, Labour, UKIP or Green. Many of the people at our market stall said they were sceptical about the record of national political parties. Dorian, from Hereford, said: \\"We should scale back government, reducing expenditure and tax. \\"We should focus only on the police, the military and the court systems. And we should eventually get rid of those too.\\" The number of women in government is a major issue for Sue, who thinks there should be more. \\"They'd do a much better job at running the country than a bunch of men,\\" she told me. During the afternoon we had visits from people concerned about the future of the NHS, the impact of a possible EU exit on farmers and from people wanting to hear more about how politicians would help encourage tourism into the area. As with Kidderminster and Worcester, the NHS came out as the top issue among people who visited the stall.

(CNN) -- Sevilla have sacked coach Manolo Jimenez after their disappointing home draw to bottom-club Xerez on Tuesday extended the club's winless run to seven games. Despite lying fifth in the Spanish Primera Liga table, Sevilla were knocked out of the lucrative European Champions League by Russian side CSKA Moscow last week. Jimenez had also secured a Copa del Rey final against Atletico Madrid but it wasn't enough to save the 46-year-old's job. The club's sporting director Ramon Rodriguez admitted the decision had been difficult but said he had \\"done what I had to.\\" He told the club's official Web site: \\"It was an unavoidable situation and we had to find a solution, and the pain that it brings. \\"Tuesday was the end of the story but the decision comes from the image and dynamics of the team. Without doubt we are grateful to Manolo. He is an excellent professional, he has made all this possible and impossible. However it is obvious that he could not get a response out of the team. \\"Fortunately we believe that there is time. The growth and the ambition of the club is shown in the change of the manager. We are fighting for important things.\\" Xerez's injury-time equaliser on Tuesday meant Sevilla's last league success was against Real Mallorca back in February. Ironically, it is Mallorca who occupy the much-coveted fourth spot in the table that guarantees Champions League football next season. Jimenez took charge in October 2007 when former coach Juande Ramos left to take over at English Premier League team Tottenham.

He was nice enough and took the time to explain to me why it had stopped working and how he would fix this. After about 30 minutes he had completed this and then offered as a free service to inspect the electrical parts of the house. He went out back to the fuse box to look and then after inspection offered to show me what he had found. It was mid to late afternoon in the back yard and that’s when the sun is aiming straight to my back yard. I should mention we live in Texas. He went over ever single fuse and wire that we had and explained about the piping and all the other things that go with it and that what we have isn’t what is recommended anymore. Our house was about 9 years old at the time. We were back there for more than 90 minutes. I started getting very restless because I wanted to work on dinner, the sun was blazing hot and I needed to do many other things. It was coming up on 5 o’clock. He then went to his truck to write up an estimate. After 20 minutes or so he comes back and tells me it will be about 10,000 to fix our fuse box system.

Background: Odissi (Odia: odd'ishii Odisi), also referred to as Orissi in older literature, is a major ancient Indian classical dance that originated in the Hindu temples of Odisha - an eastern coastal state of India. Odissi, in its history, was performed predominantly by women, and expressed religious stories and spiritual ideas, particularly of Vaishnavism (Vishnu as Jagannath). Odissi performances have also expressed ideas of other traditions such as those related to Hindu gods Shiva and Surya, as well as Hindu goddesses (Shaktism). The theoretical foundations of Odissi trace to the ancient Sanskrit text Natya Shastra, its existence in antiquity evidenced by the dance poses in the sculptures of Odissi Hindu temples, and archeological sites related to Hinduism, Buddhism and Jainism. Context: The Buddhist, Jain and Hindu archaeological sites in Odisha state, particularly the Assia range of hills show inscriptions and carvings of dances that are dated to the 6th to 9th century CE. Important sites include the Ranigumpha in Udaygiri, and various caves and temples at Lalitgiri, Ratnagiri and Alatgiri sites. The Buddhist icons, for example, are depicted as dancing gods and goddesses, with Haruka, Vajravarahi, and Marichi in Odissi-like postures. Historical evidence, states Alexandra Carter, shows that Odissi Maharis (Hindu temple dancers) and dance halls architecture (nata-mandap) were in vogue at least by the 9th century CE. According to Kapila Vatsyayan, the Kalpasutra of Jainism, in its manuscripts discovered in Gujarat, includes classical Indian dance poses - such as the Samapada, the Tribhangi and the Chuaka of Odissi. This, states Vatsyayan, suggests that Odissi was admired or at least well known in distant parts of India, far from Odisha in the medieval era, to be included in the margins of an important Jain text. However, the Jain manuscripts use the dance poses as decorative art in the margins and cover, but do not describe or discuss the dance. Hindu dance texts such as the Abhinaya Chandrika and Abhinaya Darpana provide a detailed description of the movements of the feet, hands, the standing postures, the movement and the dance repertoire. It includes illustrations of the Karanas mentioned in NatyaShastra. Similarly, the illustrated Hindu text on temple architecture from Odisha, the Shilpaprakasha, deals with Odia architecture and sculpture, and includes Odissi postures. Actual sculptures that have survived into the modern era and panel reliefs in Odia temples, dated to be from the 10th to 14th century, show Odissi dance. This is evidenced in Jagannath temple in Puri, as well as other temples of Vaishnavism, Shaivism, Shaktism and Vedic deities such as Surya (Sun) in Odisha. There are several sculptures of dancers and musicians in Konark Sun Temple and Brahmeswara Temple in Bhubaneswar. The composition of the poetic texts by 8th century Shankaracharya and particularly of divine love inspired Gitagovinda by 12th century Jayadeva influenced the focus and growth of modern Odissi. Odissi was performed in the temples by the dancers called Maharis, who played out these spiritual poems and underlying religious plays, after training and perfecting their art of dance starting from an early age, and who were revered as auspicious to religious services. Question: Were there anyone in the Medieval who did not like this form of dancing?. Whats the answer?","completion":"The available historical and textual evidence suggests that Odissi dance was admired and appreciated in the medieval era, especially considering its prevalence in temple sculptures and its influence on Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain cultural expressions. However, it is possible that there might have been some individuals in the medieval period who did not like this form of dancing. As with any art form, personal preferences and tastes vary, and it is generally impossible to account for the opinions of every individual during a specific historical period. Additionally, religious or cultural differences might have led some individuals to disapprove of or not appreciate the form. Nevertheless, the prevailing evidence points to the widespread appreciation and admiration for Odissi dance during the medieval era. Its connections to religious expression, temple architecture, and spiritual poetry contributed to its prominence and influence in ancient India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Given the question: You are given a new situation: Mike is studying for his physics exam. He realizes that the best way to learn physics is to solve problems. To that end, he needs to to convert pressure of objects from one unit to another. In one problem, four scenarios are given for the same object, scenario A, scenario B, scenario C, and scenario D. In scenario A the pressure is given in Pascals. In scenario B the pressure is given in the atm. In scenario C the pressure is given in torr. Lastly, in scenario D the pressure is given in psi. and a hint : Pressures are given in a multitude of units. We've already discussed Pascals, and we know that another unit for pressure is the atmosphere (1 atm = 101.3 x 10 5 Pa). The third commonly used pressure unit is the torr (symbol Torr). 760 torr is 1 atm, but 1 torr is also the increase in pressure necessary to cause liquid mercury to rise by 1 mm. For that reason, torr is also commonly referred to as \\"millimeters mercury.\\" Another pressure unit commonly used in our everyday world is psi, or pounds per square inch, though neither psi nor torr are SI units. Please answer this question : Which scenario's unit would most likely be used in everyday world, scenario A or scenario D? The answer is:","completion":"Scenario D would most likely be used in everyday world. The reason for this is because scenario D's pressure is given in psi, which stands for pounds per square inch. Psi is a unit of pressure that is commonly used in many everyday situations, especially when dealing with tire pressure, hydraulic systems, and air pressure systems. Scenario A uses Pascals as its unit of pressure, which is the standard unit in the International System of Units (SI). While Pascals are widely used in scientific and engineering settings, they are less commonly encountered in everyday life when compared to psi. In summary, although Pascals (scenario A) are more commonly used in scientific and engineering contexts, pounds per square inch (scenario D) are more likely to be encountered in everyday situations, making scenario D the most likely unit to be used in the everyday world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Background: En Vogue is an American R&B/Pop vocal group whose original lineup consisted of singers Terry Ellis, Dawn Robinson, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones. Formed in Oakland, California in 1988, En Vogue reached number two on the US Hot 100 with the single \\"Hold On\\", which was taken from their 1990 debut album Born To Sing. The group's 1992 follow-up album Funky Divas reached the top 10 in both the US and UK, and included their second US number two hit \\"My Lovin' (You're Never Gonna Get It)\\", plus the US top 10 hits \\" Context: In 1995, En Vogue was amongst numerous African-American female vocalists featured on the song \\"Freedom\\" for the soundtrack to Mario Van Peebles' drama film Panther (1995). Also in 1995, while band members Cindy Herron and Maxine Jones went on maternity leave, Ellis recorded and released a solo album entitled Southern Gal, which spun off the top ten R&B single \\"Where Ever You Are.\\" The same year, the band also made a cameo appearance in Joel Schumachers superhero film Batman Forever. In 1996, En Vogue recorded \\"Don't Let Go (Love)\\" for the soundtrack to the motion picture Set It Off, directed by F. Gary Gray. Released as the soundtrack's lead single in the fall 1996, it became the group's biggest hit yet, selling over 1.8 million copies worldwide and becoming certified platinum by the RIAA. In response to the large commercial success of \\"Don't Let Go (Love),\\" the group steadfastly went to work on their third studio album. As the album was nearing completion, Robinson chose to leave the group in April 1997 after difficult contractual negotiations reached a stalemate. Despite Robinson's abrupt departure, Ellis, Herron, and Jones resolved to continue on as a trio. Robinson's abrupt departure from En Vogue forced the remaining trio to re-record several of her original lead vocals on their forthcoming album EV3, which was released in June 1997. A breakaway from previous projects, it marked En Vogue's first project to include a diverse roster of collaborators including credits from Babyface, David Foster, Diane Warren, Andrea Martin, and Ivan Matias along with regular contributors Foster & McElroy. Upon its release, EV3 received mixed reviews from critics, many of whom praised the band's vocal performances but were critical with overall production of the album. In the US, it reached the top ten in Germany, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom and debuted at number eight on both Billboard's Top R&B/Hip-Hop Albums chart and the Billboard 200 with sales of 76,500 units, the band's highest first-week numbers. Two further singles released from the album, \\"Whatever\\" and \\"Too Gone, Too Long\\", entered the top twenty and top forty the Billboard Hot 100, respectively. In 1998, En Vogue recorded the song \\"No Fool No More\\" for the soundtrack to Gregory Nava's romantic drama film Why Do Fools Fall In Love (1998). A top forty entry on the New Zealand Singles Chart, it was later included on the band's first compilation album Best of En Vogue, released in June 1999. A moderate success, the album reached the top forty in Austria and the United Kingdom. Question: Why did Robinson Leave? Answer:","completion":"Dawn Robinson decided to leave En Vogue in April 1997 due to difficult contractual negotiations that reached a stalemate. Her departure was abrupt, and it happened as the group was nearing the completion of their third studio album, EV3. The exact reasons behind the contract disagreements are not publicly known, but Robinson's decision to leave the group had a significant impact on the remaining members, who had to re-record several of her original lead vocals for the album. Despite the setback, Terry Ellis, Cindy Herron, and Maxine Jones chose to continue as a trio, and they successfully released EV3 in June 1997. Robinson's departure marked a turning point for the group, as they had to adapt to new dynamics and navigate their careers without one of their original members."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

After the breakup of his gothic rock band the Marked, singer and guitarist Billy Corgan left St. Petersburg, Florida, to return to his native city of Chicago, where he took a job in a record store and formed the idea of a new band to be called the Smashing Pumpkins. While working there, he met guitarist James Iha. Adorning themselves with paisley and other psychedelic trappings, the two began writing songs together (with the aid of a drum machine) that were heavily influenced by The Cure and New Order. The duo performed live for the first time on July 9, 1988 at the Polish bar Chicago 21. This performance included only Corgan on bass and Iha on guitar with a drum machine. Shortly thereafter, Corgan met D'arcy Wretzky after a show by the Dan Reed Network where they argued the merits of the band. After finding out Wretzky played bass guitar, Corgan recruited her into the lineup and the now-trio played a show at the Avalon Nightclub. After this show, Cabaret Metro owner Joe Shanahan agreed to book the band on the condition that they replace the drum machine with a live drummer. Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was recommended by a friend of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed the sound of the nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, \\"We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before I realized that the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined.\\" On October 5, 1988, the complete band took the stage for the first time at the Cabaret Metro. In 1989 the Smashing Pumpkins made their first appearance on record with the compilation album Light Into Dark, which featured several Chicago alternative bands. The group released its first single, \\"I Am One\\", in 1990 on local Chicago label Limited Potential. The single sold out and they released a follow-up, \\"Tristessa\\", on Sub Pop, after which they signed to Caroline Records. The band recorded their 1991 debut studio album Gish with producer Butch Vig at his Smart Studios in Madison, Wisconsin for 20,000. In order to gain the consistency he desired, Corgan often played all instruments excluding drums, which created tension in the band. The music fused heavy metal guitars, psychedelia, and dream pop, garnering them comparisons to Jane's Addiction. Gish became a minor success, with the single \\"Rhinoceros\\" receiving some airplay on modern rock radio. After releasing the Lull EP in October 1991 on Caroline Records, the band formally signed with Virgin Records, which was affiliated with Caroline. The band supported the album with a tour that included opening for bands such as the Red Hot Chili Peppers, Jane's Addiction, and Guns N' Roses. During the tour, Iha and Wretzky went through a messy breakup, Chamberlin became addicted to narcotics and alcohol, and Corgan entered a deep depression, writing some songs for the upcoming album in the parking garage where he lived at the time.

Review: Fashionably fragmented, yet infuriatingly half-realized character-study, an examination of the different personalities of two college roommates: a talented but undisciplined star basketball player, and a pot-smoking, womanizing rabble-rouser. We never learn why these young men are friends. They may share confusions about the world and their places in it, but they don't seem to have anything else in common. Making his directorial debut, Jack Nicholson--who also co-wrote the screenplay with Jeremy Larner, based upon Larner's book--doesn't introduce us to the characters with any clarity, nor he does shape the scenes to help us identify with anyone on the screen. There are some very decent performances here (particularly from newcomer William Tepper in the central role), but most of the picture is unformed (perhaps intentionally), sketchy or unsure. Bruce Dern plays the hard-driving basketball coach, Karen Black is the older, married lady Tepper is having an affair with, and Michael Margotta is Tepper's wayward friend (in an off-putting, over-the-top performance). Nicholson fails to set up the sequences with any particular flavor, preferring (I assume) to let the character interaction dominate the film's tone; his script is no help either, and as a result it is unclear whom we're supposed to sympathize with. Small, random moments do work (a supermarket fight between Tepper and Black, Dern visiting Tepper in his dorm-room, all of the scenes set on the court), however the entire third act of the picture is an excruciating mess. Hoping to juxtapose an all-important b-ball game with a sexual assault, Nicholson shows no style at his craft (nor does he earn points for chutzpah, as his staging of these events is squashy and ugly). When a director goes out of his way to humiliate his actors, one has to question his motives in doing so. Perhaps if \\"Drive, He Said\\" ultimately made some sort of powerful statement in the bargain, audiences could forgive the filmmaker for his lapses in judgment and taste. Unfortunately, the perplexing closer is as dumbfounding as much of the rest of the movie. *1/2 from **** Now, what is this review like?

The answer to the question: What part of the eye is enlarged in the animal that are not thought to have a good sense of taste? is inside the article: The whale ear has specific adaptations to the marine environment. In humans, the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In whales, and other marine mammals, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, whales receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The whale ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allow for greater directional hearing underwater. Odontocetes send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. The melon size varies between species, the bigger the more dependent they are of it. A beaked whale for example has a small bulge sitting on top of its skull, whereas a sperm whale's head is filled up mainly with the melon.The whale eye is relatively small for its size, yet they do retain a good degree of eyesight. As well as this, the eyes of a whale are placed on the sides of its head, so their vision consists of two fields, rather than a binocular view like humans have. When belugas surface, their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light; they contain both rod and cone cells, meaning they can see in both dim and bright light, but they have far more rod cells than they do cone cells. Whales do, however, lack short wavelength sensitive visual pigments in their cone cells indicating a more limited capacity for colour vision than most mammals. Most whales have slightly flattened eyeballs, enlarged pupils (which shrink as they surface to prevent damage), slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and, therefore, a very clear image of the surrounding area.

Write a summary based on this article: WASHINGTON -- The United States tortured al Qaeda detainees captured after the Sept. 11,2001 attacks, President Obama acknowledged Friday, in some of his most expansive comments to date about a controversial set of CIA practices that he banned after taking office. \\"We tortured some folks,\\" Obama said at a televised news conference at the White House. \\"We did some things that were contrary to our values.\\" Addressing the impending release of a Senate report that criticizes CIA treatment of detainees, Obama said he believed the mistreatment happened because of the pressure national security officials felt to forestall another attack. He said Americans should not be too \\"sanctimonious\\" about passing judgment through the lens of a seemingly safer present day. That posture, which he expressed as a candidate for national office in 2008 and early in his presidency, explains why Obama did not push to pursue criminal charges against the Bush era officials who carried out the CIA program. To this day, many of those officials insist that what they did was not torture, which is a felony under U.S. law. Still, Obama's remarks on Friday were more emphatic than his previous comments on the subject, including a 2009 speech in which he trumpeted his ban of \\"so-called enhanced interrogation techniques,\\" and \\"brutal methods,\\" but did not flatly say the U.S. has engaged in torture. \\"I believe that waterboarding was torture and, whatever legal rationales were used, it was a mistake,\\" he said in April 2009. Obama on Friday did not address two other central arguments of the soon-to-be-released Senate report - that the brutal interrogations didn't produce life-saving intelligence, and that the CIA lied to other elements of the U.S. government about exactly what it was doing. \\"This is a question about the credibility of the CIA and what they said about the effectiveness of this program,\\" said CBS News National Security Analyst Juan Zarate. \\"What we're going to see is, out in the open, further debate about the enhanced interrogation techniques that were applied by the CIA in the first and early parts of the Bush administration.\\" The president also expressed confidence in his CIA director, John Brennan, in the wake of an internal CIA report documenting that the spy agency improperly accessed Senate computers. There have been calls for his resignation by congressional lawmakers. ||||| A Senate official, who asked not to be named before the release of the report, said Sunday that its authors were saving their response to General Hayden, Mr. Rodriguez and others until the report was public so that they could review the facts they gathered and let Americans make up their own minds. Image Former President George W. Bush in August. Credit Brendan Smialowski/Agence France-Presse — Getty Images According to those familiar with it, the 6,000-page report by the Senate Intelligence Committee takes a sharply critical view of the C.I.A.’s interrogation of terrorism suspects in the first years after the Sept. 11 attacks, questioning the efficacy of torture and revealing more details about the program. It also suggests C.I.A. officers in the field may have misled officials at headquarters. Mr. Bush and his advisers have been largely quiet about the Senate report until now, and former intelligence officials worried whether the Bush team would defend them. Some former administration officials privately encouraged the president and his top advisers to use the report to disclaim responsibility for the interrogation program on the grounds that they were not kept fully informed. But Mr. Bush and his inner circle rejected that suggestion. “Even if some officials privately believe they were not given all the facts, they feel it would be immoral and disloyal to throw the C.I.A. to the wolves at this point,” said one former official, who like others did not want to be identified speaking about the report before its release. Another former official, who remains close to Mr. Bush, said the former president did not believe that the C.I.A. had misinformed him. “The idea that George Tenet, John McLaughlin, Mike Hayden and Steve Kappes would knowingly mislead the president and the country is absurd,” the former official said. Mr. Kappes was another deputy C.I.A. director during the Bush era. “This was not a rogue program. And nobody in our administration is going to throw the C.I.A. over the side on this.” The former officials said that neither Mr. Bush nor his advisers had been interviewed by the committee. William Burck, a former deputy White House counsel serving as a lawyer for Mr. Bush, was offered the opportunity to review the report on his behalf but only after it was written, at which point it was too late to offer meaningful input, former officials said. The offer at that point, they said, was declined. ||||| WASHINGTON -- Foreign governments and U.S. intelligence agencies are predicting that the release of a Senate report examining the use of torture by the CIA will cause \\"violence and deaths\\" abroad, the chairman of the House Intelligence Committee said Sunday. Rep. Mike Rogers, a Michigan Republican, is regularly briefed on intelligence assessments. He told CNN's \\"State of the Union\\" that U.S. intelligence agencies and foreign governments have said privately that the release of the report on CIA interrogations a decade ago will be used by extremists to incite violence that is likely to cost lives. The 480-page report, a summary of a still-classified 6,000 page study, is expected to be made public next week. \\"I think this is a terrible idea,\\" Rogers said of the expected release. \\"Our foreign partners are telling us this will cause violence and deaths...Foreign leaders have approached the government and said, 'You do this, this will cause violence and deaths.' Our own intelligence community has assessed that this will cause violence and deaths.\\" A U.S. intelligence official, who was not authorized to be quoted discussing classified intelligence assessments, said Congress had been warned \\"of the heightened potential that the release could stimulate a violent response.\\" That concern was seconded Sunday by former CIA Director Michael Hayden, who told CBS News' \\"Face the Nation\\" that the report could \\"be used by our enemies to motivate people to attack Americans in American facilities overseas.\\" \\"I am genuinely concerned by that, as was the secretary of state and the director of national intelligence,\\" he said. He also warned that the report's release could undermine cooperation between the U.S. and other countries on intelligence and counterterrorism. \\"There are countries out there who have cooperated with us in the war on terror at some political risk who were relying on American discretion,\\" he explained. \\"I can't imagine anyone out there going forward in the future who would be willing to do anything with us that even smacks of political danger.\\" On Friday, Secretary of State John Kerry urged the senator in charge of the report to consider the timing of the release, though Obama administration officials say they still support making it public. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, a California Democrat and chairwoman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, has not responded to reports of the Kerry call, though she told the Los Angeles Times in a story published Sunday that \\"We have to get this report out.\\" A congressional aide noted that the White House has led negotiations to declassify the report since April, and that both the president and his director of national intelligence have endorsed its release. The government has taken steps to beef up security at American posts around the world, said the aide, who was not authorized to be quoted by name and spoke on condition of anonymity. The report amounts to the first public accounting of the CIA's use of torture on al Qaeda detainees held in secret facilities in Europe and Asia in the years after the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. U.S. officials who have read the report say it includes disturbing new details about the CIA's use of such techniques as sleep deprivation, confinement in small spaces, humiliation and the simulated drowning process known as waterboarding. President Barack Obama has acknowledged, \\"We tortured some folks.\\" The report also says the torture failed to produce life-saving intelligence, a conclusion disputed by current and former intelligence officials, including CIA director John Brennan. Rogers questioned why the report needed to become public, given that the Justice Department investigated and filed no criminal charges. \\"What good will come of this report?\\" he asked. \\"There's been a Department of Justice investigation. It was stopped under the Bush administration. There has been congressional action to stop this activity. President Obama put an executive order saying he wouldn't continue any of that activity.\\" Feinstein told the Los Angeles Times that the harsh interrogations undermined \\"societal and constitutional values that we are very proud of. Anybody who reads this is going to never let this happen again.\\" ||||| CBS News has confirmed that the Obama administration is bracing itself for a Tuesday release of the long-awaited CIA torture report, though the timing ultimately remains at the discretion of the Senate Intelligence Committee. Sources familiar with the matter confirm to CBS News State Department Correspondent Margaret Brennan that Secretary of State John Kerry called and requested, but did not pressure, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, the chairwoman of the Intelligence Committee, to hold off on releasing the report. The administration has some concerns about the safety of diplomats abroad. Bloomberg View first reported the conversation between Kerry and Feinstein. The Intelligence Committee has been negotiating for months with the White House over redactions to the report, after it voted earlier this year to declassify it. The report, which examines the CIA's now-defunct detention and interrogation program, took five years to produce and is about 6,000 pages. Though the committee voted to declassify the entire report, the committee is expected to release next week just an executive report, which is hundreds of pages long instead of thousands. The report has led to profoundly tense relations between the CIA, and the Senate Intelligence Committee, the congressional body tasked with oversight of the agency. In March, Feinstein went to the Senate floor to charge that the CIA was spying on committee staff members who were working on the report. Kerry happens to be back in the U.S. this weekend, so he also offered to go to Congress to testify this week on the Authorization for Use of Military Force for the fight against ISIS. ||||| Summary:","completion":"A long time ago, after some very bad people attacked buildings in America, the United States government wanted to find out more about these bad people to keep everyone safe.

Please answer the following question: QUEBEC CITY — Emotions were on display when U.S. President Donald Trump met other G-7 leaders at their annual summit in Canada on Friday, but the discussions were civilized and diplomatic, according to sources. Trump held firm on asserting the United States is disadvantaged when it comes to trade with its European allies. “The other leaders presented their numbers and Trump presented his,” a G-7 official who spoke on condition of anonymity told the Reuters news agency. “As expected he did not budge. This is probably not because he does not understand, but because of domestic reasons.” At a bilateral meeting later with the summit's host, Justin Trudeau, the U.S. president joked that the Canadian prime minister had agreed to “cut all tariffs.” Despite the two leaders exchanging criticism of each other’s trade policies the previous day, Trump described the cross-border relationship as very good, stating “we’re actually working on cutting tariffs and making it all very fair for both countries.

[iv] endocytosis.","completion":"Phagocytosis, pinocytosis, and receptor-mediated endocytosis are the three types of [iv] endocytosis. Endocytosis is a cellular process by which substances are internalized into the cell by being enveloped within the cell membrane. These different types of endocytosis allow cells to ingest and transport various molecules and particles: 1. Phagocytosis: Also known as \\"cell eating,\\" phagocytosis is a process in which the cell engulfs large particles or even whole cells, usually for the purpose of breaking them down and obtaining nutrients or defending against pathogens. Immune cells like macrophages and neutrophils typically engage in this process to eliminate foreign invaders. 2. Pinocytosis: Sometimes referred to as \\"cell drinking,\\" pinocytosis involves the internalization of extracellular fluids, including any dissolved substances, into small vesicles within the cell. This process allows the cell to sample its environment, take in nutrients, and maintain a balance of fluids. 3. Receptor-mediated endocytosis: This is a highly specific and targeted form of endocytosis that depends on the recognition of molecules by specific cell surface receptors. When a particular molecule, such as a hormone or nutrient, binds to its corresponding receptor on the cell surface, the cell membrane forms a vesicle around the complex, allowing the molecule to be transported into the cell. This process is critical for cellular communication and the regulation of cellular processes."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question.

Question: Which English inventor was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in1764? Answer:","completion":"James Hargreaves, an English carpenter and weaver, was responsible for the introduction of the multi-spool spinning frame known as the Spinning Jenny in 1764. James Hargreaves was born in the village of Oswaldtwistle, in Lancashire, England, in 1720. He started his career as a carpenter but later shifted his focus to the textile industry as he was also a weaver. Hargreaves had limited formal education but was a skilled artisan with a keen interest in seeking innovations and improvements in textile machinery. The textile industry during the 18th century was undergoing rapid changes due to the onset of the Industrial Revolution. Prior to Hargreaves' invention, the spinning of cotton yarn was largely done using the traditional spinning wheel, which was a slow and labor-intensive process. One person could only spin one thread at a time, resulting in low production levels and slow progress in the industry. The Spinning Jenny revolutionized the textile industry by significantly increasing the production speed and efficiency of spinning. The Spinning Jenny was essentially a multi-spool spinning frame where several spools were mounted on a wooden frame and spun simultaneously using a single wheel. The original Spinning Jenny could simultaneously spin eight threads. Over time, the design was further refined to accommodate up to 120 spools in the later versions, allowing for a massive increase in productivity. Following the introduction of the Spinning Jenny, textile production greatly increased, making it easier for weavers to obtain yarn in larger quantities and thereby reducing the costs associated with producing textiles. As a result, the price of clothing and other textiles started to decline, making them more accessible to a broader range of people. However, the Spinning Jenny had its share of controversies. The invention garnered resentment from skilled spinners who felt threatened by the potential loss of jobs due to the mechanization of yarn spinning. Consequently, the rapid growth of mechanized textile production played a role in prompting the Luddite movement in the early 19th century. Despite the controversies surrounding James Hargreaves' invention, there is no doubt that the Spinning Jenny marked a significant milestone in the development of modern textile machinery and played a pivotal role in shaping the dynamics of the industry during the Industrial Revolution. James Hargreaves' contributions to the textile industry significantly impacted the socio-economic growth in the centuries that followed, transforming the way people lived, worked, and consumed goods."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

Theodore Roosevelt Jr. ( ROH-z@-velt; October 27, 1858 - January 6, 1919) was an American statesman and writer who served as the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909. He also served as the 25th Vice President of the United States from March to September 1901 and as the 33rd Governor of New York from 1899 to 1900. As a leader of the Republican Party during this time, he became a driving force for the Progressive Era in the United States in the early 20th century. His face is depicted on Mount Rushmore, alongside those of George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and Abraham Lincoln. In the 1896 presidential election, Roosevelt backed Speaker of the House Thomas Brackett Reed for the Republican nomination, but William McKinley won the nomination and defeated William Jennings Bryan in the general election. Roosevelt opposed Bryan's free silver platform, viewing many of Bryan's followers as dangerous fanatics, and Roosevelt gave campaign speeches for McKinley. Urged by Congressman Henry Cabot Lodge, President McKinley appointed Roosevelt as the Assistant Secretary of the Navy in 1897. Secretary of the Navy John D. Long was more concerned about formalities than functions, was in poor health, and left many major decisions to Roosevelt. Influenced by Alfred Thayer Mahan, Roosevelt called for a build-up in the country's naval strength, particularly the construction of battleships. Roosevelt also began pressing his national security views regarding the Pacific and the Caribbean on McKinley, and was particularly adamant that Spain be ejected from Cuba. He explained his priorities to one of the Navy's planners in late 1897: I would regard war with Spain from two viewpoints: first, the advisability on the grounds both of humanity and self-interest of interfering on behalf of the Cubans, and of taking one more step toward the complete freeing of America from European dominion; second, the benefit done our people by giving them something to think of which is not material gain, and especially the benefit done our military forces by trying both the Navy and Army in actual practice. On February 15, 1898, the Maine exploded in the harbor of Havana, Cuba, killing hundreds of crew members. While Roosevelt and many other Americans blamed Spain for the explosion, McKinley sought a diplomatic solution. Without approval from Long or McKinley, Roosevelt sent out orders to several naval vessels, directing them to prepare for war. George Dewey, who had received an appointment to lead the Asiatic Squadron with the backing of Roosevelt, later credited his victory at the Battle of Manila Bay to Roosevelt's orders. After finally giving up hope of a peaceful solution, McKinley asked Congress to declare war upon Spain, beginning the Spanish-American War.","completion":"This text is about Theodore Roosevelt Jr. He was the 26th President of the United States from 1901 to 1909, the 25th Vice President, and the 33rd Governor of New York.

Let the emergency room and critical care team to their job. Once they’ve stabilized you, they’ll attend to the burn wounds. Stabilizing a victim of third degree burns might include using IV’s, providing oxygen, intubating or ventilating an unconscious victim, performing CPR or using and AED defibrillator.. Debris like scorched clothing, along with dead tissue, must be removed from the wound as soon as possible in order to reduce the risk of serious infections or other complications. Based on the nature of your burn, you might be placed in a special tub for cleaning and debriding, or surgical procedures may be required. In ECMO, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, doctors will draw your blood in a plastic tube. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood, oxygen is added, and the blood is returned to the body. This treatment, along with a low-level ventilator to keep your lungs moving, will ease the workload on your lungs as they heal. Keeping the burn area warm and moist can aid in the healing process. This might be provided through specially equipped room heaters and humidifiers, fluidized mattresses, and other equipment utilized in the hospital’s intensive care unit (ICU).

Both Nicaragua and Costa Rica had large tract of pristine forests. They had one of the largest concentration of tropical species. In the 1980s Nicaragua started clearing up some of these forests. Instead, they have now vast tract of sugarcane production in that land. One can still visit Costa Rica where they kept those pristine forests intact. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country's indigenours animals would most likely survive and stay put? Hint: Besides anthropogenic productivity of the land, the biodiversity of degraded land also declines, as previously mentioned.[12] With less biodiversity, this ecosystem is less adaptable to when disasters strike it[11][8] It has a smaller available food supply, in terms of plants, for animals, who then may die out or more likely may relocate. Proof of this decline is that presently 15-20% of Tibetan Plateau species are now considered endangered; and now because of this animal and plant absence, the soil quality of these degraded lands is very poor.[1] It does not hold the necessary nutrients, such as water, nitrogen, and carbon, essential to either supporting life or inviting life back to that land.[6] As a result of such carbon and nitrogen loss in the Tibetan Plateau, 8,033/ha and 13,315/ha were respectively lost in economic terms. Soils are further weakened by dust storms whose frequency increases because of degradation.[11][4] Erosion of soil becomes a bigger problem, since no longer are there as many plants to anchor in the soil.

This is because Costa Rica has preserved its pristine forests, maintaining its biodiversity. In contrast, Nicaragua has cleared vast tracts of forests for sugarcane production, leading to a decline in biodiversity. As mentioned in the hint, degraded land with less biodiversity is less adaptable to disasters and provides a smaller food supply for animals. In these conditions, animals may either die out or choose to relocate.

In the majority of these species, fertilization also takes place outside the mother's body. The male and female fish release their gametes into the surrounding water, where fertilization occurs. Female fish release very high numbers of eggs to increase the chances of fertilization.

Bite-sized treats are good for training because you can give your dog more of them without feeding them too many extra calories. Also consider what your dog likes and what will motivate them: does your dog like soft treats or hard treats? Is there a certain flavor that your dog seems to respond to more? Figure out which treat works best for your particular dog and have them on-hand for training. Try making your own treats. These could be small pieces of cooked meat or even some fruits and vegetables. Don't overfeed your dog. Keep treat sizes as small as you can. Do not feed your dog the following food items, as they can cause poisoning or illness: avocado, chocolate, bread dough, grapes, raisins, hops, ethanol, moldy foods, macadamia nuts, xylitol, onions, garlic. The only way a dog can shake hands is if they are sitting. If your dog doesn't know how the command for sit, you will need to teach them to sit first. Don't reward the dog with the treat here, as you are teaching him how to shake, not sit. You won't be giving the treat to your dog just yet. For now, simply keep the treat in your left hand. Bring the treat in front of your dogs nose, showing it to him. Once you have his attention, close your fist around the treat. Don't let the dog grab the treat from you yet. Hold the treat between your thumb and your palm. \\" This is the command you will use to ask your dog to shake (you can also say something else like \\"Shake\\" if you prefer). Say this as you hold the fist with the treat in front of your dog. Once your dog realizes you have a treat in your closed hand, they will try to get it from you. When they make a move toward the behavior you want — such as lifting a paw to try and get the treat from your fist — say \\"Yes!\\" with a lot of enthusiasm and excitement and give them the treat. When your dog makes a move toward the behavior you want, immediately reward them with the treat. Ignore any other attempts your dog may make, such as sniffing or mouthing your hand. Be patient. Practice this way a few times until the dog is reliably lifting their paw when you say \\"Paw.\\" Once your dog is lifting their paw on command, you will want to take it to the next step. You should begin reward the dog only as they do something closer to your goal of shaking. For instance, if your dog lifts their paw higher than before, that gets a \\"Yes!\\" and a treat, but not before then. Continue in this way until the dog is offering their paw. Use this additional step only if your dog doesn't seem to paw at the treat in your hand. By picking up your dogs paw, and praising them during and after, you start to show your dog that pawing at your hand is rewarded. Hold the paw for a few seconds before rewarding.

Movie title: Battle for the Planet of the Apes Context: Set in a flashback in the former North American continent of the early 21st century in the year 2003, and told by the Great Lawgiver, this latest Planet of the Apes sequel focuses on the chimpanzee ape leader, Caesar (Roddy McDowall), more then a decade after he led the ape revolution in the previous film, 'Conquest of the Planet of the Apes'. In this post-nuclear war society, Caesar tries to cultivate peace between his simian peers and the surviving remains of humanity. A militant gorilla general named Aldo (Claude Akins) however opposes this. Therefore, he plots Caesar's overthrow and doom. Caesar is now married to the chimpanzee Lisa (Natalie Trundy), the female chimpanzee ape of the previous film, and they have a son, named Cornelius (Bobby Porter) in honor of Caesar's late father.Caesar regrets having never known his parents until his human assistant MacDonald (Austin Stoker) informs him that by viewing video taped archives of his parents, he can learn about the future. Caesar learns the archives are in the Forbidden City, once the city in which Caesar was enslaved, and is now in nuclear ruins.After obtaining weapons from an armory run by the orangutan Mandemus (Lew Ayres), Caesar travels with MacDonald and the orangutan Virgil (Paul Williams) to the Forbidden City and sneaks in to find the recorded archives. However, there are radiation-scarred humans still living in the Forbidden City, now under the command of Governor Kolp (Severn Darden), the former police chief under the late Governor Beck and who is now the current leader and governor. Caesar and his party view the video recordings of Cornelius and Zira (from 'Escape from the Planet of the Apes') and learn about the future of the world, but barely have enough time to study the tapes before they must escape or risk capture or death.Back in Ape City, Caesar assembles a meeting with the citizens to report his discoveries at the Forbidden City.

Teacher: Now, understand the problem? Solve this instance: It has been proved that each class is strictly included into the next. For instance, testing when we assume that the behavior of the implementation under test can be denoted by a deterministic finite-state machine for some known finite sets of inputs and outputs and with some known number of states belongs to Class I (and all subsequent classes). However, if the number of states is not known, then it only belongs to all classes from Class II on. If the implementation under test must be a deterministic finite-state machine failing the specification for a single trace (and its continuations), and its number of states is unknown, then it only belongs to classes from Class III on. Testing temporal machines where transitions are triggered if inputs are produced within some real-bounded interval only belongs to classes from Class IV on, whereas testing many non-deterministic systems only belongs to Class V (but not all, and some even belong to Class I). The inclusion into Class I does not require the simplicity of the assumed computation model, as some testing cases involving implementations written in any programming language, and testing implementations defined as machines depending on continuous magnitudes, have been proved to be in Class I.

Based on the sentence \\"Heavy equipment leveling the sand on a nice beach.\\", is the sentence \\"People are working today.\\" a true sentence?","completion":"The sentence \\"People are working today.\\" cannot be directly confirmed as true based solely on the information provided in the sentence \\"Heavy equipment leveling the sand on a nice beach.\\" To analyze the correlation between these two sentences, let's break them down and elaborate on the possible scenarios. The first sentence, \\"Heavy equipment leveling the sand on a nice beach,\\" provides information about an action involving heavy machinery and the location where it is taking place. Although we understand that heavy equipment is performing the task, it does not explicitly mention people operating the machinery, nor does it specify the time or date of the event. The second sentence, \\"People are working today,\\" focuses on people working on a particular day. It does not establish whether the people working are related to those operating the heavy equipment, or if they are involved in another profession entirely. Furthermore, the sentence does not provide any context to the type of work being performed, the location, or whether it occurs during the same time period as the beach leveling. Considering these factors, we cannot definitively conclude that the sentence \\"People are working today.\\" is true based only on the given context. Although it is reasonable to assume that people are operating the heavy equipment mentioned in the first sentence, that simply isn't enough evidence to confirm that the second sentence is true. However, if we were to expand the context of the sentences to accommodate general scenarios, it would be reasonable to interpret that people might be working during the leveling of the sand on a beach, either operating the machinery or performing other tasks related to the process. In this case, it could be deemed plausible that people are working today, but it is important to remember that we cannot draw conclusive evidence from the provided sentence alone, without any additional information or context."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Avenged Sevenfold (sometimes abbreviated as A7X) is an American heavy metal band from Huntington Beach, California, formed in 1999. The band's current lineup consists of lead vocalist M. Shadows, rhythm guitarist and backing vocalist Zacky Vengeance, lead guitarist and backing vocalist Synyster Gates, bassist and backing vocalist Johnny Christ, and drummer Brooks Wackerman. Avenged Sevenfold is known for its diverse rock sound and dramatic imagery in album covers and merchandise. Avenged Sevenfold emerged with a metalcore sound on the band's debut Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and continued this sound through their second album Waking the Fallen. The band's influences include Guns N' Roses, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, Pantera, Bad Religion, Dream Theater, Motorhead, Metallica, Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, The Rolling Stones, In Flames, At the Gates, Helloween, Queensryche, System of a Down, AC/DC, NOFX, Alice in Chains, Black Flag, Corrosion of Conformity, Suicidal Tendencies, Misfits, Slayer, The Vandals, Soundgarden, Rage Against the Machine, Korn, Slipknot, Deftones, Beastie Boys, Biohazard, Type O Negative, Anthrax and AFI. The band has been categorized under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music has evolved over most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in \\"Streets\\", which shows a punk rock style, and \\"Warmness on the Soul\\", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: \\"When I met the band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after that is going to be all singing'.\\" On City of Evil, Avenged Sevenfold's third album, the band chose to abandon the metalcore genre, using a more hard rock and heavy metal style. Avenged Sevenfold's self-titled album, however, has some experiments with other music genres than that from City of Evil, most notably in \\"Dear God\\", which shows a country style and \\"A Little Piece of Heaven\\", which is circled within the influence of Broadway show tunes, using primarily brass instruments and stringed orchestra to take over most of the role of the lead and rhythm guitar. Nightmare contains further deviations, including a piano ballad called \\"Fiction\\", progressive metal-oriented track \\"Save Me\\" and a heavy metal sound with extreme vocals and heavier instrumentation on \\"God Hates Us\\". The band's sixth studio album Hail to the King shows more of a classic metal sound and a riff-oriented approach. On their newest album The Stage, the band explores further into progressive metal, blending it with elements of thrash metal. In the past, Avenged Sevenfold has also been described as alternative metal, screamo, and pop punk metal. The band has been criticized for \\"not being metal enough\\". Vocalist M. Shadows responded to this with, \\"we play music for the sake of music, not so that we can be labeled a metal band. That's like telling us we aren't punk enough. Who cares?\\" Avenged Sevenfold is one of the notable acts of the New Wave of American Heavy Metal.Answer this question using a quote from the following article: Did they have other bands that they styled their sound from?","completion":"Yes, Avenged Sevenfold had other bands that they styled their sound from.

Rose, an autodidact with a dominating presence, supervised his music and literature studies and engaged other tutors for languages, art and drama. From his earliest lessons, Percy developed a lifelong fascination with Nordic culture; writing late in life, he said that the Icelandic Saga of Grettir the Strong was \\"the strongest single artistic influence on my life\\". As well as showing precocious musical talents, he displayed considerable early gifts as an artist, to the extent that his tutors thought his future might lie in art rather than music. At the age of 10 he began studying piano under Louis Pabst, a German immigrant then considered to be Melbourne's leading piano teacher. Grainger's first known composition, \\"A Birthday Gift to Mother\\", is dated 1893. Pabst arranged Grainger's first public concert appearances, at Melbourne's Masonic Hall in July and September 1894. The boy played works by Bach, Beethoven, Schumann and Scarlatti, and was warmly complimented in the Melbourne press.After Pabst returned to Europe in the autumn of 1894, Grainger's new piano tutor, Adelaide Burkitt, arranged for his appearances at a series of concerts in October 1894, at Melbourne's Royal Exhibition Building. The size of this enormous venue horrified the young pianist; nevertheless, his performance delighted the Melbourne critics, who dubbed him \\"the flaxen-haired phenomenon who plays like a master\\". This public acclaim helped Rose to decide that her son should continue his studies at the Hoch Conservatory in Frankfurt, Germany, an institution recommended by William Laver, head of piano studies at Melbourne's Conservatorium of music.

He rushed into the classical music scene at the age of 12 after Itzhak Perlman, the famed violinist, heard him play. But nothing in his family history explains where Haimovitz got his extraordinary talent. And that's typical, Ellen Winner, a professor says. \\"People are fascinated by these children because they don't understand where their talent came from. You will see parents who say, 'I wasn't like this, and my husband wasn't like this.' It seems to sometimes just come out of the blue,\\" Winner says. It's not clear whether a prodigy's brain is any different from the brains of other children, in part because there have been no study comparing the brains of prodigies to those of average people. \\"But I believe that anything that shows up so early, without training, has got to be either a genetic or some other biological basis,\\" Winner says. \\"If a child suddenly at the age of 3 goes to the piano and picks out a tune and does it beautifully, that has to be because that child has a different brain.\\" Children who are extremely gifted tend to be socially different, too, Winner says. \\"They feel like they can't find other kids like themselves, so they feel strange, maybe even like a freak, and feel like they don't have anybody to connect with.

The Christmas season has long been celebrated around the world as a time for families and communities to come together to rejoice and share in the spirit of giving and love. One of the most dearly held traditions during this time is the gathering of family members on Christmas Eve: the evening before Christmas Day, when the birth of Jesus Christ is commemorated. In many cultures, it is customary for families to come together on this special night to share a festive meal, exchange gifts, and participate in a variety of activities that highlight the importance of togetherness. One such activity is singing Christmas carols, which are songs performed in celebration of the Christmas season and the birth of Jesus. Caroling is believed to have originated in Europe during the medieval period, where groups of singers would travel from house to house, singing hymns and spreading holiday cheer. Over time, the tradition evolved and became more focused on bringing family and friends together on Christmas Eve, as they joined their voices in song to celebrate the true meaning of the holiday. The birth of Jesus is honored through these Christmas carols, many of which contain lyrics retelling the story of his miraculous arrival in Bethlehem. During these gatherings, family members young and old may take turns singing their favorite Christmas carols or performing them on musical instruments. Some families also invite friends and neighbors to join in the celebration, further fostering a sense of community and togetherness during this special time of year. In addition to singing, families may participate in other traditional activities on Christmas Eve, such as decorating the Christmas tree, attending a midnight church service, or enjoying a special meal. This meal may consist of traditional dishes from the family's cultural heritage, or it may simply be a feast featuring the family's favorite foods. Whatever form these activities take, their purpose is the same: to bring loved ones together in a spirit of joy and gratitude, in celebration of the birth of Jesus Christ. In conclusion, the tradition of gathering at home on Christmas Eve to sing songs and have fun in honor of the birth of Jesus stems from a long and cherished history of families and communities coming together to celebrate this special time of year. The sharing of songs, stories, food, and gifts serves as a powerful symbol of unity and love, reminding us all of the deeper meaning behind the Christmas season, and the values that bring us together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article that answers the following question: How many different Queens were mentioned?","completion":"Title: The Royal Spectrum: A Comprehensive Look at Queens Through History Introduction Queens have long been a symbol of power, regality, and grace in human history. Across the globe, a wide assortment of queens – both real and legendary – have graced the pages of historical records, literature, and folklore. These influential women have forever left their mark on the world, as they have contributed to the advancement of politics, culture, and society in their respective nations. In this article, we will attempt to delve deep into the rich tapestry of history to explore and enumerate the various queens mentioned throughout time. A disclaimer: Given the vast abundance of queens who have been documented, this article shall only provide a snapshot of the most prominent figures to have ever donned the royal crown. Let's begin our fascinating journey. Methodology To answer the question of how many different queens have been mentioned, we delved into a wide range of resources, including academic databases, historical accounts, biographies, and literary references. We classified the queens based on their geopolitical regions and the time frames in which they reigned. We have also included queens who played significant roles in mythology and popular culture. The Queens of Europe Europe, being the birthplace of countless monarchies, has seen more than its fair share of queens. Some of the most prominent historical figures in European history include: 1. Queen Elizabeth I of England (1533-1603): Often regarded as one of the most influential queens in history, Elizabeth I oversaw the growth and prosperity of England during the Elizabethan Era. 2. Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom (1819-1901): Under Victoria's reign, Britain transformed into a global superpower, expanding its empire and industrializing its economy. 3. Catherine the Great of Russia (1729-1796): Catherine significantly expanded the borders of her vast empire and promoted education, arts, and sciences. 4. Isabella I of Castile (1451-1504): As a strong and effective ruler, Queen Isabella united Spain and oversaw the discovery of the New World by Christopher Columbus. Queens of the Middle Ages and ancient European history also captured the fascination of many, such as Eleanor of Aquitaine (1122-1204), Matilda of Flanders (1032-1083), and one of history's earliest queens, Boudica (circa 30-60 AD) of the British Celtic Iceni tribe. Queens of Asia, Africa, and the Americas Asian history, particularly that of ancient civilizations, has also produced significant queens who displayed immense power and influence. Notable examples include: 1. Empress Wu Zetian of China (624-705): As the only female emperor in Chinese history, Wu Zetian ruled during the Tang Dynasty and expanded the empire during her reign. 2. Queen Seondeok of Silla (606-647): Seondeok is revered as Korea's first queen regnant – a capable leader who laid the groundwork for the unification of the three Korean kingdoms. In Africa, queens such as Cleopatra VII of Egypt (69-30 BC), Amanitore of Nubia (circa 50 CE), and Yaa Asantewaa of the Ashanti Empire (circa 1660-1720) have gone down in history for their military prowess, strong leadership, and cultural impact. Queens from the Americas, such as the Aztec Queen Xochitl, Inca Queen Coya, and Anacaona of Haiti, have also significantly contributed to their respective civilizations. Mythological and Legendary Queens Mythology and folklore are replete with tales of powerful queens who have captured the imagination of people across generations. Some popular examples include: 1. Queen Himiko of Japan: This legendary queen has long been associated with mystery and myth, having ruled Japan during the third century. 2. Helen of Troy: Often hailed as the \\"face that launched a thousand ships,\\" Helen was an enchanting queen whose beauty was believed to have ignited the devastating Trojan War. 3. Queen Guinevere of Britain: This queen is a central figure in the Arthurian legend, famous for her love affair with Sir Lancelot. Conclusion So, how many different queens were mentioned? The answer is a staggering number - hundreds, if not thousands. Each queen, real or legendary, has her own unique story that has helped shape human history and inspire countless others. Compiling a complete list remains a Herculean task; however, this article aimed to provide a glimpse into the lives of some of the most iconic queens who have, in one way or another, left an indelible mark on the rich tapestry of our global heritage."},{"prompt":"Given a definition of a task and a sample input, break the definition into small parts.

With a budget of 329 million, LSC provides civil legal assistance to low-income people in every county in America, Kleiman said. NLAP was created in 1968. A decade later, the agency used a 50,000 LSC grant to buy a building at 438 King St. in Charleston and 33,000 to buy a building at 201 King St. in Georgetown, according to Erlenborn's letter to Kaynard. In 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway, the letter said. On Nov. 14, 2001, NLAP transferred title of the King Street building in Charleston to the Charleston County Bar Association, according to county property records. The local bar paid 5 for the building, which sits between a redeveloped office building and an antique shop. The local bar said it would maintain the building for \\"legal services to indigent residents of Charleston County and coastal South Carolina,\\" the records said. The King Street building appears to be vacant. Notices at the entrance direct visitors to the equal justice center on West Montague Avenue in North Charleston. E. Douglas Pratt-Thomas, president of the local bar, was not available for comment. Charleston County has not appraised the King Street property because it is tax-exempt. But Randall Goldman, managing partner of Patrick Properties, which owns buildings from 440 to 456 King St., said he estimates 438 King St. would sell for between 700,000 and 900,000. \\"That building, which was purchased solely with federal legal aid dollars, should be used to provide legal services for poor people in South Carolina,\\" Kleiman said. LSC wants the title to go to the equal justice center in Charleston or \\"we want 100 percent of the proceeds from the sale of the building to stay in Charleston. We are not contemplating taking that money out of South Carolina,\\" he said. Kleiman said if the neighborhood legal program in Charleston \\"had honored their obligation, this would not be an issue.\\" Question: \\"How many years after buying buildings in Charleston and Georgetown did the NLAP buy again?\\" Answer: \\"12 years\\" Is this answer correct? (A). no (B). yes...I think the answer is","completion":"(B). yes The answer is correct. According to the text, NLAP bought buildings in Charleston (438 King St.) and Georgetown (201 King St.) in 1978, a decade after its creation in 1968. They used the 50,000 LSC grant for the purchase. Later, in 1980, NLAP used 63,000 in LSC funds to buy property at 607 Main St. in Conway. We can deduce that the period between the first two purchases (1978) and the last one (1980) is 2 years, not 12 years.

Although thoroughly institutionalized, Karl is deemed fit to be released into the outside world. Prior to his release, he is interviewed by a local college newspaper reporter, to whom he recounts committing the murders with a Kaiser blade, saying, \\"Some folks call it a sling blade. I call it a kaiser blade.\\" Karl says he thought the man was raping his mother. When he discovered that his mother was a willing participant in the affair, he killed her also. Thanks to the doctor in charge of his institutionalization (James Hampton), Karl lands a job at a repair shop in the small town where he was born and raised. He befriends 12-year-old Frank Wheatley (Lucas Black) and shares some of the details of his past, including the killings. Frank reveals that his father was killed - hit by a train - leaving him and his mother on their own. He later admits that he lied, and that his father committed suicide. Frank introduces Karl to his mother, Linda (Natalie Canerday), as well as her gay friend, Vaughan Cunningham (John Ritter), the manager of the dollar store where she is employed. Despite Vaughan's concerns about Karl's history in the mental hospital, Linda allows him to move into her garage, which angers Linda's abusive alcoholic boyfriend, Doyle Hargraves (Dwight Yoakam). Karl bonds with Linda, who makes him biscuits to eat, and also with Vaughan, who tells Karl that a gay man and a mentally challenged man face similar obstacles of intolerance and ridicule in small-town America. Karl quickly becomes a father figure to Frank, who misses his father and despises Doyle.

Given the question: Jonathan Swift said, “Everybody wants to live forever, but nobody wants to grow old.” Wouldn’t it be nice if we could stay healthy and young and live as long as possible? Because that is a deep down desire of the majority, many people are always on a quest to slow down the aging process. So, our question for today is: What are the Anti-Aging Benefits of the Mediterranean Diet? First, we must acknowledge that no diet in the world can halt or slow the aging process. Aging is inevitable and food is not the elixir of life – although the type of food you choose can lengthen or shorten your life. What has been proven by numerous studies is that the Mediterranean diet lessens your risks of getting certain diseases. It also offers a range of health benefits that will allow you to age in a healthy way. When you whole-heartedly adopt the Mediterranean way of eating, you will reduce your risk of health problems such as Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, stroke, heart diseases, etc. That alone can be classified as anti-aging. Old age is often associated with health problems. If you can grow old and maintain your health, that would be a fine way to live. The Mediterranean diet can help you do that. Unfortunately, the standard diet for most Americans is filled with junk food, sugary sodas, fast foods and processed, additive-filled food, etc. – basically empty calories. Obesity is an epidemic. People eat whatever is the most convenient with little regard for their health. This is very upsetting and dangerous for the population as a whole. There is a wide assumption that healthy food is not delicious. People believe that to eat healthy they must live on a steady diet of raw carrots and steamed chicken breasts. As a result, they choose not to do so. They would much rather have a fast-food burger and cheese fries – it’s easier and tastier. What will likely happen to those who continue to eat burgers and cheese fries? A. not enough information B. they will have an increased risk of disease C. they will enjoy their food more D. they will be healthier than those who don't The answer is:","completion":"B. they will have an increased risk of disease"},{"prompt":"Carson was trying to figure out how to get to their wife's workplace.

Movie title: The Virgin Suicides Context: The story takes place in the suburbs of Grosse Pointe, Michigan during the mid-1970s, as a group of neighborhood boys, now grown men acknowledging in voice-over (narrated by Giovanni Ribisi who speaks for the group as a whole) reflect upon their memories of the five Lisbon sisters, ages 13 to 17. Unattainable due to their Catholic and overprotective, authoritarian parents, math teacher Ronald (James Woods) and his homemaker wife (Kathleen Turner), the girlsâTherese (Leslie Hayman), Mary (A. J. Cook), Bonnie (Chelse Swain), Lux (Kirsten Dunst), and Cecilia (Hanna R. Hall)âare the enigma that fill the boys' conversations and dreams. The film opens in the summer with the suicide attempt of the youngest sister, Cecilia, as she slits her wrist in a bath. After her parents allow her to throw a chaperoned basement party intended to make her feel better, Cecilia excuses herself and jumps out of her second story bedroom window, dying when she is impaled on an iron fence below. In the wake of her act, the Lisbon parents watch over their four remaining daughters even more closely. This further isolates the family from the community and heightens air of mystery about the girls to the neighborhood boys in particular. At the beginning of the new school year in the fall, Lux forms a secret and short-lived romance with Trip Fontaine (Josh Hartnett), the school heartthrob. Trip comes over one night to the Lisbon residence in hopes of getting closer to Lux and watches television with the family. Soon Trip persuades Mr. Lisbon to allow him to take Lux to the upcoming Homecoming Dance by promising to provide dates for the other sisters, to go as a group. After winning Homecoming king and queen, Trip persuades Lux to ditch the group and have sex on the school's football field. Afterwards, Lux falls asleep on the grass, and Trip, becoming disenchanted by Lux, abandons her. At dawn, Lux wakes up alone and has to take a taxi home. Having broken curfew, Lux and her sisters are punished by a paranoid Mrs. Lisbon by being taken out...

We have the equation: 0 = 432*y - 426*y - 66 First, we can combine the terms with \\"y\\" in them. So we will subtract 426*y from 432*y: (432 - 426) * y = 6 * y Now the equation looks like: 0 = 6*y - 66 Next, we need to get \\"y\\" all by itself on one side of the equation. To do that, let's add 66 to both sides of the equation: 0 + 66 = 6*y - 66 + 66 This simplifies to: 66 = 6*y Now, we will divide both sides of the equation by 6 to isolate \\"y\\": 66 ÷ 6 = 6*y ÷ 6 This gives us the answer: y = 11 So, the value of y in the equation is 11.

Not that I want to expose my life here, but I come from a small town with a similar school than these guys go. Reject & ignorance on the menu. Thing is...I understand how can young kids can be driven to do such horror. High schools have became battle fields of conformity. It's a real ugly sight. You need to fight your way into being like the others. It's hard to explain, bit a lot of people dosen't realize that high schools are becoming cemeteries of human intelligence. Meanwhile, parents are closing their eyes and smiling about how their life in their comfortable suburb is perfect. The real motive of the movie isn't about what is driving them. It's about this death-like calm suburb and everybody closing their eyes and trying to create this atmosphere of a perfect town. Cal expressed it well. It's a wake up call. Drama is everywhere and it can take every shape. In that case little dramas(like Andre being called a faggot for wearing a J.C Penny shirt) are shaping into being the worse nightmare of a whole town. Andre & Cal took the most extreme way to express their pain. The malaise of unconformity in an era where you need more than ever to be like the others to be accepted. I like particularly the last scenes where some guys are burning the crosses of Andre & Cal, like if with the pain they communicated, Cal & Andre have communicated their blind rage to their community, their refusal to think about the causes of some acts.

Blue was the color of ocean and sky, both good things. Red was the color of Mars and it was manly but mars meant aliens and aliens were bad so red was bad. This is how I navigated. I followed the colors. I was lost in a daze of exhaustion and moved my feet slowly. They were dead and raw with pain and blisters, and I shuffled out into the city.

In 1965, the activity on the main island diminished, but at the end of May that year an eruption began at a vent 0.6 km (0.37 mi) off the northern shore. By 28 May, an island had appeared, and was named Syrtlingur (Little Surtsey). The new island was washed away during early June, but reappeared on 14 June. Eruptions at Syrtlingur were much smaller in scale than those that had built Surtsey, with the average rate of emission of volcanic materials being about a tenth of the rate at the main vent. Activity was short-lived, continuing until the beginning of October 1965, by which time the islet had an area of 0.15 km2 (0.058 sq mi). Once the eruptions had ceased, wave erosion rapidly wore the island away, and it disappeared beneath the waves on 24 October.During December 1965, more submarine activity occurred 0.9 km (0.56 mi) southwest of Surtsey, and another island was formed. It was named Jólnir, and over the following eight months it appeared and disappeared several times, as wave erosion and volcanic activity alternated in dominance. Activity at Jólnir was much weaker than the activity at the main vent, and even weaker than that seen at Syrtlingur, but the island eventually grew to a maximum size of 70 m (230 ft) in height, covering an area of 0.3 km2 (0.12 sq mi), during July and early August 1966. Like Syrtlingur, though, after activity ceased on 8 August 1966, it was rapidly eroded, and dropped below sea level during October 1966.Effusive eruptions on the main island returned on 19 August 1966, with fresh lava flows giving it further resistance to erosion. The eruption rate diminished steadily, though, and on 5 June 1967, the eruption ended. The volcano has been dormant ever since. The total volume of lava emitted during the three-and-a-half-year eruption was about one cubic kilometre (0.24 cu mi), and the island's highest point was 174 metres (571 feet) above sea level at that time.Since the end of the eruption, erosion has seen the island diminish in size.

Here is an article: From left, Robertson Carricart, Joyce Cohen, Mark Saturno and Marion Wood in John Ferguson, a play that first opened in New York in 1919. The Mint Theaters production of John Ferguson is one of those lovely little surprises that pop up occasionally in the wildly uneven world of Off Off Broadway. In a cramped third-floor theater in a tiny Times Square office building, this is a thoroughly engrossing, fully realized drama brought to life by an ensemble of actors who never miss a beat. They play a small-town Irish farm family threatened with eviction and the local characters who get involved. John Ferguson (Robertson Carricart), a man who believes that God has a reason for everything that happens, reads his Bible by firelight. His daughter, Hannah (Marion Wood), happily basks in the love of her family until she realizes that the only way to save its farm is to marry James Caesar (Mark Saturno), a nice but creepy guy who makes her cringe. When she says yes to Jimmy (Ill have you), her mother, Sarah (Joyce Cohen), is thrilled. Her father struggles with himself, trying to believe that the marriage is really what Hannah wants. It has come to this because the Fergusons were expecting a check from Johns brother in the United States. When the mailman confirms that no letter has come, all seems lost. Henry Witherow (Greg Thornton), who holds the mortgage, pays a visit, just to establish his despicability. Grandly directed by Martin Platt, the cast does not have a weak link, but Ms. Wood deserves particular praise. There are a hundred ways for her to go wrong in her reaction to, and transformation by, an unspeakable violation, but she never does. Justin Schultz, as Andrew, Hannahs gentle but seething brother, spends a good deal of Act II half-cowering against a wall with the intensity of a smarter Boo Radley. The village semi-idiot, John McGrath (John Keating), known as Clutie, functions as both comic relief and Greek chorus (and a reminder that being homeless is a lot easier when neighbors share their food and offer hay lofts for sleeping). Critics adored John Ferguson, which was written by St. John Ervine, when it opened in New York in 1919. Even now, when American audiences sometimes deal with stage tragedy by looking for laughs, it is compelling. John Ferguson continues through Oct. 15 at the Mint Theater, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton; (212)315-9434. A review in The Arts on Wednesday of the play John Ferguson referred incorrectly to the production. It is playing Off Broadway, not Off Off Broadway. The article also gave an incorrect telephone number for the box office. It is (212) 315-0231.

Find the longest common substring in the strings A and B. UbIYvCyAzXyRkEngU, SMoCyAzXyRfa","completion":"Alright, to complete this task, we need to compare each character in both Strings A and B, one by one. An efficient way to do this is by using a dynamic programming algorithm. Here is how I would approach this: Implementation in Python, would look something like this: 1. First, we'd initialize our variables: String A = \\"UbIYvCyAzXyRkEngU\\" String B = \\"SMoCyAzXyRfa\\" The \`maxLength\` is used to retain the length of the longest found common substring and \`maxLengthEnd\` is used to retain the end index of the longest common substring in String A. 2. Next, build a \`DP\` matrix where \`DP[i][j]\` holds the length of the common substring ending at \`i in A\` and \`j in B\`. The matrix will be of size (n+1) x (m+1), where n, m are the lengths of String A and B respectively. We add 1 to accommodate for the zeroth row and column, which represents an empty substring in A and B. 3. Now, iterate over each cell of the matrix. If the end characters of the current substring in both A and B are equal, that is, A[i-1] == B[j-1], then DP[i][j] will be DP[i-1][j-1], which is the length of the longest common substring found till now, plus 1. 4. Check if \`DP[i][j] > maxLength\`. If so, update \`maxLength\` to \`DP[i][j]\` and \`maxLengthEnd\` to \`i-1\`. 5. After completing the iteration, the longest common substring will be found from index (\`maxLengthEnd - maxLength + 1\`) to \`maxLengthEnd\` in A. 6. Return the longest common substring. By running this dynamic programming algorithm on the given Strings A and B, the longest common substring is \\"CyAzXyR\\". This algorithm works by iteratively finding the common substrings of A and B ending at each index i, j in A and B. It then checks and updates the longest found common substring. At the end of the iterations, it returns the longest common substring found, and in our case \\"CyAzXyR\\"."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: Where was the man who's musical career was interrupted in 1896 principal conductor in 1907? is inside the article: Monteux's first high-profile conducting experience came in 1895, when he was barely 20 years old. He was a member of the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of \\"Oui – Monteux!\\". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.Monteux's musical career was interrupted in 1896, when he was called up for military service. As a graduate of the Conservatoire, one of France's grandes écoles, he was required to serve only ten months rather than the three years generally required. He later described himself as \\"the most pitifully inadequate soldier that the 132nd Infantry had ever seen\\". He had inherited from his mother not only her musical talent but her short and portly build and was physically unsuited to soldiering.Returning to Paris after discharge, Monteux resumed his career as a violist. Hans Richter invited him to lead the violas in the Bayreuth Festival orchestra, but Monteux could not afford to leave his regular work in Paris. In December 1900 Monteux played the solo viola part in Berlioz's Harold in Italy, rarely heard in Paris at the time, with the Colonne Orchestra conducted by Felix Mottl. In 1902 he secured a junior conducting post at the Dieppe casino, a seasonal appointment for the summer months which brought him into contact with leading musicians from the Paris orchestras and well-known soloists on vacation. By 1907 he was the principal conductor at Dieppe, in charge of operas and orchestral concerts. As an orchestral conductor he modelled his technique on that of Arthur Nikisch, under whose baton he had played, and who was his ideal conductor., can you guess it ? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the article, Monteux was the principal conductor in Dieppe in 1907.

It is the first handheld console in the Game Boy line and was created by Satoru Okada and Nintendo Research & Development 1. This same team, led by Gunpei Yokoi at the time, is credited with designing the Game & Watch series as well as several popular games for the Nintendo Entertainment System. Redesigned versions were released in 1996 and 1998 in the form of Game Boy Pocket and Game Boy Light (Japan only), respectively. - A board game is a tabletop game that involves counters or moved or placed on a pre-marked surface or \\"board\\", according to a set of rules. Some games are based on pure strategy, but many contain an element of chance; and some are purely chance, with no element of skill. - The action game is a video game genre that emphasizes physical challenges, including handeye coordination and reaction-time. The genre includes diverse subgenres such as fighting games, shooter games and platform games which are widely considered the most important action games, though some real-time strategy games are also considered to be action games. - Shooter games are a subgenre of action game, which often test the player's speed and reaction time. It includes many subgenres that have the commonality of focusing on the actions of the avatar using some sort of weapon. Usually this weapon is a gun, or some other long-range weapon. A common resource found in many shooter games is ammunition. Most commonly, the purpose of a shooter game is to shoot opponents and proceed through missions without the player character being killed or dying. A shooting game is a genre of video game where the player has limited spatial control of his or her character, and the focus is almost entirely on the defeat of the character's enemies using long-range weaponry. - The Atari 8-bit family is a series of 8-bit home computers introduced by Atari, Inc. in 1979 and manufactured until 1992. All of the machines in the family are technically similar, and differ primarily in packaging. They are based on the MOS Technology 6502 CPU running at 1.79 MHz, and were the first home computers designed with custom co-processor chips. This architecture allowed the Atari designs to offer graphics and sound capabilities that were more advanced than contemporary machines like the Apple II or Commodore PET, and gaming on the platform was a major draw. \\"Star Raiders\\" is widely considered the platform's killer app. - A video game is an electronic game that involves human or animal interaction with a user interface to generate visual feedback on a video device such as a TV screen or computer monitor. The word \\"video\\" in \\"video game\\" traditionally referred to a raster display device, but as of the 2000s, it implies any type of display device that can produce two- or three-dimensional images. Some theorists categorize video games as an art form, but this designation is controversial. - A video game developer is a software developer that specializes in video game development the process and related disciplines of creating video games. A game developer can range from one person who undertakes all tasks to a large business with employee responsibilities split between individual disciplines, such as programming, design, art, testing, etc. Most game development companies have video game publisher financial and usually marketing support. Self-funded developers are known as independent or indie developers and usually make indie games. - , sometimes transliterated Gumpei Yokoi, was a Japanese video game designer. He was a long-time Nintendo employee, best known as creator of the Game & Watch handheld system, inventor of the Control Pad (whose plus-shaped design nearly all video game controllers attempt to mimic today), the original designer of the Game Boy, and producer of a few long-running and critically acclaimed video game franchises, such as \\"Metroid\\" and \\"Kid Icarus\\". - Atari Corporation was an American manufacturer of computers and video game consoles from 1984 to 1996. Atari Corp. was founded in July 1984 when Warner Communications sold the home computing and game console divisions of Atari, Inc. to Jack Tramiel. Its chief products were the Atari ST, , Atari 7800, Atari Lynx, and Atari Jaguar. The company reverse merged with JTS Inc. in 1996, becoming a small division, which itself closed when JTS liquidated the IP to Hasbro Interactive in 1998. - The Nintendo Entertainment System (commonly abbreviated as NES) is an 8-bit home video game console that was developed and manufactured by Nintendo. The best-selling gaming console of its time, the NES helped revitalize the US video game industry following the video game crash of 1983. With the NES, Nintendo introduced a now-standard business model of licensing third-party developers, authorizing them to produce and distribute titles for Nintendo's platform. - Home computers were a class of microcomputers entering the market in 1977, and becoming common during the 1980s. They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers. Their most common uses were playing video games, but they were also regularly used for word processing, doing homework, and programming. - Cross-promotion is a form of marketing promotion where customers of one product or service are targeted with promotion of a related product. A typical example is cross-media marketing of a brand, for example Oprah Winfrey's promotion on her television show of her books, magazines and website. Cross-promotion may involve two or more companies working together in promoting a service or product, in a way that benefits both. For example, a mobile phone network may work together with a popular music artist and package some of their songs as exclusive ringtones; promoting these ringtones can benefit both the network and the artist. Some major corporations, for example Burger King, have a long history of cross-promotion with a range of partners (see Burger King advertising). The Disney Channel has also made extensive use of cross-promotion. Movie tie-ins are good examples of cross-promotion. On occasion, badly planned cross-promotions can backfire spectacularly such as 1992 Hoover free flights promotion fiasco. - A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, web site, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility. - The megabyte is a multiple of the unit byte for digital information. Its recommended unit symbol is MB, but sometimes \\"MByte\\" is used. The unit prefix \\"mega\\" is a multiplier of (10) in the International System of Units (SI). Therefore, one megabyte is one million bytes of information. This definition has been incorporated into the International System of Quantities. - Atari is a corporate and brand name owned by several entities since its inception in 1972, currently by Atari Interactive, a subsidiary of the French publisher Atari, SA (ASA). The original Atari, Inc. founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney was a pioneer in arcade games, home video game consoles, and home computers. The company's products, such as \\"Pong\\" and the Atari 2600, helped define the electronic entertainment industry from the 1970s to the mid-1980s. - Guinness World Records, known from its inception in 1955 until 1998 as The Guinness Book of Records and in previous U.S. editions as The Guinness Book of World Records, is a reference book published annually, listing world records and national records, both of human achievements and the extremes of the natural world. The book itself holds a world record, as the best-selling copyrighted book of all time. As of the 2017 edition, it is now in its 63rd year of publication, published in 100 countries and 23 languages. The international franchise has extended beyond print to include television series and museums. The popularity of the franchise has resulted in \\"Guinness World Records\\" becoming the primary international authority on the cataloguing and verification of a huge number of world records; the organisation employs official record adjudicators authorised to verify the authenticity of the setting and breaking of records. - A film, also called a movie, motion picture, theatrical film or photoplay, is a series of still images which, when shown on a screen, creates the illusion of moving images due to the phi phenomenon. This optical illusion causes the audience to perceive continuous motion between separate objects viewed rapidly in succession. The process of filmmaking is both an art and an industry. A film is created by photographing actual scenes with a motion picture camera; by photographing drawings or miniature models using traditional animation techniques; by means of CGI and computer animation; or by a combination of some or all of these techniques and other visual effects. - Real-time strategy (RTS) is a subgenre of strategy video games where the game does not progress incrementally in turns. - Dundee, officially the City of Dundee, is Scotland's fourth-largest city and the 51st-most-populous built-up area in the United Kingdom. The mid-year population estimate for 2015 was 148,210 which gave Dundee a population density of 2,477/km or 6,420/sq mi, the second-highest in Scotland. It lies within the eastern central Lowlands on the north bank of the Firth of Tay, which feeds into the North Sea. Under the name of \\"Dundee City\\", it forms one of the 32 council areas used for local government in Scotland. - The Motorola 68000 (\\"'sixty-eight-thousand'\\"; also called the m68k or Motorola 68k, \\"\\"sixty-eight-kay\\"\\") is a 32-bit CISC microprocessor with a 16-bit external data bus, designed and marketed by Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector (later Freescale Semiconductor, now NXP). Introduced in 1979 with HMOS technology as the first member of the successful 32-bit m68k family of microprocessors, it is generally software forward compatible with the rest of the line despite being limited to a 16-bit wide external bus. After 37 years in production, the 68000 architecture is still in use. - The Game Boy line is a line of handheld game consoles developed, manufactured, and marketed by Nintendo. The product line has sold 200 million units worldwide. - A microprocessor is a computer processor which incorporates the functions of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) on a single integrated circuit (IC), or at most a few integrated circuits. The microprocessor is a multipurpose, clock driven, register based, programmable electronic device which accepts digital or binary data as input, processes it according to instructions stored in its memory, and provides results as output. Microprocessors contain both combinational logic and sequential digital logic. Microprocessors operate on numbers and symbols represented in the binary numeral system. - A role-playing game (RPG and sometimes roleplaying game) is a game in which players assume the roles of characters in a fictional setting. Players take responsibility for acting out these roles within a narrative, either through literal acting or through a process of structured decision-making or character development. Actions taken within many games succeed or fail according to a formal system of rules and guidelines. - Abandoning previous ventures in favor of toys in the 1960s, Nintendo then developed into a video game company in the 1970s, ultimately becoming one of the most influential in the industry and Japan's third most-valuable company with a market value of over 85 billion. From 1992 until 2016, Nintendo was also the majority shareholder of Major League Baseball's Seattle Mariners. - The ZX Spectrum is an 8-bit personal home computer released in the United Kingdom in 1982 by Sinclair Research Ltd. It was manufactured in Dundee, Scotland, in the now closed Timex factory. - Ocean Software Ltd (also known in the United States as Ocean of America, Inc.), commonly referred to as Ocean, was a British software development company, that became one of the biggest European video game developers/publishers of the 1980s and 1990s. It was acquired by a French holding company, Infogrames in 1996 and renamed to \\"Infogrames UK\\" in 1998, and again in 2004 to Atari UK, and once again in 2009 now known as Atari, Inc. - A fighting game is a video game genre in which the player controls an on-screen character and engages in close combat with an opponent, which can be either an AI or controlled by another player. The fight matches typically consist of several rounds and take place in an arena, while each character has widely differing abilities but each is relatively viable to choose. Players must master techniques such as blocking, counter-attacking, and chaining attacks together into \\"combos\\". Since the early 1990s, most fighting games allow the player to execute special attacks by performing specific input combinations. The fighting game genre is related to but distinct from beat 'em ups, which involve large numbers of enemies against the human player. - The Addams Family is the title of a video game released for the original Game Boy , as well as differing versions for the Amiga , Amstrad CPC , Atari ST , Commodore 64 , Game Gear , Genesis , NES , SNES , and the ZX Spectrum . The games are a tie - in with the 1991 movie , The Addams Family . It was published and developed in 1992 by Ocean Software . It is a platform side - scrolling action game . - The Amiga is a family of personal computers sold by Commodore in the 1980s and 1990s. Based on the Motorola 68000 family of microprocessors, the machine has a custom chipset with graphics and sound capabilities that were unprecedented for the price, and a pre-emptive multitasking operating system called AmigaOS. The Amiga provided a significant upgrade from earlier 8-bit home computers, including Commodore's own C64. - A Platform game (or platformer) is a video game which involves guiding an avatar to jump between suspended platforms and/or over obstacles to advance the game. The player controls the jumps to avoid letting the avatar fall from platforms or miss necessary jumps. The most common unifying element of games of this genre is the jump button, but now there are other alternative like swiping in touchscreen. \\"Jumping\\", in this genre, may include swinging from extendable arms, as in \\"Ristar\\" or \\"Bionic Commando\\", or bouncing from springboards or trampolines, as in \\"Alpha Waves\\". These mechanics, even in the context of other genres, are commonly called \\"platforming\\", a verbification of \\"platform\\". Games where jumping is automated completely, such as 3D games in \\"The Legend of Zelda\\" series, fall outside of the genre. - The Atari ST is a line of home computers from Atari Corporation and the successor to the Atari 8-bit family. The initial ST model, the 520ST, saw limited release in the spring of 1985 and was widely available in July. The Atari ST is the first personal computer to come with a bit-mapped color GUI, using a version of Digital Research's GEM released in February 1985. The 1040ST, released in 1986, is the first personal computer to ship with a megabyte of RAM in the base configuration and also the first with a cost-per-kilobyte of less than US1. - The Commodore 64, also known as the C64, C-64, C= 64, or occasionally CBM 64 or VIC-64 in Sweden, is an 8-bit home computer introduced in January 1982 by Commodore International. It is listed in the Guinness World Records as the highest-selling single computer model of all time, with independent estimates placing the number sold between 10 and 17 million units. Volume production started in early 1982, marketing in August for . Preceded by the Commodore VIC-20 and Commodore PET, the C64 took its name from its of RAM. It had superior sound and graphical specifications compared to other earlier systems such as the Apple II and Atari 800, with multi-color sprites and a more advanced sound processor. - AmigaOS is the proprietary native operating system of the Amiga and AmigaOne personal computers. It was developed first by Commodore International and introduced with the launch of the first Amiga, the Amiga 1000, in 1985. Early versions of AmigaOS required the Motorola 68000 series of 16-bit and 32-bit microprocessors. Later versions were developed by Haage & Partner (AmigaOS 3.5 and 3.9) and then Hyperion Entertainment (AmigaOS 4.0-4.1). A PowerPC microprocessor is required for the most recent release, AmigaOS 4. - North America is a continent entirely within the Northern Hemisphere and almost all within the Western Hemisphere. It can also be considered a northern subcontinent of the Americas. It is bordered to the north by the Arctic Ocean, to the east by the Atlantic Ocean, to the west and south by the Pacific Ocean, and to the southeast by South America and the Caribbean Sea. - Satoru Okada ( \\"Okada Satoru\\") was the general manager of Nintendo Research & Engineering, the division designing and developing Nintendo handheld game consoles (such as the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, Game Boy Advance SP, and Nintendo DS consoles). He is best known for creating the original Game Boy. He was also assistant producer and director of and contributor to several Nintendo games, notably \\"Metroid\\", released for the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1986. - Digital Research, Inc. (also known as DR or DRI; originally Intergalactic Digital Research) was the company created by Dr. Gary Kildall to market and develop his CP/M operating system and related products.

I think that Dr. Diehl (he’s a dentist in his day job) has a real knack for this sort of puzzle, and his clues are a bit more challenging than that of other constructors, but that’s a good thing. It brings them a small step closer to the cryptics that some PandA solvers aspire to conquer. Not only that but Dr. Diehl’s PandA grids are Scrabbly and filled with fun entries. Would you have thought to clue J.K. ROWLING as “Author whose first two initials fit between I-L wrong”? Isn’t it cool that Dr. Diehl saw that it could work out? If you’re still pondering how RELAXANTS could be the answer to “They’ll help you unwind at 10 Star Lane,” think Roman numerals. “10 Star Lane,” substituting an X for the 10, anagrams to RELAXANTS. I love that, as well as the somewhat delayed “Aha!” moment that I experienced. In fact, if you’re into Roman numerals, you’ll enjoy 25 Across’s clue, “5 + 0 + 1 + 500,” the answer is not 506, it’s VOID. V = 5, O = 0, I = 1, and 500 = D.

Rather than explicitly presenting the nomenclature of Nasser's Arab admirers, the sentence emphasizes the considerable reach and impact of the 'Voice of the Arabs' radio station, based in Cairo, which broadcasted Nasser's ideas of united Arab action throughout the Arabic-speaking world. Nasser, a proponent of Pan-Arabism, used the radio as a powerful medium to foster a sense of unity and shared identity among Arab nations. The explicit mention of historian Eugene Rogan's quotation, \\"Nasser conquered the Arab world by radio,\\" underscores Nasser's widespread influence and the significant role of the radio in amplifying his vision and ideas. However, the name or term by which Nasser's Arab admirers identified themselves or were known by others is not specified or inferred in the provided sentence. To answer that question, one would need to conduct further research into the sociopolitical landscape of the time, particularly with a focus on the followers of Nasser and their ideological leanings. The admirers of Nasser's ideology were often called Nasserists or supporters of Nasserism, a political ideology based on the policies of Gamal Abdel Nasser, but this information is not given in the original sentence."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Sara grew the flowers in the greenhouse instead of the backyard because it was warmer in the","completion":"greenhouse. Step 1: Identify the main elements in your segment of the story. In this case, Sara, the greenhouse, and the aspect of warmth are the main threads being considered. Step 2: Consider how these elements will interact. Given that we understand the greenhouse is connected to warmth and the growing of flowers, a sensible direction for the story would be to focus on Sara's experience within the greenhouse, possibly emphasizing the blooming of the flowers. So, to continue the story: \\"Although the backyard was vast, Sara preferred the cozy hug of the greenhouse. It wrapped her and her sprouts in an inviting warmth, even during the coldest of winters. The idea of their shared isolation from the outside world was oddly comforting to her. As days turned into weeks, Sara lovingly tended to her floral companions, nurturing each one like her own child. The flowers responded to her love and the greenhouse’s warmth in the best way they could: by blooming. Each blossom was a testament to Sara's hard work and dedication, from the bulbs of tulips that sprung up to the sunlight to the delicate petals of rose slowly unfurling. It wasn't long before the greenhouse became a tropical paradise within the chilly confines of her backyard. Being inside the greenhouse felt like crossing into another dimension. The hum of the outside world would become distant, exchanged for the softer symphony of nature - the rustle of leaves, the light patter of water droplets falling from the mister, the ever-so-subtle scent of fresh earth and blooming flowers. It was her sanctuary, her fortress, fortified with glass panes and vibrant petals. Here, regardless of the frost outside, warmth held eternal reign. Sara's heart swelled with contentment whenever she stepped into her floral abyss, a wave of satisfaction washing over her, her love for her flowers outshining the sun they grew under. And it was this love and patience, combined with the unique warmth the greenhouse provided, that made the flowers bloom like they did nowhere else.\\" Justification: The story continuation reflects on the main elements brought up early in the story. The focus on the flowers blooming as a result of Sara's efforts and the warmth of the greenhouse adds depth to her character while retaining the key essence of the story."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage. a good answer to this question?","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"She agreed to visit the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington and take a drive through London in an open carriage\\" is a good answer to the question about where Queen Victoria visited after being advised by her uncle, King Leopold, to make more public appearances. However, it could be expanded upon to provide a more detailed and complete response. Here is a longer, more detailed version of the answer: In the early 1840s, Queen Victoria received advice from her uncle, King Leopold of Belgium, to make more public appearances in order to connect with her subjects and raise her public profile. Although Queen Victoria was initially reluctant to do so due to her reserved nature and the stressful demands of court life, she eventually heeded her uncle's advice and agreed to participate in several public events and outings. One of the most notable public appearances Queen Victoria made during this time was her visit to the gardens of the Royal Horticultural Society at Kensington in London. The Royal Horticultural Society is a prestigious British organization dedicated to promoting horticulture and gardening, and at the time, their gardens were an important venue for both social functions and scientific research. Queen Victoria's visit to the gardens helped to raise awareness and appreciation of the work being done by the society, as well as demonstrate her support for British horticulture and botanical studies. In addition to her visit to the Royal Horticultural Society, Queen Victoria also undertook a drive through the city of London in an open carriage. This allowed her to be seen by a large number of her subjects who lined the streets to catch a glimpse of their Queen, and it served as an important symbol of her dedication to her people. Open carriage rides were a customary way for members of the royal family to appear in public during the nineteenth century, and Queen Victoria's participation in this tradition helped to strengthen her presence in the public sphere and enhance her connection with her subjects. As a result of these efforts, Queen Victoria's public image and popularity significantly improved. She continued to participate in public events and ceremonies throughout her long reign, and the success of her early public appearances laid the foundation for the role of the British monarch as a public figurehead concerned with the welfare and progress of her people."},{"prompt":"Question: After getting high his memory seemed shot, he felt practically what?

And once again, high blood pressure is making headlines in the news: the American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology (AHA/ACC) have just released new guidelines about hypertension. Since this development is likely to cause confusion and concern for many, I’m writing this post to help you understand the debate and what this might mean for you and your family. By the way, if you’ve read any of my other blood pressure articles on this site, let me reassure you: I am not changing my clinical practice or what I recommend to others, based on the new AHA/ACC guidelines. The core principles of better blood pressure management for older adults remain the same: * Take care in how you and your doctors measure blood pressure (more on that here), * Start by aiming to get blood pressure less than 150/90 mm Hg, as recommended by these expert guidelines issued in 2017 and in 2014, * And then learn more about what are the likely benefits versus risks of aiming for more intensive BP control. Perhaps the most important thing to understand is this: treatment of high blood pressure in older adults offers “diminishing returns” as we treat BP to get lower and lower. Scientific evidence indicates that the greatest health benefit, when it comes to reducing the risk of strokes and heart attacks, is in getting systolic blood pressure from high (i.e. 160-180) down to moderate (140-150). From there, the famous SPRINT study, published in 2015, did show a further reduction in cardiovascular risk, when participants were treated to a lower systolic BP, such as a target of 120. However, this was in a carefully selected group of participants, it required taking three blood pressure medications on average, and the reduction in risk was small. As I note in my article explaining SPRINT Senior, in participants aged 75 or older, pushing to that lower goal was associated with an estimated 1-in-27 chance of avoiding a cardiovascular event. (The benefit was even smaller in adults aged 50-75.) According to the above context, answer the following question. What is most likely the author's occupation?

Can you tell me the answer to when was the federal law providing benefits for the unemployed passed??","completion":"The federal law providing benefits for the unemployed in the United States was initially passed on August 14, 1935, as a part of the Social Security Act. This landmark legislation, signed into law by President Franklin D. Roosevelt, aimed to address social and economic problems faced by the nation during the Great Depression. Title III of the Social Security Act established a cooperative federal-state system for unemployment compensation, which was designed to provide financial assistance to eligible workers who found themselves out of work through no fault of their own. The unemployment insurance program laid out in the Act is a joint effort between the federal government and individual state governments to administer the program and disburse benefits to those in need. Under the terms of the Act, employers would pay a payroll tax, and the unemployment insurance benefits would be funded through these collected taxes. The federal government is responsible for overseeing the program and setting general guidelines, while individual states are responsible for the actual administration of the program, determining eligibility criteria, and setting benefit amounts and duration. This cooperative system ensures that each state can tailor its unemployment insurance system to the specific needs of its workforce while maintaining uniform standards. Since its inception in 1935, the unemployment insurance program has undergone several amendments and expansions to address the evolving needs of the American workforce. The most notable changes include the Federal Unemployment Tax Act (1939), which set uniform guidelines for the taxation of employers, the Employment Security Amendments (1970), which established temporary extensions of benefits during periods of high unemployment, and the Federal-State Extended Benefits Program (1970), which provides additional benefits to those who exhaust their regular benefits during periods of high unemployment across the nation or in specific states. Today, the unemployment insurance system remains a critical safety net for millions of Americans experiencing job loss due to economic downturns, natural disasters, or other disruptions to the labor market. It is important to note, though, that the system continuously adapts and evolves to respond to the changing economic and social landscape in the United States."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Art and Gil are suspected to be rustlers because they have rarely been seen in town. A man enters the saloon and announces that a rancher named Larry Kinkaid has been murdered. The townspeople immediately form a posse to pursue the murderers, who they believe are cattle rustlers. A judge tells the posse that it must bring the suspects back for trial, and that its formation by a deputy (the sheriff being out of town) is illegal.

Summarize this article: Using a shovel or hiring someone with a backhoe, remove the top layers of grass and dirt from the marked-off driveway area. You might want to use a tiller to loosen up the soil and make it easier to dig out. The amount of soil you remove depends on how many layers of soil you are planning. You should dig 4-6 inches of soil for every layer of rocks you plan to put down. This doesn’t have to be perfect since it will be covered by rocks, but your driveway surface should be pretty level—any areas that are deeper than other areas may lead to water pooling and cause mud puddles that have to be filled in with more gravel later. Use a mechanical compactor, have someone drive over the area with a bulldozer, or drive over the area repeatedly with a heavy vehicle such as a large truck. If you want to prevent grass and weeds from growing through your driveway, you may want to lay a weed barrier underneath your rocks. Weed barrier is a woven landscaping cloth that allows water to pass through it but does not allow weeds to grow through it, and it is available at most landscaping and home improvement stores. Weed barrier usually comes on a roll. You should be able to lay the roll down at one end of your driveway and unroll it until you have reached the other end of your driveway. Most weed barrier rolls are 4 feet wide, so you may need to get several rolls. Be sure the amount of weed barrier you buy matches or exceeds the square footage (length times width) of your driveway. If you are using landscaping timber or bricks to edge your driveway, you may want to place them before the gravel is delivered so that they can hold the rocks in place. If you do not want a border, you can skip this step.","completion":"The given article outlines the process of preparing a driveway area before laying down rocks.

Question: Connecting with Patients Dr. Paris often treats several generations of a family over many years. \\"He's seen us through two births, one operation, multiple earaches, a broken wrist and a recovery from a serious traffic crash,\\" says Jill Farrow, a 43-year-old lawyer whose first visit to Dr. Paris was as a teenager. During the birth of her younger son, Farrow began bleeding badly. Dr. Paris managed to solve the problem in a delicate procedure. \\"Twenty years ago, she probably would have died,\\" he says. Today, when he performs school sports physical examinations for the Farrow boys, 10 and 11, he is always reminded that lives are changed forever by doctors just doing their jobs. To be a mix of country doc and somewhat adventurer, the 55-year-old family physician moved to Hailey after completing his residency . He hoped to practice medicine there and ski at nearby Sun Valley. Unfortunately, the only job opening was for an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana, 300 miles away. Dr. Paris took it. \\"I'd ski all day and then drive all night to be in Missoula for a 48-hour shift,\\" he recalls. \\"I'm lucky to be alive.\\" Knowing he couldn't keep up with his eight-hour commute , he began taking flying lessons. In 1981, Dr. Paris joined a small medical practice in Hailey, a former mining town with a population at the time of 2,109. As Hailey grew in the shadow of Sun Valley's booming popularity, Dr. Paris's own practice expanded to seven physicians, including his wife, Kathryn Woods, who is also a family doctor. They met in 1986 at a certification exam in Denver when, in a room full of men in stodgy suits, Woods arrived wearing a Lycra biking outfit and carrying the front wheel of her bicycle (which she couldn't lock up outside). Dr. Paris asked her out on the spot. In 1989, they married. Dr. Paris often reminds himself that _ . A) lives of people should not always stay the same B) people can rely on themselves to change their life C) doctors should change their own life D) it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients Answer:","completion":"Dr. Paris often reminds himself that it is the duty of a doctor to heal the patients (D). His experiences treating multiple generations of families, such as the Farrows, have shown him the profound impact that doctors can have on their patients' lives. Whether it's saving a mother's life during childbirth or simply providing routine medical care for her children, Dr. Paris understands that the work he and his fellow physicians do can change lives forever. Throughout his career, Dr. Paris has managed to strike a balance between being a dedicated country doctor and enjoying his own personal adventures. He moved to Hailey for its proximity to Sun Valley's skiing opportunities but eventually found work as an emergency-room doctor in Missoula, Montana. The demanding commute drove him to learn to fly, which ultimately allowed him to settle in Hailey and grow a thriving medical practice. As Hailey's population grew, so did Dr. Paris's practice, eventually attracting seven physicians, including his wife, Dr. Kathryn Woods.

Title: Public Enemies Movie plot: The film opens in 1933 as John Dillinger (Johnny Depp) is brought to the Indiana State Prison by his partner John \\"Red\\" Hamilton (Jason Clarke), under the disguise of a prisoner drop (with Dillinger posing as the prisoner). Inside the prison, several gang members, Charles Makley (Christian Stolte), Harry Pierpont (David Wenham), Ed Shouse (Michael Vieau), Homer Van Meter (Stephen Dorff), and Walter Dietrich (James Russo) acquire guns smuggled into the prison inside boxes of thread sent to the prison's shirt factory, with which they take a few guards hostage and march them to the changing rooms. At the same time, the warden that meets Dillinger and Hamilton suddenly recognizes Dillinger. Dillinger admits to his identity, and at this point, he suddenly springs his handcuffs off, and he and Hamilton conjure shotguns and force the warden to open the door to the break room at gunpoint, at the moment that the other inmates come in. They force the guards to take off their uniforms at gunpoint. Everything goes as planned until Shouse suddenly beats a guard to death in a fit of rage and another guard gets shot. A running shootout ensues as the men run towards the waiting car. Unfortunately, a sniper on the wall shoots Dietrich in the back just as he is about to get into the car, mortally wounding him, and a furious Dillinger kicks Shouse out of the car.In East Liverpool, Ohio, Melvin Purvis (Christian Bale) and several other FBI agents are running down Pretty Boy Floyd (Channing Tatum).

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Background: John William Money (8 July 1921 - 7 July 2006) was a psychologist, sexologist and author, specializing in research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was one of the first scientists to study the psychology of sexual fluidity and how the societal constructs of \\"gender\\" affect an individual. More recent academic studies have criticized Money's work in many respects, particularly in regards to his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer and his eventual suicide. Money's writing has been translated into many languages, and includes around 2,000 articles, books, chapters and reviews. Context: Born in Morrinsville, New Zealand, to a family of English and Welsh descent, Money initially studied psychology at Victoria University of Wellington, graduating with a double master's degree in psychology and education in 1944. Money was a junior member of the psychology faculty at the University of Otago in Dunedin, but in 1947, at the age of 26, he emigrated to the United States to study at the Psychiatric Institute of the University of Pittsburgh. He left Pittsburgh and earned his PhD from Harvard University in 1952. He was married briefly in the 1950s but had no children. Money proposed and developed several theories and related terminology, including gender identity, gender role, gender-identity/role, and lovemap. He coined the term paraphilia (appearing in the DSM-III) to replace perversions and introduced the term sexual orientation in place of sexual preference, arguing that attraction is not necessarily a matter of free choice. Money was a professor of pediatrics and medical psychology at Johns Hopkins University from 1951 until his death. He also established the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic in 1965 along with Claude Migeon who was the head of plastic surgery at Johns Hopkins. The hospital began performing sexual reassignment surgery in 1966. At Johns Hopkins, Money was also involved with the Sexual Behaviors Unit, which ran studies on sex-reassignment surgery. He received the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002 from the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. Money was an early supporter of New Zealand's arts, both literary and visual. He was a noted friend and supporter of author Janet Frame. In 2002, as his Parkinson's disease worsened, Money donated a substantial portion of his art collection to the Eastern Southland Art Gallery in Gore, New Zealand. In 2003, the New Zealand Prime Minister, Helen Clark, opened the John Money wing at the Eastern Southland Gallery. Money died 7 July 2006, one day before his 85th birthday, in Towson, Maryland, of complications from Parkinson's disease. Question: was he well regarded in his field? Answer:","completion":"John William Money was initially well-regarded in his field of psychology, sexology, and research into sexual identity and biology of gender. He was a pioneer in the study of the psychology of sexual fluidity and the societal constructs of \\"gender,\\" which has greatly influenced the understanding of these subjects today. Money's development of several theories and related terminology, such as gender identity, gender role, and lovemap, have become fundamental concepts within the field of sexology and gender studies. Moreover, Money's work in establishing the Johns Hopkins Gender Identity Clinic and being involved in the Sexual Behaviors Unit demonstrated his commitment to advancing the field. His contributions earned him significant recognition, such as the Magnus Hirschfeld Medal in 2002, which was awarded by the German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research. However, Money's reputation and legacy have been tarnished over time based on the criticism of specific aspects of his work, most notably his involvement with the sex-reassignment of David Reimer. This case brought significant controversy due to Reimer's eventual suicide and the ethical concerns raised by Money's experimental treatment methods. As a result of this and other criticisms, Money's standing within the scientific community has become more complex and debated. In conclusion, John William Money was initially well-regarded in his field, with his groundbreaking work and theories influencing the study of sexology and gender. However, due to controversies and subsequent criticisms, his reputation has become increasingly nuanced, and certain aspects of his work have faced scrutiny from the academic community."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the following question: Information: - Lead, from the Old English \\"léad\\", is a chemical element with atomic number 82 and symbol Pb (after the Latin, \\"plumbum\\"). It has the second highest atomic number of all practically stable elements. As such, lead is located at the end of some decay chains of heavier elements, which in part accounts for its relative abundance: its stability exceeds those of other similarly-numbered elements. Lead is a soft, malleable, and heavy metal. Freshly cut lead has a bluish-white color that soon tarnishes to a dull grayish color when exposed to air; as a liquid, it has a shiny chrome-silver luster. Lead's density of 11.34 g/cm exceeds those of most common materials. - Text figures (also known as non-lining, lowercase, old style, ranging, hanging, medieval, billing, or antique figures or numerals) are numerals typeset with varying heights in a fashion that resembles a typical line of running text, hence the name. They are contrasted with lining figures (also called titling or modern figures), which are the same height as upper-case letters. - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - In typography, leading refers to the distance between the baselines of successive lines of type. The term originated in the days of hand-typesetting, when thin strips of lead were inserted into the forms to increase the vertical distance between lines of type. The term is still used in modern page layout software such as QuarkXPress and Adobe InDesign. - In typography, a typeface (also known as font family) is a set of one or more fonts each composed of glyphs that share common design features. Each font of a typeface has a specific weight, style, condensation, width, slant, italicization, ornamentation, and designer or foundry (and formerly size, in metal fonts). For example, \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed Italic\\" means the bold, condensed-width, italic version of ITC Garamond. It is a different font from \\"ITC Garamond Condensed Italic\\" and \\"ITC Garamond Bold Condensed,\\" but all are fonts within the same typeface, \\"ITC Garamond.\\" ITC Garamond is a different typeface from \\"Adobe Garamond\\" or \\"Monotype Garamond.\\" (These are all alternative updates or digitisations of the typeface Garamond, originally created in the 16th century.) There are thousands of different typefaces in existence, with new ones being developed constantly. - X (named \\"ex\\" , plural \\"exes\\") is the 24th and antepenultimate letter in the modern English alphabet and the ISO basic Latin alphabet. - In typography, line length is the width of a block of typeset text, usually measured in units of length like inches or points or in characters per line. A block of text or paragraph has a maximum line length that fits a determined design. - Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point sizes, line lengths, line-spacing (leading), and letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space between pairs of letters (kerning). The term typography is also applied to the style, arrangement, and appearance of the letters, numbers, and symbols created by the process. Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers. Typography also may be used as a decorative device, unrelated to communication of information. - A written language is the representation of a spoken or gestural language by means of a writing system. Written language is an invention in that it must be taught to children, who will pick up spoken language (oral or sign) by exposure even if they are not specifically taught. - In typography, kerning is the process of adjusting the spacing between characters in a proportional font, usually to achieve a visually pleasing result. Kerning adjusts the space between individual letter forms, while tracking (letter-spacing) adjusts spacing uniformly over a range of characters. In a well-kerned font, the two-dimensional blank spaces between each pair of characters all have a visually similar area. - In typography , small capitals ( usually abbreviated small caps ) are uppercase ( capital ) characters set at the same height and weight as surrounding lowercase ( small ) letters or text figures . They are used in running text to prevent capitalized words from appearing too large on the page , and as a method of emphasis or distinctiveness for text alongside or instead of italics , or when boldface is inappropriate . For example , the all - caps TEXT IN CAPS appears as text in caps in small caps . They can be used to draw attention to the opening phrase or line of a new section of text , or to provide an additional style in a dictionary entry where many parts must be typographically differentiated . Well - designed small capitals are not simply scaled - down versions of normal capitals ; they normally retain the same stroke weight as other letters and have a wider aspect ratio for readability . Typically , the height of a small capital will be one ex , the same height as most lowercase characters in the font . In Anglo - Saxon typography , small caps are somewhat larger than the x-height . For example , in some Tiro Typeworks fonts , small caps are 30 % larger than x-height , and 70 % the height of full capitals . To differentiate between these two alternatives , the x-height form is sometimes called petite caps , preserving the name \`\` small caps '' for the larger variant . OpenType fonts can define both forms via the \`\` small caps '' and the \`\` petite caps '' features . Because the support for the petite caps feature is absent from most desktop - publishing programs , many fonts use x-height small caps in the small - caps feature . Many word processors and text - formatting systems include an option to format text in caps and small caps , which leaves uppercase letters as they are , but converts lowercase letters to small caps . How this is implemented depends on the typesetting system ; some can use true small caps associated with modern professional fonts , making text such as \`\` Latvia joined Nato on... - Type design is the art and process of designing typeface. - The ISO basic Latin alphabet is a Latin-script alphabet and consists of two sets of 26 letters, codified in various national and international standards and used widely in international communication. - In typography, letter-spacing, usually called tracking by typographers, refers to a consistent degree of increase (or sometimes decrease) of space between letters to affect density in a line or block of text. 'small caps' is related to which object entity through the relation of 'instance of'?

Having seen 'In His Life: The John Lennon Story', I was quite concerned that Two Of Us will turn out no better. The fact that Aidan Quinn and Jared Harris look absolutely nothing like John Lennon and Paul McCartney  even with some make-up and proper hairdos  didn't help one bit. But I was more than a bit pleasantly surprised. It's probably thanks to the involvement of Michael Lindsay-Hogg, who directed Let It Be in 1970 and consequently probably knew John and Paul quite well, that the characters and the dialogue came across as convincing as they did. (The writing credit for Two Of Us is given to a man named Mark Stanfield, of whom I know absolutely nothing; I feel confident that director Lindsay-Hogg had more than a bit to do with the script.) Two Of Us is not a biography of the Beatles; it has very little plot, in fact, and takes place all in one day in New York City. What it does is imagine a meeting between John and Paul in 1976, while John lived in New York. That meeting is entirely fictitious, of course  though it can't truly be disproved that such a meeting actually took place. But through that imagined conversation it gives us a glimpse into the personalities of these two great musicians  their intelligence, their sense of humor, their different reaction to stardom, and most of all their relationship; what made them such a great team, and what broke them up. Since it's a talk movie, nothing much except for dialogue between two characters for an hour and a half, it's likely to bore all but true fans of the Beatles; but it's a fantastic piece of writing and storytelling, and is both informative and touching. For those interested in these two musical giants, very quickly you'll get over the shock of how different the actors look from their counterparts and feel like John and Paul had come to life  so intimate and convincing is the script, and so committed are the actors. Two Of Us gives you priceless insight into the lives of two geniuses, and a tale that is both sad and funny. Most certainly recommended.

Released on September 11, 1977, it is credited with popularizing the use of microprocessor-based hardware and ROM cartridges containing game code, a format first used with the Fairchild Channel F video game console in 1976. This format contrasts with the older model of having non-microprocessor dedicated hardware, which could only play the games that were physically built into the unit. - The Fairchild Channel F is a home video game console released by Fairchild Semiconductor in November 1976 across North America at the retail price of 169.95. It was also released in Japan in October the following year. It has the distinction of being the first programmable ROM cartridgebased video game console, and the first console to use a microprocessor. It was launched as the Video Entertainment System, or VES, but when Atari released its VCS the next year, Fairchild renamed its machine. By 1977, the Fairchild Channel F had sold 250,000 units, trailing behind sales of the VCS. - Armor Ambush is a video game for the Atari 2600 produced by M - Network . - Atari, Inc. was an American video game developer and home computer company founded in 1972 by Nolan Bushnell and Ted Dabney.

We'll make it through this together.\\" As Danny bit into the remaining ration bar, the two friends sat in silence, reflecting on their situation. The sun had just begun to set in the distance, casting a warm glow over the desolate landscape around them. They had been stranded in the wilderness for days now, with no sign of rescue. Joe was an experienced outdoorsman who had always enjoyed challenging himself in nature, and this time, he had brought along his best friend, Danny. Despite being blind, Danny was always eager to take on new adventures and challenges with Joe. He had an indomitable spirit and a sense of humor that made every journey more enjoyable for the both of them. However, they didn't expect to be in this perilous situation - lost and with limited supplies. As they continued sharing the ration bar, Joe thought about their dire circumstances. They were both hungry, thirsty, and exhausted from days of navigating through rough terrain. Joe, who was responsible for leading Danny, felt a heavy burden on his shoulders. He was not only responsible for his life but also for his friend's well-being. Despite his concern for Danny, Joe couldn't help but admire his blind friend's resilience. Danny never complained about their situation or allowed his disability to hold him back. Instead, he had a knack for lifting their spirits with a well-timed joke, or providing a listening ear when Joe needed to vent his frustration. As night approached, the temperature dropped, and the friends huddled together for warmth. Joe started a small fire to ward off the chilling air and to keep wild animals at bay. They spent the evening recounting their fondest memories, stories of past adventures, and dreams for the future. Their bond only deepened in the face of adversity. The next morning, in the pale light of dawn, Joe crafted a makeshift walking stick for Danny, helping him to navigate the rough terrain more easily. With renewed hope, they set off in search of help or a way out of the wilderness. Throughout the day, the friends worked as a team. Joe focused on deciphering the landscape, while Danny strained to use his heightened senses of hearing and touch to search for signs of civilization or nearby water sources. Together, they devised creative solutions for the numerous obstacles they encountered, such as crossing treacherous streams or setting traps to catch some food. That night, they managed to catch a small rabbit, and Joe cooked it over their fire. The meal, though meager, brought them both strength and comfort, as they held onto hope that their situation would improve soon. On the following day, as they trekked further into the unknown, Danny noticed a faint sound in the distance. With his extraordinary sense of hearing, he was able to guide Joe towards what he believed to be the sound of human civilization. Their hearts raced as they got closer. Finally, after hours of walking towards the sound, they stumbled upon a small village on the outskirts of the wilderness. The villagers greeted the exhausted friends with open arms, providing them with food, shelter, and the necessary resources for contacting a rescue team. Once they were safely back home, Joe and Danny's friendship had become stronger than ever. Their harrowing experience taught them about resilience, hope, and the power of perseverance. The bond they shared would continue to flourish throughout their remaining years, as they continued to embark on countless adventures and face adversities together. After all, true friendship is like an unbreakable rope – pulling each other through the darkest of times and the toughest of challenges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen, which can be animal, wind, or human intervention (by hand-pollination or by using a pollen sprayer). Cross pollination produces seeds with a different genetic makeup from the parent plants; such seeds may be created deliberately as part of a selective breeding program for fruit trees with desired attributes. Trees that are cross-pollinated or pollinated via an insect pollinator produce more fruit than trees with flowers that just self-pollinate. In fruit trees, bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit. Possible answers: 1). no; 2). yes;","completion":"Based on the text provided, it is true that bees are needed to pollinate fruit trees. The text states that, \\"In fruit trees, bees are an essential part of the pollination process for the formation of fruit.\\" Although there are other possible pollinators, such as the wind or humans, bees play a crucial role in enabling the cross-pollination of flowers. This is because the pollination process requires a carrier for the pollen to transfer from one flower to another for the fertilization of the flowers. Cross pollination, as mentioned in the text, leads to the production of seeds with a different genetic makeup from their parent plants. This genetic diversity is beneficial for the plants, allowing them to adapt better to various environmental conditions and resist pests and diseases. This process may also be used deliberately in selective breeding programs for fruit trees with desired attributes. Furthermore, the text highlights that cross-pollinated trees or trees pollinated via an insect pollinator, such as bees, tend to produce more fruit compared to self-pollinating trees. Bees are efficient pollinators as they visit multiple flowers during their foraging process, allowing for a higher rate of successful cross-pollination. In summary, bees play an essential role in pollinating fruit trees, as they contribute to successful cross-pollination and the formation of fruit. Thus, based on the information given in the text, the answer related to the necessity of bees for the pollination of fruit trees is 2). Yes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mary always got good deals when she was grocery shopping but Natalie did not because","completion":"Natalie simply didn't have the same level of experience or patience as Mary. Mary had been a thrifty shopper for years, always seeking out the best bargains and using her knowledge of sales cycles, coupons, and store policies to her advantage. Natalie, on the other hand, was new to managing her own grocery budget and just didn't have the same set of skills yet. One day, Natalie decided to tag along with Mary on her weekly grocery shopping trip, hoping to learn some of her secrets. As they entered the store, Mary immediately went to the area near the entrance where the weekly sale flyers were located. “First thing's first,” Mary said to Natalie, “Always grab the weekly flyer and take a look at what's on sale. This is where you'll find the best deals and plan your purchases and meals around them.” Natalie took a flyer and began flipping through the pages, noting the special offers on meats, produce, and other essential items. Meanwhile, Mary pulled out a small notebook from her purse, filled with neatly written lists and additional coupons she had found in various places. “My next tip is to use coupons whenever possible, but only if they are for items that you actually use or need. Otherwise, you end up spending more money rather than saving it.” Natalie nodded, realizing she had made that mistake before. As they walked through the store aisles, Mary continued to explain her shopping strategies to Natalie. “Another thing I do is keep track of the regular prices of items I often buy. That way, I know if the ‘sale price’ shown is actually a good deal or not.” Natalie glanced at the products on the shelves, comparing their current prices with the ones listed in the flyer she was holding. She started to recognize some of the marketing tricks that she had fallen for in the past. When they reached the produce section, Mary paused to inspect some fruits. “Some things, like fruit and vegetables, don't usually have coupons. So for these items, I try to buy them when they're in season, which means they're fresher and usually on sale.” She picked up a container of strawberries and checked the price against her notes. “These are actually a great price right now, so I'll grab a couple.” As the shopping trip continued, Natalie began to understand the secret to Mary's thrifty shopping habits: being organized, patient, and having a willingness to plan ahead. Natalie had always been more of an impulsive shopper, buying whatever caught her eye instead of making a conscious decision based on the best deals. But now, she was committed to change. By the end of the day, Natalie had not only learned a number of valuable money-saving tips, but she had helped them both cart away a hefty amount of groceries, all while staying comfortably within their budgets. As they loaded their haul into the car, she turned to Mary, a grin spreading across her face. “Thanks so much for showing me how you do this, Mary. I think I'll be a much smarter shopper from now on.” Mary smiled and patted her on the back. “No problem, Natalie. Just remember: it's a skill that takes time and practice. But soon enough, you'll be getting good deals just like me.” Natalie nodded in determination. In addition to saving money, she was excited about the new sense of control and confidence she felt in managing her own finances. As the pair drove home, they were already talking about their next shopping trip and the great deals that awaited them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Pearl Prophet volunteers for the dangerous courier mission and is made into a cyborg through surgical augmentation. Pearl, accompanied by bodyguard Marshall Strat, retrieves the data in New York but is pursued by the vicious Fender Tremolo and his gang of pirates.

Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents. They encounter other Jewish escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership.

Article: If there's a child in your house who likes pixies , nature, or magic, Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure is sure to be a hit. This beautifully animated film is a first class production in every way, and features the familiar voices of Kristin Chenoweth, Anjelica Huston, Jane Horrocks, Lucy Liu, and Raven Symone. The movie offers up an adventure that's easy enough to follow, but complex enough to hold one's attention, and even throws in a nice little moral about friendship. What can I say? I'm pleasantly surprised. The up-and-coming Mae Whitman voices Tinker Bell herself, a far more dynamic character than we met in Peter Pan. Though Tinker still possesses her fiery temper, it doesn't manifest itself immediately, and takes a backseat to this pixie's many good qualities. As it turns out, Tinker Bell is extremely skilled at tinkering , so she is a natural choice to build a special scepter , for Pixie Hollow's Autumn Celebration. The scepter will hold the moonstone through which the light of the Blue Moon will pass, supplying Pixie Hollow with enough pixie dust for the year ahead. For days, Tinkers works hard on the perfect scepter design while her good friend Terrence does his best to assist. When Terrence accidentally breaks the Moon Stone, Tinker Bell \\"explodes\\" and sends him away. One of Tinker's more literal friends finds this extremely concerning, as she doesn't quite understand that the outburst was emotional rather than physical ----- very funny indeed. After hearing the legend of the lost treasure, Tinker Bell strikes out on her own to find a new Moon Stone. She faces many difficulties and meets new friends along the way, but when Terrence comes to the rescue at Tinker's darkest hour, she realizes the value of a truly loyal friend. Though the film is engaging and offers a positive message to young viewers, it's the animation that makes Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure stand out.

Haiti is in size and has an estimated 10.6 million people, making it the most populous country in the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) and the second-most populous country in the Caribbean as a whole. - A sovereign state is, in international law, a nonphysical juridical entity that is represented by one centralised government that has sovereignty over a geographic area. International law defines sovereign states as having a permanent population, defined territory, one government, and the capacity to enter into relations with other sovereign states. It is also normally understood that a sovereign state is neither dependent on nor subjected to any other power or state. - The Dominican Republic is a sovereign state occupying the eastern two-thirds of the island of Hispaniola, in the Greater Antilles archipelago in the Caribbean region.

Eric often had liposuction but Brett did not, as Brett was indifferent of their body. The two individuals had distinctly contrasting views on body image and personal preferences when it came to self-care and appearance. While Eric felt the need to undergo liposuction to achieve his desired aesthetic, Brett remained at peace with their body as it was. Eric's decision to frequently opt for liposuction could have stemmed from various reasons, such as societal pressure, personal insecurities, or wanting to achieve a certain standard of beauty. Liposuction, a popular cosmetic surgery procedure, involves the removal of fat from specific parts of the body to enhance its overall shape and contour. By undergoing this procedure, Eric likely aimed to gain more confidence and satisfaction in his appearance. On the other hand, Brett's indifference towards their own body allowed them to embrace a different perspective on personal appearance and self-worth. Instead of focusing on physical attributes and adopting cosmetic procedures to conform to societal norms, Brett prioritized other aspects of their life, such as relationships, personal growth, or career achievements. They may have practiced body positivity, accepting their body for what it was, or believed that physical appearance held little importance compared to other determining factors of success and happiness. Thus, the contrast between Eric and Brett's outlooks on their bodies serves as a reminder of the vast array of attitudes and preferences people can hold when it comes to personal appearance and self-care. While some, like Eric, may choose to undergo procedures such as liposuction to feel more confident, others, like Brett, may find solace in being indifferent to their body and focusing on other aspects of life.

The presence of the Vorontsov Lighthouse, a renowned 27.2-metre-tall red-and-white landmark, further emphasizes the importance of the port to the region. This iconic lighthouse, built in its current form in the early 1950s, has endured multiple modifications and reconstructions since the original version was constructed in 1863. Its enduring presence speaks to the ongoing significance of the port and its maritime trade. The lighthouse is named after Prince Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov, an influential 19th-century Russian nobleman and statesman.

Yes or no? Answer: \\"The Princess and the Pea\\" (; literal translation: \\"The Princess on the Pea\\") is a literary fairy tale by Hans Christian Andersen about a young woman whose royal identity is established by a test of her physical sensitivity. Question: where is the princess from in The Princess and the Pea Answer:","completion":"The original Hans Christian Andersen fairy tale, \\"The Princess and the Pea,\\" does not specifically mention the country or kingdom from which the princess originates. However, the storyline provides some hints and context that can help give a detailed understanding of the situation. In the story, the prince is on a quest to find a true princess to marry. He travels through various kingdoms, encountering several princesses in his journey. Still, none of them are able to prove their genuine royal lineage, much to his disappointment, as there are always certain doubts about their authenticity. One stormy night, a young woman arrives at the castle, drenched by rain and claiming to be a princess. The queen, who wants to test the young woman's claim to royalty, places a single pea beneath twenty mattresses and twenty featherbeds where the alleged princess would sleep. According to the queen's belief, only someone of true royal birth would be sensitive enough to feel the pea under all those layers. As it turns out, the young woman has a sleepless night due to discomfort caused by the pea, thus proving her noble background and sensibility. The prince, now satisfied and delighted, proposes to her, and they have a grand wedding ceremony. Although the kingdom from which the princess comes is never explicitly named, the story's focus on proving one's royal identity emphasizes the importance of nobility and lineage. In summary, the fairy tale does not specify the exact location or kingdom of which the princess is a part; instead, the author Hans Christian Andersen focuses on the theme of sensitivity, nobility, and the journey of finding a true princess. The fairy tale serves as a symbol of royalty and the distinct characteristics that princes and princesses should possess, allowing their noble nature to shine through, even when tested by the slightest adversities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this \\"The traditional scrum of sharp elbows was notably less intense on Black Friday in the US this year.\\"","completion":"Title: A Tamer Black Friday Experience: The US Witnesses a Notable Decline in Physical In-Store Hustle Introduction Every year, the day after Thanksgiving brings with it a shopping frenzy known as Black Friday. Eager shoppers in the United States brace themselves for long queues and competitive store atmospheres, all in the hopes of bagging the best deals. This year, however, the traditional scrum of sharp elbows was notably less intense. COVID-19-related restrictions, a rise in online shopping, and retailers stretching sales across November have all contributed to a tamer Black Friday experience. Step 1: Discuss COVID-19-Related Restrictions The global pandemic has brought forth several restrictions and guidelines to protect public health, and these measures have had a significant impact on Black Friday sales. Though some stores remained open, measures such as limited in-store capacities, social distancing, and mask mandates deterred many from partaking in the typical Black Friday dash. As people prioritize health and safety, retail experiences have needed to adapt. Step 2: Examine the Rise in Online Shopping The surge in online shopping was another significant factor contributing to a less chaotic Black Friday. With many shoppers looking to avoid crowded spaces, they turned to the comforts of their homes and the convenience of their devices. This shift towards e-commerce has helped maintain sales momentum, as retailers provided fantastic online deals and offers. Consequently, this satisfied the bargain-hunting appetites of consumers, all while avoiding the frenetic in-store experience. Step 3: Look at Extended Black Friday Sales In a bid to facilitate a safer shopping experience, retailers have stretched Black Friday sales across November, starting earlier than usual, and even referring to the entire month as \\"Black November.\\" Some stores even offered week-long or month-long deals to avoid the typical one-day rush, allowing shoppers to take their time and plan their purchases more strategically. This extension of sales has significantly dispersed the crowd and reduced the physical stress on the actual day of Black Friday. Conclusion Black Friday 2021 gave bargain hunters a tamer shopping experience, with less of the traditional sharp elbow jostling, thanks to an adaptation of retail practices in response to the pandemic. Shoppers and retailers alike have embraced a combination of COVID-19 restrictions, a shift towards online shopping, and extended sale periods, all of which contributed to the more serene atmosphere witnessed this year. As the world continues to overcome these unprecedented challenges, it is essential for industries to adapt and find safer ways to cater to consumers' needs, and this Black Friday serves as a promising example."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer correctly the following question related to the paragraph below. Which person had a greater chance of suffering permanent brain damage? Tammy and Rob rode a tandem bike down the hill. They hit a large rock and fell. Tammy wound up in the hospital and was diagnosed with a serious brain injury. Rob suffered only a mild concussion. Hint: A person with a serious brain injury usually suffers permanent brain damage. These brain injuries usually occur when an external mechanical force, such as a violent blow or jolt to the head or body, causes brain dysfunction. An object penetrating the skull, such as a bullet or a shattered piece of the skull, also can cause traumatic brain injury. As a result, the person may have trouble talking or controlling body movements. Symptoms depend on what part of the brain was injured. Serious brain injuries can also cause personality changes and problems with mental abilities such as memory. Medicines, counseling, and other treatments may help people with serious brain injuries recover from, or at least learn to cope with, their disabilities.

What is the answer to this question? who played chewbacca in star wars episode 4?","completion":"The actor who played Chewbacca in Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope, the first film released in the iconic Star Wars series in 1977, was Peter Mayhew. He was a British-American actor who stood at 7 feet 3 inches (2.21 meters) tall, making him an ideal choice to portray the towering Wookiee co-pilot of the Millennium Falcon. Born on May 19, 1944, in London, England, Peter Mayhew worked in several different capacities before his role in Star Wars, including a brief stint as a hospital orderly. George Lucas, the creator of Star Wars, had initially cast bodybuilder David Prowse to play Chewbacca. However, Prowse opted to play the role of Darth Vader instead, opening the door for Mayhew. Mayhew portrayed Chewbacca, the loyal and lovable sidekick of Han Solo, played by Harrison Ford. The character of Chewbacca was an extremely tall, hairy, and bipedal creature from the planet Kashyyyk, with an appearance inspired by George Lucas's own Alaskan Malamute dog. The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Peter Mayhew on screen was evident, making Han Solo and Chewbacca one of the most memorable duos in cinematic history. Chewbacca quickly became a fan favorite due to his loyalty, bravery, and friendship with Han Solo, despite communicating only through a series of growls and roars, which were later dubbed over by sound designer Ben Burtt. Mayhew was able to convey a range of emotions through his body movements and expressive eyes. Peter Mayhew reprised his role as Chewbacca in The Empire Strikes Back (1980), Return of the Jedi (1983), and Revenge of the Sith (2005), before passing the torch to Finnish actor Joonas Suotamo due to his declining health. Suotamo served as a body double for Mayhew in The Force Awakens (2015) and took over the role of Chewbacca completely in subsequent Star Wars films and appearances. Sadly, Peter Mayhew passed away on April 30, 2019, but his portrayal of Chewbacca remains an enduring and well-loved aspect of the Star Wars universe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A: A:","completion":"Bone fractures are breaks or cracks in the bones, which can occur due to various factors. The primary causes of bone fractures can be broadly grouped into two categories - traumatic fractures and pathological fractures. 1. Traumatic fractures: Traumatic fractures are caused by external forces applied to the bone, either directly or indirectly. They are the most common type of fractures and can occur due to several reasons: a) Accidents: Accidents, such as automobile crashes and falls, are major causes of traumatic fractures. Sudden impacts or forced movements can cause bones to break or crack. In elderly people, falls are particularly dangerous and can result in hip and wrist fractures. b) Sports and physical activities: High-impact sports like football, rugby, or basketball, as well as activities like skiing or gymnastics, can lead to fractures due to the intense force applied to the bones during these activities. Stress fractures can also develop in athletes due to repetitive stress on specific bones. c) Physical assault: Violent impacts or forceful twisting caused by assaults can result in bone fractures. Fractures caused by physical assault might include skull fractures, facial fractures, or rib fractures. 2. Pathological fractures: Pathological fractures occur when a bone that has been weakened by a disease or condition breaks due to minor stress or force, which would not normally cause a fracture in a healthy bone. Several factors can contribute to bone weakness and pathological fractures: a) Osteoporosis: Osteoporosis is a condition characterized by the loss of bone mineral density and bone strength, leading to an increased risk of fractures, especially in the spine, wrist, and hip. It is more common in older people, particularly women who have gone through menopause. b) Osteogenesis imperfecta: This is a genetic disorder that causes brittle and fragile bones. People with osteogenesis imperfecta are more prone to fractures, even from mild impacts or movements. c) Infections: Bone infections, such as osteomyelitis, can weaken the bone structure and cause fractures. Bacterial or fungal infections can cause inflammation and gradual destruction of bone tissue, increasing the risk of fractures. d) Bone tumors: Benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous) tumors can grow within the bone and weaken the bone structure. Malignant tumors, such as osteosarcoma or Ewing's sarcoma, can cause pathological fractures and spread cancer cells to other parts of the body. e) Nutritional deficiencies: Deficiencies in crucial nutrients like calcium, vitamin D, and phosphorus can lead to weak bones, and eventually bone fractures. Ensuring a balanced diet with adequate amounts of these nutrients is crucial in maintaining bone health. f) Metabolic diseases: Some metabolic disorders, like hyperparathyroidism, can lead to bone weakness and fractures. The disorder disrupts the balance of calcium and phosphate in the body, resulting in the loss of bone density. g) Medications: Certain medications, including corticosteroids and anti-seizure medications, can adversely affect bone density and increase the risk of fractures. Preventing bone fractures involves maintaining healthy bone density and strength through proper nutrition, regular exercise, and early detection of bone diseases. In addition, taking safety precautions while engaging in sports or physical activities and avoiding accidents can help reduce the risk of traumatic fractures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Dietary supplements are big business, with around half of the Australian population using at least one type per year; most commonly a multivitamin and mineral pill. Many people take supplements as a form of dietary insurance in case they are not meeting their nutrient needs from foods alone. Others take them as a form of health insurance – to protect against certain diseases. Some just take them out of habit. Supplements do have a role to play in some situations. People with a diagnosed deficiency, those with malabsorption conditions, women planning pregnancy, and people with very poor diets all can benefit from specific nutrient supplementation. But what about the benefit of supplements across the broad population? The mantra of most health professionals, which is even etched on the label of many supplements, is that supplements may only be of assistance if dietary sources are lacking. To see if this is supported by solid evidence, a systematic review of 63 clinical trials involving some form of supplementation in non-pregnant adults was carried out by a team of medical researchers. The clinical trials were broad in their nature with many nutrients studied including vitamins A, B6, B12, C, D and E; folic acid; calcium; selenium, omega-3 fatty acids; ginkgo biloba; glucosamine; saw palmetto; and milk thistle. All of the studies were randomised controlled trials and evaluated a range of health outcomes including risk of heart disease, cancer, diabetes, bone fractures, cognitive function and all-cause mortality. From the 63 studies, no benefit was seen in 45 studies with 10 of these showing a trend towards harm and just two showing a trend towards a benefit. Of the remaining studies, four showed harm with a greater risk of cancer with beta-carotene and a higher risk of fractures with a once-yearly dose of vitamin D. One study showed a lower risk of cancer with selenium supplementation, but this was not validated in much larger trials. Twelve studies showed a benefit and these mostly involved vitamin D...

Black people is a term used in certain countries, often in socially based systems of racial classification or of ethnicity, to describe persons who are perceived to be dark-skinned compared to other given populations. As such, the meaning of the expression varies widely both between and within societies, and depends significantly on context. For many other individuals, communities and countries, \\"black\\" is also perceived as a derogatory, outdated, reductive or otherwise unrepresentative label, and as a result is neither used nor defined. Different societies apply differing criteria regarding who is classified as \\"black\\", and these social constructs have also changed over time. In a number of countries, societal variables affect classification as much as skin color, and the social criteria for \\"blackness\\" vary. For example, in North America the term black people is not necessarily an indicator of skin color or majority ethnic ancestry, but it is instead a socially based racial classification related to being African American, with a family history associated with institutionalized slavery. In South Africa and Latin America, for instance, mixed-race people are generally not classified as \\"black.\\" In South Pacific regions such as Australia and Melanesia, European colonists applied the term \\"black\\" or it was used by populations with different histories and ethnic origin.

If Senator Ghitter is correct about his interpretation of the motion, that would mean that the committee adopted a proposition that was contrary to the Rules of the Senate while he was in the chair; that he and the other committee members and the clerk of the committee understood this motion to mean that he had to report by twelve noon today, even though the Senate would not be sitting until 4 p.m. today; and that no one, including himself, knew that this would be contrary to the rules. Can we draw the following conclusion? Senator Ghitter knows some rules of the senate,","completion":"but he may lack comprehensive knowledge and understanding of all pertinent rules, leading to potential oversight in executing his duties as the chairperson of the committee. To fully analyze this scenario, let's first explore the key points raised in this assumption. 1. The committee adopted a proposition contrary to the Rules of the Senate while Senator Ghitter was in the chair: As the chairperson of the committee, it is inherently presumed that Senator Ghitter should possess a firm grasp of the Senate rules. However, it appears that he and the other committee members might not have been completely familiar with all the rules, causing them to adopt a proposition that clashed with the existing Senate regulations. 2. Senator Ghitter and other parties thought the motion implied he had to report by twelve noon today, while the Senate would only be in session later in the day: This suggests that there might have been a misinterpretation or lack of clarity regarding the motion. Moreover, it highlights the possibility of inadequate communication between the committee members or perhaps a lack of procedural clarity in the Senate rules. 3. No one, including Senator Ghitter, was aware that the adopted motion was contrary to the rules: In this case, it seems Senator Ghitter's knowledge of the Senate rules might be limited or at least not comprehensive enough to identify the contradiction. This lack of awareness could have also stemmed from the overall ambiguity in the motion or the language used. Considering the context and the points raised, we can indeed conclude that Senator Ghitter knows some rules of the Senate. Simultaneously, it is important to acknowledge his potential lack of comprehensive knowledge of all the applicable rules, which led to the committee adopting a proposition contrary to the Senate rules. It is essential for members of any governing body, including Senator Ghitter, to possess a thorough understanding of the rules and procedures that guide their decision-making processes. This enables them to function effectively and uphold the integrity of the institution. Thus, Senator Ghitter should take this experience as an opportunity to further familiarize himself with all the relevant Senate rules to avoid future inconsistencies or potential conflicts with the rules and procedures."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write highlights for this article: Dozens of Labour MPs employ staff on zero-hours contracts — despite Ed Miliband claiming they have 'no place in the 21st century'. Official figures from Parliament's expenses watchdog show 36 Labour MPs employed staff on the casual contracts last year. Some of Mr Miliband's closest allies in the Labour Party have used the contracts – including his election campaign co-ordinator Lucy Powell and parliamentary bag carrier Karen Buck – who has six staff on the contracts. Ed Miliband claimed zero-hours contracts have 'no place in the 21st century' - even though 36 Labour MPs employ staff on them. Mr Miliband has repeatedly criticised zero-hours contracts and companies using them. Just last week he said: 'If you are working regular hours then you should get a regular contract.' Zerohours contracts allow a company to vary the number of hours staff can work each week or month between full-time and none at all. Labour has insisted it is not 'exploiting' workers and the casual contracts were typically of those used to take on interns part-time. But the revelation is an embarrassment for Mr Miliband, who has vowed to tackle the 'epidemic' of zero-hours contracts if Labour wins power. Last year, Mr Miliband slammed the high street giant Sports Direct, owned by Newcastle United chief Mike Ashley. He said: 'Sports Direct has predictable turnover, it is a modern company with stores on many high streets and, judging by its success, where many people shop,' he will say. 'But for too many of its employees, Sports Direct is a bad place to work. This is not about exceptional use of zero-hours contracts for short-term or seasonal work … This is the way Sports Direct employs the vast majority of its workforce. These Victorian practices have no place in the 21st century.' Last year Mr Miliband hit out at the high street chain Sports Direct for employing its staff on zero hours contracts. Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley has come under fire from politicians and union bosses for employing thousands of workers on zero-hours contracts. Last year it emerged even the shadow chancellor Ed Balls employed four staff on zero-hours contracts. Several Labour-run councils also employ staff on zero hours, including Doncaster Council, the authority in Mr Miliband's constituency which admitted employing 300 people on the contracts. Freedom of Information inquiries show that in 2013, Derby Council employed 1,333 people on the contracts, Gateshead 1,285 and Bury 3,418. All are run by Labour. Conservative MP Julian Smith MP told MailOnline the figures exposed the 'same old do-as-we-say-not-as-we-do hypocrisy from the Labour Party'. He said: ‘Ed Miliband might say he’s against zero hours contracts but his MPs ignore him and use them anyway.

Q:I read this background article the other day: The theory of evolution by natural selection was proposed at about the same time by both Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, shown in Figure below , and was set out in detail in Darwin's 1859 book On the Origin of Species . Natural selection is a process that causes heritable traits that are helpful for survival and reproduction to become more common, and harmful traits, or traits that are not helpful or advantageous for survival to become more rare in a population of organisms. This occurs because organisms with advantageous traits are more \\"fit\\" to survive in a particular environment and have \\"adapted\\" to the conditions of that environment. These individuals will have greater reproductive success than organisms less fit for survival in the environment. This will lead to an increase in the number of organisms with the advantageous trait(s) over time. Over many generations, adaptations occur through a combination of successive, small, random changes in traits, and natural selection of those variants best-suited for their environment. Natural selection is one of the cornerstones of modern biology. I am facing a new situation today: David wants to revisit the theory of evolution proposed by Darwin and Wallace. He is particularly interested in two species of deer, species A and species B. Species A has some helpful traits, but species B has some harmful traits. He is planning to write a paper on why some species are greater in number while others are smaller in number. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which species would decrease in number, species A and species B? A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the background article on the theory of evolution by natural selection, we can effectively address the question about which species, species A or species B, would decrease in number. To recap, the process of natural selection favors individuals with heritable traits that are advantageous for survival and reproduction in their specific environment. Over time and many generations, organisms that possess these helpful traits will increase in number as they are more likely to survive and reproduce successfully. On the other hand, organisms with harmful traits or traits that do not confer any advantage for survival will have a harder time surviving and reproducing, leading to a decrease in their numbers. In the situation you described, species A has some helpful traits, while species B has some harmful traits. According to the theory of evolution by natural selection, we would expect species A to experience an increase in population size as the individuals with helpful traits are better adapted to their environment and have greater reproductive success. In contrast, species B, with harmful traits, should decrease in number as their individuals are less adapted to their environment and might struggle to survive and reproduce. David's paper should focus on the principles of natural selection as proposed by Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace, and the fact that species with advantageous traits are more likely to survive and increase in number, while species with harmful traits are more likely to struggle and decrease in number. When examining the case of species A and species B, David should analyze how the specific helpful traits of species A contribute to its survival and reproductive success, while also examining how the harmful traits of species B affect its chances of survival and reproduction. Additionally, David could delve into the environmental factors that might favor or hamper the survival and reproduction of each species, and how these factors may influence the natural selection process. Discussing factors such as predation, competition, and available resources will help provide a comprehensive understanding of why species A with helpful traits is more likely to increase in number, while species B, with harmful traits, might decrease in number over time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He bought Orson Welles's own directorial copy of the script for the radio broadcast The War of the Worlds (1938) in 1994. Spielberg has purchased Academy Award statuettes being sold on the open market and donated them to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, to prevent their further commercial exploitation. His donations include the Oscars that Bette Davis received for Dangerous (1935) and Jezebel (1938), and Clark Gable's Oscar for It Happened One Night (1934). Spielberg is a major collector of the work of American illustrator and painter Norman Rockwell. A collection of 57 Rockwell paintings and drawings owned by Spielberg and fellow Rockwell collector and film director George Lucas were displayed at the Smithsonian American Art Museum July 2, 2010 - January 2, 2011, in an exhibition titled Telling Stories. Spielberg is an avid film buff, and, when not shooting a picture, he will watch many films in a single weekend. He sees almost every major summer blockbuster in theaters if not preoccupied and enjoys most of them. Since playing Pong while filming Jaws in 1974, Spielberg has been an avid video gamer. Spielberg played many of LucasArts adventure games, including the first Monkey Island games. He owns a Wii, a PlayStation 3, a PSP and Xbox 360, and enjoys playing first-person shooters such as the Medal of Honor series and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare. He has also criticized the use of cutscenes in games, calling them intrusive, and feels making story flow naturally into the gameplay is a challenge for future game developers.

Question: When did EL Greco have his epic journey? Movie title: El Greco Movie plot: The film tells the story of Domenicos Theotokopoulos, better known as El Greco, a great Greek artist of the 16th century with an uncompromising character, who sets off from his homeland Crete and goes to Venice and finally Toledo, in search of freedom and love. There he is confronted by his greatest adversary, the Spanish Inquisition, but his creative consciousness and power make him stand out and overcome barbarity and ignorance. Being imprisoned and awaiting execution by the Spanish Inquisition, Domenicos (Nick Ashdon) writes out his story, thus parts of his life play out in extended flashbacks. Born on the island of Crete, which was at the time part of the Republic of Venice, he falls in love with Francesca (Dimitra Matsouka), daughter of the Venetian governor of Crete. But his father is preparing a political rebellion and as a result Domenicos leaves the island and moves to Venice, away from the young woman. There he meets the famous painter Titian (Sotiris Moustakas) and the Spanish priest Fernando NiÃ±o de Guevara (Juan Diego Botto). Guevara immediately shows a confused interest in Domenicos, and, when roiled[clarification needed] by the Greek - and fighting personal demons - calls Domenicos before the Inquisition where he must defend himself against charges of heresy. Answer:","completion":"El Greco's epic journey began in the mid-16th century, when he left his homeland of Crete for Venice, and later, Toledo. The exact date of this journey may vary, as there are differing accounts of his life and travels. However, it is known that he arrived in Venice around 1567, and in Toledo around 1577.

If I'm a little uncomfortable with the way the question invites a sense of cultural superiority., can we conclude that \\"The question poses no problems. \\"? a. yes; b. it is not possible to tell; c. no;","completion":"c. No The comfort level one experiences with a question is influenced by a multitude of factors such as personal beliefs, experiences, and cultural backgrounds. If you're uncomfortable with the way a question invites a sense of cultural superiority, this suggests that the question indeed does pose a problem on an individual level. At the very least, it is problematic from the perspective of promoting equal attention, respect, and appreciation for all cultures. A question that invites a sense of cultural superiority can perpetuate stereotypes and harms associated with cultural bias, cultural appropriation, and ethnocentrism. It can also exhibit offensive or disrespectful undertones, marginalize diverse groups, exacerbate inequalities, and discourage multicultural understanding. Thus, your discomfort in such a scenario challenges the statement, \\"The question poses no problem.\\" Cultural sensitivity, equality, and respect are critical when forming and posing questions. Tolerance and understanding are crucial components of communication, enabling us to bridge the gap between cultures and facilitate the sharing of diverse perspectives. However, on a societal or collective level, whether or not the question is problematic may depend on the prevailing norms, values, and level of cultural sensitivity. If these aspects of society also echo your discomfort, a shared consensus might determine the question as problematic. The underlying fact remains that sensitivity to questions implying cultural superiority is integral to ethical and respectful communication. Therefore, affirming that \\"The question poses no problems\\" is not possible in this case. So, recognizing your discomfort and treating it seriously is a step toward advocating for culturally sensitive dialogue, which implies minimizing cultural bias and promoting inclusivity and respect for all cultures."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The commission had ordered the LSE to sell its 60% stake in MTS, a fixed-income trading platform. However, the LSE said the request was \\"disproportionate\\". It warned investors it would struggle to sell MTS and that such a sale would harm its ongoing business. As a result, the LSE said: \\"Based on the commission's current position, LSE believes that the commission is unlikely to provide clearance for the merger.\\" The two rival exchanges announced plans for a \\"merger of equals\\" about a year ago, aiming to create a giant trading powerhouse that would better compete against US rivals. They had already agreed to sell part of LSE's clearing business, LCH, to satisfy competition concerns before the commission's surprise demand concerning MTS earlier this month. The Commission had given the exchanges until Monday to come up with a proposal to meet that demand. LSE said that such a sale would need regulatory approval from several European governments and would hurt its wider Italian business. \\"Taking all relevant factors into account, and acting in the best interests of shareholders, the LSE Board today concluded that it could not commit to the divestment of MTS,\\" the exchange said on Sunday night. When the London Stock Exchange trumpeted its merger with Deutsche Boerse last year, the chairman, Donald Brydon, was remarkably relaxed about the Brexit vote. He and his German counterparts said the deal would go ahead regardless of the outcome. What they didn't know was that it would eventually fall foul of another aspect of the single market - Brussels' control of competition laws. The two sides have made no bones about the fact the merger would create a company with a powerful presence in key markets, and have offered a number of sops to competition authorities in an attempt to win their approval. But it was not enough; Brussels insisted the LSE cede control of MTS, an important Italian clearing house with a crucial role in the trading of Italian government debt. For the LSE board, this was a step too far. A sale of MTS would be too harmful, the directors decided, and they have chosen not to meet an European deadline to say how they would get rid of it. The Brits say they want to go ahead with the merger, but it looks like an insurmountable obstacle. The LSE will either go it alone in a post-Brexit world, or - as has often seemed possible before, and even more so now - fall into the arms of one of the giant American exchanges. MTS is a relatively small part of LSE's business, but it is a major platform for trading European government bonds, particularly in Italy, where it is classified as a \\"systemically important regulated business\\". The LSE group also owns the Milan-based Borsa Italiana. The LSE said it remained convinced about the merits of a merger, but joining forces with Deutsche Boerse would be impossible unless the commission changed its stance. Deutsche Boerse said on Sunday night that it and the LSE would await a further assessment by the European Commission, which was expected to make a decision by the end of March. Syed Kamall, MEP for London and a member of the European Parliament's financial services committee, told the BBC: \\"I think this is good news for competition, and it's also good news for those who are worried that some business in London might be moved to Frankfurt via the back door.\\" The European Commission declined to comment. Shares in the London Stock Exchange fell 3% on the news.

Daniel Villegas' 1995 Conviction Raises Questions About Coerced Confession and Inadequate Representation Daniel Villegas, now 35, was convicted back in 1995 for the drive-by shooting of two men. The double murder, which took place more than two decades ago, sparked controversy due to the questionable circumstances surrounding Villegas' confession and the lack of physical evidence linking him to the crime. Now, new information has surfaced about the potential mishandling of his case and the possibility that the true culprits were two brothers, one of whom has passed away. Villegas was only 16 years old at the time of the drive-by shooting. During his interrogation, he confessed to the crime. However, he later recanted his confession, claiming that it had been obtained through coercion by police investigators. This begs the question: was his confession given willingly, or was it the result of aggressive police questioning? The timeline and circumstances surrounding his confession might hold the key to unraveling this mystery. Adding to the controversy surrounding the case is the striking absence of physical evidence connecting Villegas to the crime scene. In countless wrongful conviction cases, the presence of DNA or other physical evidence plays a vital role in linking suspects to the crime. However, in this case, not a shred of such evidence has been found to implicate Villegas in the double murder. In light of this absence of evidence, the defense team for Villegas has voiced concerns about the quality of his representation during the 1995 trial. They claim that Villegas' court-appointed attorney spent a mere 40 hours preparing for the trial, which is a frighteningly low amount of time given the gravity of the charges he faced. The lack of preparation seems to have played a pivotal role in the outcome of Villegas' trial, as key details in his defense might have been overlooked or dismissed. Interestingly, the two murders have been attributed to two brothers, one of whom has since passed away. If this is indeed the truth, it brings into question the legitimacy of Villegas' conviction and opens up the possibility that a serious miscarriage of justice occurred back in 1995. As we revisit this case, it is crucial to remember that justice must be served both for victims and for the accused. It is not enough to simply convict someone for the sake of closure; the integrity of our justice system relies on the accuracy and fairness of its judgments. In light of these recent revelations, it becomes apparent that the case against Daniel Villegas deserves a thorough reexamination to ensure that justice is genuinely upheld. In summary, the conviction of Daniel Villegas more than two decades ago continues to raise questions about coerced confessions, lack of physical evidence, and inadequate legal representation. With the murders being attributed to two other individuals, one must ask whether or not our justice system failed Villegas and if a wrongful conviction took place. It is imperative that this case be revisited to ensure that justice is properly served for all parties involved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Stuck in a hotel in Kuwait, I happily switched to the channel showing this at the very beginning. First Pachelbel's Canon brought a lump to my throat, then the sight of a Tiger Moth (which my grandfather, my father and I have all flown) produced a slight dampness around the eyes and then Crowe's name hooked me completely. I was entranced by this film, Crowe's performance (again), the subject matter (and yes, what a debt we owe), how various matters were addressed and dealt with, the flying sequences (my father flew Avro Ansons, too), the story - and, as another contributor pointed out, Crowe's recitation of High Flight. I won't spoil the film for anyone, but, separated from my wife by 4,000-odd miles, as an ex-army officer who was deployed in a couple of wars and as private pilot, I admit to crying heartily a couple of times.

U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday blasted former FBI director James Comey as an \\"untruthful slime ball,\\" and said it was his \\"great honor\\" to fire him. Trump's barrage of insults comes as Comey engages in a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" which is set to be released next week. The memoir promises a deep look at Comey's fraught relationship with the U.S. president who fired him, and whom Comey has accused of interfering in the independence of the FBI. On Twitter, Trump said Comey should be prosecuted. Trump's comments are in line with an online campaign, organized by his supporters, to discredit Comey. The Republican National Committee on Thursday launched a new website, Lyin'Comey.com, which features quotes from prominent Democrats who have criticized the former FBI director in the past. The GOP plans to fact-check Comey's book and use the website for \\"rapid response\\" to highlight any \\"misstatements\\" or \\"contradictions,\\" Fox News reports. Comey's book blasts Trump as unethical and \\"untethered to truth'' and calls his leadership of the country \\"ego driven and about personal loyalty.'' The book also contains several personal jabs at Trump, including references to what Comey says are the \\"bright white half-moons\\" under Trump's eyes, which he surmises were the result of Trump using tanning goggles. Comey also casts Trump as a Mafia boss-like figure who sought to blur the line between law enforcement and politics, and tried to pressure him regarding his investigation into Russian election interference, according to multiple early reviews of the book. Trump fired Comey in May 2017, setting off a storm of charges from Democrats that the president sought to hinder an investigation into whether his campaign colluded with Russians. The firing led to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation. Mueller's probe has expanded to include whether Trump obstructed justice by firing Comey, an idea the president denies. Trump has... Who did Trump fire from the FBI in 2017? - not enough information - Mueller - Comey - Scotts A:","completion":"In 2017, U.S. President Donald Trump fired James Comey from his position as director of the FBI. This represented a significant moment in Trump's presidency, as it proved a controversial decision due to the circumstances surrounding it. Comey's dismissal took place while the FBI was actively investigating alleged Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election and potential ties between Trump's campaign and Russia. Such actions led to accusations from critics that Trump was attempting to obstruct justice, leading to the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel to oversee the Russia investigation. This firing marked the beginning of a contentious public relationship between Trump and Comey. Following his departure from the FBI, Comey embarked on a publicity campaign for his book, \\"A Higher Loyalty: Truth, Lies, and Leadership,\\" in which he extensively discussed his fraught relationship with Trump. The book was potentially damaging for the President, as Comey presented an image of Trump as a dishonest leader driven by ego and personal loyalty, rather than by a commitment to ethical governance. The Trump administration, in response, launched an aggressive campaign to discredit Comey. This included the establishment of a website by the Republican National Committee, lyincomey.com, that sought to highlight perceived contradictions and inaccuracies in Comey's book and statements. Trump himself also publicly derided Comey, referring to him as an \\"untruthful slime ball\\" and suggesting that he should face prosecution.

LZ Granderson says working for money is a job, not volunteerism. LZ: Second bill requires drug testing, even though few recipients abuse drugs. LZ: Creative ways exist to earn aid that don't exploit or demonize poor people.","completion":"Title: Michigan Bill Aims High, but Does Welfare-to-Work Efforts Stigmatize Recipients? Introduction A proposed Michigan bill, if passed, would require specific welfare recipients to complete community service in exchange for their benefits. The welfare-to-work debate has always been contentious, with proponents arguing that recipient objectivity must extend beyond the financial realm. However, critics like esteemed commentator LZ Granderson have raised concerns that these efforts may stigmatize welfare recipients by blurring the distinction between volunteerism and paid employment. Mandating Community Service: A Job or Volunteering? LZ Granderson has criticized the notion of mandated community service for welfare beneficiaries, arguing that when a person is required to work in exchange for payment, it constitutes a job and not volunteerism. While the motive behind the bill may be to encourage self-sufficiency, it inadvertently undermines the notion of community service as voluntary and altruistic, thereby stigmatizing recipient involvement. Additionally, the bill implicitly equates welfare recipients to non-contributing members of society who must 'earn' their benefits - fostering an environment that is potentially hostile towards those who need assistance. Drug Testing: Efficient Policy or Discriminatory Practice? Another aspect of the proposed Michigan bill is the requirement for drug testing, despite the fact that only a small percentage of welfare recipients engage in substance abuse. The stipulation of mandatory drug tests perpetuates the stereotype that those in need are prone to substance abuse, which further aggravates the stigma experienced by welfare recipients. Considering the minimal evidence supporting drug abuse among welfare beneficiaries, the question arises whether such a policy is not only unethical but also an inefficient use of resources. Exploring Alternative Solutions: Empowerment over Exploitation Rather than exploiting or demonizing poorer populations, Granderson suggests that there are more creative ways to facilitate aid. These alternative methods can include skills training, mentorship programs, and educational opportunities that foster personal growth and self-sufficiency. By focusing on empowerment instead of punitive measures, welfare programs can counteract stigmatization and increase the likelihood that recipients will achieve lasting independence. An Asset-Based Approach to Welfare The ongoing discourse surrounding welfare and public assistance ought to focus on promoting the well-being of recipients from an asset-based perspective - meaning, helping individuals achieve their inherent potential while acknowledging their value to society. Bills like the one proposed in Michigan may be well-intentioned, but they run the risk of perpetuating negative stereotypes and alienating welfare recipients. In conclusion, it is crucial to approach the welfare-to-work debate with a nuanced and empathetic mindset - prioritizing empowerment and personal growth, as opposed to punishment or stigmatization. Policymakers and social service agencies alike should consider asset-based approaches that will help foster self-sufficiency among welfare recipients while avoiding potential exploitation or demonization."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Ms Cooper says more offenders are now avoiding court action as \\"community resolutions\\" are instead being used. Police have disputed the claim they are not taking violence seriously. The Home Office, meanwhile, said the use of the resolutions - which can include apologies or compensation - for serious crimes was \\"not acceptable\\". Community resolutions are used by police to resolve low-level or minor offences through \\"informal agreement between the parties involved\\", instead of through the court system. They are aimed at first-time offenders and can be used where there has been an admission of guilt and after the victim's views have been taken into account. Data compiled by Labour from 15 of the 43 police forces showed there were 3,305 uses of community resolutions for domestic violence in 2013 - up from 1,337 in 2009. In a speech in Birmingham to mark Labour's summer campaign, Ms Cooper said the data is \\"deeply worrying\\" and suggests ministers are \\"turning their backs\\" on victims of domestic violence. She also repeated Labour's promise to ban the use of the resolutions for domestic and sexual violence. Speaking earlier on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Cooper said the aim of Labour's planned legislation was to ensure police intervened in cases of domestic violence. Ms Cooper said in her speech that community resolutions can be \\"very effective\\", but added that they should not \\"be used for violent offences, and especially not for domestic violence\\". She also accused the government, saying it \\"just doesn't take violence against women seriously\\". \\"For the police to simply take a violent abuser home to apologise risks making domestic violence worse and makes it even harder for victims to escape a cycle of abuse,\\" she said. Advice from the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo) suggests community resolutions are suitable for crimes such as criminal damage, minor theft and anti-social behaviour. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan from Greater Manchester Police, Acpo's lead on restorative justice, told Today community resolutions were given in less than 1% of cases categorised as domestic violence. He added the method is \\"specifically attuned to low level domestic abuse particularly where victims want that course of action\\". A Home Office spokeswoman said a review had already been conducted into the inappropriate use of community resolutions. She also said every police force in England and Wales had been written to by Home Secretary Theresa May instructing them to produce a domestic violence action plan. \\"It is not acceptable for the police to use out-of-court settlements for serious criminality and that is why the government is already reviewing how they are used,\\" the spokeswoman said. The Home Office is yet to respond to a consultation on the use of out-of-court disposals, which ended in January. Sandra Horley, chief executive of national domestic violence charity Refuge, said: \\"These types of remedies may be effective for some crimes - but domestic violence is not one of them\\". \\"When women make the extraordinarily brave step of reporting their partners to the police, they must feel confident that they have the full weight of the law behind them.\\" Hilary Fisher, of the charity Women's Aid, said: \\"Women tend not to call and ask for help until they've experienced violence for over five times, sometimes up to 30 times.\\" She said weak punishments would not deter these serial perpetrators who would think \\"if the police don't take it seriously why should I?\\"","completion":"Yvette Cooper, a British Labour Party politician, expressed concern over the increasing use of community resolutions in cases of domestic violence. Community resolutions are measures used by the police to resolve low-level or minor offenses through informal agreements rather than through the court system, often used for first-time offenders.

The Home Office has stated that the use of community resolutions for serious crimes is \\"not acceptable\\" and already conducted a review of their inappropriate use in domestic violence cases. Home Secretary Theresa May has instructed all police forces in England and Wales to develop a domestic violence action plan. Critics, including the chief executives of national domestic violence charities Refuge and Women's Aid, argue that community resolutions are not appropriate for addressing domestic violence and that victims need the full weight of the law behind them.

Maggie asks Frankie to train her, but he initially refuses. Maggie works out tirelessly each day in his gym, even after Frankie tells her she's \\"too old\\" to begin a boxing career at her age.

With prodding from Scrap and impressed with her persistence, Frankie reluctantly agrees to train Maggie. He warns her that he will teach her only the basics and then find her a manager. Other than Maggie and his employees, the only person Frankie has contact with is a local pastor, with whom he spars verbally at daily Mass. Before her first fight, Frankie leaves Maggie with a random manager in his gym, much to her dismay; upon being told by Scrap that said manager deliberately put her up against his best girl (coaching the novice to lose) to give her an easy win, Frankie rejoins Maggie in the middle of the bout and coaches her instead to an unforeseen victory. A natural, she fights her way up in the women's amateur boxing division with Frankie's coaching, winning many of her lightweight bouts with first-round knockouts. Earning a reputation for her KOs, Frankie must resort to bribery to get other managers to put their trainee fighters up against her.

Article: Todd Akin, the Republican candidate for senate in Missouri, said in an interview released this weekend that he did not support abortion for rape victims because: \\"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\" The idea that rape victims cannot get pregnant has long roots. The legal position that pregnancy disproved a claim of rape appears to have been instituted in the UK sometime in the 13th century. One of the earliest British legal texts, Fleta, has a clause in the first book of the second volume stating that: \\"If, however, the woman should have conceived at the time alleged in the appeal, it abates, for without a woman's consent she could not conceive.\\" This was a long-lived legal argument. Samuel Farr's Elements of Medical Jurisprudence contained the same idea as late as 1814: \\"For without an excitation of lust, or the enjoyment of pleasure in the venereal act, no conception can probably take place. So that if an absolute rape were to be perpetrated, it is not likely she would become pregnant.\\" This \\"absolute rape\\" is not quite the same as Akin's \\"legitimate rape\\". Akin seems to be suggesting that the body suppresses conception or causes a miscarriage, while the earlier idea of Farr relates specifically to the importance of orgasm. Through the medieval and early modern period it was widely thought, by lay people as well as doctors, that women could only conceive if they had an orgasm. The biological basis for this idea is what the historian Thomas Laqueur has termed the \\"one sex system\\". The one sex system suggests that women's reproductive organs are fundamentally based on men's reproductive organs, so the vagina is represented as an inverted penis, the ovaries are testes and so on. Women had \\"cooler\\" constitutions, and therefore lacked the heat or force to drive the gonads out of the body, to convert ovaries to testes. Thinking of the sexual organs as mirrors of each other obviously led to questions about the existence of a female \\"seed\\" or ejaculate. There was a disagreement about the roles of male and female seed – did they mingle to create the offspring, or did they contribute different things? Whatever the female seed contributed to conception, it was thought necessary, and so in theory a female orgasm was as important as a male orgasm. Not everyone agreed with this interpretation. Helkiah Crooke, in his 17th century anatomy book Microcosmographia suggested that women's sexual organs were not simply inverted versions of men's, and said that a woman's orgasm was not always needed, although conception was much more likely, and a pregnancy much more secure, if she had one. Generally, though, the idea that a women had to orgasm in order to conceive (although not necessarily at exactly the same time as her male partner) was widespread in popular thought and medical literature in the medieval and early modern period. By logical extension, then, if a woman became pregnant, she must have experienced orgasm, and therefore could not have been the victim of an \\"absolute rape\\". Medical theories of sex, reproduction and conception changed gradually through the 18th century, so that by the 19th century the female orgasm was considered much less important for conception, and the female \\"seed\\" – if it even existed – was of less significance to the foetus. In popular culture the idea of the essential female orgasm lingered, and seems to still exist in a mutated form today. ||||| Rep. Todd Akin (Jeff Roberson | AP) Rep. Todd Akin, Missouri's Republican Senate nominee, caused a public outcry Sunday when he told a local television station that \\"legitimate rape\\" rarely leads to pregnancy. \\"First of all, from what I understand from doctors [pregnancy from rape] is really rare,\\" Akin, the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri, said. \\"If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\" Akin later issued an apology, saying he \\"misspoke\\" when he made an \\"off-the-cuff\\" remark. Empirical evidence suggests that he is indeed wrong: Research published in the Journal of American Obstetrics and Gynecology suggests over 30,000 pregnancies result from rape annually. \\"Rape-related pregnancy occurs with significant frequency,\\" the trio of researchers from the University of South Carolina concluded. \\"It is a cause of many unwanted pregnancies.\\" A separate 2001 study - which used a sample of 405 rape victims between ages 12 and 45 - found that 6.4 percent became pregnant. But while Akin is wrong in his assertion about rape and pregnancy, he certainly isn't alone. His remarks tapped into a strain of thinking that dates back to at least the 1980s, with anti-abortion politicians from Pennsylvania to Arkansas making the case that the trauma of rape can often prevent pregnancy. The argument does not come up frequently, but when it does, it nearly always leads to political controversy. Pennsylvania state Rep. Stephen Freind (R) was an ardent abortion opponent. He authored legislation that included one of the the nation's first abortion waiting periods, and the case went all the way to the Supreme Court. He also looks to be the first legislator to make the argument that rape prevents pregnancy, arguing in the late 1980s that the odds of a pregnancy resulting from rape were \\"one in millions and millions and millions.\\" His explanation? The trauma of rape causes women to \\"secrete a certain secretion which has the tendency to kill sperm.\\" Reproductive health experts immediately denounced those remarks. One told the Philadelphia Inquirer, \\"Boy, if I could find out what that [secretion] was, I'd use it as a contraceptive.\\" The argument was dormant for about a decade, until the late 1990s. That's when a North Carolina legislator, whom Garance Franke-Ruta points to, extended the argument to question whether there should actually be a rape exception from abortion restrictions, given that \\"The facts show that people who are raped - truly raped - the juices don't flow.\\" Arkansas politician Fay Boozman followed up during during his 1998 Senate campaign by arguing that \\"fear-induced hormonal changes could block a rape victim's ability to conceive.\\" Those remarks lead to a backlash when then-Gov. Mike Huckabee tapped Boozman to run the state's health department. The argument was most recently - and perhaps most fully - articulated by National Right to Life president John Wilke in a 1999 essay titled \\"Rape Pregnancies Are Rare.\\" Wilke made a pretty similar case to Akin: That the \\"physical trauma\\" of rape has a way of preventing pregnancy. \\"To get and stay pregnant a woman's body must produce a very sophisticated mix of hormones,\\" Wilke wrote. \\"There's no greater emotional trauma that can be experienced by a woman than an assault rape. This can radically upset her possibility of ovulation, fertilization, implantation and even nurturing of a pregnancy.\\" The scientific evidence for this proposition is, unsurprisingly, shaky. Freind later backed off his theory about secretions, switching to an argument that rape would instead \\"delay, disrupt or prohibit ovulation by preventing the release of hormone-triggering factors.\\" Wilke, the former Right to Life president, does not cite any evidence in his essay; \\"no one knows,\\" he says of the impact. That does not stop him from estimating that the physical trauma of rape \\"certainly cuts this last figure by at least 50 percent and probably more.\\" Why do these arguments come up again and again, even if the scientific evidence - and public opinion - is clearly not in their favor? Usually, they come from legislators looking to push abortion regulations that tighten the constitutionally-required exceptions for cases of rape and incest. That's what Friend was looking for back in 1988. And that's what Akin has pushed for in the House of Representatives. He was among the 227 co-sponsors of the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, introduced earlier this year by Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) That legislation, as initially written, who have prohibited federal funding for abortion except in cases of incest or \\"forcible rape.\\" That last term quickly-turned heads: It had the potential to significantly curtail Medicaid's ability to pay for an abortion for certain rape victims. Those who faced a statutory rape, where one party was too young to consent, could be left out. That language was, much like Akin's Sunday remarks, walked back in the face of public outcry. The legislation was revised within days to include an exception for all rape victims. |||||Summary:","completion":"In an interview, Republican candidate for Senate in Missouri, Todd Akin, claimed that he did not support abortion for rape victims because he believed that \\"if it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down.\\" This idea has long roots, with the belief that rape victims cannot get pregnant appearing in legal texts dating back to the 13th century.

Article: A Korean wave is sweeping across China, with many Chinese women worshiping South Korean actors Kin Soo-hyun and Lee Min-ho as demigods . Chinese netizens always have different opinions. Over South Korean TV dramas, but there is no doubt that programs from the neighboring country are now enjoying a new round of popularity in China, And a big part of the credit for that goes to You Who Came From The Star, the South Korean TV series which is on the air now. You Who Came From The Star and The Heirs have been subjects of hot online discussions throughout Asia. Besides, the book, The Miraculous Journey of Edward Tulane, read by the hero You Who Came From The Star was a hard-to-get item on Amazon for a while. The two TV programs have several common elements :a tall, handsome, and rich hero who loves the heroine blindly and always protects her, and an equally handsome man madly in love with the same woman. Both programs describe the purity of love, which is expressed through a kiss or a warm hug. Perhaps that's the secret of their success; perhaps people still like Cinderella-type stories. The widening wealth gap is a matter of social concern both in South Korea and China, and the challenges that young people face in their hope for a better life might have caused many ordinary girls to dream of marrying rich, caring men. This is precisely what the popular South Korean TV drams describe. _ Many netizens even said at an earlier time that South Korean TV dramas had become popular because of their stereotyped themes: traffic accidents, cancer and other incurable diseases.

Article 94 of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) is focused on the duties and responsibilities of the flag State, which is the country whose flag the fishing vessel is flying. UNCLOS is an international treaty that lays down the legal framework governing the use and conservation of the world's oceans and their resources. According to Article 94, the flag State has the primary responsibility to exercise jurisdiction and control over its fishing vessels on the high seas. This includes ensuring that they comply with safety, certification, and licensing requirements, as well as the adoption of laws and regulations regarding the operation, management, and conduct of fishing vessels and their crew members. Furthermore, the flag State must investigate and penalize individuals and legal entities that engage in illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing or breach other international and national rules. The statement you provided highlights the concern that the current procedure does not fulfill the requirements set out in UNCLOS Article 94, as it may not allow the flag State to effectively control and supervise its fishing vessels on the high seas. This is particularly important because IUU fishing poses a significant threat to the sustainability of marine resources, local economies, and global food security. To address these concerns, it is vital for flag States to step up their efforts to ensure compliance with national and international laws related to fisheries management and marine conservation. This could involve: 1. Strengthening national regulations and laws to improve monitoring, control, and surveillance of fishing activities. 2. Ensuring that all fishing vessels flying the flag State's flag have the necessary licenses and meet safety and certification requirements. 3. Implementing effective tracking and monitoring systems, such as vessel monitoring systems (VMS) and Automatic Identification System (AIS), to ensure transparency and traceability throughout the entire supply chain. 4. Pursuing international cooperation and information exchange with other relevant States and regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) to detect and combat IUU fishing. 5. Increasing penalties and sanctions for non-compliance with fisheries laws and regulations to deter IUU fishing activities. By adopting these measures and balancing the interests of various stakeholders, flag States will be better equipped to fulfill their obligations under Article 94 of UNCLOS and contribute to the collective goal of protecting and managing the world's oceans and marine resources sustainably."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

According to a police statement, Sychantha tried to flee on foot, but was quickly apprehended. When asked for identification, Sychantha produced an American identification card. The officers suspected the card was fake and took him into custody for further questioning. Police fingerprinted Sychantha and noticed he had a missing fingertip on his right hand. When they ran the prints through their database, they learned the Laos-born man they had in their custody was the suspected ring leader in a large-scale drug and weapons smuggling operation. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement wanted Sychantha as the suspected leader of an organization that supplied ecstasy pills and marijuana to distributors in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Georgia and New York. He was also wanted by the Ontario Provincial Police for several drug trafficking offences. The U.S. Department of Homeland Security considered him one of their most wanted, and offered a US25,000 reward for his capture. The wanted poster for Sychantha on the ICE website warned that Sychantha had a history of violence, had allegedly made threats against several law enforcement officials, and should be considered armed and dangerous. It said that Sychantha was first indicted in Michigan in 2005 for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. He evaded capture, they wrote, and continued to supervise a drug-smuggling organization based in Windsor.

Katay-Khaophone Sychantha, 35, reportedly a dual citizen of Canada and Laos, was arrested on Wednesday by two Montreal police officers based out of neighbourhood Station 7 who were patrolling a bike path in the St-Laurent borough near the Bois Franc train station. According to a statement issued by the Montreal police on Monday, Sychantha was with another man when they were approached by the officers who suspected they possessed drugs. Sychantha tried to flee but was arrested after a short pursuit. He produced a fake American identification card, but the officers suspected he was trying to hide something and arrested him. He was eventually brought to the Montreal police West Operations Centre in the St-Laurent borough, where he was fingerprinted and his true identity was revealed. According to the release, Sychantha is wanted by the Ontario Provincial Police on warrants involving a series of drug trafficking-related offences. He was also on the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Ten Most Wanted list. The wanted poster on the ICE website alleges Sychantha, 35, was first indicted in Michigan in 2005 for conspiracy to distribute a controlled substance. “Following this indictment, Sychantha evaded capture and continued to supervise a drug-smuggling organization based in the Windsor, Canada area. In 2013, Sychantha’s continued illicit activity led to a second indictment in the Eastern District of Michigan for Conspiracy to Distribute a Controlled Substance. He has a history of violence and has allegedly made threats against HSI Special Agents and other law enforcement officials,” the wanted poster notes. It describes Sychantha as someone who should be considered as “armed and dangerous.” He last known location is listed as being Lakeshore, Ont., a town just 40 kilometres from the U.S. border crossing into Detroit. A statement issued by ICE following the arrest describes Sychantha as “the suspected ring leader of a drug-smuggling organization which supplied millions of ecstasy pills and hundreds of pounds of marijuana to several distributors located in Michigan, Ohio, Illinois, Massachusetts, Georgia, and New York.” Sychantha appeared at the Montreal courthouse on Thursday where he was charged with drug possession, trying to mislead a police officer and with carrying fake identification. He is expected to be turned over to the Ontario Provincial Police and might eventually be extradited to the U.S. The charges Sychantha faces in the U.S. involve a indictment that was filed more than a decade ago in a U.S. District Court in Michigan. It remained sealed for years while authorities sought him and then was made public in 2013. It was later amended to add charges alleging Sychantha (who is referred to as Khaophone Sychantha) and three other people were part of a conspiracy to distribute several different types of drugs, including ecstasy and methamphetamine and more than 100 kilograms of marijuana, in the U.S. pcherry@postmedia.com ||||| ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

Jon Kitna and the Lions' top-tier passing offense exploited the Bears' injury-depleted secondary. He threw two touchdowns in the fourth quarter, to keep the Bears four points behind the Lions. Griese threw an interception to Keith Smith, who returned it for a touchdown. However, Devin Hester responded by returning the ensuing kickoff for a touchdown. The Lions established their running game later, and allowed Kevin Jones to score a rushing touchdown, sending the Lions up by ten again. Griese led the Bears downfield on the subsequent drive. After several unusual penalties and mishaps, the Griese threw a touchdown to Desmond Clark. Now trailing by three points, Gould attempted by an onside kick, but it was recovered and returned by Casey FitzSimmons, sealing the Bears' loss. The 34 points allowed in the fourth quarter by the Bears are the most in NFL history. Griese completed thirty-four of fifty-two passes for 286 yards, two touchdowns, and three interceptions in his first start as a Bear. The team's running game mustered a combined total of sixty-nine yards, ousted by the Lions' ninety-five yards. Both defenses unleashed equal punishment on their opposing quarterbacks, combining for a total of twelve quarterback sacks. The Lions' victory snapped their four-game losing streak against the Bears.

Second: \\"transient v. stationary\\" events, which are based on the understanding of whether an event will change over time or not (e.g., \\"being born in the U.S.\\" is a stationary event since it will last forever; \\"being hungry\\" is a transient event since it lasts for a short period of time). Third: \\"event ordering\\" is the understanding of how events are usually ordered (e.g., \\"earning money\\" usually comes before \\"spending money\\"). Fourth: \\"absolute timepoint\\" of events which is the understanding of when events usually happen (e.g., \\"going to school\\" usually happens during the day, not at 2 A.M).

A: A:","completion":"Desert plants have evolved processes to conserve water and deal with harsh conditions. A more efficient use of CO2 allows plants to adapt to living with limited water resources and extreme temperatures. Step 1: Understanding the question The user is asking how a more efficient use of CO2 helps plants adapt to living in desert conditions. Step 2: Considering the adaptations of desert plants Desert plants have developed various adaptations to survive in their harsh environment. Some of these adaptations include: - Efficient use of CO2: By using CO2 more efficiently, plants can conserve water and reduce the amount of water lost through transpiration. - Deep or widespread root systems: This allows desert plants to absorb water from a larger area, accessing water that may be deeper beneath the surface. - Reduced or modified leaves: Some desert plants have small or no leaves, which reduces the surface area for water loss through transpiration. In some cases, leaves may be replaced by spines as in the case of cacti, which also serves a protective function against herbivores. - Specialized photosynthesis processes: Some desert plants use a specialized form of photosynthesis called Crassulacean Acid Metabolism (CAM) to minimize water loss. CAM plants can open their stomata at night to absorb CO2, converting it into a stored form, and using it during the daytime for photosynthesis, thus reducing water loss through transpiration during the heat of the day. Step 3: Answering the user's question A more efficient use of CO2 allows desert plants to adapt to living with limited water resources and extreme temperatures.

By Lizzie Edmonds PUBLISHED: 12:41 EST, 27 September 2013 | UPDATED: 16:49 EST, 27 September 2013 They say we are all creatures of habit and this pensioner has certainly proved that saying to be correct. Loyal customer Peter Butler has bought 32 cars from the same garage over the past four decades. The 92-year-old man has buying his cars from the Howards Motor Group garage in Weston super Mare, Somerset, since 1974 - a total of 41 years. Peter Butler's wife Marcia poses by one of the couple's first Nissans - a Datson from late 1976 Another motor bought from Howards Moror Group circa 1977 In 1986, OPTIONS: - Datson phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Datsun Cherry phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Howards Moror Group phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Howards Motor Group phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Lizzie Edmonds phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Marcia phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Nissan phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Nissans phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Peter Butler phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - RAF phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Somerset phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. - Weston super Mare phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets.","completion":"Nissan phased out the Datsun name but relaunched in 2013 as the brand for low-cost vehicles manufactured for emerging markets. This is the correct answer because Nissan is the car company that originally had the Datsun name. All the other options are either people, places, or other unrelated things, and they don't make cars. So they couldn't have phased out the Datsun name or relaunched it. Just like how apples are fruits and can't make cars, those other options also can't make cars or change car names. Nissan is the company that makes the cars, so Nissan is the right answer."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Should I validate this answer? Select from the following. (1). No (2). Yes Answer:","completion":"1). No The suggested answer does not directly address the question about who destroyed street cars. The factors mentioned are related to the decline of streetcars, but the key element missing is the role of the General Motors streetcar conspiracy. In the 1920s and 1930s, General Motors, along with other companies such as Firestone Tire, Standard Oil of California, and Phillips Petroleum, conspired to dismantle streetcar systems across the United States and replace them with bus systems that used their products. This led to the decline and eventual disappearance of many streetcar systems. However, it should be noted that the factors listed in the suggested answer also played a role in the decline of streetcars, but the General Motors conspiracy played a significant role."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Aubrey came to Lee, distraught: Aubrey is visibly affected by Lee's situation and approaches them with empathy. 3. Aubrey hugged Lee for support: Aubrey's comforting action may bring some consolation to Lee. Given these factors, it is most likely that Lee would feel (b). gratified, because Aubrey showed genuine concern and offered support at a tough moment. This makes option (a) resentful unlikely, and although option (c) caring as a result is possible, we can't specifically deduce that Lee would feel caring just from the context described.

Sentence 2: There are several ways that the cost of universal service can be measured. If the first sentence is true, then is the second sentence true? Available choices: * yes * it is not possible to tell * no","completion":"To determine the relationship between the two sentences, let's examine their content step by step. Step 1: Identify the main topic of each sentence. Both sentences discuss the cost of universal service. Step 2: Analyze the information provided in Sentence 1. Sentence 1 states that there are two measures of the cost of universal service: the entry pricing measure and the net avoided cost measure. These measures are discussed in the context of delivery profits. Step 3: Analyze the information provided in Sentence 2. Sentence 2 states that there are several ways that the cost of universal service can be measured. Step 4: Evaluate the relationship between the information in the two sentences. Since Sentence 1 mentions two specific measures for the cost of universal service, it implies that there are at least two ways to measure the cost. Sentence 2 states that there are several ways to measure the cost, which is consistent with the information in Sentence 1. Conclusion: If Sentence 1 is true, then Sentence 2 is also true.

If the weather means you what, so do your animals? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - travel - get cold - feel pain - move - electrical circuit Answer:","completion":"There seems to be some confusion in the phrasing of the question which makes it difficult to decipher its intended meaning. However, I will do my best to address the potential interpretations and provide a suitable answer. If we assume that the question is discussing the relationship between weather and how it affects both humans and animals, we can analyze each of the provided options in that context: 1. Travel: Weather plays a significant role in determining whether humans and animals travel or not. For instance, extreme weather conditions such as storms, heavy rain, or snow can make it challenging for both humans and animals to travel or migrate in search of food, or to find a suitable living environment. In this context, if the weather influences your decision to travel or not, it may have a similar effect on the movements and migration patterns of animals. 2. Get cold: As temperature fluctuates with weather conditions, humans and animals alike can experience feelings of cold or warmth. Most living organisms are capable of adapting to their environment, and animals have various ways of regulating their body temperature to cope with external weather conditions. For example, some animals grow thicker fur in winter to stay warm, while others can change their behavior to avoid cold temperatures. Humans also adapt to the changing weather conditions by wearing appropriate clothing and taking other necessary measures. Therefore, if the weather makes you feel cold, it's likely that the animals around you will also experience cold temperatures and react to it accordingly. 3. Feel pain: Weather conditions, especially extreme ones, can sometimes cause pain or discomfort for both humans and animals. A common example is arthritis joint pain, which can be aggravated by cold, damp weather. Similarly, animals can also experience pain and discomfort due to weather conditions. For example, livestock can suffer during extreme heatwaves or prolonged exposure to cold weather. That being said, if the weather causes you to feel pain, it's possible that animals, too, may experience pain or discomfort as a result. 4. Move: While the initial question's phrasing is unclear, if the idea is that changing weather conditions influence the movement of humans and their animals, then the \\"option\\" relating to movement could be most suitable. For instance, if you decide to move indoors or to warmer places as a result of cold weather, the animals you care for, such as pets, would need to adapt to those changes as well. However, wild animals will naturally move in response to weather conditions to find shelter, food, or a suitable living environment. 5. Electrical circuit: This option doesn't seem to directly relate to the concept of how weather might affect humans and animals. Electrical circuits pertain to the flow of electric current in a closed path, which has little to do with the weather-how it directly impacts humans and animals. In conclusion, while the phrasing of the question is somewhat confusing, it appears that the topic focuses on how weather conditions can influence both humans and animals, particularly in terms of travel, getting cold, feeling pain, and movement. Choosing a most suitable answer likely depends on the specific aspect of human-animal interaction you are looking to address within the context of weather."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The dye is a common antiseptic in Russia and has been used in protests there and in Ukraine. \\"It looks funny but it hurts like hell,\\" Mr Navalny tweeted. It is not clear who carried out the attack, which happened near the offices of the Anti-Corruption Fund (FBK) that he founded. According to one report (in Russian) he was diagnosed with a chemical burn to the eye. Mr Navalny is one of the foremost Russian critics of President Vladimir Putin and has announced his intention to run for president himself. But his intentions may be thwarted - he has been convicted of embezzlement, which would bar him from running for office, although he denies it. A new weapon of choice - Vitaliy Shevchenko, BBC Monitoring A mild antiseptic known as \\"brilliant green\\" has recently become a weapon of choice against government critics in Russia. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Footage from March appears to show Mr Navalny being attacked with a green liquid Mr Navalny has been doused with it twice this year. One of Russia's most popular bloggers, Ilya Varlamov, had it thrown at him twice on the same day on 26 April. And pro-Western politician Mikhail Kasyanov had it splashed in his face at a rally commemorating murdered opposition activist Boris Nemtsov. So why brilliant green? It stains the skin and is hard to wash off, which can be a problem if you want to take the media spotlight. Also, it doesn't do any lasting damage, which means attackers will not be facing charges of grave bodily harm. But the attackers don't always have the last laugh. When Mr Navalny was last doused he turned his green face into an internet meme and was imitated by his supporters. Mr Navalny was among 500 people arrested after organising an anti-corruption rally last month. Rallies across the country were the biggest opposition demonstrations in Russia in several years. He has said repeatedly that he wants to challenge Vladimir Putin's control of the Kremlin and expose what he claims is the \\"myth\\" that Mr Putin commands more than 80% popular support. Meanwhile a separate opposition group, Open Russia, says its office has been raided by police, a day after the group was blacklisted by the authorities. Activists said more than 20 riot police raided the office and removed computer equipment and 100,000 flyers for an unsanctioned rally planned for this weekend. Open Russia was founded by former oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who lives in exile after spending 10 years in a Siberian prison on fraud charges, which he says were politically motivated. ||||| MOSCOW — Aleksei A. Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, said on Tuesday that a doctor told him he had lost 80 percent of the sight in one eye after suffering a chemical burn when an assailant threw a green liquid in his face last week. The eye’s vision may improve, but the outlook is unclear, Mr. Navalny wrote on his website, citing his doctor. Initially, the attack had appeared less serious; dousing opposition figures with green dye is a common occurrence and often attributed to pro-Kremlin activists. Typically, a type of topical medical disinfectant has been used. It is difficult to wash out but harmless. Mr. Navalny, who has declared his intention to run in Russia’s presidential election next year, had already been splashed in the face with green dye once this spring, without any adverse affects. ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

REUTERS/Tatyana Makeyeva/File Photo By Andrew Osborn MOSCOW (Reuters) - Kremlin critic Alexei Navalny is ineligible to run for the Russian presidency next year unless he can overturn a conviction for embezzlement, a senior election official was quoted as saying by Russia's RIA news agency on Wednesday. Navalny, who says he sees no legal impediment to his presidential run, organized the biggest anti-government protests in years in March, and has become the most prominent opposition challenger to President Vladimir Putin, who is expected to run for what would be a fourth presidential term in March 2018. Navalny's political plans were complicated in February when a court found him guilty of embezzlement at a retrial of a case which he said was politically-motivated and designed to sabotage his political career. On Wednesday, a court rejected his appeal and upheld the original conviction which came with a five-year suspended prison sentence. Navalny's legal team said it would now appeal to the European Court of Human Rights. Allies say that Navalny, a 40-year-old lawyer turned opposition leader, is entitled to run for the presidency next year under the Russian constitution despite the embezzlement conviction. The law is not explicit on whether he can run, leaving room for interpretation. Nikolai Bulayev, deputy chairman of Russia's Central Election Commission, told the RIA news agency on Wednesday that Navalny was currently ineligible to run and could only do so if he quashed his conviction via the courts. \\"He (Navalny) is already trying to conduct a presidential campaign and, it seems to me, is manipulating people's understanding about how the law, allegedly, does not apply,\\" said Bulayev. \\"It's a delusion. If he's doing this deliberately he's deluding other people. For now, as far as I understand, he does not have the right to stand for election and in order to get it he needs to act via the courts. There is no other way.\\" Navalny says he has lost most of his sight in his right eye after an assailant threw green liquid in his face If he is allowed to run and is up against Putin, who has not yet confirmed he will stand, opinion polls suggest Navalny will lose by a big margin. Some analysts believe the Kremlin may ultimately allow Navalny to run in order to boost turnout and create the impression of some genuine political competition. However, having Navalny on the ballot paper could be an irritant for the Kremlin by providing a focus for anti-Kremlin protests, especially in the big urban centers where Navalny draws most of his support. Leonid Volkov, a Navalny ally, said on social media on Wednesday that he and fellow activists would fight for their leader's right to run. \\"Nobody promised it would be easy,\\" said Volkov. \\"Navalny has the right to run, but ensuring he is able to exercise it won't be easy.\\" (Editing by Christian Lowe) ||||| What Is \\"Zelyonka,\\" the Russian Green Dye Weapon of Choice? The dye has had a longer history as an antiseptic. On Thursday Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny had brilliant green dye thrown into his face, staining his skin and dousing his right eye. It was the second time in the past two months that the Vladimir Putin critic and leader of the Anti-Corruption Foundation has been sprayed with this dye, known in Russia as zelyonka, an experience that he tweeted “looks funny but … hurts like hell.” The liquid has become a recurring tool used by pro-government activists against critics of the Kremlin, in part because it’s considered to be nontoxic unless ingested. According to Radio Free Europe, the non-toxicity creates a safety net for the attackers in case they are caught. But in the case of Navalny, the dye may have been mixed with something else. The Moscow Times reported Monday that Navalny has been diagnosed with a “chemical burn in his right eye,” something that zelyonka presumably could not do on its own. Having zelyonka splashed on you, added chemicals or not, is no picnic because of the stain that it leaves. Zelyonka is a diluted form of “brilliant green”, a triarylmethane dye. These are dyes that are intensely colored, produced industrially, but stem from organic compounds that contain the colorless solid triphenyl methane. Russian opposition leader Alexei @Navalny has been hospitalized. An attacker sprayed antiseptic in his eye today. https://t.co/fqTW0pYjh6 pic.twitter.com/Pvtsd9oNOI — The Moscow Times (@MoscowTimes) April 27, 2017 Zelyonka became popularized as an inexpensive antiseptic in the 1900s. Doctors at the time applied it to wounds and commended the dye for its “extraordinary results” in increasing the comfort of patients, despite “of occasional stained hands and clothes.” Today it is still commonly found in Russian homes and used as a go-to antiseptic for scrapes and cuts. As an antimicrobial agent, it’s demonstrated to be effective in preventing the development of infections — maybe it’s not quite “the best herpes killer” like it’s sold on Ebay, but it’ll make sure a scab doesn’t turn into a bigger issue. It’s been demonstrated to be an effective way of turning anti-Putin critics green as well. Just in the past week Radio Free Europe journalist Galina Sidorova and political campaigner Natalia Fedorova have also been attacked with this dye.

Suspecting the satellite may have brought back an extraterrestrial pathogen, Scoop Mission Control activates an elite scientific team it had previously recruited for just this type of emergency. Nobel laureate Dr. Jeremy Stone (Arthur Hill), the team leader, and Dr. Mark Hall (James Olson), the team surgeon, are dropped in Piedmont by helicopter, where they search the town for Scoop 7 in hazmat suits. They find the town's doctor, who died after opening the satellite out of curiosity. Hall cuts open the doctor's corpse and finds that all of his blood has clotted and turned to powder.

The given sentence translates to \\"You probably won't have much hair on your body, will you?\\" in English. The Czech language is closely related to other Slavic languages, particularly Slovak, with which it shares high mutual intelligibility. It uses the Latin alphabet with several additional diacritics, notably the háček (ˇ) and kroužek (˚), for certain consonants and vowels and to indicate specific sounds and pronunciation. Czech has a rich history and is a descendant of Old Czech, dating back to the 9th century when the Great Moravian Empire was established. The Czech language has many dialects, with Bohemian, Moravian, and Silesian being the most widespread. It gained importance during the rise of the Kingdom of Bohemia and the formation of the Czech National Revival in the 19th century, which resulted in the modern standard Czech language. Czech grammar is quite complex, with four genders for nouns (masculine animate, masculine inanimate, feminine, and neuter), seven cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, vocative, locative, and instrumental), and several verb forms (e.g., aspect, tense, mood, and voice) as well as complex declensions for nouns, pronouns, and adjectives.

He has a younger sister, Hillary, and a younger brother, Andrew. Wentz has written a book entitled The Boy With the Thorn in His Side, a story based on nightmares he had as a child. The title is a reference to a track on The Smiths' album The Queen Is Dead. Wentz explained that writing books serves as another mode of self-expression other than songwriting: \\"My inspiration and my ideas don't begin and end at the beginning and the ending of a song. It is too limiting.\\" It was reported that he was to publish another book, entitled Rainy Day Kids, but years went by without any word on the book's progress, and Wentz even expressed on his Twitter account that he didn't think it would ever come to fruition. However, in February 2012, he posted a photo on his personal blog of what appeared to be a rough draft of the book's manuscript, explaining that he was currently in the process of editing Rainy Day Kids and that it would be 40-50 pages longer than he originally expected. On December 13, 2012, Wentz revealed the cover for the book, now titled Gray, on his personal blog. The book, which was written with MTV News writer and former FNMTV co-host James Montgomery, was released on February 26, 2013.

He says that \\"hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes\\" and \\"deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, is an isotope of hydrogen, or a hydrogen atom with a neutron added\\". So, what's the best answer to the question? The answer is:","completion":"The bonds of deuterium cause water to expand when it freezes. Let me provide a detailed explanation for this answer. The original question asks about the bonds of a specific substance, deuterium, which expands when it freezes. Our teacher provided two hints: first, hydrogen bonds cause water to expand when it freezes, and second, deuterium, or heavy hydrogen, is an isotope of hydrogen with an added neutron. Deuterium is indeed an isotope of hydrogen, with the key difference being the presence of a neutron in its nucleus. One proton and one neutron make up the nucleus of a deuterium atom, while a regular hydrogen atom has only one proton and no neutrons. Despite this difference, both deuterium and regular hydrogen can form hydrogen bonds with oxygen atoms to create water molecules (H2O). In the case of deuterium, the resulting molecule is called \\"heavy water\\" (D2O). When water freezes, its hydrogen (H) bonds cause the molecules to form a hexagonal lattice, creating a less dense crystal structure compared to liquid water. This hexagonal lattice results in the expansion of water when it turns into ice. In the case of heavy water, the hydrogen bonds are formed between deuterium (D) and oxygen (O) atoms. Since deuterium is an isotope of hydrogen, heavy water will similarly form a hexagonal lattice when it freezes, also resulting in expansion. Although there may be some differences in the lattice structure due to the presence of the extra neutron in deuterium, the basic principle of hydrogen bonding and the resulting expansion when freezing remains the same. In conclusion, the bonds of deuterium cause water to expand when it freezes due to the similar hydrogen bonding present in both regular water and heavy water molecules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: Text: first some backstory about me and the job to fully understand the fuck up. i've always been interested in medical related stuff as well as the military. so throughout my life i'd taken classes and done a good amount of high stress training, in addition to just my cpr/aed, and lifeguard certifications. the company was pretty bureaucratic and stupid from the supervisors up, but when the higher ups weren't around (which is about 90% of the time) it was a ton of fun. this fuck up happened over the summer while i had my job as a lifeguard. it was my second year doing this job and i was loving it. this year was going to be better though, all my friends from school were working for the same company. in fact my two best friends were assigned to the same pool as me. most guards would just hotbox their car before coming into work and come in stoned as fuck, but i've never really enjoyed it. another reason is because i realized that at any time i might have to save a kid and i wouldn't be able to live with myself if somehow one died while i was on stand. by most peoples' standards i was a good lifeguard. for my time on stand i remained vigilant as well as friendly, and i wasn't one to stop a kid or a family from having fun just because the rules didn't permit it; unless the management was around. one slow saturday, my best friend and i were working together. he opened the pool and i came in a few hours later to help for lunch. it got decently busy and we needed to work through a break or two. to help the time pass i would talk to my friend for a few minutes, take a lap around the pool, and be friendly with the patrons, all while keeping a keen eye on my section of the pool. when i got back to the stand i would repeat the process. on one of my trips around i noticed a guy in the corner staring at me hard as fuck, but at the time i wasn't really sure if he was looking at me since he was wearing sunglasses. whatever. i figured watching the pool was easy enough, though i had no idea what a hard time my boy, the other guard, was having, or how complacent i was. unknown to me he was higher than a fucking kite. he's usually pretty quiet and laughs a lot so nothing about him was too unusual, though he was wierding me out by laughing so much this day. nothing to make me think he couldn't properly do his job. i notice a father and his two sons rough-housing a little bit on the shallow end, but i leave the whistle down. i used to have a lot of fun as a kid playing like that with my dad. i'm hanging out next to the stand, leaning on it with one arm and talking to my friend while watching the deep end of the pool, talking nonchalantly. next thing i know he's making loud, inaudible noises, i can see his eyes wider than shit behind his sunglasses and he's trying to point at something, but as he tried to point his hand caught the whistle hanging from his neck. whilst he did this, he also tried to stand up and get off the stand. miraculously, the force of his hand indirectly pulling his neck and simultaneously trying to stand up pulled him straight into the pool. he literally made a grunt and then randomly flew into the pool from what i could comprehend at that point. fortunately, i looked where he was trying to point and there was a kid having a seizure in the pool, same kid who was messing around with his brother and his dad. before i knew it i was at the kid holding him up and letting him seize. i bit down on my whistle and signaled for everyone to clear the pool. parents are grabbing their kids, kids aren't complying, its pure fucking chaos and my best friend, the primary guard, is just barely untangling his hand from the simple whistle necklace as if he forgot what he fell into the pool for in the first place. as soon as the situation calms itself and the kid comes to, chaos restarts. that motherfucker who was eyeing me is right up in my fucking face while i'm trying to provide lifesaving aid to this poor fucking child. he's screaming at me, \\"you no good piece of shit! how many kids under the age of 12 are were in this pool!? you just stood there talking to your friend you shitbag! i've been watching you talk to your friend while you let this family rough house the whole fucking time! when i was a lifeguard...\\" yada, yada, fuck me. i yell over to my friend to call 911, forgetting what state he's in. at this point the kid and his family are fine, a fire fighter who was off duty was at the pool and he pulled the angry asshole patron aside. the kid is conscious and complaining of a headache and the parents have been calmed. the only thing i need is ems. friend comes out holding the phone repeatedly saying, \\"they won't answer!\\" what the fuck does he mean they won't answer? he's using his cell phone and pressing 911 on the lock screen, fuck. i grab the phone and dial 911 and tell them what happened. immediately after ems arrives and the family goes to the hospital i notify the supervisor and my manager. supervisor shows up and has me doing all this paperwork, of course the asshole goes up to the supervisor and complains so fucking much about me. supervisor was a total bitch and fired me on the spot for being incompetent. the fire fighter came to my side when he saw me get fired and tried to convince the supervisor that i was watching the pool and made the right call, but she wasn't having it. i had upset a patron to the point of hysterics and that was all she would hear. my friend? finished the shift and got a pat on the back from the company. in the end i learned that the kid had a seizure due to minor head trauma and lack of oxygen. he spent some time underwater and then decided to launch himself off the side of the pool, while still underwater, and headbutt his dad as hard as possible. the result was a random seizure. freak incident but the kid is okay, my manager said if i needed a job recommendation she would give me a really good one. that high fuck is still my best friend and i laugh about this story now with him. asshole motherfucker + retarded child = chaos, unemployment, and a slightly more retarded child A:","completion":"While working as a lifeguard, the narrator's high co-worker accidentally fell into the pool trying to signal a kid having a seizure, leading to chaos, the narrator being fired, and a funny story to share."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Mission workers, also known as missionaries, are individuals who are dedicated to spreading their religious beliefs and converting others, most often in areas where there is limited knowledge or presence of their faith. They are constantly telling many people about religion, its principles, teachings, and scriptures. Missionaries come from various religious backgrounds, such as Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, and others. They aim to promote the spiritual, moral, and social welfare of people and communities by sharing religious tenets, fostering spiritual growth, and often providing humanitarian services. The primary objective of mission workers is to share their religious beliefs to encourage a deep understanding of their faith and help others find spiritual fulfillment. They may conduct religious services, teach classes, and mentor individuals. They also engage in community projects such as building schools, medical clinics, and other social welfare programs to help the communities they serve. Apart from spreading their religious beliefs, mission workers also play crucial roles in intercultural understanding, mutual respect, and tolerance by bridging the gaps between different cultures, languages, and traditions. In conclusion, mission workers are constantly telling many people about religion. They dedicate their lives to spreading their faith, helping people find spiritual fulfillment, and providing humanitarian services for the betterment of communities.

No The sentence \\"Clean plain water can also be one of several fluids given.\\" does not provide a valid answer to the question \\"What are some good standard home solutions?\\" because it is not explicitly referring to home solutions. While the statement mentions that plain water can be one of several fluids given, it does not provide enough context or information to determine which home solutions it refers to. A valid answer to the question should list specific home solutions, such as cleaning products, cooking ingredients like vinegar or baking soda, or other commonly used household items that serve a purpose in regular household tasks. Home solutions typically refer to remedies or problem-solving strategies that utilize everyday items, and therefore, the answer should address this directly. Here is an example of a more detailed answer with a more explicit focus on home solutions: Some good standard home solutions include: 1. Baking soda: This versatile substance can be used for cleaning, deodorizing, and even unclogging drains. Mix it with water to create a paste for cleaning surfaces, or add it to a load of laundry as a booster. 2. Vinegar: White vinegar is excellent for cleaning glass, removing hard water stains, and even acting as a natural fabric softener. Dilute it with water for a gentle cleaning solution. 3. Lemon juice: The natural acidity of lemon juice can help break down grime and kill bacteria. Mix it with water to create an all-purpose cleaning spray or use it undiluted to remove stubborn stains. 4. Salt: As a natural abrasive, salt can be used to scrub away stains and grime. Combine it with oil or water to create a cleaning paste for various surfaces. 5. Hydrogen peroxide: This common medical supply can be used to sanitize and clean surfaces. Use it as a disinfectant in your home by diluting it with water and spraying it onto surfaces, or mix it with other cleaning agents for a more powerful solution. These home solutions not only provide effective cleaning options but often offer a more environmentally friendly alternative to commercial cleaning products.

Please briefly summarize this news article: In a Florentine Palazzo, History with a Dash of Playfulness Rooms from 140 euros (about 156); from 250 euros in high season. Themes weave prominently throughout the aptly named Garibaldi Blu Hotel. Opened in December 2014 in a historic Florentine palazzo, the 21-room boutique hotel takes its name from the property’s history: A plaque outside states that the building was the site of a memorable 1867 address by Giuseppe Garibaldi, the Italian general and politician who was a major figure in the unification of what was then the Kingdom of Italy. So while many of the palazzo’s original details have been preserved — 19th-century frescoes above the reception desk and in some of the rooms, tall vaulted ceilings in the lounge — the hotel is also liberally decorated with pictures of the bearded patriot’s likeness. As the name suggests, there’s also a conspicuous color theme, evident everywhere from the lobby’s collection of inky-blue vases to the blue-gray walls. Added to the mix is a liberal dash of playfulness in the form of quirky lifelike statues — Batman, a pirate — that are stationed around the hotel. The hotel is on the recently refurbished Piazza Santa Maria Novella, in the city’s historic center. It is approximately midway between the main train station and the Duomo, each about five minutes away by foot. After a dour check-in experience with nary a welcome, my husband and I were brusquely shown to our second-floor room at the end of a mazelike hallway, where I was startled to turn a corner and find myself eye-to-eye with a life-size figure of Spock from “Star Trek.” A key card malfunction later, we finally entered the spacious room, which felt even larger thanks to the bedroom’s extremely high ceiling. The walls were painted a calming blue-gray hue, and the floors were teak parquet. Simple furnishings included a walnut desk, a couple of low stools and a firm double bed with a gray headboard and two bedside tables. The best feature, however, was revealed when a heavy floral drape was pulled aside to reveal the window and a lovely view of the entire piazza including the Basilica di Santa Maria Novella’s exquisite inlaid-marble facade. Small but sufficient for one person at a time, the space had been updated with black-and-white terrazzo flooring, modern fixtures and bright lighting. The shower stall, a cramped box tiled with gray-veined Calacatta marble, had a glass door and rainfall shower head. In addition to bath amenities, there was also a powerful, high-quality blow dryer. There was a meager minibar with cold drinks in the room, but Wi-Fi was fast and free. The lobby lounge, with palm tree sculptures and artworks beneath vaulted ceilings, had ample seating and an array of international publications. A daily breakfast buffet, served in a small atrium, is included in the room rate. The spread had both hot and cold dishes, including warm scrambled eggs, loaves of rustic Tuscan bread, Italian cheeses, prosciutto, and fresh fruit juices like green-apple and a citrusy multivitamin blend. Espresso-based drinks are made to order, but filter coffee was also available. For a fee (5 euros per person), breakfast could be delivered to the room. A mix of intriguing history and quirky design make for an eye-catching hotel, but friendlier service should be added to that equation.

Question: \\"What formed the Himalayan mountains?\\" Context: \\"In many ways, the Paleocene continued processes that had begun during the late Cretaceous Period. During the Paleocene, the continents continued to drift toward their present positions. Supercontinent Laurasia had not yet separated into three continents. Europe and Greenland were still connected. North America and Asia were still intermittently joined by a land bridge, while Greenland and North America were beginning to separate. The Laramide orogeny of the late Cretaceous continued to uplift the Rocky Mountains in the American west, which ended in the succeeding epoch. South and North America remained separated by equatorial seas (they joined during the Neogene); the components of the former southern supercontinent Gondwana continued to split apart, with Africa, South America, Antarctica and Australia pulling away from each other. Africa was heading north toward Europe, slowly closing the Tethys Ocean, and India began its migration to Asia that would lead to a tectonic collision and the formation of the Himalayas.\\" Answer: A:","completion":"The Himalayan mountains were formed as a result of the tectonic collision between India and Asia. During the Paleocene epoch, India began its migration towards Asia, and when the two landmasses collided, the immense pressure and force caused the land to uplift and fold, resulting in the formation of the Himalayas."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: Review: A film with very little positive to say for it.Firstly it has zero pace and is positively lacking in any drama.Besides being remarkably slow The Empty Acre seems dedicated to using the same stock footage again and again. I lost count of how many times I had seen \\"that\\" field at night or that bit of cracked earth.It also has the fundamental flaw of thinking that if the audience don't know about things they will be gripped rather than just confused. So with no signs that there are any issues we suddenly find the marriage is not what it seems to be despite being given the impression that it's fine. We find Jacob is possibly the worst farmer in the universe as he seems to spend no time on the farm and also seems to have bought land with a wholly useless acre. Beth has a key to a warehouse of books? There are innumerable other questions some of which are resolved later in the movie, much later, in fact too late.And on the point of the acre. Horror filmmakers note that large inanimate objects are inherently not scary  and also if they're meant to be an acre big then make them so.There is also a frightening lack of reasonability as Beth (the best performer in the piece, followed by Jefferson  the cop) suddenly appears to be accused of everything under the sun just because she is on \\"medication\\".With the full ten minutes plus of running round the fields looking for the missing child (did he crawl out of the window? He's six months old) the film descends into badly written scene after badly written scene.

Johnny now hosts an entity called 'The Rider', a fiery demon who punishes sinners, no matter how petty the crimes are. However, his father dies regardless, and having two minds fighting for control over his new powers, Johnny attempts to stay as far away from mankind as possible, hiding out in Eastern Europe (Romania).In the present, a drunken priest named Moreau (Idris Elba) attempts to warn the order of monks residing in a castle that the Devil has sent out forces to retrieve a certain boy and his mother hiding there, despite the head monk's (Anthony Head) reassurances of their safety. At that moment, mercenaries hired by Roarke breach the castle and kill all of the monks except for Moreau, while the mother, Nadya (Violante Placido) and her son Danny escape. Moreau chases after them, as well as the mercenaries.

Should I validate this answer? OPT: A. No; B. Yes; The answer is:","completion":"A. No. The suggested answer does not provide a clear definition or explanation of what a 2nd or 3rd cousin once removed is, and might be misleading due to the focus on \\"first cousin\\" in the response. A more accurate and detailed answer to the question would be: A 2nd cousin is someone who shares a common great-grandparent with you, but not a grandparent. In other words, their grandparents are siblings to one of your grandparents. A 3rd cousin is one more step removed; you share a common great-great-grandparent with them, but not a great-grandparent. The term \\"once removed\\" refers to the difference in generations between the two relatives. For example, your 2nd cousin's child would be your 2nd cousin once removed because you are one generation apart (the child is the next generation below you). Similarly, a 3rd cousin once removed implies that there is a one-generation difference between you and your 3rd cousin, whether that person is one generation above or below you in the family tree. If your 3rd cousin is one generation above you, that person would be your parent's 3rd cousin. If your 3rd cousin is one generation below you, that person would be the child of one of your 3rd cousins.

Massenet was a prolific composer; he put this down to his way of working, rising early and composing from four o'clock in the morning until midday, a practice he maintained all his life. In general he worked fluently, seldom revising, although Le roi de Lahore, his nearest approach to a traditional grand opera, took him several years to complete to his own satisfaction. It was finished in 1877 and was one of the first new works to be staged at the Palais Garnier, opened two years previously. The opera, with a story taken from the Mahabharata, was an immense success and was quickly taken up by the opera houses of eight Italian cities. It was also performed at the Hungarian State Opera House, the Bavarian State Opera, the Semperoper, Dresden, the Teatro Real in Madrid, and the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in London. After the first Covent Garden performance, The Times summed the piece up in a way that was frequently to be applied to the composer's operas: \\"M. Massenet's opera, although not a work of genius proper, is one of more than common merit, and contains all the elements of at least temporary success.\\"This period was an early high point in Massenet's career. He had been made a chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1876, and in 1878 he was appointed professor of counterpoint, fugue and composition at the Conservatoire under Thomas, who was now the director. In the same year he was elected to the Institut de France, a prestigious honour, rare for a man in his thirties. Camille Saint-Saëns, whom Massenet beat in the election for the vacancy, was resentful at being passed over for a younger composer. When the result of the election was announced, Massenet sent Saint-Saëns a courteous telegram: \\"My dear colleague: the Institut has just committed a great injustice\\". Saint-Saëns cabled back, \\"I quite agree.\\" He was elected three years later, but his relations with Massenet remained cool.Massenet was a popular and respected teacher at the Conservatoire.

A monk may be a person who decided to dedicate his life to serving all other living beings, or to be an ascetic who voluntarily chooses to leave mainstream society and live his life in prayer and contemplation. The concept is ancient and can be seen in many religions and in philosophy. - In the show, Azula is the crown princess of the Fire Nation and a Firebending prodigy. Upon Fire Lord Ozai's orders, she begins a quest with her childhood friends and Ty Lee to retrieve her exiled brother Prince Zuko and their uncle Iroh, while also attempting to capture the Avatar, a transcendent being capable of manipulating all four elements (Earth, Water, Fire and Air). Azula is known to be cold, cruel, manipulative, and, as her brother Zuko says, 'always lies'. Throughout the series, she is shown to be capable of a much higher level of bending and yields blue flames, instead of red and orange, as well as having the rare firebending ability to generate pure whitish-blue lightning. - Aang is the last surviving Airbender, a monk of the Air Nomads' Southern Air Temple.

Burt Freeman Bacharach ( BAK-@-rak; born May 12, 1928) is an American composer, songwriter, record producer, pianist, and singer who has composed hundreds of popular hit songs from the late 1950s through the 1980s, many in collaboration with popular lyricist Hal David. A six-time Grammy Award winner and three-time Academy Award winner, Bacharach's songs have been recorded by more than 1,000 different artists. As of 2014, he had written 73 US and 52 UK Top 40 hits. He is considered one of the most important composers of 20th-century popular music. In 1998, Bacharach co-wrote and recorded a Grammy-winning album with Elvis Costello, Painted from Memory, on which the compositions began to take on the sound of his earlier work. In 2003, he teamed with singer Ronald Isley to release the album Here I Am, which revisited a number of his 1960s compositions in Isley's signature R&B style. Bacharach's 2005 solo album At This Time was a departure from past works in that Bacharach penned his own lyrics, some of which dealt with political themes. Guest stars on the album included Elvis Costello, Rufus Wainwright, and hip-hop producer Dr. Dre. In 2008, Bacharach opened the BBC Electric Proms at The Roundhouse in London, performing with the BBC Concert Orchestra accompanied by guest vocalists Adele, Beth Rowley and Jamie Cullum. The concert was a retrospective look back at his six-decade career. In early 2009, Bacharach worked with Italian soul singer Karima Ammar and produced her debut single Come In Ogni Ora, which became a #4 hit. In June, 2015, Bacharach performed in the UK at the Glastonbury Festival, and a few weeks later appeared on stage at the Menier Chocolate Factory to launch 'What's It All About? Bacharach Reimagined', a 90-minute live arrangement of his hits. In 2016, Bacharach, at 88 years old, composed and arranged his first original score in 16 years for the film A Boy Called Po (along with composer Joseph Bauer). The score was released on September 1, 2017. The entire 30-minute score was recorded in just two days at Capitol Studios. The theme song Dancing With Your Shadow, was composed by Bacharach, with lyrics by Billy Mann, and performed by Sheryl Crow. After seeing the film, a true story about a child with Autism, Bacharach decided he wanted to write a score for it, as well as a theme song, in tribute to his daughter Nikki -- who had gone undiagnosed with Asperger syndrome, and who committed suicide at the age of 40. Bacharach asked Director John Asher to see the film and offered to score it. \\"It touched me very much,\\" the composer says. \\"I had gone through this with Nikki. Sometimes you do things that make you feel. It's not about money or rewards.\\" Answer this question using a quote from the following article: What are some song of the album?","completion":"Given that you asked me to answer your question using a quote from the provided article, I'm unable to respond as there's no specific listing of songs from an album in the information that you provided.

If I tell you that Eye color in humans is determined from information encoded in DNA, and ask you the question \\"eye color is determined by information found in\\", is the correct answer \\"sEC filings\\"? OPTIONS: 1). Yes. 2). No.","completion":"2). No. Eye color is not determined by information found in sEC filings. Eye color in humans is determined by the genetic information contained in an individual's DNA. DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is the molecule that carries the genetic instructions for the development, functioning, growth, and reproduction of all known living organisms, including humans. It is essentially the blueprint for life. Eye color is a polygenic trait, meaning that multiple genes are involved in determining an individual's eye color. Researchers have identified a few major genes responsible for eye color variation, including OCA2 and HERC2, both located on chromosome 15. These genes, along with others, influence the production of pigments called melanin in the iris of the eye. Melanin is responsible for the color of our skin, hair, and eyes. The amount and type of melanin produced in the eye's iris determine an individual's eye color. Those with more melanin tend to have brown eyes, while those with less melanin will have lighter-colored eyes, such as blue or green. Eye color can range from very dark brown to light blue or even gray, with many shades in between. sEC filings, on the other hand, refer to the documents that publicly traded companies are required to submit to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). These filings contain financial statements, disclosures about the company's business operations, risks, and financial condition. They provide investors with information to help them make informed investment decisions. sEC filings have no relation to an individual's eye color or genetic information. In conclusion, eye color is determined by the genetic information found in an individual's DNA, not in sEC filings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. I'm going to say first off that I have given this film a 3 out of 10 after some thought. I was going to give it a straight out 1 but it got a couple extra points for the body count. But that would be about it. Let me explain. I paid literally £1 for this DVD in a supermarket because I tend to have a lot of faith in bargain horror flicks, B-movies especially. But if this film was aiming for B status as I suspect it was for a number of reasons (which I'll touch on in a sec) then it failed magnificently. Not only did it shoot for B and miss, it landed somewhere around F. This film had so many opportunities to be good and it pretty much failed on all accounts. I say above that it's likely this film was aiming for B status and it seems to try and achieve this by trying to blend humour with horror, which can either be very good or very bad. For example, later Freddy films (Dream Warriors onwards) are all about Freddy's style and nose-thumbing, which works out great! But this film completely bombed in that respect because the times where they tried to inject humour were mostly just stupid. I will admit though that towards the beginning of the film the humour was good. In fact, for about half an hour I liked this film and was prepared to congratulate myself on another good find. BUT what really killed this film for me was the inappropriate kills. For instance, when 'Satan' smashes the cat against the board and writes 'boo' with it's blood using its body as a brush. Or when 'Satan' slams the door into the helpless disabled elderly woman. Now I'm not usually too against senseless kills in films-hey, thats the point, right? But in those two cases I just found it grossly offensive and unnecessary to anything in the film-plot especially. For me, the film went downwards from then on. One major bad point about this film is that I hated every character in it. The kid, Dougie was just ridiculously annoying!!! I'm at a loss to explain how he could possibly write off all those bodies and people being killed in front of his eyes as a trick! I mean, come on!!! I completely understand that to be in a horror film a character does have to be somewhat stupid, like running upstairs when you should blatantly be running out of the house screaming for help, but this kid took the biscuit! I wanted to kill him myself by the end of it! It was completely unbelievable and if I had to hear him say 'duh!' one more time I was going to bang my head against a wall-because thats what watching this film felt like. Why didn't i just turn the film off? Mainly because I honestly believe an ending can sometimes redeem a film. But I was wrong in this case. The ending did NOT redeem this film, it further irritated the hell out of me and was inadequate to the plot line. I get it already! The killer is always going to come back dressed as someone else, be welcomed into the house by the stupid kid and go on a killing spree again because no one suspects him in that costume! I GET IT! This film made me physically angry because it was so stupid! And if by some foul mistake you do end up watching this film, watch out for the intestines. Frankly, if that guy actually did have intestines that looked like that, I'd be surprised he wasn't already dead, let alone until someones rips them out and ties them to a chair. In fact, I'll even go so far as to say that the only character I liked at all in this film was actually the killer. Purely because when his 'comedy routine' worked, it did work. All in all, the plot line of this film dragged anything that might have been good down. Why was the killer killing? I don't know. I can live without knowing who he actually was, thats fairly typical, but without some kind of motive - hell i don't know, i'd settle for him having a bad Halloween as a kid! -it just seems more than senseless, just stupid.

Put on safety goggles and gloves. Using the glass cutter, score around the bottle at your desired candle height. Apply even pressure while rotating the bottle against the cutter. 3. Heat the scored area by rotating the bottle over a candle flame or use boiling water. Alternate between heating and cooling the scored area by using cold water or ice to facilitate the bottle breaking apart at the scored line. 4. Once the bottle has separated, smooth the edges with sandpaper to remove any sharpness. 5. Set up the double boiler by placing the heat-safe container inside the saucepan filled with water. Alternatively, use a double boiler pan if you have one. 6. Add the candle wax to the heat-safe container and heat the water in the saucepan gradually. Monitor the temperature of the wax with a thermometer to avoid overheating. 7. While the wax is melting, prepare the wick by attaching it to the wick holder or clothespin to keep it steady and centered in the bottle. 8. When the wax reaches the optimal melting temperature (usually around 180°F or 82°C), carefully pour the melted wax into the glass bottle. If desired, add dye or fragrance to the wax during the melting process, stirring well to combine. 9. Let the wax cool and solidify in the glass bottle. This may take several hours or overnight. 10. Once the wax has fully hardened, trim the wick to an appropriate length (about 1/4 inch or 6mm above the wax surface). You have now successfully made a candle using a glass bottle."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Greene County is a county located in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. As of the 2010 census, the population was 38,686. Its county seat is Waynesburg. Greene County was created on February 9, 1796, from part of Washington County and named for General Nathanael Greene. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"Greene County did not exist on February 10, 1796.\\"?","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph above, we cannot conclude that \\"Greene County did not exist on February 10, 1796.\\" In fact, the opposite is true. The paragraph states that Greene County was created on February 9, 1796, from part of Washington County and was named after General Nathanael Greene. Therefore, on February 10, 1796, Greene County would already have been one day old. Greene County, with its county seat in Waynesburg, would have already begun functioning as a separate administrative unit within Pennsylvania, as the creation date was explicitly mentioned to be February 9, 1796. After this date, the population, geographical boundaries, and local governance would have been established under the new county's jurisdiction. The 2010 census reveals that the population of Greene County went on to become 38,686 people. Another important factor that can be gleaned from this paragraph is the significance of the individual for whom the county was named. General Nathanael Greene was a major figure in the American Revolutionary War, serving as the Continental Army's Quartermaster General and second-in-command to General George Washington. Naming the newly created county after him reflects the importance given to the memory of the war and the eventual establishment of the United States as a separate nation. In conclusion, based on the provided paragraph, we can confidently state that Greene County did exist on February 10, 1796, as it was created just a day before on February 9, 1796. The county's establishment marked an expansion of American administrative divisions and its naming paid homage to a significant figure from the Revolutionary War."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability, I simply cried. Glenn Close's role as Ruth, showed her wanting to deal with the situation, but she was under the domination of her husband. \\"Let him think about what he did,\\" Robert Duvall's character, Joe, said staunchly. The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother, called \\"The Stone Boy,\\" meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did, he became emotionally paralyzed. Then towards the end when Jason Presson's character, Arnold, let it all out to a stranger, I was so broken hearted for him, that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life. I personalized and identified with his character. Frederick Forrest's and Gail Youngs' roles, did NOT add not much to the film. I thought of Frederick Forrest, who played Ruth's antagonistic, womanizing brother, Andy, as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation. His wife, Lou, played by Gail Youngs, acted like a crazy-lady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles. I could NOT really feel sorry for these two. Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together, she was unsuccessful. Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively. They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous. Wilfred Brimley's minor role as the grandfather was, touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention. I felt his role should have been elaborated. The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient. However, I really liked the ending so much, I actually smiled and cried tears of joy. I felt good. The Hillermans were a family again. I actually wanted to be a part of this family.

Indianapolis started the season going 3-and-out on their first offensive possession of the new year. The Texans got good field position with a big punt return from Jacoby Jones to set up a 30-yard field goal to give them a 3-0 lead. The offense continued to struggle throughout the first half, getting two first downs on the next drive, however, eventually having to punt. The Texans continued to show energy on both offense and defense by scoring two more time, a field goal and a touchdown, giving the Texans a 13-0 lead halfway through the second quarter. The Colts eventually got the offense going late in the second quarter by scoring on a touchdown reception by Reggie Wayne, which broke the lead down to one possession. Adam Vinatieri made a 20-yard field goal at the end of the first half and the Colts went into the half trailing 13-10. The momentum was seemingly shifting to Indianapolis, until Houston took almost eight minutes off the third quarter clock on a 15-play drive, 13 rushes, that resulted in one of Arian Foster's rushing touchdowns on the day to give Houston a 20-10 lead. Peyton Manning and the offense struggled throughout the third quarter with missed opportunities and continued to shoot themselves in the foot with penalties. With the start of the fourth quarter Houston scored another touchdown and broke the game open. The Colts would eventually score two touchdowns late in the game, only when there was no chance of a comeback.

The text you provided lists various types of calorimeters but does not discuss the internal pressure of any of them, particularly the bomb calorimeter. To answer your question, the internal pressure of a bomb calorimeter varies depending on the specific experiment being conducted. Bomb calorimeters are designed to withstand high pressures. During a combustion reaction inside a bomb calorimeter, the pressure may increase significantly - reaching up to 30-40 atmospheres or even higher. This increase in pressure is due to the production of gases during the combustion reaction, and it is a crucial reason why bomb calorimeters are built with strong, robust materials to prevent ruptures or leaks. The exact internal pressure depends on factors such as the composition and quantity of the sample being analyzed, as well as the calibration and design of the calorimeter itself."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The rear-most sledge, which had carried the most weight, was well-worn, and they decided to abandon it. The remaining supplies were re-distributed between the remaining two sledges. Most of the important supplies—the tent and most of the food—were stored on the new rear sledge; if they were to lose a sledge down a crevasse, they reasoned, it would be the front, less-vital sledge.

Cameron was born in 1954 in Kapuskasing, Ontario, Canada, the son of Shirley (nee Lowe), an artist and nurse, and Phillip Cameron, an electrical engineer. His paternal great-great-great-grandfather emigrated from Balquhidder, Scotland, in 1825. Cameron grew up in Chippawa, Ontario, and attended Stamford Collegiate School in Niagara Falls, Ontario. His family moved to Brea, California in 1971, when Cameron was 17 years old. In June 2005, Cameron was announced to be working on a project tentatively titled \\"Project 880\\" (now known to be Avatar) in parallel with another project, Alita: Battle Angel (an adaptation of the manga series Battle Angel Alita). Both movies were to be shot in 3D. By December, Cameron stated that he wanted to film Battle Angel first, followed by Avatar. However, in February 2006, he switched goals for the two film projects and decided to film Avatar first. He mentioned that if both films were successful, he would be interested in seeing a trilogy being made for both. Alita: Battle Angel eventually began production in 2016 with Cameron writing and producing and Robert Rodriguez directing. Avatar had an estimated budget of over 300 million and was released on December 18, 2009. This marked his first feature film since 1997's Titanic. It is composed almost entirely of computer-generated animation, using a more-advanced version of the \\"performance capture\\" technique used by director Robert Zemeckis in The Polar Express. James Cameron had written an 80-page scriptment for Avatar in 1995 and announced in 1996 that he would make the film after completing Titanic. In December 2006, Cameron explained that the delay in producing the film since the 1990s had been to wait until the technology necessary to create his project was advanced enough, since at the time no studio would finance for the development of the visual effects. The film was originally scheduled to be released in May 2009 but was pushed back to December 2009 to allow more time for post-production on the complex CGI and to give more time for theatres worldwide to install 3D projectors. Cameron originally intended Avatar to be 3D-only. Avatar broke several box office records during its initial theatrical run. It grossed 749.7 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.74 billion worldwide, becoming the highest-grossing film of all time in the United States and Canada, surpassing Cameron's Titanic. Avatar also became the first movie to ever earn more than 2 billion worldwide. Including revenue from the re-release of Avatar featuring extended footage, it grossed 760.5 million in the United States and Canada and more than 2.78 billion worldwide. It was nominated for nine Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Director, and won three for Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography and Best Visual Effects. Avatar's success made Cameron the highest earner in Hollywood for 2010, netting him 257 million as reported by Vanity Fair.

Obeidallah: Why do media coddle Colbert just because he calls himself a \\"comedian\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Stephen Colbert's Potential Presidential Run: Why is the Media So Supportive of a Comedian? Introduction: Comedian Dean Obeidallah recently shared that Stephen Colbert is considering running for president. However, this potential candidacy is being met with mixed reactions. While some view it as a breath of fresh air, Obeidallah, through his satirical portrayal of Colbert, asserts that it could be a threat to our way of life. As the media continues to coddle Colbert simply because he calls himself a \\"comedian,\\" this article aims to explore why such support exists and the potential implications of Colbert's candidature. Body: 1. The appeal of celebrity involvement in politics Stephen Colbert, as a comedian and television host, holds significant sway in the entertainment industry. But why would the media be inclined to support a candidate with no political experience? In recent times, we have witnessed a growing trend of celebrities entering the political arena. This could potentially be due to the widespread influence of media personalities who command a large, devoted following. As the public tends to trust and relate to their favorite figures, celebrities like Colbert tap into this pre-established emotional connection translating it into political support. 2. Colbert's unique perspective as a satirist Colbert is known for his biting wit and satirical comedy, which he has consistently used to critique political figures on his television show. Through this lens, he has developed an understanding of the political landscape that might be valuable in an unconventional way. His candidature, therefore, may shed light on the flaws of the system and bring a fresh perspective to the table. 3. The role of media in shaping public perception It is crucial to examine the role media plays in shaping the public's perception of a potential candidate like Stephen Colbert. By lending support and rallying around a comedian, the media risks oversimplifying the political process. While it is essential for the public to have a diverse pool of candidates representing various backgrounds, the media has a responsibility to question the qualifications of all candidates, no matter their background or occupation. Conclusion: Stephen Colbert's potential presidential run brings to light questions about celebrity involvement in politics and the media's role in shaping public perception. As influential personalities like Colbert consider entering the political arena, it's vital for both the public and the media to scrutinize these figures with the same level of stringency as career politicians. The media's support of Colbert's candidacy should not be accepted uncritically simply because he identifies as a comedian. Instead, careful consideration of qualifications, policy proposals, and the implications of such candidature should be the focus of future analyses."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Help as much as you can. Read the following article and select the best answer. Article: In the 18th century, New York was smaller than Philadelphia and Boston. Today it is the largest city in America. How can the change in its size and importance be explained? To answer this question we must consider certain facts about geography, history, and economics. Together these three will explain the huge growth of America's most famous city. The map of the Northeast shows that the four areas with the largest populations in this region are around seaports. At these points materials from across the sea enter the United States, and the products of the land are sent there for export across the sea. We know that places where transportation lines meet are good places for making raw materials into finished goods. That is why seaports often have cities nearby. But cities like New York needed more than their geographical location in order to become great industrial centers. Their development did not happen simply by chance.www.zxxk.com About 1815, when many Americans from the east had already moved toward the west, transportation routes from the seaports to the central regions of the country began to be a serious problem. The slow wagons of that time, usually drawn by horses, were too expensive for moving heavy freight very far. In New York State a canal seemed the best answer to the transportation problem. From the eastern end of Lake Erie all the way across the state to the Hudson River there is a long strip of low land. Here the Erie Canal was built, and after several years of work it was completed in 1825. The canal produced an immediate effect. Freight costs were cut to about one tenth of what they had been. New York City, which had been smaller than Philadelphia and Boston, quickly became the leading city of the coast. In the years that followed, transportation routes on the Great Lakes were joined to routes on the Mississippi River. Then New York City became the end point of a great inland shipping system that started from the Atlantic Ocean far up the western branches of the Mississippi. Question: According to the passage, which of the following statements is TRUE? - The Erie Canal connected Lake Erie with the Hudson River. - Economists are of the opinion that places where farming is done are good for making raw materials into finished goods. - Wagons drawn by horses and oxen soon proved to be better and cheaper than canal transportation. - The seaports usually have less population but more business.","completion":"According to the passage, the statement that is TRUE is: - The Erie Canal connected Lake Erie with the Hudson River."},{"prompt":"Question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: In Marseille, an undercover detective is following Alain Charnier (Fernando Rey), a wealthy French criminal who runs the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world.

He was applying his knowledge of genetic engineering to develop better crops. Recently, he had successfully developed a crop, crop A, that was herbicide tolerant. To determine the versatility of the crop he compared it with another crop that was not tolerant of herbicides, crop B. The results of his research would allow his company to market the new crop. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Would crop A need less or more number of chemicals than crop B? Hint: In addition to insects, weeds have also been a menace to farmers - just ask anyone with a garden how much they hate weeds. They can quickly compete for water and nutrients needed by other plants. Sure, farmers can use herbicides to kill weeds, but do these chemicals also harm the crops? Can biotechnology help with this issue? Some crops have also been genetically engineered to acquire tolerance to the herbicides - allowing the crops to grow, but killing the weeds. But the lack of cost effective herbicides with a broad range of activity - that do not harm crops - is a problem in weed management. Multiple applications of numerous herbicides are routinely needed to control the wide range of weeds that are harmful to crops. And at times these herbicides are being used as a preventive measure – that is, spraying to prevent weeds from developing rather than spraying after weeds form. So these chemicals are being added to crops. This practice is followed by mechanical and/or hand weeding to control weeds that are not controlled by the chemicals. Crops that are tolerant of herbicides would obviously be a tremendous benefit to farmers ( Figure above ). The introduction of herbicide tolerant crops has the potential to reduce the number of chemicals needed during a growing season, thereby increasing crop yield due to improved weed management and decreased harm to the crops.

An object with more mass is pulled by gravity with greater force. Mass and weight are closely related. However, the weight of an object can change if the force of gravity changes. On Earth, the force of gravity is the same everywhere. So how does the force of gravity change? It doesnt if you stay on Earth. What if we travel to another planet or moon in our solar system? Look at the photo of astronaut Edwin E. Aldrin Jr. taken by fellow astronaut Neil Armstrong in the Figure. They were the first humans to walk on the moon. An astronaut weighs less on the moon than he would on Earth. This is because the moons gravity is weaker than Earths. The astronauts mass, on the other hand, did not change. He still contained the same amount of matter on the moon as he did on Earth. If the astronaut weighed 175 pounds on Earth, he would have weighed only 29 pounds on the moon. If his mass on Earth was 80 kg, what would his mass have been on the moon?

News article: Scientists Use Big Data to Identify Anonymous Artist Banksy Banksy is a famous artist and activist whose distinctive drawings appear unexpectedly on the buildings of London and New York City. Hailed by some as a genius, and others as a vandal, his aura is enhanced by mystery: He never appears with his art, and he tightly conceals his identity. Now a new study by British scientists at Queen Mary University of London purports to identify Banksy using big data tools and geographical profiling. According to the paper, which appears in the Journal of Spatial Science, it is possible to use “a Dirichlet process mixture (DPM) model of geographic profiling, a mathematical technique developed in criminology…to analyse the spatial patterns of Banksy artworks in Bristol and London.” As The Economist explains, this involved associating Banksy works with corresponding locations: a pub, playing fields, and three residential addresses. All of the locations are tied with one man, Robin Gunningham, meaning it’s possible to conclude with a high degree of certainty that Gunningham is Banksy. This finding is consistent with reports in 2008 that claimed to identify Banksy as Gunningham, who is a painter from Bristol, based on a photograph of the artist with a spray can. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. Banksy became famous for his outdoor stencils, often political in nature, and for acts such as placing a life-size replica of a Guantanamo Bay detainee on a ride at Disneyland. In 2013, he spent the summer in New York, leaving impromptu murals on buildings, earning the ire of the city’s mayor in the process. According to the BBC, lawyers for Banksy approached the Queen Mary University of London with concerns about how the work would be publicized. But they reportedly did not question the validity of the science. The purpose of the study was to use Banksy as a test subject to prove how the DRM model of profiling is a superior mathematical technique for identifying people associated with certain acts. The study claims the technique used to identify Banksy “could be used to help locate terrorist bases before more serious incidents occur.” What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"This news article is about how scientists used a special math technique called \\"geographical profiling\\" to try and figure out the real identity of Banksy, a famous artist who draws on buildings and keeps their identity a secret.

Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"If the bees mold less wax, it will directly affect the construction process of a smaller hive. Let's consider the steps and effects involved: 1. Bees molding less wax: This will result in a reduced amount of wax available for hive construction. Bees typically use wax to build the hexagonal cylinders that form the structure of the hive. 2. Hexagonal cylinders construction: With the limited wax material, bees may build fewer hexagonal cylinders, potentially leading to a smaller hive size. 3. Space for honey storage and brood rearing: A smaller hive would have less space for honey storage and brood rearing. This could result in the colony having less food supply to support the population, as well as the future growth of the colony. 4. Resource allocation: Bees may have to prioritize the allocation of limited wax resources, potentially either focusing on honey storage cells or brood cells. This could lead to a compromise between colony growth and food storage and could have indirect effects on the overall health of the colony. Even though the bees might produce less honey if they mold less wax, smaller hives might still be functional, as the perturbation could retain the basic structure and function of the hive.

But have you ever considered why you are a fan of the Harry Potter series? JK Rowling has created a list of characters and an environment for them to inhabit that appeals to both adults and children. The fantasy aspect of the wizarding world expands the imagination, and takes the mind to new and exciting places.Anything could happen there.Her stories contain parts of the believable and unbelievable, changing the predictability that readers commonly come across and bear in fiction. The main theme of the series, including good versus evil, prejudice, love, death, sacrifice, friendship and loyalty, in actuality contributes to the ever-lasting nature of the stories.At the same time, these themes remind us of classic literature, offering mature readers tales that wear like a comfortable pair of shoes, while introducing younger readers to concepts they will meet throughout their lives. Much of the appeal also comes from the characters.In each book, JK Rowling introduces and describes the characters in such a way that we wonder not only about their futures, but also about their pasts.Even supporting characters are suddenly more than just extras in the background.And what of Harry Potter himself? We care about Harry, because we watch him grow from an innocent boy to a powerful wizard.We see him as both Hero and Victim.He experiences endless love and extreme pain, and as readers, we experience them with him.
