Q:The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a 1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year’s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. “Today marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,” House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. “This legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.” After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

They found it took longer to nod off with a back-lit e-reader, which led to poorer quality sleep and being more tired the next morning. Original Kindle readers do not emit light so should be fine, say experts. Experts said people should minimise light-exposure in the evening. Whether you are perusing the Man Booker shortlist or leafing through Zoella, the impact of reading on your sleep is probably the last thing on your mind. But there has been growing concern about the dangers of light before bedtime. Our bodies are kept in tune with the rhythm of day and night by an internal body clock, which uses light to tell the time. But blue light, the wavelength common in smartphones, tablets and LED lighting, is able to disrupt the body clock. Blue light in the evening can slow or prevent the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. Twelve people were locked in a sleep laboratory for two weeks. They spent five days reading from a paperback and five days from an iPad. Regular blood samples showed the production of the sleep hormone melatonin was reduced by reading an e-book. People also took longer to fall asleep, had less deep sleep and were more tired the next morning. The researchers said other e-readers such as the Nook and Kindle Fire produced similar wavelengths of light and would have the same impact. The findings were published in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. Lead researcher Prof Charles Czeisler told the BBC News website: \\"The light emitted by most e-readers is shining directly into the eyes of the reader, whereas from a printed book or the original Kindle, the reader is only exposed to reflected light from the pages of the book.\\" He said disrupting sleep in turn affected health. \\"Sleep deficiency has been shown to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease, metabolic diseases like obesity and diabetes, and cancer. \\"Thus, the melatonin suppression that we saw in this study among participants when they were reading from the light-emitting e-reader concerns us.\\" Dr Victoria Revell, who researches the impact of light on the body at the University of Surrey, told the BBC: \\"This is a very good study and I think it's really interesting. \\"We should be advising people to minimise their [light-emitting e-reader] use in the evening, particularly teenagers who are a group that are using their phones and tablets late in to the evening.\\" Teenagers naturally have a late body clock, which makes them slow to rise in the morning and up late at night. \\"People who already have a delayed body clock are delaying themselves much further and that is a very important message,\\" Dr Revell added. Prof Czeisler agreed, saying there was \\"special concern\\" for teenagers who were already sleep deficient by being forced to get up early for school.","completion":"A team from Harvard Medical School found out that reading on a light-emitting e-reader before sleeping is not good for you. It takes longer to fall asleep, and you won't sleep as well, making you more tired the next day. This is because the blue light from the e-reader can mess up your body's internal clock and the production of the sleep hormone melatonin. It is better to read a paper book or use an original Kindle, which does not emit light, and try to reduce using screens with blue light before bedtime."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: What type of pistol was George Jackson accused of smuggling? Movie plot title: Black August Movie plot: Feature Description:The George Jackson story has now been developed into a movie entitled Black August. It depicts the last 14 months of George Jackson's existence under the subjective and objective conditions of captivity. Sentenced to one year-to-life at age 18, for a 70 gas station robbery in 1960, George Jackson would spend the next 11 years in California's industrial prison complex, 7 years of which were in solitary confinement. The movie encompasses the infamous Soledad Brothers case in which George Jackson, Fleeta Drumgo, and John Clucheette are accused of murdering a Soledad prison guard, in retaliation for the killing of three Black inmates involved in a fight with White inmates on an exercise yard in Soledad State Prison, Soledad, California. The movie also reflects on the general prison movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and the role the Black Panther Party would play in organizing both the outside communities in America as well as their influence on prisoners across the country. George Jackson would be moved and inspired as a result of the Panther Party activities. As a prison organizer, George was recruited by Black Panther Party founder Huey P. Newton to head the Peoples Army, a euphemism which would become synonymous with the name Black Guerrilla Family. The film points out the conspiratorial nature of occurrences, which surrounded the events of August 7, 1970, where Jackson's 17-year-old younger brother, Jonathan Jackson, would be killed at the Marin County Courthouse, at San Raphael, California, during an alleged hostage takeover attempt to leverage against the release of the elder Jackson, and the other Soledad Brothers. The younger Jackson and thre others would be killed, including Superior Judge, Harold Haley. and August 21, 1971, where George Jackson himself, and five others would be killed at San Quentin State Prison, California, during what is discribed as a prison break attempt.

He is studying the effect of insect species on environment. For his study he chose four locations, location A, location B, location C and the entire globe, which he denoted as location D. He noticed location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary , but location B's loss is permanent. Location C's loss of biodiversity yet to be determined. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which location most probably suffered land loss or similar processes, location A or location B? Hint: Biodiversity loss is the extinction of species (plant or animal) worldwide, and also the local reduction or loss of species in a certain habitat. The latter phenomenon can be temporary or permanent, depending on whether the environmental degradation that leads to the loss is reversible through ecological restoration / ecological resilience or effectively permanent (e.g. through land loss). Global extinction has so far been proven to be irreversible. Even though permanent global species loss is a more dramatic phenomenon than regional changes in species composition, even minor changes from a healthy stable state can have dramatic influence on the food web and the food chain insofar as reductions in only one species can adversely affect the entire chain (coextinction), leading to an overall reduction in biodiversity, possible alternative stable states of an ecosystem notwithstanding. Ecological effects of biodiversity are usually counteracted by its loss. Reduced biodiversity in particular leads to reduced ecosystem services and eventually poses an immediate danger for food security, also for humankind.[1] A:","completion":"Location B most probably suffered land loss or similar processes. The paragraph states that location A's loss of biodiversity is temporary, implying that the environmental degradation that led to the loss in this area may be reversible through ecological restoration or ecological resilience.

Try to ask a question about all parts of the plot, not just the beginning. Nick Hendricks (Bateman) and Dale Arbus (Day) are friends who despise their bosses. Nick works at a financial firm for the sadistic David Harken (Spacey), who implies the possibility of a promotion for Nick for months, only to award it to himself. Dale is a dental assistant being sexually harassed by his boss, Dr. Julia Harris (Aniston); she threatens to tell his fiancee Stacy (Lindsay Sloane) that he had sex with her unless he actually has sex with her. Nick and Dale's accountant friend Kurt Buckman (Sudeikis) enjoys working for Jack Pellitt (Donald Sutherland) at a chemical company, but after Jack unexpectedly dies of a heart attack, the company is taken over by Jack's cocaine-addicted son Bobby (Farrell), whose apathy and incompetence threaten the future of the company. At night, over drinks, Kurt jokingly suggests that their lives would be happier if their bosses were no longer around. Initially hesitant, they eventually agree to kill their employers. In search of a hitman, the trio meet Dean \\"Motherfuckah\\" Jones (Foxx), an ex-con who agrees to be their \\"murder consultant\\". Jones suggests that Dale, Kurt and Nick kill each other's bosses to hide their motive while making the deaths look like accidents. The three reconnoiter Bobby's house, and Kurt steals Bobby's phone. They next go to Harken's house, where Kurt and Nick go inside while Dale waits in the car. Harken returns home and confronts Dale for littering, but then has an allergy attack from the peanut butter on the litter. Dale saves Harken by stabbing him with an EpiPen. Nick and Kurt think Dale is stabbing Harken to death and flee, with Kurt accidentally dropping Bobby's phone in Harken's bedroom. The next night, Kurt watches Julia's home, but she seduces and has sex with him. Nick and Dale reluctantly wait outside Bobby's and Harken's houses, respectively, to commit the murders, despite neither of them wanting to. Harken discovers Bobby's cellphone in his bedroom and uses it to find his address, suspecting his wife Rhonda (Julie Bowen) is having an affair. He drives over and kills Bobby, with Nick as a secret witness. Nick flees at high speed, setting off a traffic camera. The trio meet to discuss their reservations about continuing with their plan. They are arrested by the police, who believe the camera footage makes them suspects in Bobby's murder. Lacking evidence, the police are forced to let the trio go free. The trio consult with Jones again, but learn that he never actually killed anyone, having been imprisoned for bootlegging the film Snow Falling on Cedars. Jones suggests that they get Harken to confess and secretly tape it. The three accidentally crash Harken's surprise birthday party, where Nick and Dale get Harken to confess to the murder before realizing that Kurt, who has the audio recorder, is elsewhere having sex with Rhonda. Harken threatens to kill all three for attempting to blackmail him. They flee by car, but Harken gives chase and repeatedly rams their vehicle. Believing they have committed a crime, the car's navigation-system operator remotely disables Kurt's car, allowing Harken to catch and hold them at gunpoint. Harken shoots himself in the leg as he boasts about his plan to frame them for murdering Bobby and attempting to kill him to get rid of the witness. The police arrest Nick, Dale and Kurt, but the navigation-system operator, Gregory, reveals that it is his companies policy to record all conversations for quality assurance. Gregory plays the tape that has Harken confessing he murdered Pellitt. Harken is sentenced to 25 years to life in prison, while the friends get their charges waived. Nick is promoted to president of the company under a sadistic CEO, Kurt retains his job under a new boss, and Dale blackmails Julia into ending her harassment by convincing her to sexually harass a supposedly unconscious patient, while Jones secretly records the act.","completion":"What does Dean \\"Motherfuckah\\" Jones suggest as a plan for Nick, Dale, and Kurt to kill each other's bosses while making the deaths look like accidents?"},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Although people everywhere seem to enjoy drinking coffee, they don't all have the same coffee culture. In Europe, for example, coffee shops are common places for people to meet friends and to talk while they drink coffee. On the other hand, places like this were not as common in North America in the past. Instead, people in North America liked to drink coffee in their homes with friends. The coffee culture in the USA changed when Starbucks coffee shops spread across the country. The first Starbucks coffee shop opened in 1971 in downtown Seattle, Washington, in the USA. It was a small coffee shop that cooked its own coffee beans. The coffee shop's business did well, and by 1981 there were three Starbucks stores in Seattle. Things really began to change for the company in 1981.That year, Howard Schultz met the three men who _ Starbucks. Schultz worked in New York for a company that made kitchen equipment. He noticed that Starbucks ordered a large number of special coffee makers, which caused his great interest. Schultz went to Seattle to see what Starbucks did. In 1982, the original Starbucks owners hired Schultz as the company's head of marketing . In 1983, Schultz traveled to Italy. The special environment of the espresso( ) bars there caught his eyes. Back in the USA, Schultz created an environment for Starbucks coffee shops that was comfortable and casual, and customers everywhere seemed to like it. Starbucks began opening more stores across the USA. Then the company opened coffee shops in other countries as well. Today, there are more than 16,000 Starbucks coffee shops all over the world. However, that does not mean Starbucks has not had problems. In fact, many Starbucks stores have closed over the past few years. On the one hand, this is because there were too many coffee shops competing for business in one small area. On the other hand, stores in some countries closed because the coffee culture there did not match with the \\"feel the same everywhere\\" environment offered by Starbucks. Question: Why did so many Starbucks close in small areas? Yes or no, is the answer \\"The style of the coffee stores seems the same.\\"? A:","completion":"No, the answer is not \\"The style of the coffee stores seems the same.\\" The reason many Starbucks stores closed in small areas is primarily due to the high competition among coffee shops, causing an oversaturated market with too many businesses competing for customers in one small area.

Question: Who is Bernie to Guerin? Movie title: Veronica Guerin Movie plot: Veronica Guerin is a feisty crime reporter for the Sunday Independent. Suddenly aware of how much Dublin's illegal drug trade is encroaching upon the lives of its working class citizens, especially the children, she becomes determined to expose the men responsible for its spread. Guerin begins by interviewing the pre-pubescent addicts who shoot up on the street or in abandoned buildings in the housing estates. Her investigation leads her to major suppliers and John Traynor, a notable source of information about the criminal underworld. Traynor is willing to assist her to an extent but is not above misleading her in order to protect himself from nefarious drug lord John Gilligan. In order to steer her away from Gilligan, Traynor suggests Gerry Hutch, a criminal known as The Monk, is in charge of the operation. Guerin pursues him with a vengeance, only to discover he is not involved. As Guerin's investigation deepens and she comes closer to the truth, she and her family become targets. When a bullet fired through a window in her home as a warning fails to stop her, she is shot in the leg and the life of her young son Cathal is threatened. Her husband Graham, mother Bernie, and brother Jimmy implore her to stop, but when Guerin confronts Gilligan at his home and he savagely beats her, she becomes more determined to expose him for who he is. Rather than press charges against him, which would necessitate her removal from the story, she forges ahead with her investigation. On 26 June 1996, Guerin appears in court to respond to an accumulation of parking tickets and numerous penalties for speeding that she has ignored. She is given a nominal fine of IRÂ£100, but while en route home she calls her mother and then her husband to report the good news. She is speaking to her office while stopped at traffic lights on red on the Naas Dual Carriageway when a motorcycle with two men on it pulls up beside her.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Why can some people sleep through noises like a honking car or flushing toilet, while others are awakened by the lightest sound? To find the answer, sleep researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital conducted an unusual study of 12 self-described deep sleepers. After tests confirmed that the healthy volunteers were solid sleepers, they took part in a three-night study in the university's sleep laboratory. The participants spent the night in a big and comfortable room. But the room also included four speakers positioned near the top of the bed. During the night, the deep sleepers were subjected to 14 different recorded sounds, like street traffic, toilets flushing, an ice machine dispensing and an airplane flying overhead. Next door, the researchers monitored their sleep patterns and brain waves. As expected, all of the participants slept ly well, but there were differences in how they responded to the noisy interruptions. Some of the sleepers didn't wake up even when a sound was blasted at 70 decibels ; others were awakened by sounds at 40 or 50 decibels. The researchers discovered that the difference in a sleeper's reaction to noise could be predicted by the level of brain activity called \\"sleep spindles''. A sleep spindle is a burst of high-frequency brain activity coming from deep inside the brain during sleep. The source of the spindles is the thalamus, a part of the brain that sends sensory information to the rest of the cortex . Before the study, the Massachusetts researchers theorized that the spindles are the brain's way of preventing sensory information from passing through the thalamus and waking the rest of the brain during sleep. They found that the sleepers who experienced the most sleep spindles during the night were also the soundest sleepers and were least likely to be awakened by noise. Scientists already know that most people become lighter sleepers with age, most likely because older people experience less \\"slow wave sleep'', which is the deepest stage of sleep.

Ok, well that’s a slight exaggeration but it was the first high-end make-up item that I ever bought and it made me feel like I was really getting somewhere. I’d got a good job, was in the process of buying my own house and I could afford to buy premium beauty products. I chose a transparent lemon yellow gloss with tiny flecks of iridescent glitter in, and over the following months I treated myself to several other Juicy Tube variants including a shimmery nude gloss called Pamplemousse which I wore on nights out for years (incidentally Pamplemousse is still going!). Fast forward several (ahem…) years and Juicy Tubes are still going strong, but there’s a new member of the Juicy family vying for attention – the Juicy Shaker.*. Another lip product, this one is a nourishing tinted lip oil which acts a bit like a gloss, and I was sent two of the new shades to try out – Piece of Cake and Show Me The Honey. Juicy Shakers are a bi-phase nourishing lip oil, when the product is allowed to settle the pigment falls to the bottom and the oil rises to the top, giving a split effect. Then you need to shake the bottle to mix the two layers together, giving the product it’s name. The ingredients include sweet almond oil, omega 3 and cranberry oil and really help care for your lips unlike most other glosses. Show Me The Honey is a nude coral shade, it looks rather orange and scary in the bottle but in reality it’s much more of a gentle shade. Piece of Cake is a damson pink, and again looks much darker in the bottle. I found that Piece of Cake matches almost exactly with the natural colour of my lips so it’s perfect for when I want my make-up to look really pared back with glossy supple natural looking lips.

PopMatters reviewer Adrien Begrand observed that Rubin's production \\"shoves [Dave] Lombardo's drumming right up front in the mix\\". Guitarist Jeff Hanneman has since said that South of Heaven was the only album the band members discussed before writing the music. Aware that they \\"couldn't top Reign in Blood\\", and that whatever they recorded would be \\"compared to that album\\", he believed they \\"had to slow down\\", something Slayer had never done on albums before, or since. Guitarist Kerry King cited the need to \\"keep people guessing\\" as another reason for the musical shift. \\"In order to contrast the aggressive assault put forth on Reign in Blood, Slayer consciously slowed down the tempo of the album as a whole\\", according to Slayer's official biography. \\"They also added elements like undistorted guitars and toned-down vocal styles not heard on previous albums.\\"King has since been critical of his performance, which he describes as his \\"most lackluster\\". King attributes this to the fact he had recently married, and moved to Phoenix, Arizona. Describing himself as \\"probably the odd man out at that point\\", he stated he \\"didn't participate as much because of that\\". Hanneman said: \\"We go through dry spells sometimes, but the good thing about having two guitar players that can write music is that you are never gonna go without.

But there came a day when giant quakes threatened to destroy Krypton forever. One of the planet's leading scientists, sensing the approach of doom, placed his infant son in a small rocket ship and sent it hurtling in the direction of the Earth, just as Krypton exploded. The rocket sped through star-studded space, landing safely on Earth with its precious burden: Krypton's sole survivor. A passing motorist found the uninjured child and took it to an orphanage. As the years went by and the child grew to maturity, he found himself possessed of amazing physical powers. Faster than a speeding bullet, more powerful than a locomotive, able to leap tall buildings in a single bound, the infant of Krypton is now the Man of Steel: SUPERMAN! To best be in a position to use his amazing powers in a never-ending battle for truth and justice, Superman has assumed the disguise of Clark Kent, mild-mannered reporter for a great metropolitan newspaper.\\" Main story[edit] Play media The animated short.

Premise: \\"Brahmins, the priestly caste, fill many of the top posts in the universities and administration; many Indian Army officers can trace their ancestry to the proud Kshatriya warrior caste; business is dominated by the merchant or Vaishya caste; and Shudras till the land.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"Shudras farm the land and business is mainly controlled by the merchant.\\"?","completion":"To determine whether the premise supports the hypothesis \\"Shudras farm the land and business is mainly controlled by the merchant,\\" I will take the following steps: Step 1: Identify the relevant information in the premise. The premise states that: - \\"Brahmins, the priestly caste, fill many of the top posts in the universities and administration.\\" - \\"Many Indian Army officers can trace their ancestry to the proud Kshatriya warrior caste.\\" - \\"Business is dominated by the merchant or Vaishya caste.\\" - \\"Shudras till the land.\\" Step 2: Compare the relevant information to the hypothesis. The hypothesis states that \\"Shudras farm the land and business is mainly controlled by the merchant.\\" Step 3: Determine if the premise supports the hypothesis. According to the premise, Shudras (who till the land) are indeed responsible for farming, which aligns with the first part of the hypothesis. The premise also states that the business sector is dominated by the merchant or Vaishya caste, suggesting that they mainly control business. This similarly aligns with the second part of the hypothesis. Conclusion: Based on the premise provided, it can be concluded that the premise supports the hypothesis \\"Shudras farm the land and business is mainly controlled by the merchant.\\" Both parts of the hypothesis are consistent with the information mentioned in the premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was designed by noted architect Edward Columbus Hosford in the Classical Revival style. On September 20, 2006, it was added to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places. Based on the paragraph above can we conclude that \\"The Pasco County Courthouse has no historical significance. \\"?","completion":"Based on the paragraph provided, we can conclude that the statement \\"The Pasco County Courthouse has no historical significance\\" is incorrect. The Pasco County Courthouse, located in Dade City, Florida, is a historical site with several noteworthy aspects. Firstly, it was constructed in 1909, which indicates that the building has over a century of history associated with it. Buildings from that time period can provide valuable insight into the architectural and societal norms of the era. Secondly, the Classical Revival style of the courthouse holds historical significance. The design of the building was created by well-known architect Edward Columbus Hosford, who took inspiration from classical architecture. Classical Revival or Neoclassical architecture was a prevalent architectural style in the United States during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style was characterized by grandiose proportions, symmetrical designs, columns, and the use of classical motifs such as pediments and friezes. The Pasco County Courthouse is a fine example of this style and thus possesses historical value. Lastly, the Pasco County Courthouse's addition to the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on September 20, 2006, validates its historical significance. The National Register of Historic Places is a program of the United States government designed to identify and protect historically significant properties. By being on this list, the Pasco County Courthouse is recognized nationally for its architectural and historical relevance. Thus, contrary to the initial statement, the Pasco County Courthouse holds substantial historical significance due to its age, architectural style, and inclusion on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The government approved plans for horizontal fracking in Little Plumpton, Lancashire, this month in a landmark ruling for the UK's shale gas industry. The county council rejected Cuadrilla's fracking application but it was overruled by the communities secretary. Preston New Road Action Group has written to the government saying the decision was unlawful. The Department for Communities and Local Government (DCLG) said the decision followed \\"extensive consideration\\". The group argued the decision was \\"fundamentally flawed in its misapplication of planning laws and policy\\" and urged the government to reconsider. If it refuses, campaigners will consider bringing a statutory legal challenge through the courts. In a statement, the group said: \\"The dismantling of local democracy to facilitate this industry is a travesty of justice and... troubling on a number of fronts. \\"Lancashire said 'no' loudly and clearly and in line with local planning policies, that decision should stand.\\" Cuadrilla chief executive Francis Egan said a legal challenge was \\"not unexpected\\" but the plan was approved after \\"an extensive public inquiry and lengthy and detailed subsequent consideration by the planning inspector and communities secretary\\". He added: \\"We are confident all due processes have been followed and DCLG can and will demonstrate this as necessary.\\" Communities Secretary Savid Javid previously said the shale gas industry would support thousands of jobs and reduce the UK's reliance on energy imports. The DCLG said in a statement: \\"The decision followed extensive consideration of all the evidence, including an independent planning inspector's report and evidence submitted during a two week public inquiry.\\" It is not the first time fracking has been approved since a ban was lifted in 2012. It is however the first to involve horizontal drilling, which is seen as more productive than vertical drilling. In May, North Yorkshire County Council approved an application by Third Energy to vertically extract shale gas at a site near Kirby Misperton in Ryedale.

Short movie review: catch this imax offering Did the critic thinking positively or negatively of the movie?","completion":"The critic's statement of \\"catch this IMAX offering\\" does not directly provide a positive or negative view on the movie. This short review does not contain any explicit value statements that would clearly denote either a positive or negative opinion. The use of the word \\"catch\\" might be construed as a recommendation to see the film, however, without further context it's hard to definitively interpret this as a full-on endorsement. Our understanding of the critic's opinion remains rather limited with such a short phrase. Due to the absence of any distinct criticisms or praising comments, we can't definitively say that they liked or disliked the movie. They've simply advised the audiences to 'catch' it on IMAX. However, let's break down what we can gather from the limited words used: 1. The word \\"catch\\": It's a rather casual term often used in English. It's often associated with grabbing an opportunity or getting hold of something. In this context, it might be an arm-twisting persuasion to go see the movie. 2. \\"this IMAX offering\\": The critic specifies the format, i.e., IMAX. This may hint that the movie contains high-quality visual effects and cinematography that is worthwhile watching on an immersive, high-resolution platform like IMAX. That said, the critic does not pass judgment on whether the viewed content is good or bad. To summarize, the phrase \\"catch this IMAX offering\\" doesn't help us determine if the critic had a positive or negative view of the film. It feels more like a neutral recommendation to see the film in a specific format for a potentially increased viewing experience. To form a better perspective on the critic’s stance, more explicit details or descriptive review commentary would be needed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The ambiance in the restaurant was warm and inviting, the lighting was perfect, and the background music set the tone for an enjoyable dining experience. The menu selection was diverse and well-organized, catering to different dietary preferences and offering options from appetizers to desserts. Each dish was described in a manner that showcased the ingredients and flavors, making it quite challenging to decide what to order. I started with a delightful tomato and mozzarella salad that was impeccably plated. The flavors blended effortlessly, with the heirloom tomatoes' freshness and the mozzarella's creaminess creating a perfect balance that melted in my mouth. The drizzled balsamic reduction offered just the right tanginess to elevate the dish further. For my entree, I ordered the pan-seared salmon with a side of seasonal vegetables and garlic and herb mashed potatoes. The salmon was cooked to perfection, with a crispy exterior giving way to moist, tender flakes of fish. The accompanying sauce was light and flavorful, complementing the salmon without overpowering it. The vegetables were equally satisfying, cooked to perfection, and maintaining their vibrant colors and inherent taste. The garlic and herb mashed potatoes were a delightful surprise, as they were fluffy, creamy, and seasoned beautifully. The staff at [Restaurant Name] deserves a special mention. Our server was extremely attentive, knowledgeable, and friendly. They made excellent recommendations on dishes and were always available to meet our needs. The restaurant's cleanliness was impeccable, and observing the adherence to proper COVID-19 guidelines reinforced our comfort and reassurance.

You should describe the task and explain your answer. While answering a multiple choice question, first output the correct answer(s). Then explain why other answers are wrong. You might need to use additional knowledge to answer the question. Water flowing over Earths surface or underground causes erosion and deposition. Water flowing over a steeper slope moves faster and causes more erosion. How water transports particles depends on their size. When water slows down, it starts depositing sediment. This process starts with the largest particles first. Runoff erodes the land after a heavy rain. It picks up sediment. Runoff carries most of the sediment to bodies of water. Mountain streams erode narrow, V-shaped valleys and waterfalls. Erosion and deposition by slow-flowing rivers create broad floodplains and meanders. Deposition by streams and rivers may form alluvial fans and deltas. Floodwaters may deposit natural levees. Erosion and deposition by groundwater can form caves and sinkholes. Stalactites and stalagmites are mineral deposits. They build up in caves as water continues to drip.

Premise: A tan dog is running along side another dog outside Hypothesis: Two big dogs are chasing after the same ball .Given the premise, can we conclude the hypothesis?","completion":"Based on the premise provided, we can't definitively conclude the hypothesis. This is because the premise only provides us with limited information, specifically about the colour and the action of one dog (that it's tan-coloured and it's running) and the fact that there is another dog outside. It doesn't provide us with any detail about the size or breed of the dogs, the object of their pursuit, or even if the other dog is participating in the running. The hypothesis, on the other hand, makes specific claims— primarily that there are two big dogs and that they are running after the same ball. The size of the dogs isn't provided in the premise, so we can't make any conclusions regarding that aspect. Similarly, there is no mention of a ball in the premise, or any specific detail as to what both dogs might be chasing after (if they're chasing after anything at all). We can imagine scenarios wherein the hypothesis could be true based on the premise. For instance, it could be that the tan dog and the other dog, not specified in color, are both large dogs, and they happen to be chasing after the same ball. However, without explicit information confirming these details, we can't justifiably conclude the hypothesis to be true based on the premise. The hypothesis is simply much more specific than the premise, and the premise does not provide sufficient detail to fully support the hypothesis. The statement also doesn't specify if the dogs are running alongside each other in a companionship manner or in a competitive manner as suggested by the use of 'chasing after the same ball' in the hypothesis. While the two dogs could be running alongside each other for a variety of reasons, without explicit contextual hints it is impossible to draw a final conclusion about the motivation behind their actions. In short, for us to validate the hypothesis from the given premise, we would need more specific data about the dogs' size, their actions, and the presence of a ball or other object of interest. Without these details, the connection between the premise and the hypothesis remains assumptive and speculative, rather than definitive.

Napoleon Napoleon maintained strict, efficient work habits, prioritizing what needed to be done. He cheated at cards, but repaid the losses; he had to win at everything he attempted. He kept relays of staff and secretaries at work. Unlike many generals, Napoleon did not examine history to ask what Hannibal or Alexander or anyone else did in a similar situation. Critics said he won many battles simply because of luck; Napoleon responded, \\"Give me lucky generals,\\" aware that \\"luck\\" comes to leaders who recognize opportunity, and seize it. Dwyer argues that Napoleon's victories at Austerlitz and Jena in 1805-06 heightened his sense of self-grandiosity, leaving him even more certain of his destiny and invincibility. By the Russian campaign in 1812, however, Napoleon seems to have lost his verve. With crisis after crisis at hand, he rarely rose to the occasion.

Answer the following question: Background: In grassland, much of the organic matter added to the soil is from the deep, fibrous, grass root systems. By contrast, tree leaves falling on the forest floor are the principal source of soil organic matter in the forest. Another difference is the frequent occurrence in the grasslands of fires that destroy large amounts of aboveground material but stimulate even greater contributions from roots. Also, the much greater acidity under any forests inhibits the action of certain soil organisms that otherwise would mix much of the surface litter into the mineral soil. As a result, the soils under grasslands generally develop a thicker A horizon with a deeper distribution of organic matter than in comparable soils under forests, which characteristically store most of their organic matter in the forest floor (O horizon) and thin A horizon.

Please answer the following question: Candied fruit, also known as crystallized fruit or glacé fruit, has existed since the 14th century. Whole fruit, smaller pieces of fruit, or pieces of peel, are placed in heated sugar syrup, which absorbs the moisture from within the fruit and eventually preserves it. Depending on size and type of fruit, this process of preservation can take from several days to several months.[1] This process allows the fruit to retain its quality for a year.[2] The continual process of drenching the fruit in syrup causes the fruit to become saturated with sugar, preventing the growth of spoilage microorganisms due to the unfavourable osmotic pressure this creates.[3] Greg's grandma is a culinary expert. She is also very eager to teach others how to make great foods. One day she taught Greg how to make candied fruit. Greg was so excited about it that he bought two baskets of fruits, basket A and basket B, to make some candied fruits.

Article: If you have ever been rock climbing, you will know that it is not a very easy sport. In fact, you probably felt quite defeated when you first tried to do any serious climbing. Indoor and outdoor rock climbing are both extremely demanding and require practice to get good at. It is one of the most physically and mentally demanding sports. There are three basic types of rock climbing. Top roping is the most common type and the climber need to climb with a partner. The second type, which is very similar to top roping, is called lead climbing. In both of the types, the climber can sit off the wall and rest on the rope. The third type is called bouldering. Bouldering is a type of free climbing without any ropes. This is the most demanding of all climbing types. The climber must be able to complete the climbing without taking a rest on the rope. Believe it or not, climbing is said to be about 75% legs and only 25% arms. To climb efficiently and successfully, a person needs to have a wonderful technique. One of the major rules of rock climbing is to always have three points touching the wall, whether it is both feet and one hand, or one foot and both hands, as it is much easier to have your weight cases will not do the climbing; they only hold you into the wall so that your legs are actually pushing you upward. Also, the closer you are to the wall, the easier it is to climb. Rock climbing may sound a bit too extreme for the everyday person, but it is really an amazing workout. Once you get into the sport, and learn how to position your body and rest your weight, then you can begin to deal with some difficult problems. The great thing about rock climbing is that it is mentally challenging as well. You are constantly analyzing the way your body moves and how to do certain moves on the wall. For anyone who wants to get into shape, rock climbing is a fun and effective way to exercise muscles. Question: While climbing, it is much easier for a rock climber if he _ .

Question: Due to economic sanctions and trade embargoes, Cuban citizens primarily use cars designed in the late 1940s and early 1950s. These cars contain engines that were designed before the introduction of the catalytic converter. Meanwhile trade relations between nearby Panama and Japan have enabled the citizens of Panama to drive cars with the most up to date catalytic converter technology possible. Which country's cars, Cuba's or Panama's, will emit less carbon monoxide? Hint: Gasoline-powered vehicles emit a lot of harmful materials. Nitrogen oxides are formed when atmospheric nitrogen reacts with oxygen at the high temperatures found in a car engine. Carbon monoxide is a by-product of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Evaporated and unused fuel releases volatile hydrocarbons into the atmosphere to help form smog. The presence of a catalytic converter in the exhaust system of the car causes these materials to react and be changed into less harmful products. Answer:","completion":"Step 1: Analyze the information given: Cuban vehicles use outdated engines built in the late 1940s and early 1950s without a catalytic converter. Panamanian vehicles use modern engines with the most up-to-date catalytic converter technology. Step 2: Understand the role of catalytic converters: Catalytic converters reduce the amount of harmful emissions produced by vehicles, including nitrogen oxides, carbon monoxide, and hydrocarbons. Step 3: Determine how this relates to carbon monoxide emissions. Carbon monoxide is a byproduct of incomplete combustion of hydrocarbons. Because of the presence of a catalytic converter, Panamanian cars are likely to emit less carbon monoxide due to their more efficient combustion process, facilitated by the catalytic converter, which changes harmful materials into less harmful products. Conclusion: Panama's cars, equipped with advanced catalytic converter technology, will emit less carbon monoxide compared to Cuba's cars that lack catalytic converters."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Archaeologists looking for Roman remains have stumbled across an even more historic find - a wooden railway which was instrumental in the development of the Industrial Revolution. An excavation on the banks of the Tyne unearthed a stretch of waggonway which is more than 200 years old, making it the earliest surviving example of the standard-gauge railway. The discovery was originally part of a network which linked the ports of the North East with collieries in Tyneside and Northumberland in the late 18th century. Discovery: A wooden railway which carried waggons from collieries to the River Tyne has been unearthed. Archaeology: The excavation was expected to find Roman remains but instead stumbled upon the railway. The railway was found by archaeologists digging on the site of the Neptune shipyard, which is currently being redeveloped. Because the site is near the Roman fort of Segedunum, in Wallsend, lead excavators Richard Carlton and Alan Williams were expecting to find remains from the Roman period. Instead, they stumbled across the 25-metre stretch of wooden rails, an early contributor to the mining industry which transformed the North East. The waggonway is made up of a heavy duty 'main way' with two sets of rails laid on top of each other to preserve their longevity, with a loop from the main line descending into a dip. That depression would have been filled with water where coal wagons' wooden rails were rested to stop them drying out and cracking. In the middle of the loop is a stone elevation where the horse pulling the waggon would have stood. Pioneering: The waggonways helped the North East develop and were the precursor to Britain's train network. Breakthrough: Standard-gauge railways ended up being used for steam trains around the world. A waggonway from the former mining town of Tanfield in County Durham. 'The wooden waggonway uncovered by the excavation is the direct ancestor of the modern standard-gauge railway,' Mr Carlton said. With horses and carts eventually replaced by steam trains, railways quickly became the fastest form of transportation the world had ever seen and facilitated the creation of the modern world. In Newcastle and the surrounding areas, the railways allowed coal to be transported around Britain, leading to the rapid growth of the region. Mr Carlton added: 'The coal industry was so vitally important for the North East, and there are so few signs of it left now.' The archaeologists' find is remarkably well-preserved - Mr Williams said: 'It looks as if it has just been covered up and left yesterday.' The discovery has revealed features which were previously known only from drawings and the notebooks of engineers such as John Buddle, who lived near the dig site. Work: The dig on the former site of the Neptune shipyard comes as it is redeveloped for new construction. Preserved: The wooden rails have not rotted because they have been kept from biodegrading under the ground. 'We have drawings describing what has been found by the dig but this is the real thing,' said local historian Les Turnbull. 'It is tremendous to be able to see these features rather than just looking at them in historic drawings and notebooks. 'Because the line is standard railway gauge, it is tremendously important as the earliest example in the world and this is of international significance. The waggonway complex is at the forefront of late 18th-century engineering.' Mr Turnbull, who has written a book on waggonways, claimed that the discovery was more important than any Roman find could be. 'One of the gifts of the North East to world history is the development of the railways,' he said. 'Coal and the railways are Tyneside's heritage and this waggonway was part of that, because without the waggonways the coalfields would not have developed.' In the late 18th century, hundreds of waggons ran from collieries to wharves on the Tyne, where coal would be loaded onto brigs for transport to London and abroad. The excavated remains were part of the Willington waggonway, which took in collieries at Willington Quay and Bigges Main on the edge of Wallsend. In 1801 the Killingworth waggonway, for which George Stephenson's first locomotives were built, joined the Willington line. Stephenson and his son Robert went on to build locomotives at their works in South Street in Newcastle to the Willington gauge, which was 4ft 8½in wide - this became the standard width for railways throughout Britain and much of the world. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. They were an ingenious solution to a problem facing coal barons in Northumberland and Durham - namely, how to efficiently get coal from pit-head to port. The alternative, slower, option was via pack-horse or ox cart. A waggonway was a timber track used for transporting coal in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Where possible, the waggonway would slope gently downhill so that the waggons could roll under their own weight. The driver sitting on the back would control the brake while the horse trotted behind on a tether. After the contents were emptied, the horse would pull the empty cart back up the slope. The rails on the Newcastle waggonway were made of wood, four or five inches thick and five or six inches broad. Although the use of wood as a travelling surface was not new - Neolithic man had used it for carrying trackways across bogs - it was the use of the flanged wheel, which made all the difference, allowing the wagon to move snugly on the track. By 1810, the wooden waggonways began to be phased out, replaced by iron. Over the years, the wooden networks fell into disrepair. In 2000, North Tyneside Council successfully bid for £2million worth of funding to transform more than 30 miles of routes as part of the Government's Liveability Fund. The former haulage routes were made into a welcoming and accessible community leisure, travel and learning resource. Highlights:","completion":"1.

The touchdown, Moss' 13th on the season, broke Stanley Morgan's franchise record of 12 touchdown passes in a single season. On the ensuing drive, a Green strip-sack of Losman was recovered by the Bills, and two plays later, Roscoe Parrish caught a 47-yard touchdown pass for the only Bills touchdown of the game. The Patriots' next drive went for 72&#160;yards and ended in a 16-yard Moss touchdown reception on the first play of the second quarter. A Bills punt on their next possession gave the Patriots the ball at their own 16-yard line. Aided by catches of 25, 15, 11, and 10&#160;yards by Watson, Welker, Stallworth, and Faulk respectively, the Patriots drove 84&#160;yards in under 7&#160;minutes, capping off the drive with a 6-yard touchdown reception to Moss. That touchdown gave Brady the most career touchdown passes in Patriots franchise history, breaking Steve Grogan's record of 182. Another Bills punt led to the Patriots' fifth possession and fifth touchdown of the half, this time a 17-yard Moss touchdown catch ended another 72-yard drive. Moss' fourth touchdown of the half tied an NFL record for touchdowns for a single player before halftime, and set the Patriots' franchise record for touchdowns by a player in a game. Adalius Thomas also had 2.5 sacks in the half, setting a single-game career high. The Patriots began the second half where they left off in the first, driving 73&#160;yards in more than 6&#160;minutes for another touchdown, this one a 3-yard reception by Watson. The Bills responded with a 29-yard Terrence McGee kickoff return that led to a 52-yard Rian Lindell field goal to cut the Patriots lead to 42-10. The Patriots' next series, their seventh of the game, also ended in their seventh touchdown of the game, setting a Patriots franchise single-season touchdown record (1961 and 1980, 52). A Welker screen pass went 24&#160;yards to put the Patriots in the Bills' red zone, and a 1-yard Eckel touchdown run on the first play of the fourth quarter gave the Patriots a 49-10 lead. On the second play of the Bills' next drive, Sanders forced a fumble by running back Dwayne Wright after a 5-yard reception, which Hobbs recovered and returned 35&#160;yards for the Patriots' eighth and final touchdown of the game. The Patriots' 56 points tied a franchise record, and were the most points scored by a road team in the NFL since 1973. Their 46-point scoring margin was also the second-largest in team history. The Patriots' 56-10 win brought their record to 10-0, the tenth time since 1970 a team started a season 10-0.

Mitchell Johnson, who plays for Australia, threw the ball that hit Virat on the head when he tried to avoid it. Virat's teammates from India quickly went to see if he was alright. Even though the Australian players were probably worried because of something sad that happened to another player named Philip Hughes, Greg Matthews thinks it is time to focus on the game and not worry so much.

Last week, the police ordered one of Google's cars to stop for driving too slowly on a public road. The car was not breaking any law, so no one was punished. Another American company, Tesla, added an \\"Autopilot\\" feature to its cars last month. With the Autopilot turned on, the vehicle drives itself. The car will speed up, slow down, _ and drive by itself. You can take over driving any time by turning the steering wheel or touching a pedal. The car uses sensors to know when driveway changing is safe and whether it should speed up or slow down. Tesla Autopilot is made for cross-country driving. It keeps you in the driveway and helps you avoid hitting other cars. It does not work well on local roads, for it will not stop at a red light or stop sign. Reporter Carolyn Nicander Mohr tried the Autopilot feature of a Tesla earlier this month. She had a hard time trusting the car to do what it should do. She thought about disabling the Autopilot feature many times during her trip. She wanted to take control at every bend in the road and hit the brake when the car in front of her slowed down.

Question: what sense do the eyes have Context: The brain is an organ that serves as the center of the nervous system in all vertebrate and most invertebrate animals. Only a few invertebrates such as sponges, jellyfish, adult sea squirts and starfish do not have a brain; diffuse or localised nerve nets are present instead. The brain is located in the head, usually close to the primary sensory organs for such senses as vision, hearing, balance, taste, and smell. The brain is the most complex organ in a vertebrate's body. In a typical human, the cerebral cortex (the largest part) is estimated to contain 15–33 billion neurons, each connected by synapses to several thousand other neurons. These neurons communicate with one another by means of long protoplasmic fibers called axons, which carry trains of signal pulses called action potentials to distant parts of the brain or body targeting specific recipient cells.

Context: After Alexander the Great's ventures in the Persian Empire, Hellenistic kingdoms were established throughout south-west Asia (Seleucid Empire, Kingdom of Pergamon), north-east Africa (Ptolemaic Kingdom) and South Asia (Greco-Bactrian Kingdom, Indo-Greek Kingdom). This resulted in the export of Greek culture and language to these new realms through Greco-Macedonian colonization, spanning as far as modern-day Pakistan. Equally, however, these new kingdoms were influenced by the indigenous cultures, adopting local practices where beneficial, necessary, or convenient. Hellenistic culture thus represents a fusion of the Ancient Greek world with that of the Near East, Middle East, and Southwest Asia, and a departure from earlier Greek attitudes towards \\"barbarian\\" cultures. The Hellenistic period was characterized by a new wave of Greek colonization (as distinguished from that occurring in the 8th–6th centuries BC) which established Greek cities and kingdoms in Asia and Africa. Those new cities were composed of Greek colonists who came from different parts of the Greek world, and not, as before, from a specific \\"mother city\\". The main cultural centers expanded from mainland Greece to Pergamon, Rhodes, and new Greek colonies such as Seleucia, Antioch, Alexandria and Ai-Khanoum. This mixture of Greek-speakers gave birth to a common Attic-based dialect, known as Koine Greek, which became the lingua franca through the Hellenistic world.

Please tell me if those questions are the same.","completion":"To address both questions in sequence and then determine if they are the same: 1. Rolling back from Lollipop to KitKat on Moto G 1st Generation (without rooting): Step 1: Backup data on the device Before downgrading, it's essential to back up critical data such as contacts, messages, photos, and videos. You can use built-in tools like Google Drive, your Moto G's default backup features, or third-party apps for this purpose. Step 2: Download KitKat firmware for Moto G Visit a reliable source to download the correct KitKat firmware for your Moto G 1st Generation. Ensure it matches your device model to avoid potential issues. Step 3: Install Motorola USB drivers To connect your device to a computer, you will need to install Motorola USB drivers on the computer. You can download the drivers from the official Motorola website. Step 4: Download and install ADB & Fastboot Android Debug Bridge (ADB) and Fastboot tools are essential for communication between your device and computer. You can download the Android SDK Platform Tools which include ADB and Fastboot from the official Android developer website. Step 5: Boot your Moto G into Fastboot mode Power off your device. Press and hold the volume down and power button simultaneously for a few seconds. Your device will boot into Fastboot mode. Step 6: Connect your Moto G to the computer Using the original USB cable, connect your Moto G to your computer. Step 7: Flash the KitKat firmware Open the folder where you downloaded the KitKat firmware and extract its contents. Similarly, open the folder containing ADB and Fastboot. Copy the extracted KitKat files into the ADB and Fastboot folder. Execute the flashing script (usually a .bat or .sh file) by double-clicking it. The flashing process will begin, and your device will be downgraded to KitKat. Step 8: Reboot your Moto G Once the flashing is completed, your Moto G will reboot automatically. Set up your device, and it will be running on KitKat. 2. Moto G3 (Moto G 3rd gen 2015) Android 7.0 (Nougat) update: Motorola officially announced that the Moto G3 would not receive the Android 7.0 Nougat update. However, custom ROMs are available for this device if you want to install Nougat unofficially. Conclusion: These questions are not the same. The first question is about downgrading the Moto G 1st generation from Lollipop to KitKat, while the second question asks about the availability of Android 7.0 (Nougat) update for the Moto G3 (Moto G 3rd gen 2015). They both concern Android software updates, but for different generations of the Moto G device and with different intentions (downgrading versus upgrading)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Select from the following. [A]. no. [B]. yes.","completion":"[B]. yes. The two questions are indeed paraphrases of each other, as they both ask about the cost of a trip from India to Tomorrowland. To provide a detailed and long answer to this question, we need to consider several factors, including flight and transportation costs, Tomorrowland ticket prices, accommodation, food and drink, and miscellaneous costs. 1. Flight and transportation costs: While the exact cost of flights may vary depending on the date, route, and airline, you can expect to pay anywhere between 500 and 1,500 for a round-trip flight from India to Belgium. Tomorrowland takes place in Boom, which is located between Antwerp and Brussels. In addition to your flight, you will need to factor in the cost of transportation from the airport to the festival grounds. This can be done using trains, buses, or taxis, with costs ranging from 20 to 100. 2. Tomorrowland ticket prices: Tomorrowland offers various ticket options, including day passes and multi-day passes. A day pass for the festival usually costs around 120, while a three-day pass can cost up to 360. Tickets tend to sell out quickly, so it's essential to purchase them as soon as they're available. You can also opt for a Global Journey package, which includes your Tomorrowland ticket, transportation, and accommodation, but will cost significantly more (starting at 1,000). 3. Accommodation: During Tomorrowland, Dreamville, the official festival campsite, provides a variety of accommodation options. Basic camping with your own tent starts at around 90 per person, while luxury tent or cabana options can cost anywhere between 400 and 2,500 per person. If camping isn't your style, you can look for hotels, hostels, or vacation rentals in the nearby area, with average prices ranging from 100 to 300 per night. 4. Food and drink: Inside the festival grounds, food and drink can be quite expensive. A meal may cost between 10 and 20, with drinks costing between 5 and 10 each. It’s essential to budget accordingly for the entire event, adding to the overall cost of your trip. However, you can save money by bringing some food and snacks with you, as well as refillable water bottles. 5. Miscellaneous costs: To fully enjoy the Tomorrowland experience, you'll want to set aside some money for souvenirs, such as merchandise, posters, or accessories. You might also need to budget for things like mobile data and roaming charges, travel insurance, and any sightseeing or cultural experiences you may want to indulge in during your time in Belgium. Taking all these factors into account, a realistic estimate for the total cost of a trip from India to Tomorrowland may range from 1,500 to 5,000 or more, depending on your personal preferences and the choices you make regarding transportation, accommodation, and other expenses. Planning ahead and researching your options thoroughly can help you find the best deals and make your Tomorrowland experience more affordable."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is because people from various professions and walks of life may exhibit similar behavior in certain situations. The premise indicates that the person visits bodies in a morgue, and this may be a common occurrence given the presented context. While it is true that priests often visit morgues to perform last rites or to provide spiritual comfort to the deceased and their loved ones, there are several other professions or roles which may involve such visits, such as coroners, morticians, forensic professionals, chaplains, and even family or friends of the deceased. The individual in question, referred to as \\"Brock,\\" also demonstrates a level of reverence for the deceased by saying a short prayer of mercy and forgiveness. Although this prayer may carry religious undertones, this in itself does not guarantee that he is a priest. People with strong religious beliefs or moral values may also feel compelled to express their emotions through prayer, regardless of their professional roles. Another crucial factor to consider is that the premise lacks specific information about Brock's attire or any clear indication of his religious affiliation. A mention of wearing vestments or a clerical collar, for instance, would have provided stronger evidence in support of the \\"priest\\" hypothesis. In conclusion, the given premise does not provide enough substantial evidence to definitively conclude that \\"He visits their bodies in the morgue because he is a priest.\\" One can only speculate or make assumptions based on the information provided.

News article: ROME --Former Pope Benedict XVI, who shocked the world by resigning in February, has reportedly revealed that God told him to do it during a \\"mystical experience.\\" The first pontiff to step down in six centuries, Benedict said, \\"God told me to,\\" when asked about his decision to dedicate himself to a life of prayer instead. The 86-year-old pope emeritus said he had not witnessed a vision of God but had undergone a months-long \\"mystical experience\\" during which God gave him the \\"absolute desire\\" to forge a deeper relationship with him. Benedict also said that the more he witnessed the \\"charisma\\" of his extremely popular successor, Pope Francis, the more he understood how his stepping aside was the \\"will of God.\\" The former pontiff's comments were reported by the Catholic news agency Zenit, which did not disclose to whom Benedict made the remarks. But the report was backed by a senior Vatican source. \\"The report seems credible -- it accurately explains the spiritual process that brought Benedict to resign,\\" the source told The Times. When announcing his resignation to cardinals on Feb. 11, Benedict had focused on his ill health, stating his strength \\"has deteriorated in me to the extent that I have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me.\\" Observers have also speculated that Benedict was demoralized both by the leaking of his personal correspondence by his butler and by the lobbying of an alleged group of gay clergy within the Vatican. Zenit reported that in the last six months, Benedict has received few visitors at the secluded house he now occupies in the Vatican's gardens. \\"During these meetings, the ex-pontiff does not comment, does not reveal secrets, does not make statements that could be understood as 'the words of the other pope,' but is as reserved as he has always been,\\" Zenit said. Francis last month joked about having two popes under one roof, telling reporters: \\"The last time there were two or three popes, they didn't talk among themselves and they fought over who was the true pope!\\" But having Benedict living in the Vatican, he added, \\"is like having a grandfather -- a wise grandfather -- living at home.\\" ALSO: Syria rebels say scores dead in poison-gas attack Mexico legislators seek to change freedom-of-information law Britain defends detaining the partner of Edward Snowden journalist ||||| \\"God told me to do it,\\" the 86-year-old former pontiff told a friend, six months after his decision to step down shocked the world's 1.2 billion Catholics. God had implanted in his heart the \\"absolute desire\\" to resign and to devote himself to a life of prayer and reflection, Benedict told the anonymous confidante, according to Zenit, a Rome-based Catholic news agency. \\"It was not because of any type of apparition or phenomenon of that sort,\\" he said, but instead the result of a \\"mystical experience\\" received during \\"a direct rapport with the Lord\\". He said the more he sees the \\"charisma\\" of Pope Francis, his successor, the more he is convinced that it was \\"the will of God\\" that he became the first pontiff in 600 years to resign. Francis, the former archbishop of Buenos Aires, has won huge popularity with his down-to-earth and direct style, renouncing many of the trappings of office, visiting a favela slum during his week-long trip to Brazil last month and calling for a \\"poor Church\\". The conversation between Benedict and the confidante took place in Mater Ecclesiae, the former convent within the walls of the Vatican that has been converted into a retirement home for the German former pope. Vatican sources confirmed the veracity of the report but declined to reveal the identity of the person that Benedict spoke to. \\"The report is reliable, without a doubt, although this is not an official Vatican statement or position,\\" an insider told The Daily Telegraph. Benedict surprised the world, including cardinals and close aides within the Vatican, when he unexpectedly announced his intention to resign on Feb 11. He made the announcement during a gathering of cardinals in the Vatican, choosing to deliver the bombshell in Latin. Many of the cardinals did not immediately understand what he had said, but the news was picked up by a sharp-eared correspondent from Ansa, the Italian news agency, who happened to be well versed in Latin and landed herself a worldwide scoop. Benedict, the former Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, left the Vatican for the last time as Pope just over two weeks later, flying off in a white helicopter to Castel Gandolfo, a hilltop castle outside Rome used as a papal retreat during the hot summer months. Pope Francis was elected as the first non-European pontiff in 1,300 years, and the first from the Americas, during a secret conclave of 115 cardinals in March. Benedict returned to live in the Vatican in May, saying that he would remain \\"hidden from the world\\", devoting the rest of his life to prayer and theological study. His remarks will do little to dampen speculation about the more worldly reasons for his departure. Although old and frail, he does not appear to be suffering from any specific illness, prompting speculation about his true motives. His papacy, which began in 2005, was mired in controversy, including scandals over paedophile priests in Catholic dioceses around the world, allegations of money laundering by the Vatican bank, and intrigue within the Curia, the powerful but secretive Vatican administration. It has been claimed that he was deeply hurt by the betrayal of his butler, Paolo Gabriele, who stole confidential Vatican documents and handed them to an Italian investigative journalist who published them in a bestselling book. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"So, kiddo, this is a story about a man named Pope Benedict XVI who was once a very important leader in the Church. Something a bit funny happened: he decided to stop being the Pope. He said that God told him to do this during a special kind of experience he calls \\"mystical\\". Because he loved God so much, he wanted to spend more time alone in prayer. Now, this hadn't happened in 600 years. Popes usually stay Popes until they go to Heaven. But Pope Benedict chose to step down. Many people think the new Pope, Pope Francis, is doing a wonderful job and Pope Benedict likes him a lot too. For the last six months, Pope Benedict has been living in a quiet house in the Vatican's gardens where he doesn't receive too many visitors. He spends his time praying and studying about God. Some people think there may be more reasons why he left his job, like being tired or sad about some problems in the Church, but Pope Benedict insists he left because God asked him to."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As the first openly gay player in major U.S. sports, he's also paying tribute to Matthew Shepard, the victim of one of the most infamous hate crimes in recent American history. Shepard, a gay University of Wyoming student, was beaten to death in 1998. \\"I was very fortunate to speak with Matthew's mother, Judy,\\" Collins told CNN's \\"Unguarded with Rachel Nichols.\\" \\"She had some great advice I don't think she would mind me sharing. Typically I like to keep private conversations private but her message was: 'Let the haters hate. Just keep living your life and keep going out there and being yourself.' \\" It's a powerful message and it's proving effective -- earlier this week Collins' No. 98 jersey became the best-selling in the NBA. Not bad when you consider that Collins -- who had been without a team after coming out at the end of last season -- has only signed a 10-day contract with the Nets. \\"It's really cool to see the support that's out there,\\" he said. \\"It's cool to see that people are going out there and buying the jersey and wearing it with pride. \\"So I hope that continues and I'll keep wearing the jersey and keep going out there and trying to do my job.\\" Collins has been doing his job since making his NBA debut in 2001. He spent seven years with the New Jersey Nets, the former name of his current employer, before going on to play for Memphis Grizzlies, Minnesota Timberwolves, Atlanta Hawks, Boston Celtics and Washington Wizards. The center's first game of 2014 couldn't have gone any better. The 35-year-old played 10 minutes during a 108-102 win at the Los Angeles Lakers -- his hometown team -- and was given a warm ovation by the Staples Center crowd. The reception he received is an indication of Collins' newfound prominence. Since coming out in a cover story for an issue of Sports Illustrated in April 2013, he has become part of a band of high-profile U.S. athletes who have gone public about their homosexuality -- and they have been supporting each other. U.S. international Robbie Rogers, who plays for Major League Soccer's Los Angeles Galaxy, announced he was gay two months before Collins. After telling the world about his sexuality, Collins went to Rogers for advice on how to handle the media. NFL prospect Michael Sam revealed he was gay this month after completing his college career. If drafted by a franchise, he will become the league's first openly gay player. \\"I've met some other athletes who are in the same position as I am,\\" explained Collins. \\"We're sort of like a fraternity just trying to help each other, just trying to keep inspiring each other, whether it be Robbie Rogers or Michael Sam, the list goes on and on. \\"And it's really great to you know hear each other's stories and keep inspiring each other to work,\\" added Collins, who was a guest of First Lady Michelle Obama at the State of the Union address in January. A free agent since July, Collins' determination to get back in the NBA was such that he went on a five-mile run the morning before his trip to the House of Representatives. \\"I've grown so much as an individual, I've come across so many great people, great organizations, heard so many great stories, inspiring stories,\\" he said. \\"I feel like with my actions I've had a positive impact on someone else's life.\\" While Collins' return to the NBA has been a success, it could well be short-lived. His temporary contract means he could be out of the league again by the end of next week, but he remains hopeful of extending his professional career. \\"You know anything can happen -- anything's possible,\\" he said. \\"You continue to work hard, that's what I did over the past 10 months ... Always having that positive mindset that good things will happen if you prepare for it. \\"It's the same environment. Everything is the same. Like I said before, 12 years in the NBA, not a problem, not an issue. Year 13, not a problem, not an issue, same old, same old.\\" For the man who is changing the face of the U.S. basketball, Collins is convinced everything looks just like it did before.

But the only thing that wasn't very fun about it was that he could catch many fish while I couldn't catch anything. I usually got pretty upset and kept asking him why. He always answered, \\"Son, if you want to catch a fish, you have to think like a fish\\", I remember being even more upset then because, \\"I'm not a fish!\\" I didn't know how to think like a fish. Besides, I reasoned, how could what I think influence what a fish does? As I got a little older I began to understand what my dad really meant. So, I read some books on fish. And I even joined the local fishing club and started attending the monthly meetings. I learned that a fish is a cold-blooded animal and therefore is very sensitive to water temperature. That is why fish prefer shallow water to deep water because the former is warmer. Besides, water is usually warmer in direct sunlight than in the shade. Yet, fish don't have any eyelids and the sun huts their eyes... The more I understood fish, the more I became effective at finding and catching them.. When I grew up and entered the business world, I remember hearing my first boss say, \\"We all need to think like sales people.\\" But it didn't completely make sense. My dad never once said, \\"If you want to catch a fish you need to think like a fisherman.\\" What he said was, \\"You need to think like a fish.\\" Years later, with great efforts to promote long-term services to people much older and richer than me, I gradually learned what we all need is to think more like customers. It is not an easy job. I will show you how in the following chapters. Question: Why was the author upset in fishing trips when he was nine? Answer: Choices: [+] He could not catch a fish. [+] His father was not patient with him. [+] His father did not teach him fishing. [+] He could not influence a fish as his father did.

His father's advice to \\"think like a fish\\" initially seemed unhelpful, as the young author did not know how to apply this concept and felt that his thoughts could not influence a fish's behavior. However, as he grew older and learned more about fish and their preferences, he began to understand his father's advice and used the knowledge to improve his fishing skills."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question 2: What is the difference between the cylindrical coordinate system and polar coordinate system? Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"Answer to Question 1: A cylindrical coordinate system is a three-dimensional coordinate system that is used to describe the position of a point in space using cylindrical coordinates. This system is particularly useful for solving problems related to cylindrical and symmetrical shapes, such as cylinders, cones, and spherical objects. The coordinates in this system are expressed as (r, θ, z), where: 1. r: The radial coordinate or distance from the origin to the point in the xy-plane. It is a non-negative real number. 2. θ: The azimuthal coordinate or polar angle, which represents the angle between the positive x-axis and the projection of the point onto the xy-plane. It is usually measured in degrees or radians and ranges from 0 to 2π (0 to 360 degrees). 3. z: The axial coordinate, which is the vertical distance from the origin to the point in space along the z-axis. It can be positive, negative, or zero depending on the position of the point above, below, or at the same level as the origin. The cylindrical coordinate system can represent any point in 3D space and is typically used in problems where cylindrical symmetry makes the mathematical formulation simpler and more convenient. Some common applications of this system are in fluid mechanics, electromagnetism, and heat transfer problems, where an object or domain exhibit this kind of symmetry. Answer to Question 2: The cylindrical coordinate system and the polar coordinate system are both coordinate systems that use radial and angular coordinates to describe the positions of points in space. However, there are some key differences between the two systems: 1. Dimensionality: The most significant difference between the two systems is their dimensionality. The polar coordinate system is a 2D coordinate system, whereas the cylindrical coordinate system is a 3D coordinate system. While the polar coordinate system only deals with points within a plane (typically the xy-plane), the cylindrical coordinate system can describe points anywhere within three-dimensional space. 2. Coordinate Set: In the polar coordinate system, points are described using two coordinates, (r, θ), whereas in the cylindrical coordinate system, points are described using three coordinates (r, θ, z). The polar coordinate system does not have any information about the position along the z-axis, while the cylindrical coordinate system takes that into account. 3. Applications: The polar coordinate system is often used for problems involving circular or radial symmetry in a plane, such as calculating the areas or volumes of circular shapes, solving problems in plane geometry, and analyzing wave patterns. On the other hand, the cylindrical coordinate system is applied to problems that involve cylindrical or axial symmetry, including electromagnetism, fluid mechanics, and heat transfer problems related to cylindrical or spherical objects. In summary, the answers to these two questions are not the same. The cylindrical coordinate system is a 3D coordinate system that uses radial, azimuthal, and axial coordinates to describe points in space, while the polar coordinate system is a 2D coordinate system that uses only radial and angular coordinates. They are used for different types of problems based on the nature of the symmetry involved in the problem."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. This provided a bigger, more dependable food supply. It also allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. Birth rates went up because there was more food and settled life had other advantages. Death rates also rose because of crowded living conditions and diseases that spread from domestic animals. Because the higher birth rates were matched by higher death rates, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago. His colleague Phil studied human settlement from 8-10,000 years ago. They were both fascinated by their findings. Which colleague studied that more people settled down in cities? Answer:","completion":"In order to answer this question, let's break down the information provided and relate it to the time periods studied by Brad and Phil. 1. Human beings invented agriculture about 10,000 years ago. 2. This development allowed people to settle down in villages and cities for the first time. 3. Birth and death rates increased, but overall, the human population continued to grow very slowly. Now, let's examine the time periods studied by Brad and Phil: - Brad studied ancient human settlements from 100,000 years ago, which is before the invention of agriculture (10,000 years ago). Since people started settling down in cities after the invention of agriculture, this suggests that during this time period, there were fewer people settling in cities. - Phil studied human settlements from 8 to 10,000 years ago. This period includes the invention of agriculture (10,000 years ago), leading to the rise of villages and cities. Considering the above points, we can conclude that Phil, who studied human settlements from 8 to 10,000 years ago, researched the time period when more people settled down in cities due to the invention of agriculture and the emergence of villages and cities."},{"prompt":"Given the task definition and input, reply with output.

Events presumably take place in 1884, a year named in one of the scenes. The action involves four men who live for pleasure, and takes place mostly in the light of oil lamps, giving the film a claustrophobic feel. Preparation and consumption of opium and tea occur more than once, and dishes of food are served and hot towels prepared in several scenes. We are introduced to the main characters, mainly the courtesans known as Crimson, Pearl, Emerald, Jasmine and Jade. Crimson belongs to Huifang Enclave (èè³é) brothel; Pearl and Jade to Gongyang Enclave (å¬é½é) brothel; Emerald lives at Shangren Enclave (å°ä»é) brothel; and Jasmine works at East Hexing Enclave (æ±åèé) brothel. The relationship between the wealthy patrons and the courtesans are semi-monogamous, frequently lasting many years. The courtesans are purchased at an early age by the owners of the brothels, otherwise known as \\"Aunties\\". In spite of the trappings of luxury and the wealth surrounding them, the graceful, well-bred courtesans live lives of slavery. Although there are only a few references to the courtesans being beaten, we are led to understand that there are frequent beatings for the girls and women with harsher Aunties and that beatings for perceived misbehaviour are common. Because of the oppressing social conventions, the best that the courtesans, known as \\"flower girls\\", can hope for is to pay off their debts some day (possible through a wealthy patron) or marry into a better social status. The silent Master Wang leaves the courtesan Crimson in favor of Jasmine, with whom he fell madly in love in only 10 days, after (allegedly) 2Â½ years with Crimson. He offers to settle Crimson's debts. Wang sees himself with multiple ties and between hardening fronts. The dependencies turn out to be reciprocal.

Others have fled the terror group because of fears they were to be used as “cannon fodder” or suicide bombers. Having to carry out “dull duties” and a lack of frontline action and was also blamed by some for them leaving, a report has found. At least 58 people have left the group since January last year but the true figure is likely to be far higher, the research by International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) concluded. They wanted to first experience fighting and enjoy the spoils of war before their final mission That figure is likely to be just a fraction of “those disillusioned, ready to defect, and or willing to go public\\", it found. Some of those who left were disappointed by the \\"quality of life\\" and were “typically among the ones who had joined the group for material and ‘selfish’ reasons, and quickly realized that none of the luxury goods and cars that they had been promised would materialize”. Power shortages and a lack of basic goods was also blamed while two said they left after hearing they were to be used as suicide bombers. “They wanted to first experience fighting and get an opportunity to enjoy the spoils of war before going on their final mission,” the report said. • French jihadists write home: 'My iPod's broken. I want to come back' • British jihadists now want to return home, say researchers For others their experience of combat “failed to meet their expectations of action and heroism”. IS is not the jihadist utopia that the group's videos promise The level of brutality against fellow Muslims and in-fighting were also raised as reasons for leaving. The report said the defections had been \\"sufficiently frequent to shatter IS's image as a united, cohesive and ideologically committed organisation\\". It added: \\"They demonstrate that IS is not the jihadist utopia that the group's videos promise; and that many of its own fighters have deep concerns about the group's strategy and tactics.\\" It suggested the pace of public defections was increasing with six in ten cases reported this year and a third in the three months to August.

The report stressed it \\"does not attempt to excuse, justify or glorify people's decision to join IS\\", adding that some are \\"likely to have committed crimes\\". However, it said: \\"They joined the most violent and totalitarian organisation of our age, yet they have also become its victims, and their stories can be used as potentially powerful tools in the fight against it.\\" ||||| Thinktank says states should encourage fighters to leave Isis by helping them to resettle, ensuring their safety and allowing them to speak out publicly Western governments have been urged by a terrorism thinktank to encourage fighters to defect from Islamic State with measures including offering them protection against reprisals. In a report published on Monday, the British-based International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence (ICSR) said that global lawmakers need to remove legal “disincentives” to those wishing to speak publicly about their newfound hostility to Isis, whose reach spreads across Syria, Iraq and parts of other countries around the world. Controversially, the King’s College London thinktank, which has been at the forefront of tracking the movement of jihadis from the UK and other countries to the Syrian civil war, also recommends that western governments encourage defectors to leave Isis-held territory and then protect them against reprisals. Entitled Victims, Perpetrators, Assets: the Narrative of Islamic State Defectors, the report says governments should “provide defectors with opportunities to speak out; assist them in resettlement and ensure their safety; and remove legal disincentives that prevent them from going public”. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Belgian father who went to Syria to help his Isis defector son return home – video Peter Neumann, ICSR director and the report’s author, said new legal frameworks had to be devised to support and encourage such defections. “It seems to me to be wrong that if someone is helping to deter people to join Isis by casting a negative light on the group, that he is then being punished for it,” Neumann said. “Right now, if you speak out, the prosecutor will say, ‘oh that’s very interesting, so he’s admitting membership of Isis, so we can prosecute him for that.’ So that needs to stop. “We’re not asking for the creation of legal incentives, saying ‘if you tell a nice story you get an amnesty,’ but people right now are being actively punished for speaking out and I think that needs to change. “Lawyers need to figure out a solution for that so people are no longer disincentivised for that.” Commenting on the report, the UK’s independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, David Anderson, said the Crown Prosecution Service already had the flexibility to deal with such issues. “Joining Isis or encouraging support for them is a serious terrorist offence, and should remain so. The fact that someone has defected, or provided useful intelligence, may already be taken into account in deciding whether it is in the public interest to prosecute an individual, or in passing sentence.” The ICSR lists 58 recorded incidents of public defections from Isis between January 2014 and August this year. While more than a third (21) of those have been Syrians and nearly a quarter from other parts of the Middle East, the ICSR says nine individuals from western Europe and Australia have given interviews to the media about their reasons for quitting the extremist group. Given the risks of prosecution, alienation and reprisal attacks from Isis, Neumann said that, although the motives for why people have come forward are undoubtedly varied, the narratives for leaving Isis are “pretty consistent” with four themes. Neumann said the main one centres around how “brutal Isis is towards the very people they are pretending to protect” – Sunni Muslims in the region. Other reasons for quitting, the report says, include that Isis is more interested in fighting fellow Sunni Muslim radicals, tribes and civil organisations than Syria’s Assad government, that it is “corrupt and un-Islamic” and that life under Isis “is harsh and disappointing”. The centre says the 58 defectors are likely to represent a much larger group who have yet to come out publicly. In August last year, one Briton who was too frightened to return to the UK, and whom ICSR did not record as a public defector, told researcher Shiraz Maher: “Muslims are fighting Muslims … Assad’s forgotten about. The whole jihad was turned upside down.” The report says that the defections, although limited in overall numbers, “have been sufficiently frequent to shatter Isis’s image as a united, cohesive and ideologically committed organisation”. It adds that the pace of public defections has increased in recent months: almost 60% of the cases were reported in the first eight months of 2015, 17 of which appeared this summer. Neumann said the study should have implications for western counter-extremism policy. “None of the defectors talk about Christians or Yazidis being executed, they don’t care about that. The brutality they are outraged about is brutality against Sunnis.” He said that though it might not be the most encouraging finding, policymakers had to accept that hardened radicals weren’t going to convert to liberal humanitarianism. “If you want to stop people from joining Isis, there’s no point in showing pictures of ethnic and religious minorities being persecuted. Maybe you have to start talking about how Isis is actually bad to Sunnis. Maybe that will have more of an effect.” ||||| ICSR Report – Victims, Perpetrators, Assets: The Narratives of Islamic State Defectors 18/09/2015 Victims, Perpetrators, Assets: The Narratives of Islamic State Defectors The full report can be downloaded HERE. Much has been written about the young men and women who join the Islamic State. We are familiar with their biographies and pathways, backgrounds and motivations. But virtually nothing is known about those who quit: the ‘defectors’ who didn’t like what they saw, abandoned their comrades, and fled the Islamic State. Yet their stories could be key to stopping the flow of foreign fighters, countering the group’s propaganda, and exposing its lies and hypocrisy. For a short paper, ICSR collected all published stories about people who have left the Islamic State and spoken about their defection. We discovered a total of 58 – a sizable number but probably only a fraction of those who are disillusioned or ready to leave. The Defectors They are a new and growing phenomenon. Of the 58 cases, nearly two thirds of the defections took place in the year 2015. One third happened during the summer months alone. The defectors’ experiences are diverse. Not everyone has become a fervent supporter of liberal democracy. Some may, in fact, have committed crimes. They were all, at some point, enthusiastic supporters of the most violent and viciously totalitarian organization of our age. Yet they are now its worst enemies. The quality of their testimony varies, and the precise circumstances and reasons for leaving IS aren’t always clear. What convinced me that, as a whole, their stories are credible is how consistent their messages were. The Narratives Among the 58 defectors, we found four narratives that were particularly strong: 1) One of the most persistent criticisms was the extent to which the group is fighting against other Sunni rebels. According to the defectors, toppling the Assad regime didn’t seem to be a priority, and little was done to help the (Sunni) Muslims who were targeted by it. Most of the group’s attention, they said, was consumed by quarrels with other rebels and the leadership’s obsession with ‘spies’ and ‘traitors’. This was not the kind of jihad they had come to Syria and Iraq to fight. 2) Another narrative dealt with the group’s brutality. Many complained about atrocities and the killing of innocent civilians. They talked about the random killing of hostages, the systematic mistreatment of villagers, and the execution of fighters by their own commanders. None of the episodes they mentioned involved minorities, however. Brutality didn’t seem to be a universal concern: it was seen through a sectarian lens, and caused outrage mostly when its victims were other Sunnis. 3) The third narrative was corruption. Though none believed that corruption was systemic, many disapproved of the conduct of individual commanders and ‘emirs’. Syrian defectors criticized the privileges that were given to foreigners, for which they claimed was no justification based on the group’s philosophy or Islam in general. While many were willing to tolerate the hardships of war, they found it impossible to accept instances of unfairness, inequality, and racism. “This is not a holy war”, said a defector from India, whom the group had forced to clean toilets because of his color of skin. 4) A fourth narrative was that life under the Islamic State was harsh and disappointing. The defectors who expressed this view were typically the ones who had joined the group for ‘selfish’ reasons – and who quickly realized that none of the luxury goods and cars that they had been promised would materialize. For others, their experience in combat didn’t live up to their expectations of action and heroism. One of them referred to his duties as ‘dull’ and complained about the lack of deployments, while another claimed that foreign fighters were ‘exploited’ and used as cannon fodder. Why This Matters These stories matter. The defectors’ very existence shatters the image of unity and determination that the group seeks to convey. Their narratives highlight the group’s contradictions and hypocrisies. Their example may encourage others to follow, and their credibility can help deter wannabes from joining. In my view, governments and civil society should recognize the defectors’ value and make it easier for them to speak out. Where possible, governments should assist them in resettlement and ensure their safety. They also need to remove legal disincentives that prevent them from going public. Not every defector is a saint, and not all of them are ready or willing to stand in the public spotlight. But their voices are strong and clear: ‘The Islamic State is not protecting Muslims. It is killing them’. They need to be heard. The full report can be downloaded HERE This is an abridged version of a story at CNN.com.

Article: Newfoundlanders who want to keep at least one of two giant blue whales that washed ashore on the west coast of the island may get their wish. The man leading the Royal Ontario Museum’s effort to dismember and transport those remains to Toronto says he must review plans to handle both carcasses. “My commitment when I came in was to do at least one whale and my hope is to do both of them,” Mark Engstrom, deputy director of collections and research for the museum, said during a break from the huge, smelly job. “We’re doing the Trout River whale and then I have to reassess my budget and see where I am in terms of whether or not I can actually do the Rocky Harbour whale,” he said. “I’ve incurred a few expenses that I hadn’t expected so it’s going to be tight to do both whales.” Those extra costs include towing the first carcass from Trout River to adjacent Woody Point where it could more easily be worked on, Engstrom said. The second body is still resting in shallow water near the Rocky Harbour fish plant in Gros Morne National Park. They are among nine rare and endangered whales that became trapped in pack ice earlier this spring. It’s believed they were either crushed or drowned as they tried to surface to breathe. Removing pieces of bone. This one is a piece of the spinal cord. @romtoronto #bluewhale http://t.co/NWktYM92gE — (@ROMBiodiversity) May 09, 2014 Rocky Harbour Mayor Walter Nicolle had expressed relief when the museum offered to add the whales to its collection and make scientific data available to global researchers. Local officials had raised concerns about health hazards and the impact on crucial tourism if the carcasses were left to rot. “We’re only a small town,” Nicolle said earlier this month. “We don’t have a budget large enough to take care of that whale.” But Engstrom, who has dealt with the remains of several other whale species, said even he was surprised at the huge challenge posed by the biggest animal on the planet. Squawking sea gulls feasted Sunday as Engstrom’s team of museum staff and several local men used flensing knives to remove tonnes of blubber and skeletal muscle from the 23-metre female whale. She is now exposed past her enormous rib cage as her bones are removed, labelled and stored in an 18-wheel truck. The stench has been powerful enough at times that even seasoned fishermen have gagged. Woody Point Mayor Ken Thomas approved the messy project as long as it was done in five days, ending Monday. He doubts the community of 300 could have taken on such a task alone. “Looking at the magnitude of the job and getting to understand the skill sets that are required, it’s highly unlikely that this could have been done with a local effort. “The cost is certainly piling up.” Engstrom declined to discuss budget details. But he had said in an earlier interview that expenses to be absorbed by the museum would reach tens of thousands of dollars and he hoped they wouldn’t exceed 100,000. Local businesswoman Jenny Parsons is part of the new Trout River Blue Whale Committee that wants to establish its own exhibit. The idea that both whales would go to Ontario was seen by many residents as a lost opportunity. But as the federal government passed responsibility to the province and provincial officials stayed quiet, the museum stepped in. “It’s this once-in-a-lifetime event and we would hope and keep our fingers crossed that nothing like this ever happens to the blue whale population ever again,” Parsons said in an interview. “But I believe from the tragic event there can be a very positive outcome for this, not only for the Royal Ontario Museum but also for the town of Trout River. “With the fishery dying more each day, and with the cutbacks that government is giving us, this blue whale exhibit in the enclave of a national park could be nothing but a positive thing for this little town.” The big question is who would pay to take responsibility for the second whale. Parsons’ group hasn’t got to that point yet. They want to start a non-profit corporation and see about raising funds and resources. Northwest Atlantic blue whales are endangered with an estimated population of just 250 before the nine known deaths. ||||| It’s been a tough, awe-inspiring and stinky operation – and by the time it’s over, the biggest animal to grace the Earth will be packed into travel-sized parts on an unlikely journey across Canada. Workers expect to complete the transformation of a blue whale from sea-dwelling leviathan to highway cargo on Tuesday, the latest chapter in a tragic and curious tale that has travelled the globe. The dead whale was one of nine caught in unusually heavy sea ice this spring, and one of two to wash ashore in Newfoundland. Towed by trawler from the community of Trout River to Woody Point, it is being dissected by a team headed by Mark Engstrom, an evolutionary biologist at the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. The task of carving and dismantling a whale carcass is not simple – workers have faced hail, cold, marauding seagulls and a stench described at best as gut-wrenching – but Mr. Engstrom sees the exercise as being all in the service of science. He is collecting the bones as well as tissue samples to make them available for researchers. “It is a positive from the tragedy of the death,” he said Monday while taking a break from the job. “It’s very unfortunate that the whales died, but we’re trying to get as much information as we can out of this animal, so that it comes to some good use.” Beheld, the blue whale is an animal of superlatives. It can stretch to 30 metres and weigh up to 180 tonnes. Its tongue is as heavy as an entire elephant, its heart as hefty as a car. On Monday, the team was taking apart the last part of the beast’s skeleton – the skull, which is so large it will probably require its own transport truck. “The animal is absolutely gigantic. I’m awed by the physical size,” said Mr. Engstrom, who should know – he more typically studies mice and bats. On Monday, Mr. Engstrom had also stripped the carcass of a blood vessel. “I could put my head inside of it,” he said over the phone. “And I have a big head.” The fate of the second beached whale remains uncertain. Mr. Engstrom says he is likely to know by Tuesday whether he will have the funds to relocate and dismantle the animal, which is in the town of Rocky Harbour. He said he has come up against “unexpected” costs, including the towing operation from Trout River and the price of burying the whale blubber in a local landfill. Each specimen is considered a gift to researchers. Only about 250 blue whales remain in the North Atlantic, the remnants of a once-thriving population devastated by whaling. The nine whales killed this year represent about 5 per cent of the entire North Atlantic population, Mr. Engstrom said. “Blue whales are extremely rare. The population just hasn’t been recovering,” he said. “I think we really have to be super careful about anything that we introduce into their environment, because we might lose them. We can’t assume that they’ll be okay.” Ultimately, Mr. Engstrom, deputy director of collections and research at the ROM, would like to see the whale skeleton put on display at the museum. (That possibility remains in the distant future, since it takes years to fully strip the skeleton.) Transporting the Earth’s largest animal across a portion of the world’s second-largest country was never going to be easy. Each bone is being loaded by front-end loader into a tractor trailer and wrapped in plastic. The tissue samples, meanwhile, will travel in liquid nitrogen by plane. But Mr. Engstrom considers the undertaking a fitting reflection of the nation. “Whales are very iconic for Canada. We have three coasts, and there are whales on each of them,” he said. “They’re something Canadians can relate to.” |||||Summary:","completion":"The Royal Ontario Museum may fulfill the wish of Newfoundlanders to keep at least one of the two giant blue whales that washed ashore on the west coast of the island. As the museum works to dismember and transport the remains of these whales to Toronto, the man leading the effort, Mark Engstrom, deputy director of collections and research for the museum, must review plans to handle both carcasses. Engstrom hopes to do both, but budget constraints and unexpected expenses may make it difficult to do so. The museum offered to add the whales to its collection and make scientific data available to global researchers. However, handling the remains of the biggest animal on the planet poses a huge challenge, even for seasoned experts. Local businesspeople have formed the Trout River Blue Whale Committee to establish their own exhibit, hoping to turn the tragic event into a positive one for the town and the Royal Ontario Museum."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: The financial crisis is reminding Americans of a lesson they first learned in childhood: Share and share alike. They are sharing or swapping tools and books, cars and handbags, time and talent. The renewed desire to share shows up in a variety of examples: A car-sharing service has had a 70 percent membership increase since the crisis occurred. Some companies encouraged his employees to take vanpooling. Governments are putting bikes on the street for public use. How-to-swap Web sites are increasing quickly. The economy reflects the way Americans have cut back, especially on daily items: Department store sales dropped 1.3 percent in June. People are not buying cars, and as a result, auto sales dropped 27.7 percent last month. They are not paying others to do what they can do themselves -- Home Depot reports increased attendance at in-store do-it-yourself clinics. And although paint sales are down in general, according to Sherwin-Williams, individual consumers are still buying. When Tom Burdett needed to cut some tiles at his home outside Annapolis, he refused to buy expensive tools. So he asked his neighbors and friends for help. Sure enough, someone had just what he needed. And when that friend needed help fixing a satellite dish, Burdett volunteered to help. The sharing mind-set is not new to the American culture, but many Americans give it up when the nation changed from an agricultural society to an industrial one, said Rosemary Hornak, a psychology professor at Meredith College in Raleigh, N.C. They moved farther from their families and did not have time to connect with new neighbors because they worked so much, she said. Neighborhood conversations tell more of the story as the movement grows organically in communities across the Washington region and the nation.

Question: suppose the soil is more nutritious happens, how will it affect MORE erosion by the ocean. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"If the soil becomes more nutritious, it could potentially lead to more plant growth along the coast. As a result, this increased vegetation might provide some protection against erosion by the ocean due to the plant roots stabilizing the soil and reducing the direct impact of the waves. However, the overall effect of more nutritious soil on the erosion process is complex and depends on various factors such as the type of vegetation, the slope of the coast, and the intensity of the waves. In the context of the process described, the second effect mentioned is the energy of the waves pushing water and sediment. If more nutritious soil leads to greater plant growth, which in turn offers some protection against erosion, the direct impact of the waves on the coast may be reduced. This means that the wave energy might have less effect on pushing sediment and eroding the coast. So, considering these factors, it is likely that more nutritious soil might have a protective effect against coastal erosion, leading to less influence of the wave energy on sediment movement and a decrease in erosion by the ocean.

Q: CONTEXT: 11 de mayo de 2005 11 de mayo de 2005Bogotá, Colombia — Una verdadera tormenta política se ha desatado desde el pasado fin de semana, cuando sectores políticos cercanos al presidente Álvaro Uribe Vélez hicieron públicas las intenciones del mandatario colombiano de crear un partido con miras a las elecciones legislativas y presidenciales de 2006. En la actualidad, la ley que reformaría la Constitución para permitir la reelección presidencial inmediata, aprobada por el Congreso en diciembre pasado, pasa por el examen de la Corte Constitucional, cuyo fallo se espera para mediados del año. Con el 70% de popularidad según algunas encuestas, Uribe tendría prácticamente asegurada la reelección, pues además no existe por el momento ningún candidato que le haga contrapeso. Uribe tendría esta semana un encuentro con el grupo de parlamentarios que lo apoya, con el fin de crear un partido que tenga como objetivo preservar y continuar con su programa político. El movimiento sería la mayor disidencia del Partido Liberal de Colombia. Un asesor del gobierno declaró que \\"la creación del partido uribista tiene como propósito prolongar en el tiempo las banderas del actual Presidente e, inclusive, es una especie de seguro en caso de que la Corte Suprema de Justicia rechace una reciente ley aprobada por el Congreso que autoriza la reelección\\", mientras que Juan Manuel Santos, ex ministro y autor de la iniciativa afirmó que \\"el presidente Uribe encarna una serie de ideales de mediano y largo plazos y lo mejor es concretarlos y cristalizarlos alrededor de un proyecto político. El país no puede perder la posibilidad de seguir contando con este presidente\\". Uribe es apoyado principalmente por un sector disidente del liberalismo y el sector oficial del conservatismo, mientras que la oposición la ejerce el sector oficial del liberalismo, de tendencia centro-izquierdista, y el Polo Democrático Independiente, de izquierda, partido que posee en la actualidad la alcaldía de Bogotá, que ejerce Luis Eduardo Garzón. De hecho, Uribe llegó a la presidencia en 2002 sin el apoyo de su antiguo partido. En este momento, el uribismo se encuentra disperso en varios movimientos, como Cambio Radical, Colombia Democrática, Colombia Viva y Nuevo Partido, entre otros. La oposición ha pedido garantías en caso de que la reelección se apruebe y exige que sea el Estado el que financie la campaña de todos los candidatos, incluido Uribe. Además del liberal Alfonso Gómez Méndez, se encuentra en la baraja de candidatos y precandidatos el conservador Álvaro Leyva Durán, mientras que el Polo Democrático Independiente definirá su candidato en el congreso del partido, que se celebrará a comienzos de junio. Samuel Moreno Rojas, nieto del ex presidente Gustavo Rojas Pinilla; Antonio Navarro, ex militante de la guerrilla del M-19, desmovilizada a finales de los 80; y Guillermo Alfonso Jaramillo, ex gobernador del departamento del Tolima, son los opcionados por el movimiento de izquierda. El presidente del Partido Liberal, Juan Fernando Cristo, declaró a Caracol Televisión: \\"Sería bueno saber qué opina el Procurador General (encargado de vigilar que los funcionarios públicos no intervengan en política) de reuniones en Palacio para organizar partidos políticos en Colombia. Crece la audiencia en Palacio; Uribe cita a los congresistas, no para hablar de los problemas del país, sino para organizar reelecciones y organizar listas de candidatos al Congreso. Si eso no es intervención del presidente en política, sinceramente no sé qué es\\". Por su parte, el ex Fiscal General Alfonso Gómez Méndez, liberal que ya hizo públicas sus aspiraciones presidenciales, dijo que \\"estas son calenturas que de pronto no tienen mucho éxito. Esta disidencia estará basada en razones burocráticas y no programáticas y ello los llevará al fracaso\\". La embajadora de Colombia en España y ex candidata presidencial Noemí Sanín, habría comentado en una comida con el ex presidente César Gaviria que \\"se haga o no se haga partido, participe yo en él o no participe, estaré al lado del presidente Uribe, porque el país necesita otros cuatro años de seguridad democrática\\". Según el diario colombiano El Tiempo (propiedad de la familia del actual vicepresidente), Sanín relanzó la idea de la reelección de Uribe el año anterior. Horacio Serpa, contendor de Uribe en las elecciones de 2002 y líder natural del liberalismo oficialista, declaró en un comunicado que \\"la criatura cuenta con padre conocido y el padrinazgo de la cuestionada clase política parlamentaria, incluso de los voceros de los paramilitares en trance de desmovilización, y del Partido Conservador. Su nacimiento tiene felices a quienes sueñan con perpetuarse en el poder, pero mantiene en pie de lucha a los que defienden la Constitución y la vigencia de la democracia y los derechos humanos\\". Existe una polémica acerca de los supuestos vínculos entre los paramilitares de las Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia y Uribe, quien sostiene un proceso de paz con uno de los sectores de ese movimiento armado. A comienzos de abril, el ex presidente liberal Alfonso López Michelsen propuso una campaña antirreeleccionista y denunció que probablemente los paramilitares presionen, especialmente a los habitantes de zonas rurales, para votar por Uribe y sus partidarios. Hasta se acusa a ciudadanos de Estados Unidos de apoyar indirectamente a los paramilitares, gracias a hechos como la reciente detención de dos soldados norteamericanos que negociaban clandestinamente armas originalmente donadas por el gobierno estadounidense para el Plan Colombia. En declaraciones al semanario El Espectador, el ministro del Interior y Justicia Sabas Pretelt de la Vega dijo que \\"eso del Partido Uribista es un cuentazo. El Gobierno solo está escuchando cómo se están organizando algunos congresistas para sacar adelante la legislatura y cómo piensan salir adelante en el mediano y largo plazo\\", afirmación con la que pretende 'bajarle el tono' a la discusión, y negó la participación del mandatario en política: \\"Si el Presidente decide participar en la campaña electoral, tendrá que hacerlo de acuerdo a lo que estipule la Ley estatutaria y nuestra propuesta es que sea cuatro meses antes de las elecciones\\". Durante esta semana se debate en el Congreso la reforma al Código Electoral, que pretende hacer algunos cambios a las elecciones. Entre otras modificaciones, se ampliaría en una hora la jornada electoral -que sería ahora de 07:00 a 16:00-. La ley ha tenido un debate difícil, debido al simultáneo debate en torno a la ley de garantías por parte de la oposición para que el presidente y los demás candidatos que se presenten se aproximen a la igualdad de condiciones durante la época electoral. De hecho, este martes se suspendió el debate pues no iba a ser transmitido por televisión, ya que las cámaras se encontraban operando en otro salón del Congreso. Los opositores de Uribe han hecho referencia a la que consideran excesiva aparición en los medios: todos los fines de semana, Uribe realiza los llamados consejos comunales, transmitidos generalmente los sábados por uno de los dos canales públicos, y que suelen durar seis horas o más. Los detractores del mandatario afirman que dichos consejos comunales son utilizados por Uribe para \\"hacer campaña\\" con anterioridad a las elecciones. Las próximas elecciones legislativas serán en marzo de 2006, mientras que la primera vuelta de las presidenciales será en mayo del próximo año. Si ningún candidato logra la mayoría absoluta, la segunda vuelta se realizaría en junio. QUESTION: ¿Qué texto se discute esta semana en el Parlamento?

Mohnke A:","completion":"Title: The Unraveling of Mohnke Genre: Historical Drama, War, Thriller Setting: Eastern Front during World War II, 1945 Plot: Act 1: The movie begins with a panoramic view of a war-torn Eastern Front during the height of World War II. We are introduced to Wilhelm Mohnke (played by Michael Fassbender), a high-ranking SS officer and a trusted confidant of Adolf Hitler, who is tasked with commanding the Red Army's battle-hardened troops on the Eastern Front. Mohnke is known for his strict discipline and ruthless tactics, which have brought both victories and controversy. His soldiers respect him for his leadership, while others view him as a war criminal. During a strategic planning session with his fellow officers, Mohnke receives an anonymous letter, claiming that someone within his ranks has been secretly reporting key military information to the Red Army. Alarmed by this potential threat, Mohnke launches a secret investigation to unmask the traitor and protect his troops and his reputation. Act 2: As the German offensive begins to stall against the Red Army's fierce resistance, Mohnke becomes increasingly obsessed with finding the informant. He starts to suspect everyone around him, becoming increasingly paranoid and distant from his loyal officers and troops. Simultaneously, a mysterious female Soviet spy (played by Jessica Chastain) is introduced. She is responsible for transmitting key military information from the German forces back to the Red Army. The Soviet spy is shown to be highly skilled and is only known by her code name, \\"The Red Falcon.\\" Meanwhile, Mohnke's efforts to uncover the traitor lead him to an underground resistance group of German soldiers who oppose the SS's ruthless tactics and the Nazi regime itself. The group, led by a young soldier named Dietrich (played by Robert Pattinson), is secretly providing information to the Red Army in hopes of bringing an end to the destructive war. Act 3: As Mohnke closes in on the identity of the informant, he increasingly sympathizes with the resistance group's cause, becoming disillusioned with the SS and the war. With the Soviet forces entering Germany, Mohnке faces an internal struggle between his loyalty to the regime and his newfound belief in Dietrich's cause. In a thrilling climax, Mikhail, a Soviet spy (played by Oscar Isaac), discovers \\"The Red Falcon\\" is about to be captured by the SS. Mikhail manages to help her escape before she can be apprehended and believes that she is the one who reports to the Red Army. In an unexpected twist, it is revealed that the real informant is Mohnke himself. As the war reaches its end, Mohnke's conscience has led him to secretly collaborate with the resistance group and provide vital information to the Red Army. Conclusion: As the Soviet forces march into Berlin, Mohnke is captured and faces trial for his actions during the war. Despite the evidence against him, Dietrich testifies that Mohnke was vital in helping the resistance group and ultimately the Red Army to win the war. Wilhelm Mohnke faces a moral victory, even as his life is left in the hands of the court. The movie ends with a somber reflection on the human cost of war and the power of individual beliefs to change the course of history. The Unraveling of Mohnke is a thrilling historical drama, capturing the volatile nature of war, where loyalties are tested, and alliances are formed in the unlikeliest of places. The film explores moral dilemmas and the complexities of human nature in a time of extreme adversity, leaving the audience questioning the true meaning of loyalty and honor."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here are possible answers to this question: - exhaustion - tiredness - sneezing - order - make money I believe the correct choice is \\"sneezing\\", here's why: The answer is:","completion":"Sneezing, here's why: When you engage in house cleaning, even for just a short period, you're likely to encounter various allergens, such as dust, pet dander, and mold spores. These allergens are commonly found in homes and can become airborne as you clean surfaces, clean furniture, or even just move around. Sneezing is a natural reflex action that occurs when the nasal passages become irritated due to the presence of allergens or irritants. When you sneeze, you forcefully expel air from your lungs through your nose and mouth, which helps remove the offending particles and clear the nasal passages. In this context, sneezing during house cleaning is a beneficial response of the body to protect itself from possible irritants. While exhaustion and tiredness are possible outcomes of house cleaning, these are less likely to occur if you are only cleaning for a short time. House cleaning can be physically demanding, but it typically takes longer periods of work for fatigue or exhaustion to set in. Order is another possible result of house cleaning, as you'll be organizing, decluttering, and tidying up your home. However, depending on how disorganized your home is to begin with, achieving a significant level of order may require more than just a short period of cleaning. Furthermore, order in this context is not something that \\"happens to you\\" personally, but rather it's a state created in the environment around you. As for making money, this is unlikely to happen as a direct consequence of your house cleaning efforts, unless you are a professional cleaner and have been hired to clean someone else's home. Even in that scenario, the act of house cleaning is a service being provided, and the payment you receive is compensation for your work, rather than something that happens to you as a direct result of the cleaning process. In conclusion, among the options listed, sneezing is the most probable outcome when you're engaged in house cleaning for a short time. It's a natural, protective response that helps you expel dust and allergens from your nasal passages. Other outcomes such as exhaustion or tiredness are less likely within a short time frame, and while order is a possible result of your actions, it isn't something that personally happens to you. Lastly, making money is not a direct consequence of cleaning, but rather a possible outcome if you are a paid professional cleaner."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A 2004 Cornell University study showed that while 2.5 percent of murderers convicted nationwide were sentenced to the death penalty, in Nevada 6 percent were given the death penalty. Texas gave 2 percent of murderers a death sentence, less than the national average. Texas, however, executed 40 percent of those sentenced, which was about four times higher than the national average. California had executed only 1 percent of those sentenced.","completion":"Title: \\"Disparities in Death Penalty Application and Execution Rates Across Jurisdictions: A Comparative Analysis\\" Step 1: Identifying the main idea The main idea of the article is the differences in death penalty application and execution rates among various jurisdictions. Step 2: Creating a concise title To create a concise title, I would focus on the core concept, which is the disparities in death penalty rates. Using words such as \\"Disparities\\" or \\"Comparative Analysis\\" would convey this concept effectively. Step 3: Adding context To add context to the title, I would mention the subject of the study, which is death penalty application and execution rates. This would make it clear what the article is about. Step 4: Finalizing the title Combining the elements from the previous steps, I have come up with the title \\"Disparities in Death Penalty Application and Execution Rates Across Jurisdictions: A Comparative Analysis.\\" This title captures the main idea, provides context, and conveys the article's focus on comparing rates among different jurisdictions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read the following paragraph and determine if the hypothesis is true: The 1960 Gator Bowl was a college football bowl game between the Southwest Conference (SWC) co-champion Arkansas Razorbacks and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets representing the Southeastern Conference (SEC). Arkansas defeated Georgia Tech, 14–7, in front of 45,104 spectators. There were two players named Most Valuable Player: Jim Mooty of Arkansas and Maxie Baughan of Georgia Tech.

The paragraph provides information about the teams playing, the score, the number of spectators, and the most valuable players. However, there is no mention of the Gator Bowl's location.

Sentence 2: Aramaic , however , remains a spoken , literary and liturgical language for local Christians and also some Jews . Do these two sentences convey the same information?","completion":"Yes, these two sentences convey the same information but with a slightly different structure. Both sentences state that Aramaic continues to be a spoken, literary, and liturgical language for local Christians and some Jews. The main difference between the two sentences is the placement of the conjunctive adverb \\"however.\\" In Sentence 1, \\"However\\" is placed at the beginning of the sentence, indicating that it is contrasting or adding some information to a previously mentioned idea or statement. This usage of \\"however\\" serves as a transition between two ideas or statements, emphasizing a contrast or an exception. Sentence 2 also uses \\"however\\" to convey contrast, but it is placed after \\"Aramaic,\\" with a comma separating the two. This placement of \\"however\\" gives it a similar function as in the first sentence, but with a more subtle emphasis on the contrast. The pause created by the comma before and after \\"however\\" highlights the element of contrast. Apart from the differing placement of the adverb \\"however,\\" both sentences have identical content and convey the same meaning. They indicate that Aramaic, despite any possible assumptions or previous statements to the contrary, remains in use as a spoken, literary, and liturgical language for local Christians and some Jews."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

More precisely, the emergency room phoned to ask if Ray had a bed. Ray pretended to consult his admission log, just as he always did. The nightly hospital call meant one of three things: the chemical dependency floor was full (highly unlikely), the individual in question had fallen under the hospital's \\"one treatment episode every three months\\" sanction (also known as the Black List, and only moderately unlikely), or the prospective client had no insurance (in Ray's experience, very likely). The folks at the hospital knew, as did Ray, that federal law prohibited him from turning away individuals requesting detoxification services if he had an open bed. The hospital was generous enough to spring for a cab voucher for the intoxicate. In Ray's experience as well, overnight admissions were less interested in detox than in free food, a free bed and complimentary meds. For his two hour paperwork investment and aggravation, he would receive the benefit of knowing the client slept until noon then slipped out the side door and into another binge. Any bills for service generated for the brief stay would return in a week or so stamped \\"No Such Address\\" or simply \\"Return to Sender\\". On average, the clients of addictions services managed to muster a raging 25% of them who would ever pay a dime toward their bill. The night shift admission payment percentages were a quarter of that quarter in good years. Thus, the frequent calls from the hospital. They had little better luck in getting good addresses (or even with those, a client who stayed sober long enough to give a shit). No one relished treating the uninsured and uninsurable. It was fiscal suicide. The hospital was perfectly willing to let the local experts in deadbeats handle the workload. Tonight, Ray could tell them no.

Write an article that answers the following question: Which team scored the first touchdown?","completion":"Title: Unraveling the Mystery: Which Team Scored the First Touchdown? Introduction: In the world of competitive sports, it's always exciting to look back at history and identify the trailblazers who have reached major milestones. In American football, one of the most memorable milestones would be the first-ever touchdown. We will dive into the intriguing history of the sport and endeavor to unlock the mystery of which team scored the first touchdown. Step 1: Investigate the origins of American football To determine which team scored the first touchdown, it is crucial to understand how the modern sport of American football originated. American football has its roots in the traditional games of rugby and soccer. In the early 19th century, various versions of football evolved in universities across the United States. Step 2: Identify the point when the evolution of modern American football began The first official rules of football, resembling rugby, were established in 1873 through a convention among representatives of Columbia, Harvard, Princeton, and Yale. Walter Camp, also known as the \\"Father of American Football,\\" further developed the game by proposing key rule changes, eventually transforming it into the sport we know today. Step 3: Identify the first games played under modern American football rules Once we understand the evolution of American football rules, we can pinpoint the first games that were played under these rules. The first intercollegiate football game under modern rules occurred between Princeton and Rutgers on November 6, 1869, which predates the key rule changes proposed by Camp. Thus, we must look further than this game to find the first touchdown. Step 4: Examine the game where touchdowns were officially introduced One of the significant rule changes proposed by Camp was the introduction of the touchdown in 1882. Before this, the primary method of scoring was through \\"touchdowns in goal,\\" which involved kicking the ball through the goal. Therefore, to uncover the team that scored the first touchdown, we must examine games played after the 1882 rule change. Step 5: Research the games following the 1882 rule change The first college games held under the new rules, which included the scoring of touchdowns, took place in the fall of 1882. Yale and Wesleyan played a game on October 25, 1882, with Yale scoring the first touchdown. However, it's important to note that some sources claim that Stevens Institute of Technology and College of the City of New York played an unofficial game in April 1882, during which Stevens scored the first touchdown. Due to the unofficial nature of this game, the first valid touchdown is widely recognized to be during the October Yale-Wesleyan game. Conclusion: After effectively investigating the origins and evolution of American football, we have successfully unraveled the mystery of which team scored the first touchdown. The first officially recognized touchdown was scored by Yale during their game against Wesleyan on October 25, 1882.

Article: When a tornado hit the small town of Otwell, Indiana years ago, Kathryn Martin, 32, who lived 60 miles away in Evansville, couldn't get the news out of her mind. \\"I kept thinking, 'Those poor people. Somebody's got to help them,'\\" she says. She knew firsthand what they were going through. Six months earlier, a tornado had struck her town, taking the lives of her 2-year-old son, C.J. and her mother-in-law. \\"It was the most terrible experience of my life,\\" she says. \\"That _ will never go away, and it broke my heart to think about what these families were going through in Otwell.\\" So Kathryn loaded her car with juice boxes, snacks and toys and drove to Otwell. She gave the items to the Red Cross, and as she was leaving, she saw a couple sorting through the ruins of their home while their children were watching. So Kathryn stopped and gave a few toys to the kids and played with them for a while. \\"The parents couldn't thank me enough for what I did for their children,\\" she says. On the drive back to Evansville, Kathryn came up with an idea to help more kids. She talked her family, friends and neighbors into joining her and spent the next few months organizing fundraisers. Finally, in August 2007, she showed C.J.'s Bus, a 35-foot school bus that was turned into a mobile playroom. In the following years, stocked with video games and DVDs, toys, crafts, books and more, the bus traveled to disaster-torn towns, giving the children there a safe place to play. So far, C.J.'s bus has traveled to three states affected by tornadoes or floods, cheering up more than 756 children, aged 3-13. Question: When she heard that Otwell was hit by a tornado, Kathryn Martin _ .

Combine the terms with the variable 'd': 0 = 57*d - 5*d - 104 To do this, we add the coefficients (57 and -5) of the 'd' terms: 52*d - 104 = 0 2. Isolate the variable 'd': To do this, we need to get rid of the constant term, -104. We'll add 104 to both sides of the equation: 52*d - 104 + 104 = 0 + 104 Which simplifies to: 52*d = 104 3. Solve for 'd': To find the value of 'd', we need to divide by 52 on both sides of the equation: 52*d / 52 = 104 / 52 Which simplifies to: d = 2 So, the solution is d = 2."},{"prompt":"Detailed Instructions: In this task, you will be presented with a question having multiple possible answers in Swahili language.

The rest of the members are pretty much Euro-American rock musicians from Boston. As a result, the album is not African music with Euro-American enfused but Euro-American music with some West African drumming enfused.This album lacks any of the groove and rhythm that makes Wolof and Manding music so dominating in Africa.

A:","completion":"Based on the review provided, it seems that the customer is dissatisfied with the product.

Firstly, the reviewer mentions that \\"the album is not African music with Euro-American infused but Euro-American music with some West African drumming infused.\\" This indicates that the customer was disappointed with the direction of the album and felt misled by its presentation. The reviewer might have expected a more West African-centric sound, but instead found the Euro-American influence to be dominant. Secondly, the reviewer criticizes the lack of groove and rhythm in the music, stating that it doesn't represent the dominating characteristics found in Wolof and Manding music.

Additionally, the reviewer takes issue with the guitar work on the album, describing it as \\"painfully electric\\" and reminiscent of \\"80s metal.\\" The customer also notes that the guitar sound has no connection to traditional African strings and guitar, which presumably contributed to their disappointment.

Given the question \\"Why did Lee do this?\\", is \\"learn how to cook\\" a valid answer? Answer:","completion":"Though the answer \\"learn how to cook\\" might be a valid contributing factor to Lee's decision to cook food at home, the question specifically asks for the reason Lee did this. The primary reason given is to save money on going out to restaurants. This suggests that Lee's primary motivation for cooking at home was financial. However, it's possible that multiple factors influenced Lee's choice, including learning how to cook or develop culinary skills. Let's discuss the various reasons that could be related to Lee's choice to cook at home. 1. Saving money: As stated in the question, a major reason for Lee to cook food at home is to save money. Eating in restaurants can often lead to a higher expense as compared to preparing food at home. By cooking at home, Lee can control the cost of ingredients, portion sizes, and prevent any additional costs such as taxes and service fees that come with dining out. 2. Learning how to cook: While this reason might not be the primary motive in the given question, learning how to cook is a valuable skill that can add value to someone's personal and professional life. By cooking at home, Lee can develop culinary skills and techniques, experiment with flavors, and try out new recipes. This can eventually lead to an increased level of self-sufficiency, satisfaction, and confidence in the kitchen. 3. Healthier meals: Another factor that could be tied to Lee's decision to cook at home is the desire to create nutritious, well-balanced, and personalized meals by controlling cooking methods, ingredient quality, and portions. Restaurants might use unhealthy ingredients such as excessive oils, salts, or sugars, whereas cooking at home gives Lee the opportunity to make healthier choices and maintain a diet in line with their goals or needs. 4. Creativity and relaxation: Cooking can also be a creative outlet and a way for Lee to unwind and relax after a long day. Preparing meals at home can give Lee a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction, as well as bring a feeling of therapeutic calmness through the process of creating something with their hands and engaging their senses. 5. Strengthening relationships and bonding: Cooking at home can provide an opportunity for Lee to spend quality time with family and friends. Sharing and enjoying a home-cooked meal can help foster connections, deepen relationships, and create lasting memories. Additionally, involving others in the cooking process can turn meal preparation into a fun and enjoyable group activity. In conclusion, while \\"learn how to cook\\" is a valid and important reason, it may not be the primary reason for Lee's decision to cook food at home according to the question. The main reason given is to save money on going out to restaurants. However, as we've discussed, many factors can influence an individual's choice to cook at home, including learning how to cook, maintaining a healthier lifestyle, engaging in creative pursuits, and strengthening relationships."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

While Roberts accuses the building's electrical engineer, Roger Simmons of cutting corners, Simmons insists the building is up to standards. During the dedication ceremony, public relations chief Dan Bigelow is ordered to turn on the tower's exterior lights to impress the guests and dignitaries. The lighting overloads the electrical system and Roberts orders it shut off. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor and the San Francisco Fire Department is summoned.

But whereas mere mortals might seek out their sick bed, Nadal has somewhat surprisingly instead opted to take to the court. The Spaniard did at least attend a hospital in the Chinese city on Sunday after complaining of stomach problems and was treated with a course of antibiotics.

Questions: Many grains of sand together form what? Options: - eye - bathing suit - sand pile - clam - create pearl Answer:","completion":"Many grains of sand together form a sand pile. This option is in line with common sense, as the other choices do not accurately depict the accumulation of sand grains. Let's examine each of the other options to understand why they are not suitable in this context: - Eye: An eye is a sensory organ used for vision in humans and animals. It has no direct relationship with sand grains and, therefore, is not a result of their accumulation. - Bathing suit: A bathing suit is an item of clothing designed to be worn while swimming, sunbathing, or participating in water sports. Although it might be associated with beach-related activities where sand is present, a bathing suit is not formed by grains of sand. - Clam: A clam is a type of marine bivalve mollusk that lives in a shell and is commonly found in coastal areas. Clams reside in sandy areas but are not formed from sand grains themselves. They are living organisms, not the product of an accumulation of inanimate material. - Create pearl: A pearl can be produced by certain mollusks, such as oysters, as a response to an irritant (like a small grain of sand) entering its shell. The mollusk secretes layers of nacre to coat the foreign material and eventually forms a smooth, rounded pearl. Though this option mentions sand grains, the process involves more than just sand particles and therefore does not accurately depict the outcome of many grains of sand coming together. In conclusion, the most logical and common-sense answer to the question is a sand pile, as it is the only option that accurately describes the result of many grains of sand accumulating together."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the answer: What type of geographical feature is an ox-bow?","completion":"An ox-bow, also referred to as an oxbow lake, is a unique geographical feature that forms in meandering rivers. These features are characteristic U-shaped water bodies and hold great importance in the study of geomorphology and river dynamics. They are called ox-bow lakes due to their shape, which resembles an ancient oxen's yoke. To understand how oxbow lakes come into existence, one must first understand the fluid mechanics of rivers. Rivers are continuously subject to erosion, deposition, and sedimentation, which lead to the alteration of their courses. Over time, these processes result in the river meandering or winding extensively. Meandering patterns are particularly common in landscapes with relatively flat terrain or low gradients, where sediment loads are comparatively higher. As the river meanders, it carves out a sinuous path through the landscape, and the meanders change over time. As the river bends and twists, it causes erosion on the outer banks of the meanders, leading to a steep river cliff called a cut bank. Simultaneously, some of the eroded material is deposited on the opposite, more gently sloping inner bank of the meander, which is known as a point bar. Over time, the meanders become more extensive, and the distance between the two banks shortens. As the river continues to adjust its course and flow, the tips of the meanders gradually get closer and closer. Eventually, the river finds a more efficient course, which bypasses the meander loop altogether. This occurs due to eroded particles accumulating at the inner bank where two meanders come close together, which results in the narrowing of the river channel. The river can break through this narrow band forming a straighter path. Thus, the river abandons the meandering loop, and its flow cuts the loop off from the main river, forming an oxbow lake. Over time, sediments from the river accumulate, forming a natural barrier called a levee between the lake and the river. This process is known as \\"river capture.\\" As an oxbow lake becomes increasingly disconnected from the main river channel, its water typically becomes stagnant, promoting the growth of diverse aquatic ecosystems and supporting a wide range of plant and animal species. Oxbow lakes can be found in many regions across the world and are particularly common in the floodplains of mature rivers. In addition to their ecological importance, oxbows have historical and cultural significance and are often inhabited by people or used for leisure activities such as fishing or boating. Some famous examples of oxbow lakes include the Cuckmere Meanders in England, the Kanjli Wetland in India, and the Horseshoe Lake in California, United States. In conclusion, an oxbow lake is a unique geographical feature that forms as a result of river meandering and the interplay between erosion, deposition, and sedimentation. These natural formations have rich ecological and cultural significance, making them an essential area of study for researchers in the fields of geomorphology, hydrology, and environmental conservation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The number of visitors from North America shot up by 34%. While in the UK, the visitors spent Â£2.2bn, a rise of 2%, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said. The increase comes as the weak pound makes the UK more affordable for visitors, but also follows terror attacks in London and Manchester. Meanwhile, UK residents took a June record of 7.2 million trips abroad, up 4%. However, with the fall in the value of sterling putting them at a disadvantage, the amount they spent leapt by 15% to Â£4.6bn. The big increase in visitors from North America, from 483,000 in June of last year to 650,000 this year, was \\"clearly buoyed by the particularly sharp drop of the pound against the dollar since mid-2016\\", according to Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. The number of visitors from Europe rose by 2% to 2.241 million. The weaker value of the pound since the Brexit referendum vote means that the UK is now a much cheaper destination than it used to be. Many mainland Europeans, Americans and Chinese people are taking advantage of that. That's clear from the cacophony of different languages and accents outside Buckingham Palace, and on the streets around the Palace of Westminster. \\"It's a little more economical than it was a few years ago,\\" says one visiting American tourist. Meanwhile, a German man said the euro-pound rate has \\"made me quite happy\\".

Over the April-to-June quarter the number of visitors from overseas rose to 10.75 million, up 8% from the same period a year earlier. But while holiday visits were up by 20% to 4.7 million over the same three months, business visits were down by 4% at 2.4 million. VisitBritain director Patricia Yates said: \\"Tourism is one of Britain's most valuable export industries and this continued growth demonstrates the industry's increasing importance as a key driver of economic growth across our nations and regions.\\"","completion":"A weaker pound has contributed to a surge in visitors to the UK, with a 34% increase in North American tourists and a 2% rise in European visitors in June compared to the previous year, boosting the UK tourism sector."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer this question: game of thrones season 7 release date wiki??","completion":"\\"Game of Thrones\\" Season 7 premiered on the cable television channel, HBO, on July 16, 2017. Produced by David Benioff and D.B. Weiss, this was the seventh season of the widely popular fantasy drama series adapted from George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series of novels. Unlike previous seasons that all consisted of ten episodes, the seventh season only included seven episodes. This change was a decision made by the creators of the show, who felt that they could maintain the high quality of storytelling and production values with a shortened season. The episodes were also a bit longer on average compared to previous seasons, providing room for additional content. The seventh season of Game of Thrones was announced by HBO on April 21, 2016. Contrasting from earlier seasons, which premiered in the spring, Season 7 had a summer premiere. The delay was in part as a result of the storyline's progression towards winter, giving the production more opportunity to shoot scenes in real-world snowy conditions. In terms of narrative, Season 7 continues the battle for power among the families of the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros, focusing particularly on three main characters: Jon Snow, Daenerys Targaryen, and Cersei Lannister. There is also more emphasis on the impending threat of the 'Night King' and his army of the undead, the White Walkers. The season received generally favorable reviews from critics, although it was polarizing among some fans due to perceived issues with pacing and the handling of certain character arcs. Despite the criticism, the seventh season broke several viewership records, demonstrating the continued popularity of the series worldwide.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: I read this background article the other day: Rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil. Runoff carries it away. The fertilizer ends up in bodies of water, from ponds to oceans. Nitrogen is a fertilizer in the water. Since there is a lot of nitrogen, it causes algae to grow out of control. Pictured below is a pond covered with algae ( Figure below ). Algae use up carbon dioxide in the water. After the algae die, decomposers break down the dead tissue. The decomposers use up all the oxygen in the water. This creates a dead zone. A dead zone is an area in a body of water where nothing grows because there is too little oxygen. There is a large dead zone in the Gulf of Mexico ( Figure below ). The U.S. states outlined on the map have rivers that drain into the Gulf of Mexico. The rivers drain vast agricultural lands. The water carries fertilizer from these areas into the Gulf. I am facing a new situation today: In central Ireland there are two farms next to two very similar lakes, and both farms use the same fertilizer to grow crops. The farm next to lake Montopeke gets rain on a regular basis and so the farmer doesn't need to water his crops as much. The farm that is adjacent to lake Costanza hardly gets any rain at all though. Both farms are able to prosper and do well though despite the different amount of rain they get. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which lake will have more dead zones? A:","completion":"Lake Montopeke is more likely to have more dead zones. According to the background article, rain dissolves fertilizer in the soil, causing it to be carried away in runoff water. This runoff carries the dissolved fertilizer into bodies of water, such as lakes and ponds. The presence of nitrogen from the fertilizer promotes excessive algae growth, which can eventually lead to the depletion of oxygen in the water and the formation of dead zones. In the new situation, the farm next to Lake Montopeke receives regular rainfall, which means that more fertilizer could be dissolved and transported into the lake via runoff. On the other hand, the farm adjacent to Lake Costanza experiences significantly less rainfall and thus less fertilizer is likely to be washed away into the lake. Considering these factors, Lake Montopeke is expected to have more dead zones due to the higher likelihood of fertilizer-affected runoff entering the lake as a result of more frequent rain and its greater impact on the nutrient levels in the water, promoting harmful algae blooms and the depletion of oxygen."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Accuracy in the context of measurements or estimations refers to the closeness of a measured or estimated value to its actual or true value.

Precision (Option III), on the other hand, refers to the closeness of two or more measurements or estimates to each other. For example, if you weigh the same 50-lb weight three times and get the results of 49.5 lbs, 49.6 lbs, and 49.5 lbs, your measurements are not accurate, but they are precise. Option I and II, diversity and frequency, do not directly describe how close an estimate is to a known standard.

We have the equation: 240 * g + 853 - 2419 = 1074 First, let's do some adding and subtracting to make it simpler. We have this part \\"853 - 2419\\" in the equation, so let’s subtract 2419 from 853, which is: 853 - 2419 = -1566 Now our equation looks like this: 240 * g + (-1566) = 1074 We can simply write it like this: 240 * g - 1566 = 1074 Now, we need to get \\"g\\" by itself. To do that, let's get rid of that -1566. We can add 1566 to both sides of the equation to balance it: 240 * g - 1566 + 1566 = 1074 + 1566 This simplifies to: 240 * g = 2640 Now, we need to find out what \\"g\\" is, so we divide both sides of the equation by 240: 240 * g / 240 = 2640 / 240 This gives us: g = 11 There you go!

The Old Silk Route connects Lhasa in Tibet to the plains of Bengal to the south. In 1815, trade volume increased after the British annexed territories belonging to the Sikkimese, Nepalese, and Bhutanese. The potential of Nathu La was realised in 1873, after the Darjeeling Deputy Commissioner published a report on the strategic importance of mountain passes between Sikkim and Tibet. In December 1893, the Sikkimese monarchy and Tibetan rulers signed an agreement to increase trade between the two nations. The agreement culminated in 1894 when the trade pass was opened. Nathu La played a vital role in the 1903–1904 British expedition to Tibet, which sought to prevent the Russian Empire from interfering in Tibetan affairs and thus gaining a foothold in the region. In 1904, Major Francis Younghusband, serving as the British Commissioner to Tibet, led a successful mission through Nathu La to capture Lhasa. This led to the setting up of trading posts at Gyantse and Gartok in Tibet, and gave control of the surrounding Chumbi Valley to the British. The following November, China and Great Britain ratified an agreement approving trade between Sikkim and Tibet. In 1947 and 1948, a popular vote for Sikkim to join newly independent India failed and Indian Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru agreed to a special protectorate status for Sikkim. Sikkim agreed to be a protectorate nation and Indian troops were allowed to man its borders, including Nathu La. During this period, more than 1,000 mules and 700 people were involved in cross-border trade through Nathu La. In 1949, when the Tibetan government expelled the Chinese living there, most of the displaced Chinese returned home through the Nathu La–Sikkim–Kolkata route.The current Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, used this pass to travel to India for the 2,500th birthday celebration of Gautama Buddha, which was held between November 1956 and February 1957.

Redirect your kitten’s agitation with a toy. Recognize signs that your kitten has become agitated in the future.\\" Article:","completion":"Title: Redirected Aggression in Kittens: Understanding, Identifying, and Managing Agitation Introduction Kittens are known for their curiosity, playfulness, and seemingly endless energy. They can bring an immense amount of joy to any home. However, this boundless energy also makes them susceptible to agitation and redirected aggression - a common behavioral issue among cats. If left unaddressed, this can lead to unwanted consequences like injuries to other pets or family members. This article aims to deepen understanding on redirected aggression, provide insights on recognizing agitation signs, and highlight ways to manage and prevent this behavior in your kitten. Understanding Redirected Aggression in Kittens Redirected aggression is a common phenomenon in felines, wherein a kitten becomes frustrated by an external stimulus like another animal or an inaccessible toy but cannot directly interact with the source of its frustration. Consequently, the kitten channels its frustrated energy towards an unrelated target, which can be a pet, a family member, or even an inanimate object. This form of aggression typically happens when the kitten's arousal level is high, and it needs to release pent-up energy. Identifying Signs of Agitation in Kittens Being able to recognize the signs of agitation in your kitten is crucial for managing redirected aggression effectively. Common signs include: 1. Dilated pupils: When a kitten is agitated, its pupils may dilate in response to an external stimulus or heightened emotions. 2. Twitching tail: An agitated kitten may have a twitching or swishing tail, which indicates excess energy that needs to be released. 3. Flattened ears: If a kitten feels threatened or anxious, it may flatten its ears against its head. 4. Hissing, growling or yowling: Vocalizations like these serve as warnings that your kitten is feeling agitated and may escalate to physical aggression if the issue is not addressed. 5. Hair standing on end: A frightened or agitated kitten may have its hair standing on end, creating a puffed-up appearance. 6. Sudden, forceful swiping: Swiping at toys, other pets, or humans can also indicate that a kitten is agitated and redirecting its aggression. Managing and Redirecting Agitation in Kittens If your kitten displays signs of agitation, implement the following strategies to help manage and redirect their energy in a positive manner: 1. Use toys to redirect aggression: When your kitten shows signs of agitation, redirect its focus towards toys that allow it to release energy safely. Toys like wand toys, balls, or puzzle feeders can keep the kitten engaged, create an outlet for its aggression, and stimulate its natural hunting instincts. 2. Create a safe space: Sometimes, a kitten may need a quiet, secure spot to retreat to when feeling overwhelmed. Ensure there's a designated area in your home where your kitten can feel safe and calm down. 3. Encourage playtime and exercise: Keeping your kitten physically active and mentally stimulated every day through play can help release energy and prevent agitation from building up. 4. Allow for vertical space: Cats naturally enjoy climbing and exploring vertical spaces. Providing shelves, cat trees, and wall perches can enable a kitten to expend energy in a positive manner. 5. Socialization and habituation: Gently expose your kitten to new experiences and people from an early age. This helps them develop healthy coping mechanisms and adapt better to various stimuli in their environment. 6. Consult a veterinarian or a qualified behavior specialist: If your kitten's redirected aggression becomes a recurring problem or poses a threat to your pet's well-being, seeking professional advice from a veterinarian or an animal behavior specialist is a prudent step. Conclusion Redirected aggression in kittens is a common behavioral issue that requires close attention and proper intervention. By understanding the signs of agitation in your kitten and employing suitable redirection techniques, you can help your pet build a healthy and positive relationship with its environment and co-inhabitants. Ultimately, this fosters a strong bond between you and your feline companion while maintaining a safe and harmonious household."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

The hypothesis suggests that the Earth is self-regulating and tends to achieve a stable state, known as homeostasis . For example the composition of our atmosphere stays fairly consistent, providing the ideal conditions for life. When carbon dioxide levels increase in the atmosphere, plants grow more quickly. As their growth continues, they remove more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. In this way, the amount of carbon dioxide stays fairly constant without human intervention. Paragraph: Two neighbors Paul and Dean studied toghether often. this week they got together and Paul started studying about the Gaia hypothesis, while Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which person studied more about the stable state? Answer:","completion":"Paul studied more about the stable state. In the given paragraph, it is mentioned that Paul started studying the Gaia hypothesis, which deals with the concept of the Earth as a self-regulating organism maintaining a stable state, known as homeostasis. The Gaia hypothesis revolves around the idea that the Earth's biosphere, atmosphere, and its living organisms work together to ensure the ideal environment for life to thrive. On the other hand, Dean studied Einstein's Theory of Relativity, which deals with the laws of physics and the relationship between space and time in the context of gravity and motion. This theory encompasses the Special Theory of Relativity and the General Theory of Relativity. While the Special Theory of Relativity focuses on the behavior of objects in constant motion relative to one another, the General Theory of Relativity explores the effect of gravity on the fabric of spacetime. Comparing the two areas of study, it becomes evident that Paul's focus on the Gaia hypothesis is directly related to the concept of a stable state, i.e., homeostasis, as the Earth regulates itself to maintain ideal conditions for life. In contrast, Dean's study of Einstein's Theory of Relativity does not specifically deal with the stable state of the Earth or its maintenance, but rather with broader concepts of physics, space, and time. Therefore, it can be concluded that Paul studied more about the stable state."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Jonathan is attending a football game for his favorite team. Before the game, there will be a fireworks display and a fly over by some jet fighter planes. Jonathan has been looking forward to the fireworks for weeks because he has heard they are really great. The fireworks begin and their sound waves are of a high intensity. After the fireworks, the jets fly over and the sound waves for that has an even higher intensity than the fireworks did. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which sound less likely damaged Jonathan's ears? Hint: The Figure below shows decibel levels of several different sounds. As decibel levels get higher, sound waves have greater intensity and sounds are louder. For every 10-decibel increase in the intensity of sound, loudness is 10 times greater. Therefore, a 30-decibel “quiet” room is 10 times louder than a 20-decibel whisper, and a 40-decibel light rainfall is 100 times louder than the whisper. High-decibel sounds are dangerous. They can damage the ears and cause loss of hearing. Answer:","completion":"Given the information in the paragraph and the hint provided, it is clear that the sound from the fireworks display had a high intensity, but the flyover by the jet fighter planes had an even higher intensity. Since the intensity of the sound waves directly correlates with the potential for ear damage and the risk of hearing loss, the sound that is less likely to have damaged Jonathan's ears is the fireworks display. The fireworks produced lower intensity sound waves compared to the jet fighter planes, making them less dangerous to Jonathan's hearing."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It translates to: \\"In which case does a player's name in the game room turn gray?\\" In many video games and online platforms, a player's name in the game room or chat room may turn gray for various reasons. Some of these reasons include: 1. Inactivity: If the player has not interacted with the game or platform for a certain period, their name may be temporarily grayed out. This is typically a sign that the player is away from their device or not currently focused on the game. Once the player resumes participation, their name should return to its normal color. 2. Connection issues: If a player is experiencing connectivity problems, their name might turn gray to indicate this issue. This could happen due to server issues, an unstable internet connection, or the player accidentally closing their game client. Oftentimes, the name will return to normal as soon as the connection is restored. 3. Mute or silenced: In some games or platforms, the player's name might turn gray when they are muted by an administrator or have triggered an automatic moderation feature. This could be due to inappropriate behavior, spamming the chat, or engaging in activities against the platform's Terms of Service. Depending on the severity of the infraction and the policies of the platform, the grayed-out status might be temporary or permanent. 4. Spectator mode: Certain games and platforms allow users to enter a spectator mode, where they can watch others play without participating. During this time, their name may be grayed out as an indicator that they are not currently active as a player. 5. Offline status: In some instances, a player's name may turn gray if they have set their status to \\"offline\\" or \\"invisible.\\" This is usually done to indicate that the player is not looking to engage with others or prefers privacy during their gaming session. It's worth noting that different platforms and games might use varying indicators for these situations, and not all may use gray as an indicator.

Williams, who himself transferred to the English club last summer, ardently believes that Koeman's continued presence is crucial for Everton's growth and success in the future. Background on Koeman's Success at Everton: Ever since taking charge of Everton in the summer of 2016, Ronald Koeman has demonstrated commendable managerial skills, leading the team to impressive form in the English Premier League. Under his guidance, the Toffees have consistently held a strong position within the top half of the table, with exceptional performances from key players like Romelu Lukaku and Idrissa Gana Gueye. Williams' Stance on the Matter: Ashley Williams believes that Koeman's guidance plays a significant role in Everton's progress, and his departure would likely be a setback for the club. Consequently, he has urged Koeman to ignore the tempting Barcelona job speculations and remain steadfast in his commitment to Everton. Williams stated that the players and staff at Everton love working with Koeman and have full confidence in his ability to continue taking them to new heights. Barcelona's Hunt for a New Manager: Following Luis Enrique's announcement that he will step down as Barcelona's manager at the end of the current season, the Catalan club has been on the lookout for a worthy replacement. Ronald Koeman's name has surfaced on several occasions as a potential candidate, possibly due to his familiarity with the club, having played for Barcelona in his prime and the impressive coaching career that followed. Koeman's Connection to Barcelona: The Dutchman's association with FC Barcelona runs deep, as he spent six successful years as a player at Camp Nou. Koeman was known for his contributions as a top defender, and he scored the winning goal for the club in the 1992 European Cup final against Sampdoria. Since then, he has gone on to coach top-flight clubs like Ajax, PSV Eindhoven, Southampton, and now, Everton. Conclusion: While the speculations surrounding Koeman's potential move to Barcelona are a testament to his coaching prowess, the Everton camp, particularly Ashley Williams, calls for the manager to remain committed to the club's ongoing growth. The final decision ultimately rests in the hands of both the Barcelona board and Ronald Koeman, who will weigh the options available to him. Everton fans and players alike remain hopeful that Koeman will heed Williams' plea and continue his journey with the Merseyside club."},{"prompt":"Definition: In this task, you're given a fill-in-the-blank question that contains two object names.

His call to keep up the momentum and end their campaign on a high resonates deeply with fans and fellow players.

Context: With the fall of Valencia and the entry of the viceroy into the city in late 1521, a moderate repression started. Viceroy Diego Hurtado de Mendoza did not wish to start a new revolt, but took action against the most important of the leaders, and issued a general pardon to minor agermanats who had merely served in the army. However, Mendoza was replaced as viceroy by Germaine of Foix, Ferdinand's second wife, who returned to the country with Charles and a new German husband . She favored a harsher policy toward the rebels, and approximately 800 death sentences to former rebels would be dispensed. Sources differ on how much she personally ordered, but it seems likely at least 100 death warrants were directly approved of by her. Heavy fines were imposed on the guilds as punishment, as well as a total of more than 360,000 ducats of fines to all cities that had sided with the Germanies, and 2,000,000 ducats of fines were levied in compensations for damages sustained by properties during the war. The period of heavier repression ended on December 23, 1524, when Germaine signed a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and by extension the other Germanies. King Charles signed an additional general pardon in 1528, suggesting that scattered reprisals might have continued afterward. Germaine was in favor of the integration of Spain, and Catalan nationalists point to her pardon as one of the first official documents in Aragon written in Castilian Spanish. Question: How many years passed between Germaine signing a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and King Charles signing a general pardon? Answer:","completion":"Germaine signed the pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia on December 23, 1524. King Charles signed an additional general pardon in 1528. To find out how many years passed between these two events, we need to subtract the earlier year from the later year. 1528 - 1524 = 4 Therefore, 4 years passed between Germaine signing a pardon for one of the six main guilds of the City of Valencia and King Charles signing a general pardon."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer the question...who played michael corleone son in godfather 2??","completion":"In the Godfather Part II, Michael Corleone's son, Anthony Corleone, is portrayed by the actor James Gounaris. Anthony Corleone is the son of Michael and Kay Adams-Corleone, and the character is present in all three films of the Godfather series. However, in each installment of the trilogy, a different actor played the role of Anthony. In the first film, The Godfather (1972), Anthony Corleone appears as an infant and is played by Anthony Robert Driscoll, who was an uncredited actor. It is worth noting that the role of Anthony Vito Corleone was a minor one in this movie. In the second installment of the series, The Godfather Part II (1974), Anthony's character is more developed as a crucial part of the Corleone family. As mentioned earlier, he is portrayed by James Gounaris. In this film, viewers see how Michael Corleone is slowly becoming more distant and emotionally detached from his family, leading to conflicts in his relationship with his wife Kay and his children, including Anthony. Finally, in The Godfather Part III (1990), Anthony Corleone's character becomes more prominent as he struggles with his aspirations and expectations. He is played by the talented actor-singer Franc D'Ambrosio. In this last film, Anthony rebels against his father's wish for him to be involved in the family's criminal activities, as he opts to build a career in the world of opera instead. In summary, Michael Corleone's son, Anthony, is played by three different actors throughout The Godfather trilogy. Among them, James Gounaris portrays Anthony in The Godfather Part II, where Anthony's character starts to become a more significant part of the storyline."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Food allergies more likely in kids born in winter Allergy experts say it's important for people who have reactions to certain foods to sort out why with the help of their health care provider, because different food-related problems may require different management techniques and treatments. An immune system reaction that occurs soon after eating a certain food. Even a tiny amount of the allergy-causing food can trigger symptoms such as digestive problems, hives or swollen airways. In some people, a food allergy can cause severe symptoms or even life-threatening anaphylaxis. Much more common than food allergy. Because a food intolerance can cause some of the same symptoms as a food allergy, people often confuse the two. Food intolerance generally doesn't involve the immune system. It can be caused by the absence of an enzyme needed to fully digest a food. A common example is lactose intolerance. Irritable bowel syndrome and sensitivity to certain additives also fall under the umbrella of food intolerance. An immune system reaction that causes inflammation in the small intestines when a person eats any food containing gluten, a type of protein found in wheat. Sources: Mayo Clinic; Robert Wood, Johns Hopkins The chances of a child developing food allergies may be increased if that child is conceived in the early spring, a preliminary study by Finnish researchers suggests. Studies have already shown that children born in autumn or winter are more likely to have eczema, wheezing and asthma than children born in spring or summer, the researchers noted. There may be several reasons for this new finding, said lead researcher Dr. Kaisa Pyrhonen, of the Institute of Health Sciences at the University of Oulu, including concentration of pollen in spring, exposure to sunlight, which is related to synthesis of vitamin D, and viral infections. \\"These are possible explanations, but our study design did not allow any assessment of the causal role of the above factors,\\" Pyrhonen said. Pyrhonen said the study findings are preliminary and families should not plan pregnancies around specific times. \\"Because our study was an observational study, we cannot give any recommendations to families,\\" Pyrhonen said. The report is published in the Oct. 20 online edition of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. For the study, Pyrhonen's team collected data on 5,920 Finnish children born between 2001 and 2006. From birth to four years, 961 of these children were tested for food allergies. Up to age of 4, the odds of having a food allergy varied according to season of birth, ranging from 5% for children born in June and July to 9.5% for those born in October and November, the researchers found. In fact, 11% of children whose 11th week of development occurred during April or May had food allergies, compared with 6% of children who reached that stage of development in December or January, Pyrhonen's group found. In terms of specific allergies, a child whose first three months of fetal development ended in April or May was three times more likely to be allergic to milk and eggs compared with those who reached that stage in November or December, the researchers said. Commenting on the study, Dr. Erick Forno, an assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said there could be a variety of reasons for this finding. \\"But what is important is that we are understanding more that there are environmental factors that at some point during pregnancy play an important role in developing the immune system that predisposes the kid to have either food allergies or environmental allergies or asthma or eczema or something of that sort,\\" he said. Forno cautioned that this was an observational study (a type of study in which people are observed or certain outcomes are measured and no effort is made to affect the outcome — for instance, no treatment is given). \\"So there may be other things that these researchers didn't measure that are also associated. What they are looking at is the common consequence. So we can't say it's a causal association,\\" he said. Parents need to realize that things outside the uterus are very important in the developing fetus, Forno said, adding, \\"We are only beginning to understand what goes on.\\" You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

The car stalled more often than the truck had stalled because the","completion":"car's engine was older and had not undergone proper maintenance for quite some time, resulting in a significant decrease in its performance and reliability as compared to the more robust, well-tuned engine of the truck. Moreover, considering the differences between the two vehicles in terms of their make, model, and intended usage, it was becoming increasingly apparent that the car was clearly at a disadvantage in terms of its ability to withstand the cumulative wear and tear of daily use, and the consequent stalling was indicative of a deteriorating condition that would soon mandate a comprehensive overhaul, or even a replacement, of its key components in order to restore it to an optimal operating state. Additionally, the car's susceptibility to frequent stalling could also be attributed to several factors such as the presence of dirty fuel injectors, clogged air filters, worn-out spark plugs, or a malfunctioning electrical system, which collectively hampered the smooth ignition of the air-fuel mixture in the combustion chamber and the generation of adequate power to keep the engine running efficiently. In contrast, the truck, which was primarily designed to transport heavy loads over long distances, boasted of a more durable and resilient powertrain that was better equipped to handle the rigors of daily operations without succumbing to persistent mechanical issues such as stalling. Furthermore, the car owner's lack of attentiveness to the vehicle's routine maintenance schedule played a significant role in exacerbating the problem, thereby rendering the car more prone to sudden breakdowns and potentially costly repairs. On the other hand, the truck's superior performance could be attributed to the meticulous attention paid by its owner to regular maintenance, timely servicing, and prompt rectification of any issues that were detected during periodic inspections by professional mechanics. As a result, the disparity in the frequency of stalling incidents between the car and the truck served as a stark reminder of the importance of adhering to recommended maintenance practices, investing in high-quality replacement parts, and consulting with experienced professionals when troubleshooting complex automotive issues, particularly as vehicles age or accumulate higher mileage counts. In essence, proper care and proprietorship can significantly mitigate the occurrence and impact of common mechanical problems such as stalling, and can ultimately contribute to an extended vehicle lifespan, enhanced safety, and a more rewarding ownership experience. In conclusion, the fact that the car stalled more often than the truck could be mainly ascribed to the age and neglect of the car's engine components, as well as the inherent differences in the design and robustness of the two vehicles. Such circumstances underscore the need for regular maintenance and proper upkeep, especially for older or high-mileage vehicles, to ensure continued reliability and driving satisfaction."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Translate to English","completion":"So far, there has clearly been no unified community policy on urban issues, even though more than three-quarters of the citizens of the Union live in urban areas. Urban issues have become increasingly important as the majority of the population in the European Union resides in cities and towns, where various economic, social, and environmental challenges arise. In spite of this, urban policy in the EU has been somewhat fragmented, with individual cities and member states addressing them in different ways. This lack of coherent policy may hinder the ability of the Union to collectively address the unique issues that urban areas face. The absence of a unified community policy on urban issues can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the European Union covers a vast and diverse range of cities, each with their own distinct characteristics and specific local needs. This makes it difficult to formulate a single overarching policy that can address the unique challenges and opportunities of all cities. Secondly, urban policies often overlap with a range of other policy areas, such as housing, transportation, and environmental protection. This means that urban issues are often addressed through a mixture of local, regional, national, and EU level policies, creating a complex and fragmented policy landscape. However, recognizing the importance of urban issues, the European Union has been making efforts to adopt a more coordinated and integrated approach to urban policy. One example is the establishment of the 'Urban Agenda for the EU,' which aims to involve various levels of government (local, regional, national, and EU) in addressing urban challenges. It does so through partnerships focusing on key priority areas such as air quality, urban mobility, energy transition, and affordable housing, among others. The Urban Agenda encourages collaboration, knowledge sharing, and best practice exchange among European cities, aiming to ensure that urban policy objectives are incorporated into relevant legislation and funding mechanisms. Another important aspect of urban policy is the role of the EU structural and investment funds, which support urban development projects and contribute to improved living conditions for citizens. By allocating financial resources for urban projects, the EU promotes the development of sustainable and inclusive cities, encourages social cohesion, supports job creation, and fosters innovation and growth. In conclusion, while it is true that there has historically been a lack of a unified community policy on urban issues within the European Union, efforts have been made in recent years to address this gap and enhance cooperation among various levels of government. The 'Urban Agenda for the EU' and the allocation of EU structural and investment funds for urban projects exemplify this shift towards a more coordinated and integrated approach to urban policy. However, the continued diversification and growth of urban areas in the EU necessitate ongoing efforts to refine and expand on this approach, ensuring that the needs and potential of European cities are adequately addressed."},{"prompt":"Title: One of the funniest Tintins!

P.J. Lurz is informed by Gerhard Gast, the inspector-general of the police, that he is being watched and is under police protection. Gast has also arrived to pick up Susanne, his daughter-in-law.

What begins as an intriguing premise, ultimately crumbles beneath the weight of its own convoluted plot and lackluster character development that left us desperate for a resolution that never arrives. The film attempts to stitch together an intricate psychological thriller, but its reliance on redundant flashbacks and overused cliches quickly deprives the story of any originality. The writer-director, Tom Smith, apparently sought to challenge the viewer’s perception of reality but ends up perpetuating a tired and superficial narrative that is neither gripping nor engaging. It's important to note the weak performances from the lead actors, Sarah Johnson and Michael Stone, who fail to construct a believable relationship on screen. The lack of chemistry between the two is painful and only exacerbates the inadequacy of their poorly written characters. Consequently, Johnson and Stone's performances merely serve as an unconvincing attempt to mask the uninspired dialogue and unresolved plot points. Equally frustrating is the uninspired cinematography that only accentuates the already dismal atmosphere of the movie. Instead of elevating the visual storytelling, the unremarkable camera work further exacerbates the disconnect between the audience and the film's convoluted messaging. It seems that Smith's vision for the film falls disappointingly short, as the visuals only echo the confused narrative and lack of focus. Even the score, composed by James Wilson, fails to leave a lasting impact as it meanders aimlessly throughout the film. The soundscape is shallow, rarely reaching emotional depths that could have potentially breathed life into the film's dreary atmosphere. One can't help but wonder what could have been achieved if greater attention was given to the score and its ability to evoke emotion. In conclusion, Unbearable Dreams is a muddled mess, crippled by a weak plotline, unpolished performances, and a general lack of creativity. Despite its initial promise, it ultimately delivers an underwhelming and unsatisfying experience that we cannot in good conscience recommend."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Bronx Street Named for Yankee Catcher Underwhelms A green street sign hangs at the corner of Concourse Village East and 156th Street, the font shrunk to fit all the letters in a mouthful of a name from generations past: Thurman Munson Way. Yankees fans need no reminder of Munson, of course. He was the team captain and an All-Star catcher when he died in 1979 at age 32 in the crash of his personal plane. With a trademark mustache and big-city toughness tempered by Middle American values, Munson was one of the most popular Yankees during the 1970s, when the team was filled with large personalities. But now, three decades later, most people who walk down Thurman Munson Way, a one-block stretch not far from the Nos. 2 and 5 trains, know it as 156th Street. And Thurman Munson? “I don’t know who that is,” said Quirsten Green, a security officer who works at a school on the block. Do not ask a taxi driver to take you to Thurman Munson Way. And do not ask Lashay Fuller how to get there, even when you are both standing right on it. “My friend from Queens came up here and he called and said, ‘I’m on Thurman Munson.’ I was like, ‘Where is he?’ ” Ms. Fuller recalled. “And I’ve lived here 21 years.” Babe Ruth and Lou Gehrig have plazas by Yankee Stadium; Mickey Mantle has a restaurant on Central Park South; Thurman Munson was granted a narrow stretch of road between a rail-yard bed and a hulking housing complex. The Yankees are festooned with history, and honoring every shard of the pinstriped mystique could reshape a city map. But to many people, Thurman Munson Way and its constellation of potholes hardly count as a prize. The road lies nearly a mile from Yankee Stadium, far enough away that only fans who celebrated a win too hard would end up there. No businesses are on the street, and no houses. The road did not exist until the 1960s, when the city built an elevated passageway above the tracks of the old New York Central Railroad, according to Lloyd Ultan, the Bronx’s official historian. “We had a walkway that had no name at all, and the sentiment was to name it after Thurman Munson,” he said. (Though it is known as 156th Street, a glance at the map shows that it does not line up with the rest of that street. “That’s because it wasn’t really part of the original grid,” Mr. Ultan said.) Two schools were built on the road years later, and today they each house several schools — including Henry Lou Gehrig Junior High School. A mural of the Yankees slugger hangs in the school’s lobby, ensuring that the Jeter generation knows Gehrig’s name, if not Munson’s. Ms. Fuller, who lives in Concourse Village, an apartment complex one block away, said the narrow street was a poor tribute to Munson, whoever he was. “They should name a bigger street after him so lots of people know it,” she said. “In the nighttime, it’s deserted. Not many people come here.” Thurman Munson’s widow, Diana, has never been to Thurman Munson Way, but she said that her husband would have appreciated the street’s low profile. “He wasn’t about the big superhighway and mainstream streets,” she said. “It fits his personality so much more that it would be an out-of-the-way street and be something that not a lot of people would embrace.” “After 30 years,” she said, “he would just be pleased that they’re still talking about him.” It remains unclear exactly why this street was chosen to honor Munson. Henry J. Stern, who was a member of the City Council’s parks committee when the honor was bestowed in 1979, could not recall the exact circumstances. But he said it was probably chosen because it was reasonably close to Yankee Stadium. “It may have been some people there asked for it, or it may have been in anticipation of future development of the area, which did not materialize,” Mr. Stern said. Either way, he concluded, it has not worked out. “We have not yet paid our debt to Thurman Munson. With a new Yankee Stadium, maybe it’s time to think about putting Thurman Munson Way closer to the complex where people can see it.” The Yankees organization has not forgotten about the catcher who died too young. Memorabilia shops near the stadium sell Munson jerseys alongside those screaming Jeter, Mantle, DiMaggio and the rest. Fans still marvel at Munson’s poise behind the plate — he was the American League rookie of the year in 1970 and the league’s most valuable player in 1976, the same year he batted .529 in the World Series. They remember his clashes with Reggie Jackson over who was the franchise player. (“I’m the straw that stirs the drink,” Jackson said soon after he joined the Yankees. “Munson thinks he can be the straw that stirs the drink, but he can only stir it bad.”) As a tribute, the team has kept Munson’s locker vacant since his death. Last year, it was taken to the new stadium. On a recent blue-sky afternoon, Ruben Gonzalez was among the fans who passed through Babe Ruth Plaza to watch the Yankees lose to the Los Angeles Angels, 5-3. No, Mr. Gonzalez had never heard of Thurman Munson Way. “There should be something that’s visible and shows him some respect,” he suggested. Mark Strain, a first-grade teacher at Public School 31 on Thurman Munson Way, is a Mets fan, but even he thinks that the road is a poor tribute. “I think he should have gotten a better street,” he said. “I mean, this is kind of an insult.” Luis Cartagena, a fellow teacher at P.S. 31, said that if the city was serious about honoring Munson, it would at least fix the potholes. But Mr. Cartagena also imagined that Munson, a devoted father of three who once asked to be traded so he could be closer to his family, would have enjoyed watching the parade of students walk his block, shouting as they chased one another across the blacktop. “It doesn’t get livelier than this,” he said.

Option 1: Using a carpenter's square Option 2: Using a protractor The more reasonable method for making sure all the corners of a wooden board are at a 90-degree angle is Option 1: Using a carpenter's square. A carpenter's square is a special tool shaped like a big L (an \\"L\\" that's uppercase). This tool's shape helps you check if the corners of your wooden board are perfect squares, which means each corner has a 90-degree angle. You just need to place the carpenter's square on the corner, and if it fits snuggly like a puzzle piece, it's a 90-degree angle. The second option, the protractor, is a tool that helps to measure different angles. But it might be a bit tricky for you to use in this situation, and it might not be as accurate as a carpenter's square. So, it's more reasonable to use a carpenter's square to make sure all the corners of a wooden board are at a 90-degree angle."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Article: Are we getting more stupid? According to Gerald Crabtree, a scientist at Stanford University in the US, we are. You may not want to hear this, but Crabtree believes that human intelligence reached its peak more than 2,000 years ago and ever since then has been going downhill. \\"If an average Greek from 1,000 BC were transported to modern times, he or she would be one of the brightest among us,\\" Crabtree told The Guardian. At the heart of Crabtree's thinking is a simple idea. In the past, intelligence was critical for survival when our ancestors had to avoid dangerous animals and hunt for food. The difference of being smart or stupid is often life or death. However, after the spread of agriculture, when our ancestors began to live in dense farming communities, the need to keep their intelligence in peak condition gradually reduced. This is not hard to understand. Most of the time, pressure is what keeps us going - you need the pressure from your teachers to finish your homework; the pressure of looking pretty prompts you to lose weight when summer comes. And the same is also true of our intelligence - if we think less, we become less smart. These mutations are harmful to our intelligence and they were all developed in the past 3,000 years. The other evidence that Crabtree holds is in our genes. He found that among the 2,000 to 5,000 genes that we have that determine human intelligence , there are two or more mutations in each of us. However, Crabtree's theory has been criticized by some who say that early humans may have better hunting and surviving abilities, but people today have developed a more diverse intelligence. For example, spearing a tiger doesn't necessarily require more brainpower than playing chess or writing a poem. Moreover, the power of modern education means a lot more people have the opportunity to learn nowadays. \\"You wouldn't get Stephen Hawking 2,000 years ago.

Even in 1594, when the bridge was only recently completed, a British traveler called it the “eighth wonder of the world.” The version of the bridge that most people know was built between 1588 and 1591, but there’s been a bridge in this location since around 1180. The Rialto Bridge was the first bridge to cross the Grand Canal, and until the 1800s it remained the only bridge across Venice’s major waterway. The Rialto district was the main commercial hub of Venice and people increasingly needed access to buy and sell goods. The first bridge built at this site was a pontoon bridge that was eventually replaced by a wooden bridge in 1264. This wooden bridge was destroyed and rebuilt several times: it burned down during an unsuccessful coup in 1310, and in 1444 collapsed under the weight of a crowd watching a boat parade during a wedding. Its last collapse came in 1524, and by then Venice decided it was time to build a more permanent and durable bridge. Beginning in 1525, many architects submitted designs for the Rialto Bridge, but none of them was unanimously selected for the commission. The elected council overseeing the bridge’s construction deliberated and consulted several local builders to figure out how they could erect a stone bridge across the wide Grand Canal. They had a few limitations to consider: the sloped shores on either side, the need for boats to be able to pass underneath, and the practicality of having shops atop the bridge. Andrea Palladio’s design for the Rialto Bridge, published in his architectural treatise, Quattro libri, in 1570, featured three arches that would have prevented larger boats from passing under the bridge. Although his design utilized an appealing classical aesthetic, it was rejected in favor of Antonio Da Ponte’s. Question: Andrea believes that: Options: - grand canal issues - Bridge issue - not enough information - waterway issue === The correct answer is Answer:","completion":"Andrea believes that there are issues with constructing a bridge over the Grand Canal."},{"prompt":"A text is given in Gujarati.

Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What is the first initial of the person who didn't believe the story that Cocteau gave about the group taking a cab? At that time, a Parisian ballet audience typically consisted of two diverse groups: the wealthy and fashionable set, who would be expecting to see a traditional performance with beautiful music, and a \\"Bohemian\\" group who, the poet-philosopher Jean Cocteau asserted, would \\"acclaim, right or wrong, anything that is new because of their hatred of the boxes\\". Monteux believed that the trouble began when the two factions began attacking each other, but their mutual anger was soon diverted towards the orchestra: \\"Everything available was tossed in our direction, but we continued to play on\\". Around forty of the worst offenders were ejected—possibly with the intervention of the police, although this is uncorroborated. Through all the disturbances the performance continued without interruption. The unrest receded significantly during Part II, and by some accounts Maria Piltz's rendering of the final \\"Sacrificial Dance\\" was watched in reasonable silence. At the end there were several curtain calls for the dancers, for Monteux and the orchestra, and for Stravinsky and Nijinsky before the evening's programme continued.Among the more hostile press reviews was that of Le Figaro's critic, Henri Quittard, who called the work \\"a laborious and puerile barbarity\\" and added \\"We are sorry to see an artist such as M. Stravinsky involve himself in this disconcerting adventure\\". On the other hand, Gustav Linor, writing in the leading theatrical magazine Comoedia, thought the performance was superb, especially that of Maria Piltz; the disturbances, while deplorable, were merely \\"a rowdy debate\\" between two ill-mannered factions. Emile Raudin, of Les Marges, who had barely heard the music, wrote: \\"Couldn't we ask M. Astruc ... to set aside one performance for well-intentioned spectators? ...

The UK's top anti-terror police officer has said today that 'significant progress' has been made in the hunt for the UK jihadist who murdered American journalist James Foley. Assistant Commissioner Mark Rowley appealed for help in rooting out aspiring home-grown terrorists as he decried the 41-year-old's 'pitiless' death at the hands of Islamic extremists in Iraq. Islamic State terrorists posted a video online last week of the horrifying murder of hostage Mr Foley at the hands of a killer who spoke with a British accent. Making progress: The UK's top anti-terror police officer, Mark Rowley, (left) has said today that 'significant progress' has been made in the hunt for the UK jihadist who murdered American journalist James Foley (right) Today Mr Rowley, the UK's leading counter-terrorism officer, said: 'Every reasonable person in the country has been touched by the pitiless murder of James Foley at the hands of Islamic State terrorists, and the murderer's apparent British nationality has focused attention on extremism in the UK as well as the Middle East. Investigators are making significant progress.' He appealed to family members and friends of would-be UK terrorists to come forward, stressing that nearly half of potential jihadis identified as part of Syria-linked investigations had not previously been classed as dangerous. Mr Rowley said that counter terrorism police had recently arrested a 19-year-old man in Camberwell, who was charged with engaging in conduct of preparation for terrorist acts, and is now awaiting trial. He added: 'Another young man, previously unknown of as a terrorist risk, was arrested last week on suspicion of planning to leave the country to travel to Syria for terrorist acts. He remains in custody. Shocking: Islamic State terrorists posted a video online last week of the horrifying murder of hostage Mr Foley at the hands of a killer who spoke with a British accent. 'The biggest growth in Syrian related investigations has occurred in London and the West Midlands. The growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing, especially when nearly half of Syria travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously.' In the first half of this year 69 suspected extremists who planned to travel to Syria or fund terrorism there were arrested, and five times as many suspects are being arrested now compared to 2013. 'High priority operations, especially against those involved in attack planning or on the cusp have increased greatly,' he said. 'Port stops and cash seizures have grown by over 50per cent as we strive to disrupt terrorists. 'The biggest growth in Syrian-related investigations has occurred in London and the West Midlands. The growth of dangerous individuals poses challenges for policing, especially when nearly half of Syria travellers of concern were not known as terrorist risks previously. Journalist: Mr Foley pictured working in Syria in August 2012. Mr Rowley described the death as 'pitiless' 'Hence, we appeal to the public to help identify for us aspiring terrorists - they may be about to travel abroad, have just returned or be showing signs of becoming radicalised.' Scotland Yard investigators are currently having hundreds of pieces of terrorist content linked to Syria removed from websites including YouTube, Facebook and Twitter. Mr Rowley said the force is also trying to prevent hate crimes here that may be sparked by events abroad, for example anti-Semitic offences related to Gaza and crimes against Muslims over the actions of Islamic State. He added: \\"There is a lot at stake. In addition to the public assistance in identifying potential terrorists, we all need community and religious leaders to continue to speak out against warped narratives and we need everyone to ensure that public debate does not give oxygen to the terrorists by giving them the publicity they seek.' Earlier this month Scotland Yard chief Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe warned it cannot be predicted when potential terrorists might decide to return to the UK from countries such as Iraq and Syria, and police are preparing in case of an influx. It is estimated that around 500 Britons have travelled to Syria to fight alongside extremists there, of whom around half are thought to be from London. However, during a visit to India Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg rejected calls for tougher measures to combat the threat posed by returning British jihadists. Anger: London Mayor Boris Johnson (right) said he wants Mr Foley's murderer, who has become known as 'Jihadi John' (left) to be killed in a bomb attack. London Mayor Boris Johnson said he wants Mr Foley's murderer to be killed in a bomb attack and joined the growing calls for Britons fighting abroad to be stripped of their citizenship. But Mr Clegg said: 'We actually have a number of measures already on the statute book which allow us to keep a very close eye on those people who aren't in prison, aren't sentenced, but nonetheless are perceived to be a threat to the United Kingdom. 'And of course, we will continue to review all the powers on the recommendation of the police and security services that may be deemed to be necessary to deal with this very serious issue. 'I sometimes wish it was as simple as Boris Johnson implies: all we need to do is pass a law and everything will be well.' Writing in his Daily Telegraph column, Mr Johnson said those who 'continue to give allegiance to a terrorist state' should lose their British citizenship, and called for swift changes to the law so there is a \\"rebuttable presumption\\" that those visiting war areas without notifying the authorities have done so for a terrorist purpose. He wrote: 'Young men such as this killer are famously told that if they die in 'battle' they will be welcomed in heaven by the sexual ministrations of 72 virgins. 'Many of them believe it - even though scholars have suggested that the reference to \\"black-eyed virgins\\" is in fact a promise of 72 raisins. 'I suspect most of us don't give a monkey's what happens to this prat in heaven, whether he meets virgins or raisins - we just want someone to come along with a bunker buster and effect an introduction as fast as possible.'

Laura had not gotten a release date from the parole board. 2). Emily had not gotten a release date from the parole board.","completion":"Laura but not Emily would soon be going home because Laura had not gotten a release date from the parole board. This bore testament to the stark differences in their respective situations at the correction facility. Despite their shared experiences and the bond they'd managed to form over time, Laura and Emily had very different trajectories. Laura's case was less severe and her lawyers were impeccable, which made her chances of getting a release date higher compared to Emily. Her lawyers worked tirelessly, going through her case files seeking relevant pieces of evidence that could influence the parole board. They were hopeful to get a release date at the soonest time possible. Emily, on the other hand, had a lot more hurdles to jump over. Hers was a more complicated case, one that didn't promise immediate freedom. She had not gotten a release date from the parole board. Besides, she didn't have the same kind of resources as Laura. Her lawyer was court-appointed, understaffed, and overworked. This meant there was less time to allot to her case, translating to missed opportunities that could potentially decrease her sentencing or expedite her release. The time Laura and Emily spent in the correctional facility was a testament not only to their past mistakes but also to the inequalities of the justice system. Despite staying in the same cells, eating the same food, and even sharing the same clothes, they had different futures. Laura was going home – her chance at a second shot at life was waving at her in the horizon, while Emily was left gazing at the distant promise of liberty that hung just out of her grasp. This created a bittersweet atmosphere between the women. Laura's imminent freedom was a beacon of hope, an encouragement that there was a life beyond the bars. Simultaneously, her future freedom served as a stark reminder to Emily of the years she still had to serve, the harsh reality she had to endure. Laura's pending departure showcased a strong but often overlooked aspect of life in the correctional facility - the cycle of hope and despair. Seeing familiar faces leave brought both a sense of comfort and immense sadness, a longing for freedom and a reminder of lost liberty. This was the reality of their life, Laura was going home soon, leaving Emily among others behind. Undeniably, this caused a ripple effect on Emily. She began doubting her chances of release, fearing that the ticket to freedom that Laura enjoyed might never come her way. This change in Emily was a manifestation of a deeper predicament in our society, a mirror of the inherent injustices within the justice system. Therefore, while Laura's countdown to freedom served as a victory for some, it was also a somber anthem for those like Emily who remained incarcerated, a eulogy of the agonizing wait for a release date from the parole board that might never come. It highlighted the stark contrast between their lives - Laura, an embodiment of hope, against Emily, a symbol of the enduring struggle within the confines of the correctional facility."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Also known as the East African Rift Valley, this geological feature stretches approximately 6,000 kilometers (3,730 miles) from Lebanon in the Middle East to Mozambique in southeastern Africa. The Great Rift Valley was formed by the ongoing tectonic forces creating a series of geological faults that resulted in multiple diverse volcanic activities along the dormant and active volcanic zones. It presents a complex and extensive system of related geological structures comprising of rifts, ridges, and valleys formed by the interactions between the African Plate, the Arabian Plate, and the Somali Plate. As a prominent feature, the Great Rift Valley is divided into two main sections – the Eastern Rift and the Western Rift. The Eastern Rift, also known as the Gregory Rift, runs from the Afar Triple Junction in Ethiopia, southward through eastern Africa to central Mozambique. The Western Rift, also known as the Albertine Rift or Albertine Rift System, runs from Uganda to the Democratic Republic of Congo. Throughout its course, the Great Rift Valley harbors many natural wonders, including spectacular national parks, abundant wildlife, freshwater and salty lakes, and unique landforms such as plateau volcanoes, high mountains, and escarpments. Some noticeable landmarks embracing the Great Rift Valley include Mount Kilimanjaro, the Serengeti plains, Ngorongoro Crater, and the Olduvai Gorge. In addition to its geophysical significance, the Great Rift Valley also holds a vital role in anthropology as several hominin fossils, some dating back millions of years, have been discovered in the region.

Title: She's the One Movie plot: The film tells the story of two Irish Catholic Fitzpatrick brothers, Mickey (Edward Burns) and Francis (Mike McGlone) and the tribulations of love, family and betrayal. Mickey is a New York City blue-collared taxi driver, unhappy over an act of infidelity committed by Heather (Cameron Diaz), his ex-fiancÃ©e. Francis is a white-collared Wall Street stock investor, who unknown to his wife, Renee (Jennifer Aniston), is having an affair. During weekends, Mickey and Francis visit their parents who live on Long Island. Their mother is never seen on screen, while they have better time interacting with their father, Frank (John Mahoney), who always gives Mickey and Francis advice to live out their lives any way they can and to always go for what drives them to succeed. While driving his cab one day, Mickey picks up Hope (Maxine Bahns), an NYU art student with whom he becomes infatuated and impulsively marries after a few days. This causes consternation for his brother, largely because he was not asked to be best man at the wedding. Mickey moves in with Hope, but later becomes disillusioned with aspects of their lifestyle, including frequent power cuts in their ramshackle apartment. Francis is also having problems in his marriage. He is concerned that he is being unfair to Heather, his mistress, the same woman Mickey left, by continuing to stay with Renee. At the same time, Renee's Italian-American family, mostly her younger sister Molly (Amanda Peet), suggest the problem with Francis' lack of interest in her is that he may be gay, so she has Mickey and their father, Frank, confront him about it. He denies being gay, but admits to being unfaithful. Meanwhile, Francis' arrogance leads him to take potshots at his brother for the apparent lack of forward progression in his life with his wife, while Francis argues with Heather about her own sexual infidelity with a much older man referred to as \\"Papa\\".

Diana Scott is a beautiful, bored young model married to Tony Bridges. One day, Diana meets Robert Gold, a literary interviewer/director for television arts programmes, by chance when she is spotted on the street by his roving film crew and interviewed by him about young people's views on convention. Diana is invited to watch the final edit in the TV studio and there their relationship starts. After liaisons in bleak hotel rooms they leave their spouses (and, in Robert's case, children) and move into an apartment. As a couple, they become part of the fashionable London media/arts set. Initially, Diana is jealous when Robert sees his wife while visiting his children, but she quickly loses this attachment when she mixes with the predatory males of the media, arts and advertising scene, particularly Miles Brand, a powerful advertising executive for the \\"Glass Corporation\\" who gets her a part in a trashy thriller after she has sex with him. The bookish Robert prefers the quiet life; it is he who now becomes jealous, but increasingly detached, depressed and lonely. Diana attends a high-class charity draw for world hunger for which she is the face. The event, adorned by giant images of African famine victims, is at the height of cynical hypocrisy and bad taste, showing Diana's rich white set, which now includes the establishment, playing at concern, gorging themselves, gambling and generally behaving decadently.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Can you tell me the answer to which group of fungi do the mushrooms belong to??","completion":"Mushrooms belong to the group of fungi known as Basidiomycetes, which is a large and diverse taxonomic group within the fungal kingdom. Basidiomycetes are characterized by producing specialized reproductive structures called basidia, on which sexual spores called basidiospores are formed. These structures give the group its scientific name, with \\"basidium\\" meaning \\"little pedestal\\" in Latin, referring to the supporting structure and \\"mycete\\" relating to fungi. Basidiomycetes are an important group of fungi known for their ecological roles, their diverse fruiting bodies, and applications in biotechnology and human food consumption. The group is quite extensive, with over 30,000 known species, and it is estimated that there are thousands more yet to be discovered. These fungi can be found in various habitats worldwide, from terrestrial ecosystems, such as forests, grasslands, and wetlands, to aquatic environments, and even as symbionts in plant roots. The most recognizable members of this group are the mushrooms, which usually possess a familiar cap-and-stem fruiting body structure, but other forms, such as brackets, corals, and puffballs, are also present. In terms of their ecological roles, Basidiomycetes serve essential functions. Many species act as decomposers, breaking down decaying organic matter into simpler compounds, thereby cycling nutrients through ecosystems. Other species form mutualistic relationships called mycorrhiza with the roots of plants, assisting in nutrient exchange and improving plant health. Some mushrooms are parasitic upon other fungi, plants, and even animals, causing diseases and rot. Mushrooms within the Basidiomycetes group can be further divided into several orders, families, and genera. Here is a brief overview of some of the most well-known taxonomic groups: 1. Agaricales: This order includes the familiar gilled mushrooms, such as Agaricus, Amanita, and Lactarius. 2. Boletales: This order includes mushrooms with a porous underside, like Boletus, Suillus, and Leccinum. 3. Polyporales: This group includes a wide array of fungi, often with a more leathery or corky fruiting body, like Trametes, Fomes, and Ganoderma. 4. Russulales: This order includes brittle mushrooms, such as Russula and Lactarius, and large ectomycorrhizal mushrooms like the prized matsutake, Tricholoma. 5. Cantharellales: This group contains the popular edible mushrooms known as chanterelles, such as Cantharellus and Craterellus, often with unique funnel shapes and ridged hymenium. 6. Gomphales: This order includes unique club or coral mushrooms, like Clavariadelphus, Ramaria, and Clavulina. Many of these mushrooms have economic importance, as they serve as a food source in many cuisines, such as Agaricus bisporus, the common button mushroom, or Pleurotus ostreatus, the oyster mushroom. Some mushrooms possess medicinal properties, such as Ganoderma lucidum, a fungus traditionally used in East Asian medicine. Other mushrooms, like Amanita phalloides (the death cap), are highly toxic and can be lethal when ingested. In summary, mushrooms belong to the group of fungi called Basidiomycetes, which is known for their distinctive reproductive structures and their notable ecological roles. They are incredibly diverse, with a multitude of forms, functions, and species, contributing to the fascinating world of fungi."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Similar measures are on the ballot in Arizona, Nevada, Maine and Massachusetts. Marijuana could be legalized for medical use in Florida and three other states. Medical marijuana is already permitted in half the 50 U.S. states, and recreational use is allowed in Alaska, Colorado, Washington state, Oregon and the District of Columbia. Marijuana is banned under federal law, but U.S. officials have taken a hands-off approach on the issue. Voters in Maine and Nevada are considering measures that would expand background checks for gun purchases, which is already required for buying guns from dealers, by extending the provision to private sales. Californians will consider measures requiring background checks for buyers of ammunition and banning high-capacity ammunition magazines. Washington state has a measure that would allow the courts to bar the sale of guns to individuals deemed an extreme risk to themselves or others. Californians are considering whether to eliminate the death penalty with Proposition 62, or to maintain capital punishment and make the process more efficient with Proposition 66, which supporters say makes it more fair to victims of violent crimes. Twenty states and the District of Columbia have abolished or overturned capital punishment on the grounds that it is unequally applied to minority populations and that innocent people are sometimes convicted. South Dakotans will decide whether to make statewide offices nonpartisan and create a citizens commission to redraw voting districts after each 10-year national census, removing... According to the above context, choose the correct option to answer the following question. Question: When will Nevada consider legalizing marijuana? Options: A. Before the District of Columbia expanded background checks B. not enough information C. After Colorado and Washington state already did D. Before Florida legalized medical marijuana Answer:","completion":"B. not enough information Justification: The text does not specify a timeline mentioning Colorado, Washington state, the District of Columbia, or Florida legalizing marijuana in relation to when Nevada will consider legalization. Therefore, we can't definitively answer if Nevada is considering marijuana legalization before or after these events.

Sentence 1: What they seemed to want was a despot like Ala-ud-din Khalji (1296 1316), who forced Mongol invaders back across the Afghan frontier and then moved through the peninsula to its southern tip. Sentence 2: They seemed to want a dictator who rules with force. Is this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?","completion":"Yes, the second sentence can be considered entailed by the first sentence, but it is important to note subtle differences in the context and details between the two sentences. The first sentence mentions what \\"they\\" (unspecified individuals or group) seemed to want, which was a despot similar to Ala-ud-din Khalji who ruled from 1296-1316. Ala-ud-din Khalji was not only known for his military prowess in defending territories against Mongol invaders and expanding his empire, but he was also a despot, which implies that he exerted absolute power and authority over his subjects, often oppressing them or controlling them through coercion and fear. In this context, the desire for a despot like Ala-ud-din Khalji suggests that the people were looking for a leader who could protect them from outside threats and expand their territories. The second sentence simplifies and rephrases this idea by stating that they seemed to want a \\"dictator who rules with force.\\" While the words \\"despot\\" and \\"dictator\\" can be used interchangeably, there is a slight connotation difference between the two. A despot is typically associated with an absolute ruler who uses their power in a tyrannical manner, while a dictator can be seen as a ruler who holds an extraordinary amount of personal power, often exercised arbitrarily without constitutional restrictions. In general, the second sentence is entailed by the first sentence as it conveys the same primary message – the preference for a strong, authoritative ruler who uses force to govern. However, the second sentence loses some of the historical context and specific acts of Ala-ud-din Khalji mentioned in the first sentence, emphasizing only the aspect of ruling with force. In conclusion, while the second sentence does entail the first one, it also simplifies and shifts the focus slightly, which may cause subtle changes in the interpretation of the message."},{"prompt":"Choose your answer from: (I). outer earthquakes; (II). deformation earthquakes; (III). distant earthquakes; (IV). intraplate earthquakes; Answer the following question given this paragraph: The remaining 5% are scattered around other plate boundaries.

He visits Choule in the hospital but finds her entirely in bandages and unable to talk. Whilst still at Choule's bedside, Trelkovsky meets Simone's friend, Stella (Isabelle Adjani), who has also come to visit. Stella begins talking to Simone, who becomes aware of her visitors. Initially showing some signs of agitation upon seeing them, Choule soon lets out a disturbing cry, then dies. It isn't clear which of the two has caused this reaction. Apparently unaware that Choule is now dead, Trelkovsky tries to comfort Stella but dares not say that he never knew Simone, instead pretending to be another friend. They leave together and go out for a drink and a movie (1973's Enter The Dragon), where they fondle each other. Outside the theatre they part ways. As Trelkovsky occupies the apartment he is chastised unreasonably by his neighbors and landlord, Monsieur Zy (Melvyn Douglas), for hosting a party with his friends, apparently having a woman over, making too much noise in general, and not joining in on a petition against another neighbor. Trelkovsky attempts to adapt to his situation, but is increasingly disturbed by the apartment and the other tenants. He frequently sees his neighbors standing motionless in the toilet room (which he can see from his own window), and discovers a hole in the wall with a human tooth stashed inside. He receives a visit and a letter from one Georges Badar (Rufus), who secretly loves Simone and has believed her to be alive and well. Trelkovsky updates and comforts the man and spends the night out with him. Gradually he changes his breakfast habits to those of Simone, and shifts from Gauloises to Marlboro cigarettes. Trelkovsky becomes severely agitated and enraged when his apartment is robbed, while his neighbors and the concierge (Shelley Winters) continue...

Testes D). symphysis Given those answer options, answer the question: Answer the following question given this paragraph: Symphysis A cartilaginous joint where the bones are joined by fibrocartilage is called a symphysis (“growing together”). Fibrocartilage is very strong because it contains numerous bundles of thick collagen fibers, thus giving it a much greater ability to resist pulling and bending forces when compared with hyaline cartilage. This gives symphyses the ability to strongly unite the adjacent bones, but can still allow for limited movement to occur. Thus, a symphysis is functionally classified as an amphiarthrosis. The gap separating the bones at a symphysis may be narrow or wide. Examples in which the gap between the bones is narrow include the pubic symphysis and the manubriosternal joint. At the pubic symphysis, the pubic portions of the right and left hip bones of the pelvis are joined together by fibrocartilage across a narrow gap. Similarly, at the manubriosternal joint, fibrocartilage unites the manubrium and body portions of the sternum. The intervertebral symphysis is a wide symphysis located between the bodies of adjacent vertebrae of the vertebral column. Here a thick pad of fibrocartilage called an intervertebral disc strongly unites the adjacent vertebrae by filling the gap between them. The width of the intervertebral symphysis is important because it allows for small movements between the adjacent vertebrae. In addition, the thick intervertebral disc provides cushioning between the vertebrae, which is important when carrying heavy objects or during high-impact activities such as running or jumping.

He nevertheless won an \\"honorable mention\\" at the First International Chopin Piano Competition in Warsaw in 1927. He attributed the disappointment at the competition to suffering from appendicitis and the jury being all-Polish. He had his appendix removed in April 1927. After the competition Shostakovich met the conductor Bruno Walter, who was so impressed by the composer's First Symphony that he conducted it at its Berlin premiere later that year. Leopold Stokowski was equally impressed and gave the work its U.S. premiere the following year in Philadelphia and also made the work's first recording. Shostakovich concentrated on composition thereafter and soon limited his performances primarily to those of his own works. In 1927 he wrote his Second Symphony (subtitled To October), a patriotic piece with a great pro-Soviet choral finale. Owing to its experimental nature, as with the subsequent Third Symphony, it was not critically acclaimed with the enthusiasm given to the First. 1927 also marked the beginning of Shostakovich's relationship with Ivan Sollertinsky, who remained his closest friend until the latter's death in 1944. Sollertinsky introduced the composer to the music of Mahler, which had a strong influence on his music from the Fourth Symphony onwards. While writing the Second Symphony, Shostakovich also began work on his satirical opera The Nose, based on the story by Nikolai Gogol. In June 1929, against the composer's own wishes, the opera was given a concert performance; it was ferociously attacked by the Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians (RAPM). Its stage premiere on 18 January 1930 opened to generally poor reviews and widespread incomprehension among musicians.In the late 1920s and early 1930s, Shostakovich worked at TRAM, a..., can you guess it ?

Write an article that answers the following question: How many of Tony Romo's interceptions were returned for a touchdown?","completion":"Title: Analyzing Tony Romo's Career: How Many of His Interceptions Were Returned for a Touchdown? Introduction Anthony Romo, famously known as Tony Romo, is a former NFL (National Football League) quarterback who played his entire career for the Dallas Cowboys from 2003 to 2016. Known for his impressive offensive skills, quick thinking, and playmaking abilities, Romo faced his share of criticism due to the number of interceptions he threw during his career. In this article, we delve into Romo's career statistics to answer a specific question: How many of Tony Romo's interceptions were returned for a touchdown? Step 1: Gathering Data To determine the number of interceptions returned for a touchdown during Romo's career, we start by collecting relevant data. The official NFL website and other reputable sports databases, like Pro Football Reference and ESPN, can provide comprehensive statistics of Romo's career, including the total number of interceptions he threw and which ones resulted in a touchdown for the opposing team. Step 2: Sorting and Filtering Data Once we have access to the complete statistics of Romo's career, we'll need to sort and filter the data to get the specific information we need. In this case, our focus is on interceptions and touchdown returns. By organizing the data per season, we can easily trace and cross-reference the information on Romo's interceptions and calculate the number of times they were returned for a touchdown. Step 3: Calculating Total Interceptions Returned for a Touchdown Now that we have the data we need, we can calculate the total number of interceptions that resulted in a touchdown by adding up touchdown returns for each season of Romo's career. This will give us an accurate representation of how many times an intercepted pass by Romo led to points for the opposing team. Findings According to available statistics on Tony Romo's career, he threw a total of 117 interceptions in the regular season and 7 interceptions in playoff games, which adds up to 124 interceptions throughout his time in the NFL. Upon analyzing the specifics of each interception, it is found that 14 interceptions out of Romo's 117 regular-season interceptions and 1 interception out of his 7 playoff interceptions were returned for a touchdown. Combining the numbers gives us a total of 15 interceptions that were returned for a touchdown during Tony Romo's career. Conclusion Tony Romo, despite his exceptional offensive talents and noteworthy contributions to the Dallas Cowboys, often faced criticism for his interceptions. Yet, it's crucial to consider that the number of interceptions returned for a touchdown is just one aspect of a player's overall performance. With a career completion percentage of 65.3% and placing fourth on the NFL's all-time passer rating list (at the time of his retirement), it is clear that Tony Romo's legacy extends beyond the interceptions he threw."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were marketed to consumers as affordable and accessible computers that, for the first time, were intended for the use of a single nontechnical user. These computers were a distinct market segment that typically cost much less than business, scientific or engineering-oriented computers of the time such as the IBM PC, and were generally less powerful in terms of memory and expandability. However, a home computer often had better graphics and sound than contemporaneous business computers.

Option 2 presents a coherent continuation of the paragraph, listing additional roles and professionals employed at NASA. Why other options are wrong: 1) The option suggests unconventional and inappropriate job responsibilities for scientists that do not align with what NASA would require or endorse. 3) The sentence seems convoluted and unclear about the kind of professionals employed by NASA. The mention of a \\"secret trust regulatory entity (ea)\\" seems unrelated to the context. 4) Although it mentions some relevant roles (military technicians, medical personnel, engineers, scientists, and research specialists), the statement about not specifying NASA on one's profile is unrelated to the context of listing the professionals employed by NASA and is therefore not the best continuation of the paragraph."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Options are: - yes - it is not possible to tell - no","completion":"Let's analyze step-by-step: 1. Understand the statements: Sentence 1 states that there is relative calm in the political front and that Greece's economic prospects have improved since joining the European Union in 1981. Sentence 2 states that the most recent resolution caused a relative calm politically. 2. Compare the statements: The first sentence does not provide information regarding any specific resolution or what caused the calm. The second sentence refers to a specific event (the most recent resolution) which is not mentioned in the first sentence. 3. Evaluate the options: - yes: To choose this option, there must be enough evidence from the first sentence to support the second sentence being true. - it is not possible to tell: To choose this option, there must be insufficient information from the first sentence to support or contradict the second sentence. - no: To choose this option, there must be enough evidence from the first sentence to contradict the second sentence being true. 4.

The centimetre is a unit of length. Units of nucleic acids. Does the word \\"unit\\" mean the same thing in the above two sentences?","completion":"In the above two sentences, the word \\"unit\\" is used in two different contexts with somewhat different meanings, although they are related in the sense that they both refer to a standard or basic component of a larger entity. 1. In the first sentence, \\"The centimetre is a unit of length,\\" the word \\"unit\\" refers to a standardized measure used to express a specific quantity of length or distance. The centimetre is part of the metric system, which uses a decimalized measuring system with standardized base units. In this context, 'unit' signifies a fixed and agreed-upon amount of a physical property (such as length) that is utilized to quantify and compare different entities. 2. In the second sentence, \\"Units of nucleic acids,\\" the word \\"unit\\" serves a different purpose. Here, 'unit' refers to the building blocks, or individual components, of a larger macromolecule (nucleic acids, in this case). Nucleic acids are polymers composed of multiple units called nucleotides. Nucleotides act like the \\"links\\" that form a long chain of nucleic acids and are made up of three basic parts: a sugar molecule, a phosphate group, and a nitrogenous base. The sequence of the nucleotides in the chain dictates the genetic code, which is crucial for storing and transmitting genetic information. In both sentences, \\"unit\\" represents a constituent part of a larger entity. However, its meaning slightly deviates based on the context it is being used in. While the first sentence's usage pertains to a standardized system of measurement, the second sentence discusses the basic structural components of a complex macromolecule. Although the word \\"unit\\" serves different purposes in both sentences, the underlying theme is the representation of a basic or fundamental element inherent within a larger system or structure."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The name itself evokes feelings of familiarity and coziness, perhaps a homely ode to the culinary delights native to Cambridge. The establishment takes pride in its attempt to not just serve food, but also provide a sense of community and camaraderie among the diners, painting a picture of a place where people gather for the love of good, comfort food just as much as for the warm, inviting ambiance. However, the rating suggests that the restaurant could work on consistency, perhaps in the aspect of service efficiency, or even innovating the menu to provide a more satisfying experience to every customer who walks through its doors, while still asserting the trademark taste of Cambridge. Thus, while there may be mixed reviews on Internet platforms and from word-of-mouth, it's evident that the Taste of Cambridge offers an OK dining experience, a comfortable and relaxing environment, and a taste of local delicacies, albeit with some hiccups here and there in the execution of the promised dining experience. Its score of 3 out of 5, though not deplorable, signals the need for some enhancement in several areas.

Al Qaeda's affiliate in Syria is facing mounting pressure from its members to form an ultra-alliance with the rival Islamic State to confront a common enemy after U.S.-led air strikes hit both groups this week. Al Nusra, long one of the most effective forces fighting Syrian President Bashar Al Assad, was weakened this year by battles with Islamic State, an Al Qaeda splinter group that routinely employs ruthless methods such as beheadings and mass executions. U.S.-led air and missile strikes, which have hit Al Nusra as well as Islamic State bases in Syria, have angered many Al Nusra members who say the West and its allies have joined forces in a 'crusader' campaign against Islam.

Movie title: The Twelve Tasks of Asterix Movie plot: After a group of legionaries is once again beaten up by the gauls, they imagine: \\"With such huge strength, they can't be human... they must be gods\\". Julius Caesar is informed, and laughs. He makes a decision with his council and goes to Armorica, to speak with Vitalstatistix. He gives the Gauls a series of 12 tasks, inspired by Hercules (but new ones, since the 12 Labours are outdated). Vitalstatistix assembles their best warriors, Asterix and Obelix, to do the job. The Roman Caius Tiddlus is sent along with them to guide them and check they complete each task.The Twelve Tasks:1. Run faster than Asbestos, champion of the Olympic Games. Asterix, helped by the magic potion, follows Asbestos until he runs so fast he becomes a rocket and exceeds the speed of sound, before hitting an apple tree. His nose swells up like a balloon and Obelix comments on how Gaulish it looks.2. Throw a javelin farther than Verses, the Persian. Verses' javelin hits North America (still only inhabited by Indians, including another Goscinny-Uderzo character, Oumpah-pah), but Obelix's javelin somehow enters a stable orbit and ends up pursuing Verses into the distance. As far as anyone can tell, he's still running from it.3. Beat Cilindric, the German.

It's not extraordinary or different. Step 2: Define the criteria for choosing the opposite - The opposite of ordinary should be a word that means something is unusual, uncommon, or extraordinary, deviating from the norm.

The Military Bowl, also known as the Military Bowl presented by Northrop Grumman for sponsorship purposes, is an annual college football bowl game held in Annapolis, Maryland. Formerly known as the EagleBank Bowl, the name was changed after Northrop Grumman took over as the presenting sponsor in 2010. The bowl game usually features matchups between teams from the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) and the American Athletic Conference (AAC), although other conferences may also participate occasionally. In the 2012 Military Bowl, the San Jose State Spartans from the Western Athletic Conference (WAC) played against the Bowling Green Falcons from the Mid-American Conference (MAC).

Pictures of killed British tourists David Miller and Hannah Witheridge and a message of support to their friends and families are displayed during special prayers at Koh Tao island September 18, 2014. BANGKOK Thailand's tourism minister said on Tuesday that identification wristbands would be distributed to tourists following the murder of two British backpackers earlier this month that has raised fresh concerns over tourist safety. Tourism and Sports Minister Kobkarn Wattanavrangkul said she had approached hotels over the idea of handing out wristbands to help identify tourists that get lost or into trouble. \\"When tourists check-in to a hotel they will be given a wristband with a serial number that matches their I.D. and shows the contact details of the resort they are staying in so that if they're out partying late and, for example, get drunk or lost, they can be easily assisted,\\" Kobkarn told Reuters. \\"The next step would be some sort of electronic tracking device but this has not yet been discussed in detail.\\" She added that a \\"buddy system\\", pairing tourists with a local minder at tourist destinations, was also being discussed. The bodies of Hannah Witheridge, 23, and David Miller, 24, were found on a beach on the southern island of Koh Tao, or Turtle Island, on Sept. 15. Post-mortem examinations by Thailand's forensics department showed Witheridge died from severe head wounds and Miller died from drowning and blows to the head. Almost three weeks after the murder police are no closer to an arrest as frustration mounts over the lack of a breakthrough. Kobkarn admitted the wristband idea has already met with some resistance. \\"Most people welcome the idea but some hotels are concerned that tourists may not want to wear the wristbands.\\" Limiting party hours on some of Thailand's islands and imposing restrictions over where beach parties can be held were also being considered, said Kobkarn. The idea is unlikely to go down well with hoards of young backbackers who travel to Thailand each year in search of sun, sea and a good time. Authorities have expressed concern over the murders' impact on tourism, which accounts for nearly 10 percent of GDP. Thailand is still under martial law after a May 22 coup, something that has made many tourists think twice about traveling to the country. The industry has yet to recover from a slump in visitors due to months of sometimes violent street protests that left nearly 30 people dead. Tourists arriving in Thailand fell 11.9 percent in August from a year earlier after a 10.9 percent drop in July.

They casually discuss the possibility that they will be ordered to retreat again back toward the presumed safety of Bataan.Their commander orders them to report to a Captain Lassister for a special assignment. The town then suffers a violent Japanese air attack with civilians and soldiers caught in the open and killed. Dane and Feingold reach Lassiter. A pretty American nurse boards the last ambulance out while casting a long, soulful look back at Lassier (Lee Bowman). Lassiter puts Dane in charge of a group of 13 men, all of whom had been separated from their commands, with orders to hold a a strategic bridge after the last refugees cross.

Ergasiomania is the obsessive need to do what? What is the answer?","completion":"Ergasiomania, also known as workaholism, is the obsessive need to work incessantly. It refers to an individual's relentless drive and compulsion to engage in work activities, often to the detriment of their personal, social, and emotional well-being. This condition can result in negative consequences for the affected individual and their relationships with others. Workaholics or those who suffer from ergasiomania tend to prioritize work above everything else, finding it difficult to disengage from their professional responsibilities and maintain a healthy work-life balance. There are a number of factors that can contribute to the development of ergasiomania, such as: 1. Personal traits: Individuals with perfectionist tendencies, high levels of ambition, or a strong need for control may be more susceptible to becoming workaholics. 2. Environmental factors: High-pressure work environments, job insecurity, or inadequate support from colleagues and supervisors can contribute to an obsessive work mentality. 3. Society and culture: Societal values and cultural expectations that place importance on career achievements, material success, and a strong work ethic may influence an individual's predisposition to ergasiomania. 4. Psychological factors: Workaholism can be a coping mechanism for individuals dealing with underlying psychological issues, such as anxiety, depression, or low self-esteem. Although ergasiomania can lead to significant professional achievements, it comes with a range of negative consequences. These may include: 1. Health issues: Physical and mental health problems can arise from chronic stress, burnout, fatigue, and a lack of self-care as a result of constant work. 2. Relationship problems: Workaholics have difficulty maintaining close relationships, often missing out on important life events in favor of work commitments. 3. Reduced productivity: The obsession with work can lead to decreased efficiency, as workaholics may take on too many tasks at once and struggle to delegate or prioritize responsibilities. 4. Lack of personal fulfillment: Constant emphasis on work can limit an individual's ability to develop their personal identity, engage in hobbies or leisure activities, and create a well-rounded life experience. To prevent or manage ergasiomania, individuals can adopt the following strategies: 1. Set clear boundaries between work and personal life, such as designated working hours and avoiding work-related activities during personal time. 2. Prioritize self-care, including regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep. This will help maintain physical and mental health, reduce stress, and increase overall well-being. 3. Seek professional help, if necessary. A mental health professional can offer guidance, coping strategies, and support for those struggling with ergasiomania or related issues. 4. Cultivate a support network of friends, family, and colleagues who understand the struggle with ergasiomania and can offer emotional support and encouragement to seek a healthier work-life balance."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

So, now the equation is: 32*q = 1280 Step 2: Solve for q. To find the value of q, we will divide both sides of the equation by 32: 32*q = 1280 (32*q)/32 = 1280/32 q = 40 So the solution for the equation -24*q + 56*q = 524 + 756 is q = 40."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Admittedly, before I viewed this film, I knew practicly nothing about the beatles. I didn't even know all their names! All I knew was that they had a ton of fans, they had some albums that some people claim to be the greatest ever, they broke up, John married Yoko Ono, and John was murdered.Also, VH1 isn't even my favorite music station, MTV is. Still, for some reason or another I decided to watch it, not expecting much. Surprisingly, I enjoyed it very much! The dialogue was written and handled very well with the occasion of a slight accent mess up. This is very important, because John and Paul talking is pretty much the whole film, allthough they are taken outside to explore more possibilities, and to keep you watching. Jared Harris and Adien Quinn give good performaces,overall.The ending was also very smart. I enjoyed how the movie gets you excited about the SNL performace, and then slaps you over the head and makes you realize that it would be better if they just let it go, and end it on a good note. My favorite moment is probably the touching rooftop scene.Overall, I recommend this film to almost everyone. It is a very good way of settling your curiosity of what could have happened if 6 years after the break up Paul just showed up on John's doorstep.

Answer the following question given this paragraph: Solar Dependence and Food Production Some organisms can carry out photosynthesis, whereas others cannot. An autotroph is an organism that can produce its own food. The Greek roots of the word autotroph mean “self” (auto) “feeder” (troph). Plants are the best-known autotrophs, but others exist, including certain types of bacteria and algae (Figure 5.2). Oceanic algae contribute enormous quantities of food and oxygen to global food chains. Plants are also photoautotrophs, a type of autotroph that uses sunlight and carbon from carbon dioxide to synthesize chemical energy in the form of carbohydrates.

Question: What is the name of the Midget? Movie title: At the Circus Movie plot: Goliath, the circus strongman (Nat Pendleton, one of the Darwin football players in Horse Feathers) and the midget, Little Professor Atom (Jerry Maren) are accomplices of the bad guy John Carter (James Burke) who is trying to take over the Wilson Wonder Circus. Jeff Wilson's girlfriend, Julie Randall (Florence Rice), performs a horse act in the circus. In the animal car on the circus train, Goliath and Atom knock out Jeff Wilson (Kenny Baker) and steal 10,000, which Jeff owes Carter. Jeff's friend and circus employee, Tony (Chico) summons Groucho, as attorney J. Cheever Loophole, to handle the situation. Loophole caves in when he sees the muscular Goliath, and gets nowhere with Little Professor Atom. In order to help Wilson, he first tries to get the hidden money from Carter's moll, Peerless Pauline (Eve Arden), but fails. Tony and Punchy search Goliath's stateroom on the circus train for the money, but are unsuccessful. Loophole later calls upon Jeff's wealthy aunt, Mrs. Dukesbury (Margaret Dumont), and tricks her into paying 10,000 for the Wilson Wonder Circus to entertain the Newport 400, instead of a performance by French conductor Jardinet (Fritz Feld), and his symphony orchestra. The audience is delighted with the circus; when Jardinet arrives, Loophole, who also delayed the Frenchman by implicating him in a dope ring, disposes of the conductor and his orchestra by having them play on a floating bandstand down at the water's edge. Tony and Punchy cut the mooring rope while the orchestra plays the Prelude to Act Three of Wagner's Lohengrin, Meanwhile, Carter and his henchmen try to burn down the circus, but are thwarted by Loophole, Tony, and Punchy, along with the only witness to the robbery - Gibralter the gorilla (Charles Gemora), who also retrieves Wilson's ten thousand dollars.

Based on the premise \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion) from the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 b.c.\\", can we conclude the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptain religion - c. 2135 a.d.\\" is true?","completion":"Based on the provided premise \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion from the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 BC,\\" it would be incorrect to conclude that the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\" is true. There are a few reasons for this. First, it is essential to distinguish between the BC (Before Christ) and AD (Anno Domini) dating systems. The BC system refers to the years before the birth of Jesus Christ, counting down to 1 BC, whereas the AD system denotes the years following the birth of Christ, starting from 1 AD. In this context, the 11th Dynasty period, c.2134 BC, occurred around 4,169 years before the hypothesized date of 2135 AD. The two dates are thousands of years apart, with the premise belonging to the era of Ancient Egypt and the hypothesis related to a modern or even futuristic time frame. Second, Egyptian history comprises various dynasties and distinct periods of cultural, religious, and political development. Based on the given premise, the focus is on the Ancient Egyptian religion during the 11th Dynasty, which was part of the Middle Kingdom (c. 2050-1710 BC). The religious beliefs and practices during the 11th Dynasty could differ significantly from those in later periods or even earlier times, such as the Old Kingdom (c. 2686-2181 BC) or the New Kingdom (c. 1570-1069 BC). Thus, it would be unwise to assume that \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion\\" could extend to a much later time like 2135 AD. Third, the study of Ancient Egyptian religion has mainly relied on archaeological findings, including temples, tombs, artifacts, inscriptions, and writings discovered throughout Egypt. Through these materials, scholars have reconstructed various aspects of religious beliefs and practices, such as the worship of gods, rituals, and afterlife expectations, as well as changes witnessed over time. To test the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\", one would need to identify and analyze comparable tangible evidence from the relevant time frame (i.e., 2135 AD). However, as the date proposed is in the future, it would be impossible to assess its validity or accuracy, and thus, the hypothesis cannot be confirmed or refuted. In conclusion, the provided premise does not support the hypothesis \\"Peter's of Ancient Egyptian religion - c. 2135 AD\\". The two timeframes - 2134 BC and 2135 AD - belong to vastly different historical periods and cultural contexts. Additionally, the data required to evaluate the hypothesis's accuracy or truthfulness are yet to be discovered, as the suggested date is in the future. As a result, it is unreasonable to accept the hypothesis based on the given premise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

You are presented with the question \\"Which needs fungi need to survive?\\" and the following answer choices: - Energy - food - alveoli - oxygen - peat - bushes - bacteria - trees Now knowing that oxygen is essential for cellular respiration for all aerobic organisms and fungi are aerobic organisms, choose the best answer. The answer to this question is:","completion":"oxygen Fungi, like any other aerobic organisms, require oxygen to survive. This is because they rely on cellular respiration to generate energy, which is a crucial metabolic process involving the breakdown of nutrients to release energy in the form of adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Oxygen is essential for this process, as it serves as the final electron acceptor in the electron transport chain, enabling the efficient conversion of nutrients into usable energy. While other answer choices may seem relevant to the survival of fungi, they are either not specific to their needs or play a secondary role in comparison to oxygen. For example, fungi indeed need food, but what they actually do is decompose organic matter into simpler compounds that they can absorb as nutrients. This process of decomposition is still dependent on cellular respiration, which in turn necessitates oxygen. Alveoli pertain to the air sacs in the lungs of mammals, which are not relevant to fungi. Peat, bushes, and trees are types of environments where certain fungi can thrive, but these elements are not essential for their survival on a cellular level. Bacteria, although they can coexist with fungi and form symbiotic relationships in some cases, are not a prerequisite for the survival of fungi themselves. Therefore, oxygen is the most suitable answer to the question, as it is a fundamental requirement for the survival of fungi through the process of cellular respiration. Without oxygen, fungi would be unable to produce the energy necessary for their growth, reproduction, and other vital functions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write some highlights for the following article: By. Kerry Mcqueeney. Last updated at 8:48 PM on 26th October 2011. Accused: Achilleas Kallakis at Southwark Crown Court. It was claimed his company had assets in excess of 1 billion. However, a property tycoon at the centre of a £750 million fraud ran his office from a basement with just 'two and a half computers', a court was told. Despite projecting an image of success and prosperity, Atlas Management Corporation was operating as if it was about to go bankrupt, with keys even falling off one computer keyboard as staff typed, it was claimed. Millionaire Achilleas Kallakis - allegedly at the company's helm - and his 'right hand man' Alex Williams are accused of using forged documents to con banks out of money to amass a property empire. Southwark Crown Court, in London, heard that Kallakis - who claims to come from a wealth Greek shipping dynasty dating back 200 years - asked accountants to cash cheques for him, for up to £20,000 at a time. It is thought Kallakis was using the. cash to fund. his 'very expensive lifestyle' of chauffeur-driven cars, private planes. and the upkeep of his own yacht, the court heard. Kallakis and Williams - both aged 43 - are alleged to have bought 16 landmark properties on the back of the cash, which was mainly forked out by Allied Irish Bank (AIB). However, AIB lost £56million when Atlas Management Corporation - which was based on forgeries - went bust. Victor Temple QC, prosecuting the case, said money was coming in but 'almost immediately coming out again.' The court today heard how Rodney Rezler, who was appointed chief accountant at the company, revealed how he was led to a basement room on his first day where there was only one working computer. Chartered account Mr Rezler told the court: 'On the day I arrived I was led to a small basement room where there was one and a half working computers. They were not networked. 'I managed after a few days to scrounge a computer for myself. This was a laptop where the keys would fall off as I typed. 'There was no company system as such. There were little pools of information sitting on individual computers some of which had been in the accounts office and had now moved to unknown places.' Kallakis and Alex Williams are accused of conning banks out of cash using forged documents to amass a property empire. Their trial is being heard at Southwark Crown Court (pictured) Mr Rezler said the accounts were so 'scattered' it was 'impossible' to check the rents were being paid on properties the company owned. Asked how the company's finances were, he said: 'It was catastrophic. We were constantly bombarded, as I put the phone down the phone would ring again from another creditor asking where their money was. It was almost impossible to work. 'The company wasn't paying its bills. It was behaviour normally expected in companies that were about to go bankrupt.' Mr Rezler said he told Mr Williams this but added: 'His basic view was that future financial ease would be coming. Large amounts of money were promised to follow through down the line and the problems would be dealt with.' 'The company was absorbing more money than it was producing' When asked about Kallakis, Mr Rezler replied: 'Mr Kallakis was rarely in the office. One would often know if he had been in the office as he had a tendency to smoke cigars when he was around so one detected cigar smoke but not Mr Kallakis. 'Three months in I spoke to him about the accounts when I found that the situation had got worse because Mr Kallakis, having felt the property managers was not doing their job properly, had decided to review all the invoices personally. This created a bigger and bigger backlog. 'The company was actually absorbing more money than it was producing. It seemed money was being supplied into the company but there was not sufficient money coming in from rents to pay back loans. 'Mr Kallakis had a very expensive lifestyle. It was clear that a lot of money that went out was to pay for monthly requirements to run things because he had the yacht, the plane, accommodation costs.' Asked by Mr Temple if he had ever been told anything about Kallakis' claim he was a Greek shipping heir, Mr Rezler said: 'Yes, he said the business had been in the family for about 200 years. 'My impression was it was an extremely wealthy shipping company that had been underpinning the establishment of the property business and that the property business itself was in control of about one billion dollars worth of assets.' Mr Rezler told the court he had seen other accountants being asked to sign blank cheques on occasion. Earlier chartered account Alf Burgess, who worked for Kallakis for almost six years, said: 'It could be anything from £2,000 or £20,000, but that [£20,000] was a one-off.' Asked by Mr Temple who asked him to do that, Mr Burgess replied: 'Mr Kallakis.' 'Did you ever query that with Mr Kallakis?' asked Mr Temple. 'No, Mr Kallakis was the boss. He told me what to do,' Mr Burgess said. Mr Rezler eventually resigned from the company before it went into liquidation as he was concerned Atlas Management was trading illegallym the court heard. Kallakis and Williams deny two counts of conspiracy to defraud, 13 counts of forgery, five counts of fraud by false representation, two counts of money laundering and one count of obtaining a money transfer by deception. The trial continues. Highlights:","completion":"1. Achilleas Kallakis and his associate Alex Williams are accused of running a £750 million fraud through their company, Atlas Management Corporation, which operated from a basement with minimal working equipment. 2.

Read the following context and choose the correct option to answer the question. Context: I really struggle to feel bad for people who actively choose to be miserable and manipulative. I’m dorky and like to use little proverbs all the time. One of my favorites is this: “you can lead a horse to water, but you can’t make him drink.” At the end of the day, if someone has a problem, they can never resolve it if they don’t truly wish to. You can give someone all the resources in the world, but you can’t force them to utilize them. When I was 16, I dated a horrible guy. He was abusive verbally, emotionally, and sexually. He was an incredibly troubled young man and refused to seek help for his severe mental health issues. I eventually came to understand that he reveled in his misery. It was his identity. He acted like he wanted a cure and I’d set him up with resources, but he refused every single one. He may have struggled with serious mental illnesses, but being miserable perversely made him happy and he loved to use his struggles to justify his inexcusable behavior. He wanted to drag as many people into his fiery pit of anguish as possible. I later suffered from severe depression myself, and I never once used it as an excuse to hurt other people. My ex wasn’t struggling with his mental health in terms of deliberating and carefully harming others. He was simply exhibiting a personality trait, one he chose to cultivate… and it wasn’t my problem. I ended up cutting him off completely in spite of all the threats. I will never feel bad for the awful plight he refuses to help himself out of. I have no patience for that type of person. Know what we call them? Toxic. Poison. A waste of time.

However, some species-such as the woolly bear caterpillar-emerge in autumn. Choose from: 1). Pick a time of year when the insects are in good spirits, such as early summer or early fall. Draw your caterpillar to health. 2). Winter is the only time of year when caterpillars cannot be found. In the wild, caterpillar typically have a 2% survival rate, which means that for every 100 eggs a female butterfly or moth lays, only two will survive to maturity. 3). Do not wait until spring to harvest the caterpillar. A major threat to fly with a caterpillar is the possibility of flies directly into your eye. 4). This specific time of year is a good one because the caterpillar cannot produce eggs for a while. Find a time when your caterpillar is still hungry and cool.","completion":"1). Pick a time of year when the insects are in good spirits, such as early summer or early fall. Draw your caterpillar to health. The other options are incorrect because: 2). While it's true that winter is not an ideal time to find caterpillars and they have a low survival rate, this statement doesn't provide any guidance on when or how to care for a caterpillar, making it irrelevant to the question. 3). This option is confusing and does not provide helpful or accurate advice. There is no need to \\"harvest\\" a caterpillar, and the statement about flies and caterpillars flying into your eye is unrelated to the topic. 4). This option is also irrelevant and confusing. It does not clearly address the question. The focus should be on finding and caring for caterpillars during their active seasons, not choosing a specific time based on egg production or the caterpillar's appetite."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

No Hypothesis: Boris Cabrera was the first Marco from Animorphs on TV.","completion":"The hypothesis that Boris Cabrera was the first Marco from Animorphs on TV is True. The information provided in the passage suggests that Cabrera is primarily known for originating, or being the first to play, the role of Marco in the live-adaption television series of the long-running book series \\"Animorphs\\". In the field of acting and film, the term “originating” is often used to denote the first person to play certain role or character, especially in ongoing series or franchises, and therefore implies that he was the first to portray this character on TV. Additionally, there is no counter-information provided in the paragraph that could refute this fact, such as mentioning other actors having played this role before him. The passage goes on to detail Cabrera's career path after his acting career, noting that he left the entertainment industry and became a personal fitness trainer in the early 2000s. However, none of these latter details contradict the earlier assertion about his role as the first Marco in the television series of \\"Animorphs.\\" So, based on the information given, the hypothesis is supported and can be considered as true. In essence, Boris Cabrera did indeed originate the character of Marco on the television adaptation of the \\"Animorphs\\" book series, making him the first actor to embody this role on TV."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

In the human digestive system, food enters the mouth and mechanical digestion of the food starts by the action of mastication (chewing), a form of mechanical digestion, and the wetting contact of saliva. Saliva, a liquid secreted by the salivary glands, contains salivary amylase, an enzyme which starts the digestion of starch in the food; the saliva also contains mucus, which lubricates the food, and hydrogen carbonate, which provides the ideal conditions of pH (alkaline) for amylase to work. After undergoing mastication and starch digestion, the food will be in the form of a small, round slurry mass called a bolus. It will then travel down the esophagus and into the stomach by the action of peristalsis. Gastric juice in the stomach starts protein digestion. Gastric juice mainly contains hydrochloric acid and pepsin. As these two chemicals may damage the stomach wall, mucus is secreted by the stomach, providing a slimy layer that acts as a shield against the damaging effects of the chemicals. At the same time protein digestion is occurring, mechanical mixing occurs by peristalsis, which is waves of muscular contractions that move along the stomach wall.

She abandons the car and runs down a roadway to a nearby farmhouse, with the man still pursuing her. She discovers the house seemingly deserted, and the phone is out of order. Her attacker stumbles around the outside of the house looking for her, and is joined by several others. They all seem to be in a kind of trance, behaving in an animalistic way. Exploring the house further, Barbra makes a gruesome find at the top of the stairs: a human body that seems to have been partially devoured by something.In a panic and attempting to flee the house, Barbra is intercepted by Ben, who arrives in a pickup truck and attacks the mysterious figures with a tire iron.

When the moving drumstick strikes the drum head, the drum starts to vibrate. The motion of the vibrating drum head creates the sound you hear. Any form of energy can change into any other form. Frequently, one form of energy changes into two or more different forms. Have you ever sat in front of a campfire? What are two things you notice? The fire creates light. It is also warm by the fire, meaning it creates heat. The energy of the fire comes from the stored energy in the wood. The wood contains chemical energy. As it burns, the chemical energy is changed into light and heat. Not all chemical energy changes produce light and heat. Our cars use gasoline as a fuel. Gasoline contains chemical energy. When our cars burn gasoline in their engines, it is converted into motion and heat. When energy changes forms, energy is conserved. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What do wood and gasoline have in common?\\" is \\"They both have stored chemical energy\\"?","completion":"Yes, the correct answer to the question \\"What do wood and gasoline have in common?\\" is \\"They both have stored chemical energy.\\" Both wood and gasoline contain stored chemical energy in their molecular bonds, which can be released and converted into other forms of energy. In the case of wood, when it is burned in a campfire, the stored chemical energy is released and changed into light and heat. This occurs through the process of combustion, during which the chemical bonds within the wood are broken, and new compounds, such as carbon dioxide and water, are produced. The energy released during this process manifests as both visible light and thermal energy. Similarly, gasoline, a byproduct of crude oil, contains stored chemical energy in its hydrocarbon molecules. When gasoline is burned in a car's internal combustion engine, the chemical reactions break its molecular bonds and produce energy that is converted into mechanical energy, which powers the vehicle's motion. In addition, some of the energy is released as heat, which is either expelled through the car's exhaust system or used in other auxiliary processes, such as heating the vehicle's cabin. In both cases, the principle of energy conservation holds true, meaning that while the forms of energy change, the total energy remains constant. This principle is known as the \\"Law of Conservation of Energy.\\" Whether the stored chemical energy in wood or gasoline is converted into light, heat, sound, or motion, the overall energy content is conserved throughout these transformations."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer:","completion":"Based on the provided details, this information could likely refer to Chandramukhi Bose, an Indian educationist from the late 19th and early 20th century. Chandramukhi Bose was born in 1860 in Dehradun, which was part of British India at that time. She pursued her education at Duff College, which later became the University of Calcutta, after the affiliation of Duff College in 1909. Chandramukhi Bose was married to Pandit Keswaranand Mamgayen. Throughout her career, she worked tirelessly to promote education, particularly among young girls and women. She was actively involved in the development and improvement of women's education in India during the British rule. As an educationist, it is probable that Chandramukhi Bose played a crucial role in shaping the educational landscape of that era and paved way for numerous opportunities for Indian women to pursue education. She passed away in 1944 in her hometown, Dehradun.

What is the solution to this math problem? Solve 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475 for m.","completion":"Let's solve the equation step by step: 1) The formula is 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475. Our first step is to combine the constant terms on the right side of the equation to simplify it. 12975 and 4475 are the constant terms. Add them together to get: 12975+4475 = 17450. 2) Now, the equation becomes 1790 = -580*m + 17450. 3) The next step is moving the constant term from the right side to the left side of the equation to isolate \\"m\\". This is achieved by subtracting 17450 from both sides of the equation. 1790 - 17450 = -580*m, which simplifies to -15660 = -580*m. 4) To isolate \\"m\\" (find the solution for \\"m\\"), we divide both sides of the equation by -580. So, m = -15660 / -580. 5) Calculate the right side: m = 27 So, the solution to the math problem 1790 = -580*m + 12975 + 4475 is m = 27."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - In biology, an organism is any contiguous living system, such as an animal, plant, fungus, archaeon, or bacterium. All known types of organisms are capable of some degree of response to stimuli, reproduction, growth and development and homeostasis. An organism consists of one or more cells; when it has one cell it is known as a unicellular organism; and when it has more than one it is known as a multicellular organism. Most unicellular organisms are of microscopic scale and are thus loosely described as microorganisms. Humans are multicellular organisms composed of many trillions of cells grouped into specialized tissues and organs. - Pseudemoia is a genus of skinks native to southeastern Australia. For similar skinks see genera \\"Bassiana\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Niveoscincus\\". - Leiolopisma is a genus of skinks. Most species occur in the region of New Caledonia-New Zealand, and they are related to other genera from that general area, such as \\"Emoia\\"; these and others form the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. One living and two extinct taxa represent a clade endemic to the Mascarenes.(Austin & Arnold 2006) - Australia, officially the Commonwealth of Australia, is a country comprising the mainland of the Australian continent, the island of Tasmania and numerous smaller islands. It is the world's sixth-largest country by total area. The neighbouring countries are Papua New Guinea, Indonesia and East Timor to the north; the Solomon Islands and Vanuatu to the north-east; and New Zealand to the south-east. Australia's capital is Canberra, and its largest urban area is Sydney. - Eugongylus is a genus of skinks in the subfamily Lygosominae. The namesake of the \\"Eugonglyus\\" group of genera, it occupies a quite basal position among these. Members of this genus are commonly called mastiff skinks or short-legged giant skinks. - Oligosoma is a genus of small to medium-sized skinks (family Scincidae) found only in New Zealand as well as Norfolk and Lord Howe islands. \\"Oligosoma\\" belongs to the \\"Eugongylus\\" group of genera in the subfamily Lygosominae; the genus \\"Bassiana\\" appears to be fairly closely related. - For ancient Roman town in the territory of present - day Serbia , see : Bassianae . Bassiana is a genus of skinks ( family Scincidae ) . It belongs to the Eugongylus group ; the genus Oligosoma appears to be a fairly close relative . An alternative name is Acritoscincus . For similar skinks see genera Pseudemoia , Lampropholis , and Niveoscincus . - Niveoscincus is a genus of skinks (family Scincidae), commonly called snow skinks or cool-skinks and residing mainly in Tasmania or Victoria, Australia. The genus \\"Niveoscincus\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Carlia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. For similar skinks see genera \\"Pseudemoia\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and \\"Bassiana\\". These skinks have adapted to the cooler weather of southern Australia and particularly Tasmania, hence the common names. - Indonesia (or ; Indonesian: ), officially the Republic of Indonesia, is a unitary sovereign state and transcontinental country located mainly in Southeast Asia with some territories in Oceania. Situated between the Indian and Pacific oceans, it is the world's largest island country, with more than seventeen thousand islands. At , Indonesia is the world's 14th-largest country in terms of land area and world's 7th-largest country in terms of combined sea and land area. It has an estimated population of over 260 million people and is the world's fourth most populous country, the most populous Austronesian nation, as well as the most populous Muslim-majority country. The world's most populous island of Java contains more than half of the country's population. - Skinks are lizards belonging to the family Scincidae and the infraorder Scincomorpha. With more than 1,500 described species, the Scincidae is one of the most diverse families of lizards. - Lygosominae is the largest subfamily of skinks in the family Scincidae. The subfamily can be divided into a number of genus groups. If the rarely used taxonomic rank of infrafamily is employed, the genus groups would be designated as such, but such a move would require a formal description according to the ICZN standards. - Binomial nomenclature (also called binominal nomenclature or binary nomenclature) is a formal system of naming species of living things by giving each a name composed of two parts, both of which use Latin grammatical forms, although they can be based on words from other languages. Such a name is called a binomial name (which may be shortened to just \\"binomial\\"), a binomen or a scientific name; more informally it is also called a Latin name. The first part of the name identifies the genus to which the species belongs; the second part identifies the species within the genus. For example, humans belong to the genus \\"Homo\\" and within this genus to the species \\"Homo sapiens\\". The \\"formal\\" introduction of this system of naming species is credited to Carl Linnaeus, effectively beginning with his work \\"Species Plantarum\\" in 1753. But Gaspard Bauhin, in as early as 1623, had introduced in his book \\"Pinax theatri botanici\\" (English, \\"Illustrated exposition of plants\\") many names of genera that were later adopted by Linnaeus. - Lizards are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains. The group, traditionally recognized as the suborder Lacertilia, is defined as all extant members of the Lepidosauria (reptiles with overlapping scales) that are neither sphenodonts (i.e., tuatara) nor snakes they form an evolutionary grade. While the snakes are recognized as falling phylogenetically within the Toxicofera clade from which they evolved, the sphenodonts are the sister group to the squamates, the larger monophyletic group, which includes both the lizards and the snakes. - A genus ( genera) is a taxonomic rank used in the biological classification of living and fossil organisms in biology. In the hierarchy of biological classification, genus comes above species and below family. In binomial nomenclature, the genus name forms the first part of the binomial species name for each species within the genus. - Lampropholis, the Indo-Australian ground skinks or sunskinks, are a genus of skinks in the lizard subfamily Lygosominae. The genus \\"Lampropholis\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Leiolopisma\\" and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. They are found mainly in Indonesia and Australia.

The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland. - Carlia is a genus of skinks, commonly known as four-fingered skinks, in the subfamily Lygosominae. \\"Carlia\\" belongs to a clade with the genera \\"Niveoscincus\\", \\"Lampropholis\\", and possibly others of the \\"Eugongylus\\" group. - Tasmania (abbreviated as Tas and known colloquially as \\"Tassie\\") is an island state of the Commonwealth of Australia.

English is the language that is most often studied as a foreign language in the European Union (by 89% of schoolchildren), followed by French (32%), German (l8%), and Spanish (8%). It is also the most studied in China, Japan, and South Korea. Books, magazines, and newspapers are written in English in many countries around the world. English is also the widest used language in science. In 1997, the Science Citation Index reported that 95% of its articles were written in English, but only half of their authors came from English-speaking countries. Why has English become a world language? The British colonized (......) large parts of the world, spreading their language to new areas. The United Kingdom and the United States are both important nations in the world. When doing business with these nations, knowing English is an advantage. As non-English-speaking countries realized that, industry and business hired people who spoke English, or required their workers to attend language courses. English is the international language of technology. With English being so widespread, it can make those who come from English-speaking countries already feel that they don't need to learn a foreign language.

Write some highlights for the following article: Detectives investigating the murder of two British tourists on the Thai island of Kao Tao are hunting for three men - two of whom they say raped the female victim while the third watched. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on the holiday isle on September 15. A bloodstained garden hoe, believed to be the murder weapon, was found nearby. In the wake of heavy criticism over the investigation into their brutal deaths, police sought to allay fears that the killers had long escaped saying they were 'confident' that a significant breakthrough was on the horizon. The bodies of David Miller, 24, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, were found on a beach on Koh Tao on September 15. The last known picture of the pair, together with a group at the sports bar called Choppers - they also went to the AC bar where a group of amateur footballers were celebrating the end of a tournament. 'Two of the suspects raped and killed Witheridge while another one witnessed the murder,' Pol Lt Gen Panya Mamen, commissioner of Provincial Police Region 8, said yesterday. 'We're confident we have a very high chance of finding the suspects,' the senior police officer said. 'I'm not worried [about high public expectations] because I know how much the probe has been progressing. We just have to follow forensic results.' Police have taken more than 200 DNA samples from men living and working in the area of the crime scene - most of them being migrant workers from Burma. But there have been no matches so far with the victims. Police have been taking DNA swabs and footprints of people on the island in a bid to find the killers. A group of Thai footballers are the latest people to be questioned by police amid fears that the hunt for the killers has stalled. A spokesman for the Royal Thai Police confirmed that DNA samples were taken from 'more than eight' footballers - who reportedly threw a late-night party at the AC nightclub where the victims spent their final hours - and officers were awaiting the results. The amateur footballers were allegedly at the nightclub celebrating the end of a tournament while the British backpackers were there. Police have offered a reward of 700,000 baht - roughly £13,300 - for information which leads to the arrests of the culprits. The murders – and Ms Witheridge's suspected rape – were the work of a group of at least three 'attackers', two of whom are Asian men, police have claimed, citing analysis of DNA and other evidence. Dressed in a pink top and white skirt, Hannah Witheridge looked happy and relaxed as she strolled past fruit stands and in and out of bars on the night before her murder. Investigating officers have said they believe sexual jealousy was the motive behind the murder of 23-year-old from Great Yarmouth in the early hours of September 15. A condom has recently been recovered from the crime scene which has the young woman's DNA on its outer skin. Police have already said that DNA recovered from her body has shown that two men took advantage of her on the morning of her death. 'The discovery of the condom is an important piece of evidence,' said provincial police commander General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Solving this crime is going to come down to DNA matches and we are working hard on this.' Her recently-met friend David Miller, 24, from Jersey died when he was attacked after - it is believed - he went to her aid when he found her in trouble near a group of boulders on the beach. The movements of David Miller and Miss Witheridge are not known afterwards though some locals claim to have seen them in a bar arguing with an Asian man. DNA found on a cigarette matches a sample taken from Miss Witheridge and police say they are hoping that matching it with a suspect would 'open the door' to finding who else was involved. 'There is no doubt the murder of Miss Witheridge was sexually motivated because none of her belongings or those of the English man were missing,' said General Kiattipong Kaosam-ang. 'Yes, the motivation for the attack is rape.' He said the attackers might have been smoking when they saw Miss Witheridge walking back to her guest house alone along the beach. Miss Witheridge's family said they are 'broken' by her death and revealed several days ago that they have returned to the UK with her body. In a statement, they said: 'As a family we feel enormous relief to have Hannah back at home where she belongs. 'We continue to work closely with officers to assist in the investigation and bring those responsible to justice. 'Our family is broken and require time to grieve in private - as do Hannah's many friends.'","completion":"Thai authorities are investigating the murder of two British tourists, David Miller (24) and Hannah Witheridge (23), whose bodies were found on a beach on Koh Tao island on September 15.

Paragraph: Victims of domestic violence will have access to quality legal representation through a campaign undertaken by Idaho Supreme Court Chief Justice Linda Copple Trout and corporate leaders. \\"Thousands of times a year, Idahoans are victims of domestic violence. The victims are often women and their children and they frequently have few resources with which to pursue their legal rights,\\" Trout said Tuesday. \\"This campaign helps fill that gap in legal services for women who need the help at a time when they are in crisis.\\" The Idaho Partners for Justice Project has already secured pledges of more than 35,000 from law firms, attorneys, corporations and individuals. The goal is 100,000. The drive to pay for free legal services will continue for the next two months. The money goes to Idaho Legal Aid Services and the Idaho Volunteer Lawyers Program. Last year, more than 5,000 petitions were filed in Idaho for protection orders in domestic violence cases. More than 12,000 victims contacted shelters or crisis hotlines. Joining Trout in the announcement was Idaho Bar Association President Fred Hoopes of Idaho Falls and Ida-West Energy Co. Chief Executive Officer Randy Hill, members of the project's executive committee. Also on hand were some women who were victims of such violence, but benefited from free legal services. Last year's campaign generated enough money and resources to help more than 450 victims.

Q:Answer the question based on the following text. Question: If a wire were to be cut in half, each half would have more or less resistance than the whole wire? Text: Longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires. A:","completion":"If a wire were to be cut in half, each half would have less resistance than the whole wire. This conclusion can be deduced from the given text, which states that \\"longer wires have more resistance than shorter wires.\\" When the wire is cut into two pieces, the length of each piece becomes shorter than the original wire. As a result, the resistance of each half will be less than the resistance of the entire wire. To further explain this concept, let's consider the factors that determine wire resistance. The resistance of a wire (R) can be calculated using the formula: R = ρ (L/A), where ρ (rho) is the resistivity of the material, L is the length of the wire, and A is the cross-sectional area of the wire. When the wire is halved, two significant changes occur: 1. The length of the wire (L) decreases, which directly affects the resistance. As the formula shows, when the length of the wire decreases, the resistance also decreases. Since each half of the wire is half its original length, their resistance will inevitably be lower than that of the complete wire. 2. The cross-sectional area of the wire (A) remains constant for each half. Since the wire has been cut but not split or changed in any other manner, its cross-sectional area does not change. As a result, the resistance will not be affected by the area in this context. In summary, cutting a wire in half will result in each half possessing less resistance than the whole wire, primarily due to the reduction in length. This conclusion aligns with the provided text, which states that shorter wires have less resistance than longer wires."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

The Yacolt Fire Department confirmed that medics responded to Moulton Falls Regional Park Tuesday afternoon on reports that a teen girl was hurt after going over the popular pedestrian bridge. First responders told FOX 12 the girl was out of the water when they arrived and she was alert and conscious when she was taken to the hospital by ambulance. A video posted by a family member shows a girl standing on a ledge over the railing while surrounded by a group of people. One person is heard yelling a countdown, and when the teen doesn’t jump, another person is seen pushing her off the bridge – her arms flail out as she appears to fall toward the water torso-first. Tanner Peterson was jumping off the same bridge Wednesday evening. He said he saw the video of the teen falling off the bridge on YouTube, and decided to visit the park for the first time, just to jump. “She face-planted that, her pusher just threw her whole upper body off and that would be the scariest five seconds of her life,” Peterson said. “If that was someone I knew, I’d be really upset with the person who pushed them.” Despite signs warning people not to dive or jump of the bridge, several others jumped off Wednesday evening. Peterson said he wasn’t worried about the water or his jumping technique, but believes a push off the bridge should be a crime. “You hit wrong and it’s like hitting concrete,” Peterson said. “You could die, easy. If your head hits and your neck breaks, you’re going to die.” Firefighters said the jump is dangerous, not recommended, and the injuries at the bridge are stacking up. Officials said medics have responded to four cases this summer alone – a new record. They rescued a man who lost consciousness after making the jump a couple of weeks ago. “Someone pulled him out of the water, and just right under the bridge, and put him on a rock that’s pretty even,” Edgar Ruesga said. “He was out, he was unconscious.” As for the teenage girl, officials at PeaceHealth Southwest Medical Center said she is in stable condition. The Clark County Sheriff’s Office told FOX 12 that the case is being investigated and several witnesses have been contacted. Copyright 2018 KPTV-KPDX Broadcasting Corporation.

Answer the following question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: BC Social Report, August 14, 2010 Scandinavians may spend a lot of the winter in darkness but they are the happiest people in Europe, according to a study showed this month. Countries like Denmark and Finland scored highest on the study of happiness in Europe carried out by Cambridge University, which also found that the sunny southern countries of Italy, Portugal and Greece got the least joy out of life. The survey entitled: \\"No Man is an Island\\" showed that countries where people enjoy time with friends and family, have trust in government and national institutions were more likely to be happy than those living in a sunny climate. The study rated respondent on their overall sense of happiness and life satisfaction on a _ of one to 10. Danes --who expressed a high level of trust in their politicians and public institutions--came top of the field at 8.3. Italians--who reported lower levels of satisfaction with their national quality of government--came last at 6.49.' \\"Italy, Greece, Portugal, Germany and France report the lowest levels of happiness while the Scandinavian Countries, Netherlands and Luxembourg report the highest,\\" the study said. Although Europeans are generally four times wealthier than their fathers and grandfathers, their levels of happiness are either equal to or lower than 40 years ago. The study also looked at factors contributing to happiness within countries and surprisingly found that an interest in politics actually increased happiness. Lead researcher Luisa Corrado said tax cuts and throwing money at social problems appeared to have no effect on the happiness of citizens when compared with government policies which strengthened and supported wider social networks. \\"People are less naive ( ) than one would expect, politicians need to adapted their policies and target specific problems in specific areas,\\" she said.

What is the story behind anonymous animals on Google Sheets and Docs? Imagine you're in a playground with your friends, and you're all wearing animal masks so no one knows who you are. Google Sheets and Docs have a similar feature, called anonymous animals. When people who haven't signed in with their Google account view or edit a Google Sheet or Doc, instead of showing their names, Google gives them an \\"animal mask.\\" This way, people can collaborate on the same document without knowing each other's identities. There are many different anonymous animals like elephants, camels, and penguins. It helps keep things fun and private! 2. Is there any way I can receive any kind of reminder, alarm, or notification based on a simple word on a Google Doc or Sheet? Unfortunately, Google Docs and Sheets don't have a built-in way to send reminders, alarms, or notifications based on words.

He was best known for his national radio and television acts between 1937 and 1971, and as host of the television program The Red Skelton Show. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist. Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal's Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York's Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada. Skelton's performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City's Loew's State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew's, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" routine, with Skelton's visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew's State engagement and a handsome fee. The couple viewed the Loew's State engagement in 1937 as Skelton's big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt's glass, saying, \\"Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once.\\" His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt's official birthday celebration for many years afterward. Using a quote from the above article, answer the following question: Was this found to be funny?","completion":"Yes, Skelton's humor was found to be funny. As mentioned in the article, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly written material and began performing the \\"Doughnut Dunkers\\" and his older routines.

Stan went to a group to try to accept that Sheila was gone. It was a group for people whose unrequited love had ended in some kind of surrealist moment. There is a group for everything in California. After several months of hard work on himself with the group, Stan was ready to open a shop and sell the thousands of yellow gumballs.

He loved the dynamic surge and crash of Amazon's stock price, he loved the great concrete malls spreading across America like blood staining through a handkerchief, he loved how everything could be tracked and mirrored in numbers. When he closed the store each night he would count the gumballs sold, and he would determine his gross revenue, his operating expenses, his operating margin; he would adjust his balance sheet and learn his debt to equity ratio; and after this exercise each night, Stan felt he understood himself and was at peace, and he could go home to his apartment and drink tea and sleep, without shooting himself or thinking about Sheila.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Summarize: You don't need to fake cheeriness, but try not to get bogged down in worrying about the particulars of your relationship. Let your time together be easy, fun, and stress-free. If you and your boyfriend only ever talk about the heavy stuff, he may have formed negative associations around hanging out with you. That said: if you need to talk about these things, you may as well let them out. Whether it's a walk, a trip to the beach, or a movie night – find something that you both can get excited about. Consider what he's into lately, and what he might most want to spend his time on. Think back to where you met him and what the two of you did together at the beginning of your relationship. Find common ground. If you aren't sure, you might need to take a more active approach. Try as many different things as you can until you find a few that you both enjoy. Think about what he does with his friends. You don't need to do these things, and you shouldn't cut completely into his friend time – but it might help to understand where his time is going. Engage with his thoughts and feelings while still being true to your own. Be considerate, and don't force him to do things that make him comfortable. Don't try to make him jealous or stressed-out just so that he will hang out with you. When you are hanging out together, try to strike a balance between what you want to do and what he wants to do. Sometimes, you might have to spend time doing something that bores you in order to be around him. If you do things that your boyfriend likes doing, he may be much more open to spending time with you when you're doing things that he doesn't enjoy. For example: Say that you hate baseball, but your boyfriend loves it – and you love going to museums, but your boyfriend can't stand them. Make an agreement: if you go to a baseball game, he'll accompany you to a museum! . Check back in periodically to see if things have improved. If you find your boyfriend spending more time with you in an enjoyable way, then you should keep doing what you're doing. However: if he still isn't spending time with you despite your best efforts, then it might be time to end things. You may simply not have common interests; he may not like you as much as you think; or he may just generally not spend much time with his partners. Whatever the case, he's clearly not giving you the attention you need – so if you aren't comfortable, you might consider leaving him.","completion":"In summary, it is essential to maintain a balance between addressing relationship concerns and enjoying light-hearted moments with your boyfriend. Aim for stress-free and fun experiences while still addressing important matters if needed. To find activities you both enjoy, consider your boyfriend's current interests, reflect on what you did together early in your relationship, and find common ground. Exploring various activities together and paying attention to what he does with his friends can provide insight into what he enjoys spending time on. However, don't intrude on his friendships or sacrifice your own interests. Be considerate, engaging, and genuine in your interactions, while also respecting his comfort levels. Striking a balance between your preferences and his is crucial, and sometimes making compromises can help strengthen your bond. Periodically assess the situation and the quality of time you spend together. If you observe improvements, continue with your approach. However, if your boyfriend is still not spending time with you despite your efforts, it may be time to consider if the relationship is meeting your needs and whether it should continue. Reasons could range from a lack of common interests to decreased feelings or incompatible habits in relationships. Ultimately, prioritize finding a balance that brings happiness, understanding, and mutual respect to both of you."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Background: Adolf Hitler (German: ['adolf 'hItla] ( listen); 20 April 1889 - 30 April 1945) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party (Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei; NSDAP), Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 and Fuhrer (\\"Leader\\") of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945. As dictator, Hitler initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939, and was central to the Holocaust. Hitler was born in Austria--then part of Austria-Hungary--and was raised near Linz. He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. Context: Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn, a town in Austria-Hungary (in present-day Austria), close to the border with the German Empire. He was christened as \\"Adolphus Hitler\\". He was the fourth of six children born to Alois Hitler and his third wife, Klara Polzl. Three of Hitler's siblings--Gustav, Ida, and Otto--died in infancy. Also living in the household were Alois's children from his second marriage: Alois Jr. (born 1882) and Angela (born 1883). When Hitler was three, the family moved to Passau, Germany. There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect, rather than Austrian German, which marked his speech throughout his life. The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894, and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld, near Lambach, where he farmed and kept bees. Hitler attended Volksschule (a state-owned school) in nearby Fischlham. The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father-son conflicts caused by Hitler's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school. Alois Hitler's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure, and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach. The eight-year-old Hitler took singing lessons, sang in the church choir, and even considered becoming a priest. In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding. Hitler was deeply affected by the death of his younger brother Edmund, who died in 1900 from measles. Hitler changed from a confident, outgoing, conscientious student to a morose, detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers. Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau, and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps. Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office, depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son, who were both strong-willed. Ignoring his son's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist, Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900. Hitler rebelled against this decision, and in Mein Kampf states that he intentionally did poorly in school, hoping that once his father saw \\"what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream\\". Like many Austrian Germans, Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age. He expressed loyalty only to Germany, despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire. Hitler and his friends used the greeting \\"Heil\\", and sang the \\"Deutschlandlied\\" instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem. After Alois's sudden death on 3 January 1903, Hitler's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave. He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904, where his behaviour and performance improved. In 1905, after passing a repeat of the final exam, Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career. Question: Did he attend highschool?. Whats the answer?","completion":"Yes, Adolf Hitler attended high school. He went to the Realschule in Linz and later enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr. However, his performance in school was initially poor, and he eventually left without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: The air exploded in a flash of bone and steel and blood. The clash of metal rang through the forest. An arrow pierced through the darkness, its barbed head tearing through flesh and muscle. A roar echoed off of the mountains far to the west. A cry broke through soon after. Then silence. Char stood over a pile of black fur and red blood. He held a curved sword, jagged half way down the wide blade and hilted in bone. He held a large thick bow in the other. Lorfel and Ranur stood behind him, panting. Lorfel, a short man of twenty six held a large axe in both hands and still prepared to swing it hard. Ranur, the largest of the three held a pike in one hand, its tip hanging low towards the ground. He buried his other hand in his gray tunic. \\"Did it get either of you?\\" Char's voice rasped low in the silence of the night. \\"No\\" Lorfel said. He planted his axe head on the ground with a thud and leaned on the tall handle. There was a pause. Char turned towards Ranur. \\"Are you hurt?\\" \\"Mm...My hand.\\" Ranur took his hand out of his tunic. Moonlight gleamed red off of the ragged wound. Char thought he saw a glimmer of bone. \\"Did he claw you or bite you?\\" Char's voice held an urgency that set both Lorfel and Ranur on edge. Ranur paused and then spoke low. \\"He bit me.\\" Char picked Lorfel and Ranur as his hunting partners for their speed and sharpness in battle. They had hunted beasts of the deep woods all of their lives. They hunted the beasts that hunted men. They all knew the risks of battling such creatures. The old man dropped his curved sword, drew his bow, and fired. The arrow hammered into Ranur's chest, burying itself in his heart. Lorfel saw the gleaming arrow head sticking almost a foot out of his companion's back. Ranur fell face first to the ground. Question: Who bit Ranur? Options: A. the beast B.

Choose your answer from: (A). no (B). yes","completion":"(B). yes Both sentences convey the same meaning, despite their slight differences in phrasing. To better understand this, let's break down each of these sentences. 1. \\"This inspires Commander Mark Harmon (played by José Jiménez) to recite some of Wally Schirra's lines, to the great amusement of everyone at the table.\\" 2. \\"This inspires Commander Mark Harmon (played by José Jiménez) to recite some of the lines of Wally Schirra to the great amusement of all at the table.\\" In both sentences, \\"This\\" serves as the subject, and it refers to an action or event that prompts Commander Mark Harmon's response. Commander Mark Harmon, played by José Jiménez, is the main character in both sentences. Next, let's examine the section about Wally Schirra's lines: 1. Wally Schirra's lines 2. the lines of Wally Schirra Both phrases convey that Commander Mark Harmon is reciting lines that belong to or are associated with Wally Schirra. Using the possessive form (Schirra's) or the \\"of\\" form (lines of) do not change the meaning of the phrase. Lastly, let's analyze the reactions of the people at the table: 1. to the great amusement of everyone at the table 2. to the great amusement of all at the table In both cases, the reactions are of amusement, and the people experiencing this amusement are those present at the table. The only difference between the two phrases is the use of \\"everyone\\" and \\"all,\\" which in this context are synonyms and can be used interchangeably. Therefore, considering that both sentences express the same idea—Commander Mark Harmon, played by José Jiménez, reciting Wally Schirra's lines to the amusement of those at the table—the correct answer is (B).

Steven Taylor’s contribution to Newcastle’s winless start to the Premier League season amounted to little more than 60 seconds. Seven games without victory, United were adrift in the relegation places with their long-serving defender having warmed the bench for the majority. Now, on the back of maximum returns against Leicester and Spurs, the Magpies are up to 14th and manager Alan Pardew’s job is safe. Steven Taylor has played for Newcastle United for the last eleven years - since he was 16 years old. The former England Under 21 captain has found first team appearances hard to come by of late. Taylor has played every minute of those victories but was only recalled in the wake of an injury to Mike Williamson. The starting XI, however, is where the 28-year-old intends to stay and, when asked if he now deserved his place in the side, Taylor shot back: ‘Absolutely. The one thing I’ve done is waited for my chance and kept myself in good shape. ‘I’ve taken my chance and that’s what I had to do – we’ve got three points in both games. ‘One hundred per cent (I intend to stay in the side). I love my football and there’s nothing better than playing in front of 52,000 fans, that’s where I want to be.’ Since an injury to Mike Williamson though, Taylor has rejoined the Newcastle back-line for two wins in a row. Taylor (left) insists that he wants to make the position his own, as Newcastle moved up to 16th on Sunday. Taylor, the former England Under-21 captain, was sent off on the opening day of last season following a reckless elbow on Sergio Aguero during a 4-0 defeat at Manchester City. Pardew lost faith in the centre-back following that dismissal and he appeared just nine times in the league during the remainder of the campaign. And, ahead of tomorrow’s return to the Etihad Stadium, Taylor reflected: ‘It’s horrible (being out of the team). You’ve just got to knuckle down and work hard and make sure you take that chance when it comes. Now, I’m feeling full of confidence. ‘But the rest of the lads have been fantastic and it’s been a real team effort these past two games.’ Taylor is not one to shirk from danger - pictured here (second left) putting his body on the line against Leicester. Taylor (second left) celebrates with team-mates Paul Dummett and Tim Krul after Sunday's win against Spurs. Taylor prefers not to talk about his red card but believes United travel to City for their Capital One Cup fourth-round tie in good spirits. ‘If you win games you are confident,’ he said, Sammy Ameobi and Ayoze Perez having got the second-half goals during Sunday’s 2-1 win at Spurs. ‘We have that belief to stay in a game even when we are not playing well. ‘We did not play that well in the first half (at Spurs) even though we created a few chances. ‘But we had no fear - you cannot playing with fear when you go to White Hart Lane. Taylor (centre) looked delighted at the full-time whistle against Tottenham at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Taylor's first game back after Mike Williamson's injury coincided with Newcastle's first win of the season. ‘I thought we were fantastic in the second half. We really stuck at it. They had one shot maybe. When you come to Tottenham that doesn’t ever happen. ‘In the second half only one team was in it. We have creativity in the side and Sammy Ameobi was a breath of fresh air for us. He showed that. ‘And it was great for Ayoze Perez to get his goal. He is a goalscorer, put the ball in front of him and he has that ability. ‘We are now looking forward to City.

Vietnam A:","completion":"Title: The Last Battle Plot: The story is set in the year 1997, where the emotional and psychological effects of the Vietnam War still plague its veterans. The protagonist, Frankie, is a former soldier who served in the Vietnam War. He now leads a low-key life as a mechanic in a small garage owned by his sister, Anna, and tends to avoid social interaction. One regular day at the garage, Frankie encounters a mysterious man named John, who is desperately seeking help as his car has broken down. Frankie recognizes an unusual tattoo on John's arm from his days in Vietnam, which reveals his past as a war veteran and a member of the same unit Frankie was with during the war. The duo is surprised to find each other alive after so many years, as most of their comrades from the war have passed away. As they reconnect, Frankie learns that John is on a mission to find and bring justice to a notorious war criminal known as \\"The Ghost,\\" who went into hiding after the war. The Ghost is responsible for war crimes and the brutal massacre of their fellow soldiers during the Vietnam War. John believes The Ghost is now operating under a new identity in the United States. Frankie, haunted by his own past and memories of the war, decides to join John in his quest for justice. The duo begins their investigation, which takes them through the dark and grim underworld of weapon smugglers and drug cartels. Their journey brings them face to face with the evil remnants of wartime. As they inch closer to The Ghost, old memories from the war resurface. Both Frankie and John must confront their own nightmares and traumas before they can finally come face to face with the man responsible for the atrocities they had to endure. The climax of the film sees an epic showdown between Frankie, John, and The Ghost in an abandoned warehouse, where Frankie is forced to relive the horrors of his time in Vietnam. In the end, Frankie manages to conquer his demons and avenges his fallen comrades. He kills The Ghost, in not just a physical battle, but also a psychological one. In the aftermath, Frankie and John, both scarred by their experiences, find solace in each other's company and finally start to come to terms with their past. They spearhead an initiative to help other veterans like them deal with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and adjust to civilian life. The film ends with a touching tribute to all those who have served and lived through the traumatic experiences of war."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

If \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\", does it logically follow that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat.\\"?","completion":"No, it does not logically follow that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat\\" when given the statement \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\" These two premises are contradictory, and only one of them can be true. To analyze this situation further, let's break down each statement and examine the logical relationship between them. Statement 1: \\"A man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\" This statement describes the man's specific location and attire. The location is the side of a street, and the attire consists of a gray jacket. Statement 2: \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat.\\" This statement has a similar structure to Statement 1. It describes the attire of a man who is at the same location as the one mentioned in Statement 1 - the side of a street. However, the attire mentioned in this statement is different - a bright red coat. To determine whether it logically follows that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat,\\" when given that \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street,\\" we can use logical principles to examine the relationship between the statements. One such principle is the Law of Non-Contradiction, which states that contradictory statements cannot both be true at the same time and in the same sense. In this case, the attire of the man is contradictory (gray jacket vs. bright red coat). Thus, it is not logically possible for both statements to be true simultaneously. If we assume that the statement \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street\\" is true, then the statement \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat\\" must be false, as the description of the man's attire contradicts the first statement. It is important to note that this conclusion assumes we are referring to the same man in both statements. To summarize, it does not logically follow that \\"The man on the side of the street is wearing a bright red coat\\" when given the statement \\"a man wearing a gray jacket standing on the side of a street.\\" Both statements are contradictory in nature, and if we accept one as true, the other must be false."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

These add-ons and toolbars not only slow down the browser's performance but may also bring security risks. This article will guide you step-by-step on how to remove these unwanted entities from your Firefox browser and protect your computer from potential malware attacks. Section 1: Understanding Add-ons and Toolbars Add-ons are extensions, plugins, or small applications created by developers to enhance the browser's functionality, including managing passwords, blocking ads, or altering the browser's appearance. On the other hand, toolbars are a type of add-on that usually appears beneath the address bar, offering shortcuts to frequently accessed websites, search engines, or other services. While add-ons and toolbars can improve your browsing experience, some may be unnecessary, intrusive, or even harmful. It is essential to know how to manage and remove them when needed. Section 2: Opening the Add-on Manager in Firefox The first step in removing an unwanted add-on or toolbar is to open the Add-on Manager. Follow these simple steps: 1. Launch the Firefox browser. 2. Click the menu button (three horizontal lines) located in the upper-right corner of the Firefox window. 3. Select \\"Add-ons and Themes\\" or simply \\"Add-ons\\" from the dropdown menu. 4. The Add-on Manager tab will open, displaying a list of installed extensions, themes, and plugins. Section 3: Finding and Removing the Unwanted Add-on Once the Add-on Manager is open, follow these steps to find and remove the unwanted add-on: 1. Browse through the list of installed extensions (These are the add-ons in Firefox). 2. Locate the add-on or toolbar you want to remove. 3. Click the three-dot menu button next to the add-on's name. 4. Select \\"Remove\\" from the dropdown menu to uninstall the add-on. 5. A confirmation message will appear, select \\"Remove\\" again to confirm the uninstallation. Section 4: Restarting Firefox After removing the unwanted add-on, it is necessary to restart the Firefox browser for the changes to take effect. Close all Firefox windows and reopen the browser. The removed add-on should no longer be present in your browser. Section 5: Dealing with Stubborn Toolbars In some cases, toolbars can be persistent and difficult to remove using the standard method outlined above. In such situations, using antimalware software can help eliminate the stubborn toolbars. 1. Download and install a reputable antimalware software, such as Malwarebytes, Norton, or Bitdefender. 2. Update the software to ensure it has the most recent malware definitions. 3. Perform a full or custom scan on your computer, specifically targeting browsers or browser-related files. 4. The antimalware software will detect and quarantine the problematic toolbar and any related malicious files. 5. Follow the software's instructions to remove the toolbar and any associated threats. Section 6: Staying Safe and Preventing Unwanted Add-ons and Toolbars To reduce the chances of future incidents with unwanted add-ons and toolbars, try following these tips: 1. Download add-ons and toolbars only from the official Firefox Add-on website or trusted sources. 2. Pay close attention during the installation of new software, as some may bundle unwanted toolbars or add-ons. 3. Regularly update your browser and antimalware software to protect against new threats. 4. Periodically check the list of installed add-ons and remove any that you no longer use or are suspicious. Conclusion: Unwanted add-ons and toolbars can compromise your browsing experience and pose a threat to your computer's security. By learning how to identify, remove, and prevent these annoyances, you can maintain a cleaner, safer, and streamlined browsing experience with Mozilla Firefox."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Parents divorced, little Buddy was in the care of his mother's large Alabama family. Over the years, Buddy seldom saw either of his parents. But he was happy where he was and he had many kindly s, among whom Miss Sook was by far his best friend. Before Christmas, Buddy's father had managed to get legal custody of him for this Christmas. So, he had a new suit, with a card pinned with his name and address and made the trip alone, by bus, to New Orleans. Several things occurred that kept me awake the whole night. First, the footfalls, the noise of my father running up and down the stairs, breathing heavily, I had to see what he was up to. So I hid and watched. There was a Christmas tree and the fireplace downstairs. Moreover, I could see my father. He was crawling around under the tree arranging a pyramid of packages. I felt dizzy, for what I saw forced me to reconsider everything. If these were presents intended for me, then obviously they had not been ordered by the Lord and delivered by Santa Claus; no, they were gifts bought and wrapped by my father. Which meant that my rotten little cousin Billy Bob and other rotten kids like him weren't lying when they laughed at me and told me there was no Santa Claus. The worst thought was: Had Sook known the truth, and lied to me? No, Sook would never lie to me. She believed. It was just that--well, though she was sixty-something, in some ways she was at least as much of a child as I was. I waited until I was sure he was in bed and sound asleep. Then I crept downstairs and examined the tags attached to each of the packages. They all said: \\"For Buddy.\\" I decided to open the packages: It was Christmas morning. I was awake, so why not? I won't bother to describe what was inside them: just shirts and sweaters and dull stuff like that. The only thing I appreciated was a toy gun.

(June 2013) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Introduction: The title card is shown as a billboard behind which Wile E. Coyote is hiding, ready to chase the Road Runner. He starts the chase, until he runs into a large truck. Wile E. runs the other way, and the truck shows the credit. The chase ends in a win for the truck, and the Coyote emerges battered. A box with director Chuck Jones' credit then squashes him. The Coyote throws the box away, and the shot freezes: COYOTE - Eatius Birdius. He resumes the chase, which freezes to show the Road Runner: Delicius-Delicius. The chase continues down the road until the Road Runner makes a U-turn. The Coyote turns around, then stops. The Road Runner completes the circuit around, meanwhile, and beeps as the Coyote turns around, causing him to leap back. The Road Runner starts off down the road and loosens it from its hinge briefly. Wile E. points worriedly and displays an \\"EGAD\\" sign, then an \\"!!\\" sign. He drops them and thinks of his new plan. 1. Wile E. hides in a manhole, and as the Road Runner passes over him, he pops out and fires a rifle. The bullet and the Road Runner are shown in slow time, with the bullet closing to within a half-body length of the bird. Then the Road Runner turns to notice the threat, lets out a beep and gears into super speed. The bullet then brakes in puzzlement and falls to the ground. Wile E. picks it up, and then it detonates. Behind another rock face (in completely different desert scenery), Wile E. paces until he comes up with a new plan. 2. Wile E. leaps out into the road with \\"1 sheet ACME Triple Strength BATTLESHIP STEEL ARMOR PLATE\\" in front of him; even this cannot stop the Road Runner from barreling through it. The Coyote stares in puzzlement at the resulting hole, which shows only the scenery behind him where parts of his body should logically be, then walks...

Coyote paces behind the rock face in the completely different desert scenery, he is thinking and strategizing, attempting to come up with a new plan to catch the Road Runner.

I can’t think of anything “funny” I have seen at the zoo exactly although there has to be something…. we used to go to Catskill Game Farm and Bronx Zoo in NY so I am sure there has to have been something notable, if not funny…. At Catskill Game Farm there were Peacocks that walked around free and made startling noises. There were also punk flamingoes there that were amazing to see. Maybe the funniest (not so funny though) thing was in the area where you could feed deer and baby pigs so sometimes they’d all come around at once and mob you? My daughter wanted to feed who she wanted to feed but the deer and the pigs had their own ideas. The deer liked these crackers kind of like rye crisps and the baby pigs went for the bottles of milk or formula. When my daughter tried to pick and choose and just feed one suddenly she would be surrounded by many. I think my husband must have videos of what transpired. One of these days it might be entertaining to view them again. At the Bronx Zoo I remember going one or more years during the winter to see the animal light sculptures and huge block ice carving and the penguins and polar bears maybe? I can’t remember anything funny happening. When we went out to San Diego around years ago during a business trip my husband got to go on then my daughter and I went with him. I took my daughter to the Zoo and Sea World but she was so young then and it was so long ago I can’t recall much except standing on line to see the pandas and just collapsing on a open type tour after trying to carry her and a collapsible stroller and diaper bag all around.

Moscow (CNN) -- Divers have completed their search of a Russian cruise ship that sank last weekend with the loss of many lives, the Emergency Situations Ministry told CNN Friday. The official death toll has reached 114 -- including 66 women, 28 children and 20 men, the ministry said. The bodies of 15 people are still missing. There were 208 people on the \\"Bulgaria\\" at the time of the accident Sunday, of whom 79 were rescued. Divers have checked all the boat's compartments, the ministry said, and are now looking for more bodies around the boat as well downstream on the Volga River, where they could have been carried by the current. The area where search efforts continue has been enlarged to 200 kilometers (125 miles) from the scene, Russian Transport Minister Igor Levitin said at a briefing Friday. Preparations are under way for the cruise ship to be raised from the river bottom in the coming days. Two large boat cranes, one from Moscow and another one from Volgograd, which will be used for the lifting, are on the way to the accident site. \\"We have asked the Emergency Situations Ministry to keep 23 divers at the scene to continue the search for bodies even during the lifting operation,\\" Levitin said. Specialist military divers were brought in mid-week to aid in the search efforts. Four people face criminal charges over the sinking of the ship, which Russian media have called the most devastating river accident in the country's history. According to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \\"What are the preparations being made to recover the ship?\\" is \\"Oceanographers are being brought in to determine what must be done\\"?","completion":"No, the correct answer to the question \\"What are the preparations being made to recover the ship?\\" based on the paragraph provided is not \\"Oceanographers are being brought in to determine what must be done\\".

A former chief of the Basque terrorist group ETA has been sentenced to 105 years in prison for ordering the assassination of a politician, according to a copy of the court ruling, made public Monday. It is the first sentence in a case involving ETA from the National Court, which handles terrorism cases, since ETA announced last month \\"a definitive cessation of its armed activity,\\" raising hopes that decades of separatist violence may finally be over. The maximum that can be served in Spanish prison is 40 years, although courts often hand down a longer sentence for terrorist attacks. Spain has no death penalty. In the sentence issued last Friday but made public on Monday, the court ruled that Francisco Javier Garcia Gaztelu, whom Spanish authorities called the military chief of ETA when he was captured in 2001, ordered the assassination of a Basque Socialist politician, Fernando Buesa. Buesa and his bodyguard were killed in the Basque city of Vitoria in northern Spain in February 2000 when they walked past a vehicle that contained a hidden bomb that was exploded by remote control. Garcia Gaztelu, now 45, was sentenced to 30 years each for the killings of Buesa and his bodyguard, 13 years each for two people injured in the attack, and additional time mainly for damage caused by the bomb, the court said. The government, courts and police have said they will not halt the court cases pending against ETA operatives despite the outlawed group's announcement last month. Listed as a terrorist organization by Spain, the United States and the European Union, ETA is blamed for more than 800 deaths in its decades-long fight for an independent Basque state that it wants carved out of sections of northern Spain and southwestern France. ETA's announcement last month followed a recent push for the group to abandon violence permanently. That effort was led by international figures who include Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams of Northern Ireland and former U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan. Prime Minister Jose Luis Rodriguez Zapatero termed ETA's announcement as being of \\"transcendental importance\\" and a \\"victory for democracy.\\" \\"Ours will be a democracy without terrorism, but not without memory,\\" Zapatero said, referring to 829 people killed by ETA and their families. The prime minister said that it would be up to Spain's next government -- which will be formed after parliamentary elections on November 20 -- to lead the peace process.

The little moments of this film are so accurate and right on pace with what is going on in the minds and hearts of young girls during those coming of age teenage years. Now at my age I want to preach to them about their decisions and how life during those times are not as important as it all seems in those moments. That if they can be patient in their youth and wait to experience the hardships of life both external and internal that life would be so much sweeter. But then again young people today are faced with some variables that I never had to deal with a youth. The three main characters well played by all three actors (Kerry Wahington - Lanisha, Anna Simpson - Joycelyn and Melissa Martinez- Maria) give us the very believable depiction of a piece of reality for young girls living in impoverished situations. They have impoverished family lives all being raised by single mothers with expectation of Lanisha whose father is present but not actively supporting her day to day. The have impoverished educational systems and lack direct contact with achieving role models. These situations powerfully affect them and is their reality but all this is of no great depressive concern to these young women in their day to day. They except their plight and focus on the same things young girls all over the world are concerned with. Finding true love in a male, having good friends that you can depend on, gaining some respect/love and responsibility from parents and enjoying life. This is were this film cross the race, age and gender gap imposed upon it by its characters and the setting in which it is stamped. The Director and writer McKay explains on the DVD how each of scenes got into his head, by just observing young people of that age that lived in those types of neighborhoods. Plus you add three up and coming actresses who are not so far removed from that time in their own lives that you get a real good synergy of reality and acting at its best. The one thing I know about (African Americans and Hispanics) is that there is always a spiritual family member or neighbor that is in the foreground or near ground believing in a better day and better life and future in spite of the present situation and is role modeling that to some extent. This was never touched in the movie in order not to preach and I understand that but it also narrows the culture to having no hope in anything other than themselves. The HOPE FACTOR: I now think about my future and where I have come from and say as Lanisha did \` Today is a good day.' Yes poverty still exists, racism, sexism, and any other ism that we can added. Yes some of each of these young girls actions perpetuate the isms and are self-destructive, everything around them is impoverished but NONE of those actions past or neither present nor their environment leaves them without hope for a bright future. I was left with saddened hope of each of the characters and a deeper desire to be a role model in the life of some young girl on the edge of making a destructive decision. I suppose that is the value of film it should not only entertain but cause each of us to think, reflect and then act in some positive way to make this world a better place. What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly positive, with a touch of nostalgia, reflection, and hope. The reviewer appreciates the realism and accuracy of the film's portrayal of teenage girls during their coming-of-age years, praising the performances of the three main actresses and the director's keen observations. However, the reviewer also acknowledges the challenges faced by the characters, the importance of hope, and the necessity to be a role model and support for young people in similar situations. Overall, the review conveys a strong emotional connection to the film and its message."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The Rise of a New News Network For evidence, look no further than the recent tsunami disaster. While most networks, cable networks included, were regurgitating wire service copy and the same six minutes of videotape, Americans were turning to weblogs for the latest news and to peer-to-peer services like BitTorrent for videos, most of them shot by amateurs. The first images of the tragedy did not come from CNN, but rather were grainy, blurry photos captured by camera phones. As the network anchors drummed their manicured fingers, waiting for correspondents to parachute into position, the sketchy wire reports were supplanted by real-life, as-it-was-happening stories by bloggers who penned moving first-person accounts. You had to wait for the official death toll to be announced on CNN, but you could smell the stench of death on Evelyn Rodriguez's weblog. You could sense the horror in Morquendi's text messages, which were being sent from Sri Lanka and posted on ChiensSansFrontiers. This is as real-time as news can get. Weblogs, which started out as online diaries, have morphed into reporters' notebooks. The information is raw -- and perhaps unpolished when compared with news from more established outlets -- but it is nonetheless news. I think what we are seeing is the rise of a new kind of news network, thanks in large part to technology. Average Joes and Janes are now armed to the teeth with technology that can capture and distribute news almost anywhere. A smartphone like the Nokia 6630 has more processing power and is more connected to the Internet than a circa-1995 PC. The high-speed connections, coupled with easy-to-use newsreader software from startups like FeedDemon maker Bradbury Software, Ranchero Software, and Videora, make it a breeze to gather and read all the news in real time. Already 32 million Americans are reading weblogs. That's a large enough number to make even the biggest skeptic believe that this is a real revolution. How much of an impact will this have on the media giants? It's too early to tell. But as my colleagues over at Fortune suggest, one thing's for sure: This trend is too big to ignore. What are the most important parts of this text?","completion":"The most important parts of this text can be summarized as follows: 1. The rise of weblogs and peer-to-peer services as new sources of real-time news: The tsunami disaster serves as an example of how people turned to blogs and platforms like BitTorrent for immediate updates, images, and videos, as opposed to traditional media outlets. 2. Weblogs evolving into reporters' notebooks: Bloggers provided raw, unpolished, and real-life stories as news unfolded, offering a more authentic and as-it-happened perspective compared to more established news sources. 3. Technology empowering the average person to capture and distribute news: Advancements in smartphone technology and high-speed internet connections have facilitated the easy creation and dissemination of news by non-professionals. 4. Growing popularity of weblogs: With 32 million Americans reading blogs, this trend is gaining immense traction and is considered a media revolution. 5. Impact on traditional media giants: While it is still early to determine the exact impact, it is essential for traditional media companies to recognize and adapt to the changing landscape of news consumption. In summary, the text highlights the rise of a new news network influenced by technological advancements and the public's interest in real-time information sharing. It emphasizes the growing dominance of weblogs in providing authentic, raw, and immediate news, and stresses the importance of traditional media giants acknowledging this revolution for their survival."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis on Saturday slammed China's militarization of disputed South China Sea islands, insisting that weapons systems recently deployed in the area were meant to intimidate and coerce Beijing's neighbors. The comments came during a speech at the Shangri-La Dialogue, an annual Asian defense forum in Singapore. In the speech, Mattis laid out the broader U.S. strategy for a \\"free and open\\" Indo-Pacific region. \\"China's policy in the South China Sea stands in stark contrast to the openness our strategy promotes. It calls into question China's broader goals,\\" Mattis said. Specifically, the Pentagon chief mentioned China's deployment of anti-ship and surface-to-air missiles, electronic jammers, and the landing of a bomber aircraft at the Paracel Islands off the coast of Vietnam. \\"Despite China's claim to the contrary, the placement of these weapon systems is tied directly to military use for the purposes of intimidation and coercion,\\" Mattis added. Though much of the world is focused on an upcoming summit between North Korea and the United States, this year's Shangri-La Dialogue has focused primarily on the region's long-term future and how to deal with a more assertive China.

Question: Which of the following is not considered a great Liberal: Burke, Macaulay, or Hirst? Context: The 19th-century Liberal Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone considered Burke \\"a magazine of wisdom on Ireland and America\\" and in his diary recorded: \\"Made many extracts from Burke—sometimes almost divine\\". The Radical MP and anti-Corn Law activist Richard Cobden often praised Burke's Thoughts and Details on Scarcity. The Liberal historian Lord Acton considered Burke one of the three greatest Liberals, along with William Gladstone and Thomas Babington Macaulay. Lord Macaulay recorded in his diary: \\"I have now finished reading again most of Burke's works. Admirable! The greatest man since Milton\\". The Gladstonian Liberal MP John Morley published two books on Burke (including a biography) and was influenced by Burke, including his views on prejudice. The Cobdenite Radical Francis Hirst thought Burke deserved \\"a place among English libertarians, even though of all lovers of liberty and of all reformers he was the most conservative, the least abstract, always anxious to preserve and renovate rather than to innovate. In politics he resembled the modern architect who would restore an old house instead of pulling it down to construct a new one on the site\\".

Liszt wanted to learn more about instrumentation and acknowledged Raff's greater expertise in this area. Hence, he gave Raff piano sketches to orchestrate, just as he had done earlier with Conradi—\\"so that he might rehearse them, reflect on them, and then, as his confidence in the orchestra grew, change them.\\" Raff disagreed, having the impression that Liszt wanted him on equal terms as a full collaborator. While attending an 1850 rehearsal of Prometheus, he told Bernhard Cossmann, who sat next to him, \\"Listen to the instrumentation. It is by me.\\"Raff continued making such claims about his role in Liszt's compositional process. Some of these accounts, published posthumously by Die Musik in 1902 and 1903, suggest that he was an equal collaborator with Liszt. Raff's assertions were supported by Joachim, who had been active in Weimar at approximately the same time as Raff.

What a difference a year makes. At the beginning of April last year, Sir Alex Ferguson’s Manchester United headed into the derby at Old Trafford 15 points clear of Manchester City. On Tuesday evening, it is Manuel Pellegrini’s City who will stroll into their neighbours’ backyard with a strut of arrogance, knowing United’s status has been diminished to that of inferiors. This time it is they who sit in the ascendency, 12 points ahead of David Moyes’ ailing side. A win would convert 12 into 15. Damning: Our graphic shows years of United dominance, with the difference in points between the two sides going into Old Trafford derbies heavily in their favour, but the pendulum appears to have swung. Bubble's burst: David Moyes will be desperate to beat Manchester City at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. Saviour? Wayne Rooney scores his wonder goal against West Ham last weekend. Focus: Manchester City's players look fired up in their training session ahead of the derby at Old Trafford. Two more victories in City’s games in hand on United and the gap would become 21. It is a prospect barely worth thinking about for those at Old Trafford, offering a frightening snapshot of just how far United have plummeted in the post-Ferguson era. Yet there would also be little surprise if United were to surrender once more. After all, they have won just one match in 12 against the top nine in the Barclays Premier League this season, losing seven of those. It is not difficult to see, therefore, why City are the bookmakers’ favourites to win a match at Old Trafford for the first time since the inception of the Premier League. City have inflicted the odd flesh wound in the past, of course. Kevin Keegan’s side, with Jon Macken up front rather than Sergio Aguero, as the main man beat United 4-1 at the City of Manchester Stadium in 2004. More cuttingly, there was that 6-1. two years ago at Old Trafford, leaving Ferguson ‘shattered’ after the. ‘worst result in my history, ever’. And then there was the last-gasp. Aguero goal to snatch the title from United in the most dramatic manner. possible. These were. body-blows to the United system but they were swiftly corrected, first. through the signing of Robin van Persie, ahead of City, and. then by reclaiming the title in Ferguson’s final season. Blip? Shaun Goater scores for Manchester City in the 3-1 win at Maine Road in 2002. Unprecedented: Trevor Sinclair celebrates back in 2004 during the 4-1 rout of their rivals. Old rivalry: City fans goad then opposition manager Sir Alex Ferguson in the 2004 victory. It's been 44 years since Manchester City beat United in three consecutive league matches. City could break this run if they win at Old Trafford on Wednesday. The Blues won 2-1 at Old Trafford last April before battering David Moyes' side 4-1 in his first derby at the Etihad in September. So, can they make it three on the bounce once again? It is a very long time indeed since United were last unequivocally considered the weaker force in Manchester and that should be a serious concern within the walls of Old Trafford. Certainly, it has never been the case in the Premier League era. Indeed, only twice before have United entered a Manchester derby at home in the Premier League trailing City on points. Before the 6-1 in 2012, City were two points ahead of Ferguson’s side but that was after just eight games. The only other occasion was an anomaly, in September 2005, when United were one point behind Stuart Pearce’s City. City had played four games to United three, meaning that particular statistic was rather skewed. Another rout: City hammered United at the Etihad earlier this season with Sergio Aguero scoring. Not you again: Aguero struck the winner at Old Trafford last season with a powerful effort after a nice run. Relief for United: Aguero has been ruled out of Tuesday's derby with a hamstring injury. The turnaround can perhaps be more readily attributed to United’s decline than City’s development in this past year. Intriguingly, for all the calmness instilled by their phlegmatic manager, City are only four points better off than they were after 28 games last season. United, by contrast, are 26 points worse off than they were at the same stage last season. All things considered, it does not require much this season to be more formidable than Moyes’ side. Big-game player: Yaya Toure has been in exceptional form of late for City. Unstoppable: Rooney scores a tremendous overhead kick against City in 2011. Tormentor: Rooney has a penchant for scoring against City in Manchester derbies. But we should not forget that is new territory for City supporters, for the first time indisputably the dominant outfit. Previously, this would be the stuff of printed T-shirts. Now, it is par for the course. This can be rammed home if Pellegrini’s side secure a third consecutive league victory at Old Trafford on Tuesday night. That has not happened for more than 40 years, when City won five games in a row at the home of United between 1967 and 1972. Another enemy: Steven Gerrard celebrates after scoring against Manchester United. Sore sight: Luis Suarez netted Liverpool's third at Old Trafford on a dismal day for United fans. It would be the latest of a succession of records to topple under Moyes and fresh on the back of a 3-0 humiliation by Liverpool, defeat against City would provide compelling evidence that the tide has turned irretrievably in Manchester. Dropping below City or Liverpool is one thing, to fall below the two is another thing entirely. But that is the unacceptable reality that the rank-and-file at Old Trafford may be just obliged to accept come Tuesday evening at The Theatre of Dreams.

Children whispering in hushed tones about a forbidden wing, heavily guarded by men armed with Kalashnikovs. One night, curiosity gets the better of her, and Amina sneaks into the forbidden wing, only to find a hidden training camp for young Taliban recruits. She is horrified and heartbroken to realize that some of her own students are being forced into a life of violence and oppression. Determined to protect her students and expose the sinister forces exploiting religious beliefs for their own gain, Amina starts devising a plan to not only save her students but also alert the villagers and Afghan forces about the Taliban's activities. During the day, she forms a secret bond with her students, winning their trust and assuring them that there is a way out of this nightmarish existence. She develops a secret code language with the children to exchange information discreetly. As tensions escalate, Amina's quest to expose the truth becomes more dangerous. A local policeman named Arif becomes suspicious of her, and she befriends him to gain his trust and protect her secret. The two become allies and, eventually, share a deep emotional connection. Together, Amina and Arif plan a daring escape for the children and prepare evidence against the militant leaders running the House of Salvation. In a thrilling and emotional climax, Amina, Arif, and the students confront the Taliban, who attempt to thwart their escape. A fierce battle ensues, during which several militants are captured by the Afghan forces, while some manage to flee. The movie ends with the House of Salvation being transformed into a proper educational institution committed to nurturing hope, love, and peace. The brave teacher, Amina, and her ally, Arif, not only saved the innocent children from a life of misery and violence but also brought hope to the once terrified village.

Summarize this article: A research organization is growing human skin in the hope of using it to trial cosmetics and medicines, reducing the need for animal testing. The synthetic skin is made using cells from infant foreskins. The idea of a \\"skin factory\\" may sound sinister, but that is exactly what scientists at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart have created. Their so-calledgrows tiny swatches of skin - not for skin grafts, but for testing consumer products.The renowned institute is presenting their ground-breaking invention as an affordable and sustainable alternative to animal testing, which many consider unnecessarily cruel.The skin factory is a machine measuring seven metres long, three metres high and three metres deep, sealed and heated to 37 degrees Celsius – the same temperature as inside people.The machine is fitted with 500 boards, each with 24 tissue cultures growing on it in little tube formations. In each tube, extremely thin skin samples grow from cells, which robotic hands have painstakingly extracted from foreskins donated to the project. Scientists use enzymes to detach the very top layer of cells from the skin, along with connective tissue and pigment cells.The foreskin used for the process is only taken from boys up to the age of four. “The older skin is, the worse the cells function,” explained Andreas Traube, an engineer at the institute's department of production technology and automation.“It is also important that the cells we use are coming from a uniform source,\\" said Traube. \\"This avoids discrepancies in the production of the new skin.\\"The equipment developed by the Fraunhofer team can extract between three to 10 million cells from a single foreskin. In the incubator these cells then multiply hundreds of times.The brand new skin cells are mixed with collagen and connective tissue, which then becomes ‘proper’ skin, measuring up to five millimetres in thickness. The whole process can take up to six weeks, but according to Traube, “We can’t use the machine to speed up the process; biology needs time to take its course.”In a single month, the machine can produce around 5,000 skin samples. For now, these delicate creations remain untouched as the process is still being authorized by European authorities, who are examining the growths to see whether they are suitable to be used in testing.But the process has been given the nod of approval by some key members of the Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies (VFA).“I think the idea is a good one,” said Rolf Hömke, VFA spokesman. “I believe cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed comparable with real skin.”“I do think it might take a few years to get up and running though,” warned Hömke. “There are complicated international safety standards, these procedures can’t just be changed overnight.”At the moment only very small skin samples are being created. “It’s logical that we’d want to take the operation to a bigger scale,” said Traube.He added that possible future applications for products from thecould be research into cancer, pigmentation diseases, allergic reactions and fungal infections.The next step for the company is a little smaller though, as their sights are set on synthesizing a human cornea. ||||| Researchers at the Fraunhofer Institute in Stuttgart recently created the \\"Skin Factory,\\" an advanced piece of lab equipment designed to use foreskin taken from babies to grow patches of human skin that can be used in the place of animals to test products, the German Herald reported. According to a spokesman for the Institute, the groundbreaking equipment may be able to eliminate animal testing altogether and, if developed on a larger scale, could be useful in developing treatments for cancer, pigmentation diseases, and certain skin allergies. So how does the miracle machine work? First, it's heated to roughly 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, the temperature of the human body, according to the German news outlet The Local. Next, robotic hands meticulously extract cells from foreskins donated to the project, all samples of which must come from boys age four-and-under. \\"The older skin is, the worse the cells function,\\" Andreas Traube, an engineer at the institute. Scientists then take the cells extracted from the foreskin (one sample can provide up to 10 million cells) and incubate them inside tubes, where they multiply hundreds of times. The cells are then mixed with collagen and connective tissue to create skin about 5 millimeters thick. All in all, Traube explained, the process takes about six weeks -- about the same amount of time it takes skin to grow naturally. \\"We can't use the machine to speed up the process; biology needs time to take its course,\\" Traube told the The Local. At least one organization within Germany has already expressed measured approval for the machine. \\"I think the idea is a good one. I believe cells from artificially cultivated skin are indeed comparable with real skin,\\" Rolf Homke, spokesman for the German Association of Research-based Pharmaceutical Companies, told The Local. \\"I do think it might take a few years to get up and running though.

He sat and watched for several hours as a butterfly struggled to force its body through that little hole. Then it stopped. So the man decided to help the butterfly. He took a knife and cut a bigger hole in the cocoon. The butterfly came out of the cocoon but it had a weak body and small, thin wings. The butterfly didn't start to fly. In fact, the butterfly spent the rest of its life crawling around with a weak body and thin wings. It was never able to fly. The man acted with kindness but he didn't understand that he had done something wrong. When a butterfly crawls out of the cocoon, it must struggle. The hard work of getting out of the cocoon forces the fluid from the butterfly's body into wings. It helps the butterfly be ready to fly. If the butterfly never has to force itself out of the cocoon, its wings never get the fluid and it can never fly. Sometimes struggles are exactly what we need in our lives. If we lived our lives without any problems, we would never learn or grow. We would not be as strong as we could have been and we would never fly. So, the next time you are faced with a challenge or a problem, remember the butterfly. Struggle a little - then fly! Question: What does the writer want to tell us?

Help as much as you can. Q:Information: - An aircraft carrier is a warship that serves as a seagoing airbase, equipped with a full-length flight deck and facilities for carrying, arming, deploying, and recovering aircraft. Typically, it is the capital ship of a fleet, as it allows a naval force to project air power worldwide without depending on local bases for staging aircraft operations. Aircraft carriers are expensive to build and are critical assets. Carriers have evolved since their inception in the early twentieth century from wooden vessels used to deploy balloons to nuclear-powered warships that carry numerous fighter planes, strike aircraft, helicopters, and other types of aircraft. - Colombia (or ), officially the Republic of Colombia, is a transcontinental country largely situated in the northwest of South America, with territories in Central America. Colombia shares a border to the northwest with Panama, to the east with Venezuela and Brazil and to the south with Ecuador and Peru. It shares its maritime limits with Costa Rica, Nicaragua, Honduras, Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti. It is a unitary, constitutional republic comprising thirty-two departments. The territory of what is now Colombia was originally inhabited by indigenous peoples including the Muisca, the Quimbaya and the Tairona. - Birds (Aves), also known as avian dinosaurs, are a group of endothermic vertebrates, characterised by feathers, toothless beaked jaws, the laying of hard-shelled eggs, a high metabolic rate, a four-chambered heart, and a lightweight but strong skeleton. Birds live worldwide and range in size from the bee hummingbird to the ostrich. They rank as the class of tetrapods with the most living species, at approximately ten thousand, with more than half of these being passerines, sometimes known as perching birds or, less accurately, as songbirds. - A gill is a respiratory organ found in many aquatic organisms that extracts dissolved oxygen from water and excretes carbon dioxide. The gills of some species, such as hermit crabs, have adapted to allow respiration on land provided they are kept moist. The microscopic structure of a gill presents a large surface area to the external environment. - A reserve fleet is a collection of naval vessels of all types that are fully equipped for service but are not currently needed, and thus partially or fully decommissioned. A reserve fleet is informally said to be \\"in mothballs\\" or \\"mothballed\\"; an equivalent expression in unofficial modern U.S. naval usage is \\"ghost fleet\\". In earlier times, and especially in British usage, these ships were said to be \\"laid up in ordinary\\". - An aircraft is a machine that is able to fly by gaining support from the air. It counters the force of gravity by using either static lift or by using the dynamic lift of an airfoil, or in a few cases the downward thrust from jet engines. - A fish is any member of a group of organisms that consist of all gill-bearing aquatic craniate animals that lack limbs with digits. They form a sister group to the tunicates, together forming the olfactores. Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys, and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups. Tetrapods emerged within lobe-finned fishes, so cladistically they are fish as well. However, traditionally fish are rendered obsolete or paraphyletic by excluding the tetrapods (i.e., the amphibians, reptiles, birds and mammals which all descended from within the same ancestry). Because in this manner the term \\"fish\\" is defined negatively as a paraphyletic group, it is not considered a formal taxonomic grouping in systematic biology. The traditional term pisces (also ichthyes) is considered a typological, but not a phylogenetic classification. - Amphibians are ectothermic, tetrapod vertebrates of the class Amphibia. Modern amphibians are all Lissamphibia. They inhabit a wide variety of habitats, with most species living within terrestrial, fossorial, arboreal or freshwater aquatic ecosystems. Thus amphibians typically start out as larvae living in water, but some species have developed behavioural adaptations to bypass this. The young generally undergo metamorphosis from larva with gills to an adult air-breathing form with lungs. Amphibians use their skin as a secondary respiratory surface and some small terrestrial salamanders and frogs lack lungs and rely entirely on their skin. They are superficially similar to lizards but, along with mammals and birds, reptiles are amniotes and do not require water bodies in which to breed. With their complex reproductive needs and permeable skins, amphibians are often ecological indicators; in recent decades there has been a dramatic decline in amphibian populations for many species around the globe. - The winghead shark (\\"Eusphyra blochii\\") is a species of hammerhead shark, and part of the family Sphyrnidae. Reaching a length of , this small brown to gray shark has a slender body with a tall, sickle-shaped first dorsal fin. Its name comes from its exceptionally large \\"hammer\\", or cephalofoil, which can be as wide as half of the shark's total length. The function of this structure is unclear but may relate to the shark's senses. The wide spacing of its eyes grants superb binocular vision, while the extremely long nostrils on the leading margin of the cephalofoil may allow for better detection and tracking of odor trails in the water. The cephalofoil also provides a large surface area for its ampullae of Lorenzini and lateral line, with potential benefits for electroreception and mechanoreception respectively. - Costa Rica (literally meaning \\"Rich Coast\\"), officially the Republic of Costa Rica, is a country in Central America, bordered by Nicaragua to the north, Panama to the southeast, the Pacific Ocean to the west, the Caribbean Sea to the east, and Ecuador to the south of Cocos Island. It has a population of around 4.5 million, of whom nearly a quarter live in the metropolitan area of the capital and largest city, San José. - Lampreys (sometimes also called, inaccurately, lamprey eels) are any jawless fish of the order Petromyzontiformes, placed in the superclass Cyclostomata. The adult lamprey may be characterized by a toothed, funnel-like sucking mouth. The common name \\"lamprey\\" is probably derived from Latin \\"lampetra\\", which may mean \\"stone licker\\" (\\"lambere\\" \\"to lick\\" + \\"petra\\" \\"stone\\"), though the etymology is uncertain. - Malpelo is a small island in the East Pacific Ocean, located about west of the Colombian mainland. Except for a small military post that is manned by the Colombian Armed Forces, it is uninhabited. It consists of a sheer and barren rock with three high peaks, the highest being \\"Cerro de la Mona\\" with a height of . The island is about one mile in length from northeast to southwest, and 700 yards in width. - The United States Navy (USN) is the naval warfare service branch of the United States Armed Forces and one of the seven uniformed services of the United States. The U.S. Navy is the largest, most capable navy in the world, with the highest combined battle fleet tonnage. The U.S. Navy has the world's largest aircraft carrier fleet, with ten in service, two in the reserve fleet, and three new carriers under construction. The service has 323,792 personnel on active duty and 108,515 in the Navy Reserve. It has 274 deployable combat vessels and more than 3,700 aircraft in active service . - The United States Armed Forces are the federal armed forces of the United States. They consist of the Army, Marine Corps, Navy, Air Force, and Coast Guard. The President of the United States is the military's overall head, and helps form military policy with the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD), a federal executive department, acting as the principal organ by which military policy is carried out. From the time of its inception, the military played a decisive role in the history of the United States. A sense of national unity and identity was forged as a result of victory in the First Barbary War and the Second Barbary War. Even so, the Founders were suspicious of a permanent military force. It played an important role in the American Civil War, where leading generals on both sides were picked from members of the United States military. Not until the outbreak of World War II did a large standing army become officially established. The National Security Act of 1947, adopted following World War II and during the Cold War's onset, created the modern U.S. military framework; the Act merged previously Cabinet-level Department of War and the Department of the Navy into the National Military Establishment (renamed the Department of Defense in 1949), headed by the Secretary of Defense; and created the Department of the Air Force and National Security Council. - A fin is a thin component or appendage attached to a larger body or structure. Fins typically function as foils that produce lift or thrust, or provide the ability to steer or stabilize motion while traveling in water, air, or other fluid media. Fins are also used to increase surface areas for heat transfer purposes, or simply as ornamentation. - Molokai or Molokai (Hawaiian: ), often called the \\"Friendly Island\\", is an island in the Hawaiian archipelago. It is 38 by 10 miles (61 by 16 km) in size at its extreme length and width with a usable land area of , making it the fifth-largest of the main Hawaiian Islands and the 27th largest island in the United States. It lies east of Oahu across the 25-mile (40 km) wide Kaiwi Channel and north of Lnai, separated from it by the Kalohi Channel. - Hawaii is the 50th and most recent state to have joined the United States of America, having received statehood on August 21, 1959. Hawaii is the only U.S. state located in Oceania and the only one composed entirely of islands. It is the northernmost island group in Polynesia, occupying most of an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean. Hawaii is the only U.S. state not located in the Americas. - Cocos Island is an island designated as a National Park off the shore of Costa Rica, that does not allow inhabitants other than Costa Rican Park Rangers. It constitutes the 11th of the 13 districts of Puntarenas Canton of the province of Puntarenas. It is located in the Pacific Ocean, approximately from the Pacific shore of Costa Rica. With an area of approximately , about and a perimeter of around , this island is more or less rectangular in shape. - Naval warfare is combat in and on the sea, the ocean, or any other major body of water such as a large lake or wide river. - A tunicate is a marine invertebrate animal, a member of the subphylum Tunicata, which is part of the Chordata, a phylum which includes all animals with dorsal nerve cords and notochords. The subphylum was at one time called Urochordata, and the term urochordates is still sometimes used for these animals. Some tunicates live as solitary individuals, but others replicate by budding and become colonies, each unit being known as a zooid. They are marine filter feeders with a water-filled, sac-like body structure and two tubular openings, known as siphons, through which they draw in and expel water. During their respiration and feeding, they take in water through the incurrent (or inhalant) siphon and expel the filtered water through the excurrent (or exhalant) siphon. Most adult tunicates are sessile, and are permanently attached to rocks or other hard surfaces on the ocean floor; others, such as salps, doliolids and pyrosomes, swim in the pelagic zone of the sea as adults. Various species are commonly known as sea squirts, sea pork, sea livers, or sea tulips. - The United States of America has seven federal uniformed services that commission officers as defined by Title 10, and subsequently structured and organized by Title 10, Title 14, Title 32 and Title 42 of the United States Code. - USS Hammerhead ( SSN - 663 ) , a Sturgeon - class submarine , was the second ship of the United States Navy to be named for the hammerhead shark , a voracious fish found in warm seas , with a curious hammerlike head . - In cryptography, SHARK is a block cipher identified as one of the predecessors of Rijndael (the Advanced Encryption Standard). - The superclass Tetrapoda (Ancient Greek s tetrapods, \\"four-footed\\"), or the tetrapods , comprises the first four-limbed vertebrates and their descendants, including the living and extinct amphibians, birds, mammals, reptiles and some ancient, exclusively aquatic creatures such as the Acanthostega. Tetrapods evolved from the lobe-finned fishes around 390 million years ago in the middle Devonian Period, with modern tetrapod groups having appeared by the late Devonian, 367.5 million years ago. The specific aquatic ancestors of the tetrapods, and the process by which land colonization occurred, remain unclear, and are areas of active research and debate among palaeontologists at present. - The hammerhead sharks are a group of sharks in the family Sphyrnidae, so named for the unusual and distinctive structure of their heads, which are flattened and laterally extended into a \\"hammer\\" shape called a cephalofoil. Most hammerhead species are placed in the genus Sphyrna while the winghead shark is placed in its own genus, Eusphyra. Many not necessarily mutually exclusive functions have been proposed for the cephalofoil, including sensory reception, manoeuvering, and prey manipulation. Hammerheads are found worldwide in warmer waters along coastlines and continental shelves. Unlike most sharks, hammerheads usually swim in schools during the day, becoming solitary hunters at night. Some of these schools can be found near Malpelo Island in Colombia, Cocos Island off Costa Rica, and near Molokai in Hawaii. Large schools are also seen in the waters off southern and eastern Africa.

Article: Anxiety may cause people to neglect their physical or emotional health, and you can help by suggesting that she do something if you notice she has forgotten. Self-soothing activities may be especially important if she has frequent anxiety. For example, ask her if she would like to get something to eat or suggest that she take a warm, long bath. When dealing with children, engage in relaxing activities together. Let them pick what they want to do. Not everyone with anxiety will have an anxiety disorder but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t need to be dealt with. Set aside 30 minutes out of the day, where your loved one can just have a good worry. During this time, don’t let him be distracted by anything other than worrying and feeling anxious. Encourage him to think of solutions to his problems. This technique is effective with children as well as adults and helps them gain a sense of control over their problems. Your loved one may tell you why she feels upset, or you may have been able to tell based on what set off the anxiety. Try saying how upset she looks, and recognize that this is hard. This lets her know that you care, and that you think her struggles are valid. Ironically, affirming her stress can reduce it. \\"That sounds really hard.\\" \\"I can see why that would be upsetting to you. It sounds like visiting your father can be difficult for you sometimes.\\" \\"You look stressed. Your face is scrunched up and you look hunched over. Do you want to talk about it?\\" Hugs can bring comfort to an anxious person. You may try to pat his back, give him a one-armed hug or put your arm around his shoulder to make him comfortable. Only do what you and he are comfortable with. Always give him opportunities to decline. If he is dealing with sensory overload or are autistic, touch may make things worse. Or he may not be in the mood. This can be an enormous relief to the anxious person. Be accommodating, and don't question her bad days or unusual needs. Treat her anxiety like a fact that, while unfortunate, is not a dreadful burden upon your life. Recognize that her feelings matter, and treat her with compassion, anxiety and all. Be flexible. It may take longer for people with anxiety problems to get ready for events such as getting ready for school. Factor in this time and allow for delays. If your loved one isn't being treated already, seeing a doctor about his anxiety may allow him to get the help he needs. It’s important to rule out any underlying medical or biological causes of the anxiety. Once you know that the cause of your loved one’s anxiety is psychological, you will be in a better position to seek treatment. To give him a boost, you might suggest accompanying him to take notes, help him remember symptoms, or just for moral support. Asking others for help can be very encouraging for a person with anxiety problems. In fact, persons with strong informal support networks have increase their chances of benefitting from treatment for anxiety. You don’t have to do anything specific. Just knowing that there are people around with whom to talk to and share her worries with, can help a person with anxiety problems feel better.

Answer: Beowulf (; Old English : ) is a legendary Geatish hero and later turned king in the epic poem named after him , one of the oldest surviving pieces of literature in the English language. Question: what is the name of beowulf's king Answer:","completion":"The name of Beowulf's king is King Hrothgar. King Hrothgar is the ruler of the Danes in the epic poem Beowulf and is an important secondary character in the story. Hrothgar is portrayed as a wise and experienced leader who seeks the help of the Geatish warrior Beowulf in dealing with the monster Grendel, a creature terrorizing the kingdom of Denmark. Hrothgar's kingdom has been under the scourge of Grendel for twelve years when Beowulf, a hero from the land of the Geats, arrives. Beowulf offers his assistance to rid Denmark of the monster and protect its people. Hrothgar, as a grateful king, accepts Beowulf's help with open arms and holds feasts in honor of his bravery. After Beowulf successfully defeats Grendel and his mother, Hrothgar rewards Beowulf for his heroic deeds, bestowing great treasures and wisdom upon him. The two develop a strong bond and mutual respect despite their cultural differences, illustrating the epic's underlying themes of heroism, loyalty, and friendship. King Hrothgar is an essential figure in the epic poem Beowulf, as he represents a wise and compassionate ruler who seeks to protect his people from harm. His relationship with Beowulf serves as a crucial point in the story, demonstrating the importance of cooperation and valuing the skills and courage of others, irrespective of their origins. Hrothgar's character also effectively highlights the impact of strong leadership in fostering peace and prosperity within a kingdom."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Much like the Grand Old Duke of York, who had ten thousand men and marched them up to the top of the hill, and then marched them down again, I can’t get enough of York… (because he visited repeatedly, that was obvious, right?)

Alas, I haven’t really learned how to take my own advice, but hot on the end of a family visit in Lincolnshire we were lucky enough to spend sometime with one of my favourite expats on Yorkshire (ok, ok, I only know two, but they are definitely in the top two of that limited ranking system). It was of course Amanda, her fabulous husband Sam and we got to meet their gorgeous new addition to the family, a mischevious Dachshund pup who goes by the name of Harold.

It was released on record label Universal Music Australia on 21 August 2000 as the first single from the band's fourth album, Odyssey Number Five. The single is Powderfinger's most successful; it peaked at number four on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart, and charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart--the first Powderfinger song to do so. Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning wrote the lyrics for \\"My Happiness\\" as a reflection on the time the band spent touring to promote their work, and the loneliness that came as a result. \\"My Happiness\\" was put on heavy rotation by Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM two months prior to its United States release, and Powderfinger signed a contract with United States label Republic as a result of the song's early success. Beat journalist Jayson Argall joked the song had received \\"a bit\\" of airplay. Although \\"My Happiness\\" was subsequently dropped from KROQ's roster, other radio stations continued to give the song high priority. \\"My Happiness\\" peaked at number 23 on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks, making it the first Powderfinger song to appear on a Billboard chart. According to Susan Groves of WHRL, part of the song's success came about because very few people knew of Powderfinger, but were drawn towards \\"My Happiness\\" because it was \\"melodic, [and] pretty\\"--a change from what she described as \\"middle of the road rock\\" popular in the United States. Meanwhile, Australians were \\"starting to get sick of My Happiness\\"--Cameron Adams argued in The Hobart Mercury that this was one of the reasons Powderfinger decided to focus on the offshore market. Powderfinger performed \\"My Happiness\\" live on the Late Show with David Letterman while touring North America with British rock group Coldplay. They were the fourth Australian act (after The Living End, Silverchair, and Nick Cave) to play on the show. The band also did free promotional shows leading up to the release of the single. In Europe, \\"My Happiness\\" received approximately four weeks of airplay on German music video program Viva II, and the band sold out for three nights in a row in London, partly due to the success of the single. Are there any interesting aspects about this article?","completion":"There are several interesting aspects about this article: 1. \\"My Happiness\\" stands out as Powderfinger's most successful single, not only in Australia but also charted in the United States on the Hot Modern Rock Tracks chart, making it the first song by the band to do so. 2. The song was written by Powderfinger frontman Bernard Fanning, reflecting on the band's experience of touring and the loneliness resulting from it, which adds an emotional background to the song. 3. The single gained early traction in the United States due to heavy rotation by Los Angeles radio station KROQ-FM, even before its official release in the country. This early success led the band to sign a contract with US label Republic. 4. Susan Groves of WHRL suggested that part of \\"My Happiness's\\" success was due to its melodic and pretty sound, which contrasted with the \\"middle of the road rock\\" that was popular in the United States at the time. 5.

Q:Background: During late adulthood, the risk of developing diseases such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer continues to rise. Most people also have a decline in strength and stamina. Their senses may start failing, and their reflex time typically increases. Their immune system also doesn’t work as well as it used to. As a result, common diseases like the flu may become more serious and even lead to death. The majority of late adults develop arthritis, and as many as one in four develop Alzheimer’s disease. Paragraph: Robert and his son Michael are going to the doctor for their yearly physical. Robert is currently in the late adulthood phase of his life. Michael, on the other hand, just began adulthood and is still quite young. Both of them want to ask the doctor about their risks for future health problems. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Who is less likely to develop a cardiovascular disease? A:","completion":"Given the information provided, Michael is less likely to develop a cardiovascular disease compared to his father, Robert. This conclusion is based on the fact that the risk of developing cardiovascular diseases and many other health conditions increases with age. In terms of life stage, Robert is in late adulthood, a phase which is often marked by an increased susceptibility to health problems. With age, many elements of the human body start to degrade including the cardiovascular system. Arteries may harden and narrow over time due to a condition called atherosclerosis, which significantly boosts the risk for cardiovascular diseases. Furthermore, the immune system in older adults doesn't work as effectively as it once did, making them more prone to illnesses and diseases. On the contrary, Michael has just entered adulthood. During this stage of life, the risk of suffering from cardiovascular diseases or other major health conditions is typically much lower, provided the individual maintains a reasonably healthy lifestyle. The cardiovascular system in younger adults tends to be healthier with less plaque buildup in the arteries. The immune system in this phase is also generally stronger, offering better protection against infections and diseases. However, it is critical to note that although the given background suggests a higher probability for Robert to develop cardiovascular diseases, it doesn't exclude Michael from the risk entirely. Factors like genetics, lifestyle choices, and environmental influences can significantly impact an individual's health at any age. Therefore, both should engage in regular check-ups and maintain a healthy lifestyle to reduce their risks as much as possible. In conclusion, while Michael is statistically less likely to develop cardiovascular diseases compared to Robert due to their respective ages, both individuals still carry some level of risk."},{"prompt":"Information: - The Southern African Development Community (SADC) is an inter-governmental organization headquartered in Gaborone, Botswana.

Instead, Francesco Schettino \\"jumped into the lifeboat,\\" Stefano Iannelli said. Schettino is on trial in Grosseto on charges of manslaughter and abandoning ship after 32 people died in the shipwreck off the Tuscan island of Giglio on January 13, 2012. Iannelli, who was on the bridge when the ship hit the outcropping, testified that Schettino's reaction was, \\"What have I done?!\\" As part of his defense for the abandoning ship charge, Schettino has maintained that by the time he left the crippled vessel, the inclination made it impossible to stay on the ship. He told the court at a hearing in October that the ship was literally falling on top of him and he fell into the lifeboat. The ship ended up lying on its side. INTERACTIVE: How ill-fated cruise liner was raised from Italian seabed Iannelli, who followed Schettino off the ship, testified Monday that he did not see passengers when they left the vessel, even though more than 1,000 people were later rescued from the ship. In a taped conversation between the captain and the port authority in Livorno, the port authority ordered Schettino to \\"get back on board\\" while passengers were still being rescued from the other side of the ship. Schettino, who admits that he was in command when the ship veered off course and hit the rocks, also blames a malfunction of the ship's watertight doors for making the situation worse.

What creature is portrayed on the Victoria Cross?","completion":"The Victoria Cross is the highest military honor awarded to members of the British and Commonwealth armed forces for acts of conspicuous gallantry, extraordinary bravery, and self-sacrifice in the face of extreme danger. It was instituted by Queen Victoria in a Royal Warrant on 29 January 1856 during the Crimean War and remains the most prestigious military decoration in the United Kingdom, as well as in many Commonwealth countries. The creature portrayed on the Victoria Cross is a lion, specifically a rampant lion. A rampant lion is a heraldic symbol that denotes a lion standing on its hind legs with its forepaws raised. This posture of the lion signifies strength, courage, and valiance—qualities that the recipients of the Victoria Cross must possess to be deemed worthy of this esteemed accolade. The design of the Victoria Cross consists of a Maltese Cross made from bronze and measuring approximately 1.375 inches (34.9 mm) across. The bronze used in making the medals is traditionally obtained from the metal of Russian guns captured during the Crimean War, adding a historical and symbolic connection to its recipients' unmatched heroism. The obverse of the Victoria Cross bears the lion on top of the royal crown, and the lion is passant guardant, which means it is walking with one forepaw raised and its head facing forward. The lion on the Victoria Cross is encircled by a scroll-like structure that displays the inscription \\"FOR VALOUR\\". This phrase was chosen by Queen Victoria herself after rejecting the initial suggestion of \\"FOR BRAVERY,\\" as she believed that soldiers of the British armed forces were inherently brave, and only those who had displayed extraordinary levels of valor would deserve this recognition. On the reverse side of the Victoria Cross, a circular panel displays the recipient's rank, name, and unit, along with the date of the act of valor for which they are receiving the award. Suspended from a crimson ribbon, the medal is worn on the left side of the recipient's chest above all other decorations and medals, signifying its position as the highest honor in the military order of precedence. The image of the lion is not unique to the Victoria Cross and has been a recurring symbol throughout British history, particularly in heraldry, where it has long been associated with the English monarchy. As the symbol of the Victoria Cross, the lion epitomizes the renowned courage, gallantry, and selflessness that Victoria Cross recipients have consistently displayed during their service to the nation in the face of great adversity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

From an early age, American children learn responsibility . Children as young as 2 begin to put away their toys and dress themselves. At 3, many children do simple chores like setting the table. Using money wisely is also taught early. As soon as a child understands the value of money, he or she receives a weekly _ . This is used for things the child wants, like toys or treats. The child can spend or save it, usually with little guidance from parents. If the child wants money besides his or her allowance, it must be made by doing extra chores.

A) understanding the value of money B) helping the rich C) reading many books D) doing extra chores A:","completion":"In the United States, it is quite common for young adults at the age of 18 to venture out on their own and seek independence. This custom has its roots in American culture and upbringing, where children are taught self-reliance and responsibility from a very early age. The development of these skills is crucial as it helps to shape young minds into becoming responsible and confident adults in the long run. Starting from the age of 2, American children are encouraged to take responsibility for simple tasks such as putting away their toys and learning to dress themselves. As they grow older, around the age of 3, they are taught to complete slightly more complex chores like setting the table, which instill a sense of responsibility and pride in their accomplishments. Another vital aspect of the American upbringing is teaching children the value of money and how to manage it wisely. Once a child grasps this concept, they usually begin receiving a weekly allowance. This allowance serves as an opportunity for children to learn how to make decisions about their finances independently, allowing them to use this money to buy things they desire, such as toys or treats. Parents may not give much guidance on how the allowance is used, enabling the child to develop their decision-making skills. With the weekly allowance, there is often an expectation that the child must earn any additional money needed beyond the allowance by undertaking extra chores or tasks. This practice teaches children the importance of working to achieve their goals and instills a strong work ethic from a young age. One key aspect of American upbringing that sets it apart from some other cultures is the emphasis on allowing children to think for themselves and make their own decisions. Consequently, they are sometimes permitted to make mistakes, as failure can often teach us more than success. By learning from their errors, children develop resilience and problem-solving skills which prove valuable in adulthood. In conclusion, American culture places a strong emphasis on cultivating independence, responsibility, and decision-making skills in children from a young age. By acquiring these attributes, young adults are better equipped to face the challenges that arise as they embark on their journey towards self-reliance. Through learning the value of money, undertaking chores, and being allowed to make mistakes, children in the United States are set on a path to personal success and, ultimately, independence."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: Milwaukee, Wisconsin (CNN) -- President Barack Obama, in a bid to create jobs and boost economic growth, called on Congress on Monday to pass a 50 billion plan to renew the country's transportation infrastructure. His address was the first of two speeches the president is scheduled to make this week to frame his administration's ongoing response to the recession, less than two months ahead of midterm elections in which Democratic majorities in the House and Senate are in jeopardy. \\"Today, I am announcing a new plan for rebuilding and modernizing America's roads, and rails and runways for the long term,\\" said Obama, who spoke on Labor Day in Milwaukee, Wisconsin -- a state with competitive gubernatorial and U.S. Senate races. \\"We used to have the best infrastructure in the world. We can have it again,\\" he said to loud cheers from a crowd of union workers. The proposal envisions -- over a six year period -- rebuilding 150,000 miles of roads, 4,000 miles of rail and 150 miles of airport runways. It also would include modernizing the nation's air traffic control system in an effort to reduce delays and travel time. \\"This will not only create jobs immediately. It's also going to make our economy hum over the long haul,\\" said the president. Obama hopes to work with Congress to enact an up-front investment of 50 billion -- an amount a White House statement said would represent a significant chunk of new spending on infrastructure. The investment would then be paired with what the administration called a framework to improve transportation spending. The long-term plan would include the establishment of an Infrastructure Bank, which would leverage federal dollars and focus on projects that could deliver the the biggest bang for the buck, Obama said. The president stressed the need for Democrats and Republicans to work together on the transportation initiative, which would need to be approved by Congress.

This means that when he rolls his melon across the _____ will experience more resistance (A) farm field (B) back yard it Choose the answer between \\"farm field\\" and \\"back yard\\". Answer:","completion":"The answer to this logic test is the back yard (B). Here's a detailed explanation: The situation presented in the question describes two areas: Mike's farm field and his back yard. The former is described as smooth, while the latter is described as rough. From this information, we can infer certain attributes that can affect the resistance experienced by the melon when rolled across either area. Resistance, in this context, refers to the opposition or difficulty faced by the melon as it moves across the surface of either area. In general, resistance can be attributed to several factors, including surface texture, friction, and obstacles. In this case, the question highlights the surface texture as the main factor influencing resistance. While rolling the melon across the farm field, the smoother surface allows for easier movement due to minimal obstacles and lower friction between the melon and the ground. The lack of roughness means that there's little interference or hindrance, and less force is needed to overcome any obstacles that may be present. Therefore, the resistance experienced by the melon on the farm field will be less. On the other hand, when the melon is rolled across the back yard, its rough surface will present greater resistance, as the uneven and irregular texture can amplify the friction between the melon and the ground. Additionally, the roughness implies a higher probability of obstacles, which the melon must overcome to continue moving. The presence of such obstacles would require more force to be exerted to achieve the same movement as on a smooth surface. As a result, the resistance experienced by the melon in the back yard will be higher. In conclusion, taking into account the characteristics and differences between the farm field's smooth surface and the back yard's rough surface, the melon will experience more resistance when rolled across the back yard (B), as opposed to the farm field (A)."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: In choosing a friend, one should be very careful. A good friend can help you study. You can have fun together and make each other happy. Sometimes you will meet fair-weather friends. They will be with you as long as you have money or luck, but when you are down, they will run away. How do I know when I have found a good friend? I look for certain qualities of character, especially understanding, honesty and reliability . Above all else, I look for understanding in a friend. A good friend tries to understand how another person is feeling. He is not quick to judge. Instead, he tries to learn from others. He puts himself in the other person's place, and he tries to think of ways to be helpful. He is also a good listener. At the same time, however, a good friend is honest. He does not look for faults in others. He notices their good points. In short, a friend will try to understand me and accept me. Another quality of a friend is reliability. I can always depend on a good friend. If he tells me he will meet me somewhere at a certain time, I can be sure that he will be there. If I need a favor, he will do his best to help me. If I am in trouble, he will not run away from me. There is a fourth quality that makes a friend special. A special friend is someone with whom we can have fun. We should enjoy our lives, and we would enjoy our friendship. That is why I especially like friends who are fun to be with. A good friend likes the same things I like. We share experiences and learn from each other. A good friend has a good sense of humor, too. He likes to laugh with me. That is how we share in the joy of being friends. And I know that he is looking for the same quality in me. When I meet someone who is reliable, honest and understanding, I know I've found a friend!

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: When was the Chicxulub crater discovered? ? The Chicxulub crater (; Mayan: [tʃʼikʃuluɓ]) is an impact crater buried underneath the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico. Its center is located near the town of Chicxulub, after which the crater is named. It was formed by a large asteroid or comet about 11 to 81 kilometres (6.8 to 50.3 miles) in diameter, the Chicxulub impactor, striking the Earth. The date of the impact coincides precisely with the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (K–Pg boundary), slightly less than 66 million years ago, and a widely accepted theory is that worldwide climate disruption from the event was the cause of the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event, a mass extinction in which 75% of plant and animal species on Earth became extinct, including all non-avian dinosaurs. The crater is estimated to be 150 kilometres (93 miles) in diameter and 20 km (12 mi) in depth, well into the continental crust of the region of about 10–30 km (6.2–18.6 mi) depth. It is the second largest confirmed impact structure on Earth and the only one whose peak ring is intact and directly accessible for scientific research.The crater was discovered by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, geophysicists who had been looking for petroleum in the Yucatán during the late 1970s. Penfield was initially unable to obtain evidence that the geological feature was a crater and gave up his search. Later, through contact with Alan Hildebrand in 1990, Penfield obtained samples that suggested it was an impact feature. Evidence for the impact origin of the crater includes shocked quartz, a gravity anomaly, and tektites in surrounding areas. In 2016, a scientific drilling project drilled deep into the peak ring of the impact crater, hundreds of meters below the current sea floor, to obtain rock core samples from the impact itself. The discoveries were widely seen as confirming current theories related to both the crater impact and its effects.","completion":"The Chicxulub crater was discovered during the late 1970s by Antonio Camargo and Glen Penfield, who were geophysicists searching for petroleum in the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico.

Q: In this task, you will be shown a prompt from a judicial decision and multiple holding statements derived from citations following text in a legal decision.

The correct answer is the holding statement that corresponds to the citing text. The four incorrect answers are other holding statements. You should find the correct option. There is a <HOLDING> token in the position of the citing text prompt where the holding statement was extracted. of being performed by the estate representative. See TPS Freight Distribs., Inc. v. Texas Commerce Bank-Dallas, 788 S.W.2d 456, 458-59 (Tex.App.—Fort Worth 1990, writ denied); see also Solomon v. Greenblatt, 812 S.W.2d 7, 17 (Tex.App.—Dallas 1991, no writ). Thus, to the extent there is a “presumption” regarding survival of a contractual obligation after the death of one of the parties, it is exactly the converse of that advanced by the Estate and adopted by the trial court. Neither the historical treatment of alimony in Texas, nor Texas case law, indicates that the general rules of alimony—i.e., court-ordered spousal support—should apply to contracts for spousal support, particularly the rule that alimony presumptively terminates on the obligor’s death.

Professor Dianna Kenny examined 12,665 dead stars from all popular genres between 1950 and 2014. Plane and car crashes killed stars in the 50s and 60s, such as Buddy Holly. A number of popular musicians - including Jimi Hendrix and Kurt Cobain - have died at the age of 27. In the past six decades homicide rates were up to eight times greater amongst musicians than the US population. Female musicians tend to die in their early 60s rather than their 80s. Male musicians die in their late 50s compared to non-rockers at 75. She concluded that the 'pop music \\"scene\\" fails to provide boundaries and to model and expect acceptable behaviour' Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: The Dark Side of Fame: Shorter Lifespans and Growing Suicide Rates among Musicians Introduction The world of music and pop culture has long been associated with the glamour and excesses of fame. However, recent research by Sydney University highlights a darker side to the lives of musicians, including shorter lifespans, and increased suicide and homicide rates. This disturbing trend begs the question: does the music industry do enough to support and protect its stars? Shorter Lifespans and Rising Homicide Rates The groundbreaking study, conducted by Professor Dianna Kenny, delved into the lives of 12,665 deceased musicians and singers across various popular genres between 1950 and 2014. These statistics uncovered the shocking reality that popular musicians' lifespans are up to 25 years shorter than the comparable US population. In the past six decades, homicide rates among musicians were found to be up to eight times greater than that of the US population. This comes as a stark reminder of the tragic and untimely deaths of artists such as John Lennon, Tupac Shakur, and Biggie Smalls. Death by Accidents and the Infamous Age of 27 The 1950s and 60s saw a spate of fatal accidents involving musicians, such as Buddy Holly, whose life was cut short in a plane crash. More recent times have seen the emergence of the so-called \\"27 Club,\\" a group of musicians who have all died at the age of 27, often under tragic circumstances. This includes legendary artists like Jimi Hendrix, Janis Joplin, and Kurt Cobain. Gender Differences and the Role of Life Choices The research also revealed that female musicians, on average, tend to die in their early 60s rather than the average lifespan for their gender, which falls in the 80s. Meanwhile, male musicians were found to have a life expectancy in the late 50s, compared to the general male population who have an average lifespan of 75 years. Professor Kenny's work suggests one possible explanation for these shortened lifespans lies in the lack of boundaries, and the failure of the music scene to model and expect acceptable behavior from its stars. The pressures of fame, the access to drugs, and the influence of enablers could all play a role in this disturbing trend. Conclusion As the music industry continues to evolve in the face of globalization and technological advances, the findings of Professor Dianna Kenny's research serve as a sobering reminder that the lives of our celebrated musicians are not without their struggles and pitfalls. It is crucial that the industry takes these statistics as a wake-up call to provide better support and guidance to young and upcoming stars. This could be the difference between a long, successful career and a life tragically cut short."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

IV. leans on a man that also has a bandanna tied around their eyes. The answer is:","completion":"II. uses a stick to swing at a pinata. A detailed explanation for the answer: The given scenario mentions that the woman has a bandana tied around her eyes. This suggests that she is participating in an activity that requires her to be blindfolded. Among the four options provided, option II is the most suitable, as it involves the woman using a stick to swing at a pinata. Pinatas are typically used during parties or celebrations, and swinging at them while blindfolded is a common custom. Participants take turns trying to hit the pinata while their eyes are covered, adding an element of suspense and excitement to the game. Option I may not be appropriate because it is unclear why the woman would need to be blindfolded while putting on a boot. Option III is not suitable as it doesn't explain why the woman needs to be blindfolded to dance with the children. In fact, being blindfolded might make it more difficult and dangerous for her to dance with them. Option IV might be interesting in a different context, but it does not provide a reason for both the woman and the man to be blindfolded, nor does it explain an activity that requires them to be so. Thus, the most logical answer considering the given context and the implications of the bandana tied around her eyes is option II, which indicates that the woman is using a stick to swing at a pinata."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Here is a news article: Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey showed no remorse over the alleged bad behavior of a former \\"hero\\" cop who is now being held on a 60 million dollar bail -- charged with sex assaults at gunpoint. (Published Monday, May 20, 2013) Former Philadelphia police officer Richard DeCoatsworth, once honored by President Barack Obama for his heroism, remains in jail on 60 million bail for allegedly raping two women -- forcing one into prostitution. Now, NBC10 has learned the City of Philadelphia is spending more than 1.5 million defending itself against DeCoatsworth's checkered past on the force. Law enforcement sources say DeCoatsworth had nine citizen complaints against him over his nearly five year stint with the department. The complains, sources say, included allegations of assault, abuse and misconduct. Issues with the 27-year-old began to arise in 2005 when he was in the Philadelphia Police Academy. DeCoatsworth allegedly injured a Girard Avenue business owner during a fight. However, he was allowed to remain a recruit despite the allegations. Former Hero Officer Charged With Rape A former Philadelphia Police Officer once hailed a hero is now in jail on 60 million bail after he allegedly raped two women at gunpoint. NBC10's Katy Zachry has the latest details. (Published Sunday, May 19, 2013) In 2007 as a rookie officer, DeCoatsworth was severely injured after being shot in the face. After being shot, he managed to chase down the suspect for several blocks before collapsing. He called in enough information by radio that police were able to track down and arrest the suspect later the same day. His actions earned him an invitation from Vice President Joe Biden to attend President Obama’s first congressional address at the U.S. Capital in February 2009. The officer sat in the gallery with First Lady Michelle Obama during the speech. He was also honored by his peers as a 2008 Top Cop. Exclusive Beaten Man Flabbergasted by Police Arrest Soon after, though, he was involved in two more dramatic incidents. In April 2009, police say DeCoatsworth was jumped and attacked by a man when he tried to disperse a crowd at the Logan section of the city. During the struggle, sources say DeCoatsworth’s gun went off and hit the suspect who took off running. Another officer responding to the scene shot the suspect dead, according to sources. Bail Set at 60M for Hero Officer Charged With Rape Bail was set at 60 million Saturday for a former Philadelphia police officer Richard Decoatsworth who has been charged with raping two women at gunpoint. NBC10's Nefertiti Jaquez reports on the developing case. (Published Sunday, June 9, 2013) In September 2009, DeCoatsworth and another officer stopped a man on a motorcycle in the Kensington section of the city. While they were questioning him, a second man allegedly jumped on the motorcycle and drove at the officers. Police say DeCoatsworth shot at the suspect, who sped off. The suspect was found later at the hospital where his mother had taken him to be treated for a shotgun wound. During the incident, local witnesses claimed the two suspects did nothing wrong and that DeCoatsworth and the other officer acted recklessly -- shooting while children were nearby. In November 2011, Internal Affairs investigated an alleged scuffle between DeCoatsworth and another officer, according to Philly.com. DeCoatsworth retired from the police force on disability back in December 2011. Hero Officer Charged With Raping Women A former Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and given a seat next to the first lady at a speech by President Obama has been arrested and charged with raping two women and other crimes. Former officer Richard DeCoatsworth was arrested and charged Saturday with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and related offenses. NBC10's Cydney Long reports. (Published Saturday, May 18, 2013) In February of 2012, an arrest warrant was issued for DeCoatsworth after he allegedly threatened a woman in Port Richmond. The most recent incident began two weeks ago after DeCoatsworth allegedly met a woman at a bar on North Front Street. Police say the former officer forced the woman into prostitution at a Days Inn hotel along Roosevelt Boulevard in the Lawncrest section of the city. Then, between 2 a.m. Thursday and Friday evening, DeCoatsworth went to the woman’s home along North Howard Street in the Fishtown-Kensington area, according to a law enforcement source close to the investigation. Once he arrived, DeCoatsworth allegedly forced that woman and a second woman, both in their 20s, to use drugs and perform oral sex on him at gunpoint. The alleged victims reported the assault Friday only after DeCoatsworth went home, according to police. Hero Officer Arrested A former Philadelphia Police Officer once hailed a hero was arrested on Saturday for allegedly holding two women captive. NBC10's Katy Zachry has the details. (Published Saturday, May 18, 2013) Police raided DeCoatsworth’s house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street in the Port Richmond section of Philadelphia around 6:30 a.m. on Saturday. He was arraigned and charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats and other related offenses. Police also confiscated drugs and guns from the home, according to a source. No word yet on what kind of drugs were removed from the home. Video Crossing Gate Hits School Bus as Train Approaches According to court documents, bail was set at 25 million for each of the alleged victims. Another 10 million bail was set in a separate domestic violence case DeCoatsworth is now being charged with, according to investigators. Police say he assaulted his live-in girlfriend on May 9. The 60 million bail is reportedly one of the highest set in Philadelphia history. DeCoatsworth faces more than 32 crimes in all three cases. He is scheduled for another court appearance on June 17. One of DeCoatsworth’s neighbors said she was relieved to hear about his arrest. “I am scared to be saying this now but I hope he stays where he is at, he has been a thorn in the side of this neighborhood for so long,” said the woman who did not want to be identified. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter's Office says of the nine complaints lodged against DeCoatsworth -- one resulted in a lawsuit. The suit alleged DeCoatsworth used aggressive behavior while on the job. The city settled that suit for 1.5 million. However, officials say Philadelphia has accrued other legal costs related to DeCoatsworth. Last year, Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey told police he believed he failed DeCoatsworth by letting him go back to work with a stressful unit too soon after he was shot in the face. \\"I think I screwed up on that,\\" Ramsey told the Daily News. \\"I think I should have given him more time. He didn't want more time but I should have done that.\\" In light of his most recent arrest however, Ramsey had much harsher words for DeCoatsworth on Monday. \\"He has to be held accountable,\\" Ramsey said. \\"Just like anybody else. There should be no special consideration given simply because he once served as a police officer.\\" DeCoatsworth is being held on 60 million bail. A figure that is rarely seen in the U.S. criminal justice system. Philadelphia District Attorney's Office spokeswoman Tasha Jamerson said prosecution did not request a high bail amount, rather that DeCoatsworth be held without bail. “Being held without bail is the highest bail situation you could face as a defendant in Philadelphia,\\" Jamerson said, “At DeCoatsworth's arraignment on Saturday, we requested that he be held without bail, but the judge instead chose to impose bail at 60 million.” Other high-profile cases, including federal trials held in Pennsylvania, have included large sums, but none are near what the 27-year-old is held on. While many with similarly egregious crimes are held without bail, some are held on bonds that reach into the millions of dollars. Christina Regusters, the 20-year old woman charged with abducting and raping a 5-year old girl in Cobbs Creek, is currently held on 4 million bond. Ariel Castro, the Ohio man who is facing four counts of kidnapping and three counts of rape for holding three women captive in his home for a decade, is held on only 8 million. While DeCoatsworth is listed as being represented by a public defender, family members are currently helping him acquire an attorney.

Richard DeCoatsworth in happier times, as he joined first lady Michelle Obama and Jill Biden at a presidential address in 2009. (Associated Press/File) A retired Philadelphia police officer once hailed as a hero and invited by Michelle Obama in 2009 to sit next to her during the president's State of the Union address has been arrested and charged with raping and holding two women captive for two days. Richard DeCoatsworth, 27, was taken into custody early Saturday. When police arrived at his Port Richmond house on the 2700 block of Salmon Street, DeCoatsworth, who was armed, went to the basement to open a garage door and let out his pit bull, a law enforcement source said. The dog ran away after police fired two flash grenades. DeCoatsworth, discarding his gun, ran into the bedroom, where there was a loaded shotgun. Police subdued and arrested him without incident, the source said. DeCoatsworth had been under investigation by the Special Victims Unit after two women alleged that he forced them to use drugs and engage in sexual activity. The women said they came into contact with DeCoatsworth about 2 a.m. Thursday at a party, said Officer Christine O'Brien, a police spokeswoman. They left the party with him, and the three went to another location. Police did not identify the site of the party or say where the alleged crimes took place. At the second site, DeCoatsworth took out a handgun and allegedly forced the two women \\"to engage in the use of narcotics and sexual acts,\\" O'Brien said. The women reported the incident to police, and DeCoatsworth was charged with rape, sexual assault, terroristic threats, and related charges. His bail was set at 60 million. The women told police DeCoatsworth had held them captive for two days, according to the law enforcement source. It was a long fall from grace for the former officer, who in 2007 was lauded as a hero. 2009 tribute As a 21-year-old rookie, DeCoatsworth took a shotgun blast to the face and, bleeding heavily and returning fire, pursued his attacker for several blocks before collapsing and radioing for help. The gunman, Antonio Coulter, was caught and later pleaded guilty in the shooting. DeCoatsworth underwent extensive surgery and returned to duty in June 2008. His heroism in that case led to an invitation to sit next to the first lady during the president's 2009 address. DeCoatsworth then became involved in two controversial incidents in which he shot at suspects. In April 2009, he shot Anthony Temple when the man lunged for his gun, police said, and a backup officer then shot and killed Temple. The following September, he wounded a man in a leg who allegedly ran at him on a motorcycle. DeCoatsworth racked up a number of Internal Affairs complaints, and he retired in December 2011 at age 25. He left, a police spokesman said at the time, due to injuries from the 2007 shooting. 'Something like this' Some in the Police Department had feared DeCoatsworth was badly troubled. One officer said DeCoatsworth's unpredictable behavior and temper had led some in the department to view him as a time bomb. \\"I hate to say it, but I did see something like this coming,\\" the officer said Saturday. Neighbors at a diner down the block from DeCoatsworth's home said he had been known to behave erratically. A woman who asked not to be named said she avoided the former officer after an incident in the fall in which his pit bull allegedly charged at her chihuahua. \\"From the look in his eyes,\\" she said, \\"I was terrified.\\" Shattered glass from DeCoatsworth's door spilled out over his front steps Saturday afternoon, and people inside refused to answer the door. When two people left the apartment, they declined to comment. Contact Jonathan Lai at 856-779-3220, jlai@phillynews.com, or follow on Twitter @elaijuh.

Please answer the following question: I know that the answer to the question \\"What happened after the First Crusade?\\" is in \\"The crusades were intended to seize Jerusalem from Muslim control. The First Crusade was proclaimed by Pope Urban II (pope 1088–99) at the Council of Clermont in 1095 in response to a request from the Byzantine Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) for aid against further Muslim advances. Urban promised indulgence to anyone who took part. Tens of thousands of people from all levels of society mobilised across Europe and captured Jerusalem in 1099. One feature of the crusades was the pogroms against local Jews that often took place as the crusaders left their countries for the East. These were especially brutal during the First Crusade, when the Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction. Another outgrowth of the crusades was the foundation of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers, which fused monastic life with military service.\\". Can you tell me what it is? Answer:","completion":"After the First Crusade, which was proclaimed by Pope Urban II in 1095 and resulted in the capture of Jerusalem in 1099, several important events and developments took place. Firstly, there were pogroms against local Jewish communities as the crusaders left their countries for the East. The Jewish communities in Cologne, Mainz, and Worms were destroyed, and other communities in cities between the rivers Seine and Rhine suffered destruction as well. Another significant outcome of the First Crusade was the establishment of a new type of monastic order, the military orders of the Templars and Hospitallers. These orders combined monastic life with military service, representing a new fusion of religious and martial objectives. Despite the initial success of the First Crusade in capturing Jerusalem, it should be noted that this victory was followed by additional crusades over the next two centuries, as various Christian and Muslim powers struggled for control of the Holy Land and surrounding regions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Before you begin the process of haltering your horse, you'll need to prepare the halter. If your horse is acting up, it can be hard to prepare the halter in the moment. Unbuckle or unsnap the crown piece. This is the strap of the halter that goes behind the horse's ears. It should have a buckle or snap somewhere on it. Have your halter clipped to your lead line ahead of time. You want to be able to halter your horse and immediately lead him where he needs to go. You clip the lead line onto a ring at the bottom of the noseband. The noseband is the portion of a halter that slips around a horse's nose. Call your horse as you approach him. This helps alert your horse to your presence. This way, he's less likely to get spooked by your approach. Call out his name or call out something like, \\"I'm coming in!\\" to let him know you're entering his pasture or stall. Make sure you have your halter in your left hand as you approach. You will be haltering the horse from the left side. You want to make sure your horse knows what's happening. If you try to deceive the horse by hiding the halter, he'll learn to be distrustful of your intent. This can lead to a bad relationship between you and the horse. When haltering a horse, you should always approach from the left side. Halters are designed to be buckled on the left. You should approach your horse so you're standing near his head on the left side of his body. You do not want to put the halter on instantly. This can startle your horse. When you are a foot or so away from your horse's head, allow him to sniff your hand. This way, your horse will also familiarize himself with your scent. He'll be able to differentiate your smell from the smell of potential predators in other situations down the road. A nervous horse may benefit from having treats as a reward for staying calm.

Is \\"In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.\\" a good answer to the question \\"Where does Tuscon rank in terms of the largest city in the U.S. in 2009?\\"","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"In 2009, Tucson ranked as the 32nd largest city and 52nd largest metropolitan area in the United States.\\" provides a sufficient answer to the question \\"Where does Tucson rank in terms of the largest city in the U.S. in 2009?\\". However, the answer can be expanded and contextualized to provide a more detailed and comprehensive response. Here is an elaborated answer: In 2009, Tucson, Arizona was ranked as the 32nd largest city by population in the United States. With a population of over 525,000 residents, Tucson was considered a significant urban center within the country. Located in the state of Arizona, Tucson is a thriving city in the Sonoran Desert, surrounded by beautiful mountain ranges. Established in 1775, Tucson has a rich history that predates its status as an American city and plays a major role in the state's development and identity. In addition to its ranking as the 32nd largest city, Tucson was also ranked as the 52nd largest metropolitan area within the United States in 2009. The Tucson metropolitan area, comprising Tucson as well as the surrounding towns and cities in Pima County, had an estimated population of just over 980,000 residents at that time. This designation highlights that Tucson is not only a significant city in its own right, but it is also an important part of a broader region that includes a large number of residents, businesses, and cultural institutions. Tucson's size and ranking in 2009 showcase its importance regionally and nationally, as well as its continued growth and development over the years. As part of the Sun Belt, a region in the United States characterized by its warm climate and rapid population growth since the 1960s, Tucson has been an appealing destination for people seeking new opportunities or looking to enjoy the city's unique desert landscape. Since that time, Tucson has continued to experience changes in its growth and ranking as other cities in the United States evolve and develop. It is important to note that these rankings are subject to change over time, and the latest available data should always be consulted for the most current rankings. However, the statement provided aptly answers the question of Tucson's ranking in 2009, while the expanded information offers a more comprehensive understanding of the city's historical context, regional significance, and potential for future growth."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The loss dropped the Jets to 9-6 and out of first place in the AFC East. Jay Feely put the Jets on the board with a field goal eight minutes into the game and the lead held for most of the remainder of the first half. Seattle scored with thirty one seconds remaining in the half on a Seneca Wallace touchdown pass. Olindo Mare kicked two field goals in the second half, including one with 1:47 remaining to clinch victory for Seattle. Brett Favre was held without a touchdown pass for the Jets and threw two interceptions, and Thomas Jones was held to 67 yards. For the Seahawks Maurice Morris rushed for 116 yards on 29 carries and Wallace finished with 175 yards passing and his second-quarter touchdown. How many more total rushing yards did Maurice Morris have compared to Thomas Jones?","completion":"Maurice Morris rushed for 116 yards and Thomas Jones was held to 67 yards. To find the difference in total rushing yards between the two players, we can simply subtract Thomas Jones' yards from Maurice Morris' yards: 116 yards (Maurice Morris) - 67 yards (Thomas Jones) = 49 yards Maurice Morris had 49 more total rushing yards compared to Thomas Jones in that game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Due to natural selection, organisms with traits that better enable them to adapt to their environment will tend to survive and reproduce in greater numbers. Natural selection causes beneficial heritable traits to become more common in a population and unfavorable heritable traits to become less common. For example, a giraffe’s neck is beneficial because it allows the giraffe to reach leaves high in trees. Natural selection caused this beneficial trait to become more common than short necks. Mike lives in a cold mid-western city, where there is not much predator prey interaction. Mike noticed that in his city some squirrels have darker coat, while others have lighter coat.

The corrected version is: \\"Notice again: 'To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in His throne' (Rev. 3:21).\\" The passage you have provided is taken from the Bible, specifically the Book of Revelation, which is the last book of the New Testament. It is written by the apostle John, who is the recipient of a series of visions and messages that foretell the end times and the second coming of Jesus Christ. In this passage, Jesus promises to those that remain steadfast in their faith and overcome the trials and tribulations they face, the reward of sitting with Him on the throne. This can be understood as a promise of eternal life, salvation, and co-reigning with Jesus in the Kingdom of God. The key themes of this verse are faithfulness, perseverance, and the ultimate reward for those who conquer the challenges that they encounter during their lifetime. This message of hope and reward serves as an inspiration for believers to persist in their faith despite the hardships they may face, as well as assurance that Jesus will be faithful to those who remain true to Him. The imagery of sitting on a throne with Jesus emphasizes the royal nature of the reward, which indicates that these individuals who overcome will share in the divine authority and governance in the new heaven and new earth as described in the Book of Revelation. The reference to Jesus overcoming and sitting down with the Father in His throne is a reminder of how Jesus overcame sin, death, and Satan through His death and resurrection, and also how He established the foundation for this eternal inheritance. In summary, Revelation 3:21 is a passage that offers hope, encouragement, and motivation for believers to face and prevail over any obstacles that come their way, knowing that the reward awaiting them is eternal salvation and the ultimate promise of sharing in the divine authority and glory with Jesus Christ Himself."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I loved it, wore it for years, and haven't had another one since it stopped ticking a decade ago. Why? Because I don't need one. I have a mobile phone and I'm always near someone with an iPod or something like that. All these devices tell the time--which is why, if you look around, you'll see lots of empty wrists; sales of watches to young adults have been going down since 2007. But while the wise have realized that they don't need them, others--apparently including some distinguished men of our time--are spending total fortunes on them. Brands such as Rolex, Patek Philippe and Breitling command shocking prices, up to PS250.000 for a piece. This is ridiculous. Expensive cars go faster than cheap cars. Expensive clothes hang better than cheap clothes. But these days all watches tell the time as well as all other watches. Expensive watches come with extra functions--but who needs them? How often do you dive to 300 metres into the sea or need to find your direction in the area around the South Pole? So why pay that much of five years' school fees for watches that allow you to do these things? If justice were done, the Swiss watch industry should have closed down when the Japanese discovered how to make accurate watches for a five-pound note. Instead the Swiss reinvented the watch, with the aid of millions of pounds' worth of advertising, as a message about the man wearing it. Rolexes are for those who spend their weekends climbing icy mountains; a Patek Philippe is for one from a rich or noble family; a Breitling suggests you like to pilot planes across the world. Watches are now classified as\\"investments\\" . A 1994 Philippe recently sold for nearly PS350, 000, while the 1960s Rolexes have gone from PS15, 000 to PS30, 000 plus in a year.

Cependant, pour vous fournir une réponse détaillée et longue, je vais vous donner plus d'informations concernant la traduction de ce genre de phrases. Tout d'abord, il est important de noter que les acronymes n'ont généralement pas besoin d'être traduits, car ils constituent souvent des abréviations de noms propres ou d'organisations qui restent les mêmes dans toutes les langues. Par conséquent, \\"RIM\\" reste \\"RIM\\" en français. Cependant, il peut y avoir des cas où un acronyme a une signification différente dans une autre langue, ce qui pourrait alors nécessiter une traduction appropriée. Par exemple, si l'acronyme était \\"NASA\\" (National Aeronautics and Space Administration), alors il pourrait être traduit en français par \\"Agence spatiale américaine\\" même si son acronyme reste \\"NASA\\". Dans le contexte de cette phrase, \\"Submission\\" peut être traduit en \\"Soumission\\", qui souligne le fait que vous soumettez quelque chose (par exemple, un document, un projet ou une proposition) à l'organisation mentionnée. En ce qui concerne \\"to\\", il s'agit d'une préposition qui indique la direction ou le destinataire. En français, il peut être traduit par \\"à\\" ou \\"au\\" en fonction du genre et du nombre du nom qui suit. Dans ce cas, \\"au\\" est la traduction correcte puisque \\"RIM\\" est considéré comme un nom masculin singulier en français. Enfin, pour les années, la règle générale est de ne pas les traduire, car elles restent les mêmes dans toutes les langues. Ainsi, \\"2009\\" en anglais reste \\"2009\\" en français.

Movie Title: Disappointment Unleashed Step 1: Begin with an attention-grabbing introduction Justification: An interesting introduction will capture the reader's attention and encourage them to continue reading the review. Review: With a title that perfectly captures the essence of its content, Disappointment Unleashed swoops in like a tornado of bad decisions, destroying everything that made its promising premise so attractive. Step 2: Provide a brief summary of the plot Justification: Giving a brief summary will acquaint the reader with the film's storyline without revealing any spoilers. Review: The movie follows the lackluster journey of protagonist John Doe, a former secret agent, as he is coerced back into action to save the world from a generic megalomaniac villain bent on world domination. Step 3: Discuss the weaknesses in the plot and screenplay Justification: Pointing out the weaknesses in the plot and screenplay allows the reader to understand why the movie fails to deliver. Review: The plot is riddled with glaring clichés, inconsistencies, and illogical actions that completely tear apart any suspension of disbelief. The screenplay offers nothing new to the action genre, recycling tired one-liners and unimaginative set pieces, making the entire experience a true exercise in tolerance. Step 4: Comment on the performances of the actors Justification: Analyzing the performances can help the reader grasp how the actors contributed to the overall quality of the movie. Review: Despite a seasoned cast, the lackluster performances only further diminish the movie's already crumbling foundation. It seems as though the actors are all too aware of the weak material they are working with, resulting in disinterested and uninspired portrayals. Step 5: Evaluate the film's technical aspects Justification: Assessing the film's technical aspects gives a comprehensive review of every aspect of the movie production. Review: Adding insult to injury, Disappointment Unleashed also underwhelms in the technical department. From hastily edited action sequences to an underwhelming and forgettable score, it appears as though every creative choice made was another nail in the coffin for this deeply flawed film. Step 6: End with a concise conclusion Justification: Summing up the review with a clear evaluation will help the reader understand the overall quality of the movie. Review: Overall, Disappointment Unleashed lives up to its name and does little to redeem itself. With a weak plot, unimpressive performances, and forgettable technical aspects, it's best to leave this movie unwatched, unless you enjoy torturing yourself with cinematic failures.

Coopération internationale en matière fiscale Translate this to English?","completion":"\\"International cooperation in fiscal matters\\" The phrase \\"Coopération internationale en matière fiscale\\" translates to \\"International cooperation in fiscal matters\\" in English. This term typically refers to various activities and policies that countries establish and implement together to ensure efficiency, fairness, and transparency in fiscal matters. These activities may include organizing efforts to prevent illegal tax evasion across borders, establishing fair tax competition, ensuring effective information exchange regarding tax matters, and aligning global tax rules. International cooperation in fiscal matters is a crucial topic in the global economy. The primary reason being that in this era of globalization and digital technology, companies and individuals can easily conduct activities and transactions across multiple countries. This then creates complexities in tax-related matters as different countries have diverse tax laws and regulations. Therefore, multiple platforms have been established to enhance this area of cooperation. For example, the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) often takes a lead, providing a forum for governments to work together to share experiences and seek solutions to common problems. It has been active in promoting international cooperation in tax matters, most notably through its Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) project, a comprehensive package of tax reforms aimed at ensuring multinational enterprises pay their fair share of taxes wherever they operate. Another example of an initiative that promotes international cooperation in fiscal matters is the Common Reporting Standard (CRS). Developed by the OECD and adopted by numerous countries, the CRS calls on jurisdictions to obtain information from their financial institutions and automatically exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis. This transparency allows for closer scrutiny of taxpayers’ accounts held overseas and is an effective measure against off-shore tax evasion. Moreover, it isn't just about combating tax evasion and avoidance. International cooperation in fiscal matters also looks at optimizing tax structures, harmonizing tax policies across countries to avoid double taxation, and supporting developing nations in building their tax capacities. In conclusion, international cooperation in fiscal matters is a broad yet vital sector that plays a significant role in shaping up a just and stable global economy. It requires an ongoing commitment from all countries to work together to establish efficient, fair, and transparent tax systems globally."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: – Despite some presidential Twitter drama, the House voted to extend the government's powers of warrantless surveillance another six years on Tuesday with a 256-164 vote, the Hill reports. Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act allows the NSA to collect from US companies texts and emails of foreign targets, even when those targets are communicating with Americans. The legislation was opposed by privacy advocates, and Republican Rep. Justin Amash introduced changes that would have forced authorities to get warrants before obtaining information on Americans caught in the surveillance, according to the Washington Post. Those changes were voted down 183-233. The Senate is expected to vote on and pass a Section 702 renewal before it expires Jan. 19. The vote wasn't without drama. President Trump sent House Republicans scrambling ahead of the vote when he tweeted that Section 702 \\"may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others.\\" Trump's tweet came after the president watched a related segment on Fox News and despite the White House's official support for the legislation. About 90 minutes later he reversed course. \\"Today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\\" Trump tweeted. \\"We need it! Get smart!\\" NPR takes a closer look at what Trump was talking about in his tweets, determining the president's \\"comments throw together a rat's nest of related, semi-related, and unrelated strands.\\"","completion":"Title: House Votes to Extend Powers of Warrantless Surveillance Amid Presidential Drama Despite some confusion and contention stirred by President Trump's tweets, the House of Representatives passed a vote, 256 to 164, to extend the government's authority for warrantless surveillance for another six years, according to a report from The Hill. This decision substantiates and prolongs Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), a policy that grants the National Security Agency (NSA) powers to gather texts and emails from foreign targets via US companies. This power extends even when these targets communicate with American citizens, which has raised serious concerns among privacy advocates. Section 702 has long been a point of debate for privacy advocates, who argue that such warrantless surveillance stands in contrast to fundamental civil rights. The underlying opposition was further emphasized when Republican Representative Justin Amash attempted to introduce changes that would necessitate authorities to secure warrants before gaining access to any information about Americans ensnared in such surveillance. However, these proposed changes were voted down, 183 to 233, according to the Washington Post. The surveillance power extension now sits before the Senate, which is projected to vote and pass the Section 702 renewal before it expires on January 19. The lead-up to the vote in the House was served with a side of drama when President Donald Trump, following a related segment on Fox News, tweeted contentious remarks about Section 702, suggesting its potential misuse during his campaign by the former administration. The tweet left many House Republicans in disarray, especially given the White House's official endorsement of the legislation. Around 90 minutes later, however, President Trump appeared to reverse his stance in another tweet emphasizing the importance of foreign surveillance. \\"Today's vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land,\\" Trump wrote. \\"We need it! Get smart!\\" Nevertheless, the President's initial remarks raised numerous questions and speculations. NPR sought to unpack Trump's tweets and establish an understanding of their context, concluding that the president's \\"comments throw together a rat's nest of related, semi-related, and unrelated strands.\\" What remains clear is that the fate of Section 702, alongside the complex interplay of foreign surveillance, civil rights, and political statements, continues to remain a contentious and significant issue in contemporary American politics. This case provides a clear illustration of how intricate and complex legislative processes can become when they intersect with advanced communication technologies, individual political agendas, and critical civil issues such as privacy rights. And, as the nation awaits the Senate's decision, we are reminded of how closely our civil liberties are linked to the judgments made within corridors of power."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize: Cleveland Police allegedly tried to monitor the activity of six people after a 2012 front-page story in the Northern Echo. This included reporters from the paper, a staff member and a solicitor, the Echo said. The force has not commented to the BBC. A complaint has been lodged by the Police Federation with the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The force allegedly used the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act (RIPA) - which governs surveillance in relation to crime or concerns over public safety - to identify the whistle-blower. An application was made, the Echo said, after it published the story, which was based on an internal force report about institutionalised racism within the force. A Cleveland Police spokeswoman told the paper she could \\"neither confirm nor deny\\" whether a RIPA application had been made to monitor the phone activity of three of its journalists, a serving police officer, a solicitor and the then-chairman of Cleveland Police Federation. Northern Echo editor Peter Barron said: \\"These allegations are a matter of serious concern - that a police force should apparently go to these lengths to identify the source of a story which was clearly in the public interest. \\"This is surely not what the legislation was intended to do and the fact that Cleveland Police will neither confirm nor deny the allegations adds to our concerns.\\" The IPCC confirmed it had received the letter of complaint from the National Police Federation on behalf of the Cleveland Police Federation chair. Once registered, the complaint will be referred back to Cleveland Police to look at before the IPCC considers an independent investigation.

Which of the following solutions is better for the following goal: How to melt wax?","completion":"To determine the best solution for melting wax, we need to consider multiple factors such as safety, efficiency, and convenience. Here, I will outline two common methods for melting wax and provide a comparative analysis to decide which one is better. 1. Double Boiler Method: A double boiler is a traditional stove-top method that involves placing a heat-safe bowl or container containing wax over a pot of simmering water. The steam from the water indirectly heats the container, thus melting the wax gently and evenly. Advantages: - It is a safer method, as the risk of overheating or burning the wax is considerably low. - The wax temperature can be maintained easily and consistently by controlling the water's temperature. - Suitable for melting various types of wax, including candle wax, paraffin wax, and beeswax. Disadvantages: - Takes longer to melt wax as the heat is indirect. - Requires constant supervision to ensure the water does not boil away. 2. Microwave Method: This method involves placing wax in a microwave-safe container and heating it in a microwave at short intervals. The wax is stirred between each interval to promote even melting. Advantages: - It is a faster method, typically taking only a few minutes to melt wax. - Easy and convenient as most households have access to a microwave. - Uses less energy compared to the double boiler method. Disadvantages: - Uneven heating can cause temperature spikes and result in overheated wax, releasing toxic fumes. - Monitoring the melting wax can be challenging due to microwaving at short intervals. - Not suitable for all types of wax, as some waxes need consistent, gentle heat to avoid damaging their properties. Comparative Analysis: The double boiler method is a safer option, offering more precise control of temperature and reduces the chance of overheating the wax. While it may take longer to melt the wax, it's ideal for all types of wax, ensuring quality and consistency. This method is essential in crafting high-quality candles, cosmetics, or other products that require greater control over wax properties. On the other hand, the microwave method is a quicker solution that's more energy-efficient. However, it lacks the level of temperature control offered by the double boiler method. It can result in uneven heating and limit its applicability to specific types of wax. Conclusion: Considering safety, efficiency, and convenience, the double boiler method is the better solution for melting wax. It provides better temperature control, consistency, and accommodates various types of wax, ultimately resulting in better outcomes for your projects. While the microwave method may be faster, the risks and limitations outweigh the benefits and make it less suitable for most wax melting purposes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What kind of thing would answer this question?","completion":"To tie-dye clothes, you will need a few materials and follow some simple steps. Tie-dying is a fun and creative way to add color and design to clothing. The process involves using colored dyes and different tying techniques to create unique patterns on fabric. Here is a step-by-step guide on how to tie-dye clothes: Materials: 1. White or light-colored clothing (cotton works best) 2. Fabric dye (you can use multiple colors for more vibrant results) 3. Rubber bands or string 4. Gloves (to avoid staining your hands with the dye) 5. Plastic wrap or large plastic bags 6. Buckets or containers for dye baths 7. Water 8. Mixing sticks or spoons 9. White vinegar or soda ash (to help the dye set) 10. Access to water for rinsing (sink, hose, or washing machine) Here's a detailed process to tie-dye your clothes: Step 1: Prewash your fabric Before you begin tie-dying, make sure to prewash your fabric. This removes any dirt, grease, or sizing from the fabric and ensures that the dye will bond better. Keep your fabric damp after washing, as it's easier to apply the dye to wet fabric. Step 2: Choose your dyeing technique There are several tying techniques that create different patterns on your fabric. Some popular patterns are the classic spiral, bullseye, sunburst, and accordion folds. Choose the technique you'd like to create on your clothing, and follow the corresponding folding and tying method. Step 3: Tie your fabric Using your chosen technique, fold and tie the fabric with rubber bands or string. Ensure the ties are secure, as they will create the pattern by resisting the dye. Step 4: Prepare your dye Following the instructions on your fabric dye, mix the dye with water in your buckets or containers. If your dye requires a fixative to help it set, mix either white vinegar or soda ash into the dye bath. Step 5: Apply the dye to your fabric Put on your gloves and begin applying dye to your tied fabric. You can either submerge your fabric in the dye bath or use squeeze bottles to apply the dye directly to specific areas. Make sure you saturate the fabric well with the dye to achieve a vibrant result. Step 6: Wrap the dyed fabric Once you've applied the dye, wrap your fabric in plastic wrap or place it in a large plastic bag. This helps to keep the dye moist, allowing it to set more effectively. Let the fabric sit for at least 6-8 hours, or for the time specified by your dye manufacturer. Some people let their fabric sit for up to 24 hours for more vibrant colors. Step 7: Rinse and wash your fabric After the dye has set, remove your fabric from the plastic wrap and carefully remove the rubber bands or string. Rinse the fabric with cold water until the water runs clear. Then, wash your tie-dyed clothing separately using mild detergent and warm water. This removes any excess dye and helps to prevent color bleeding. After washing, dry your fabric according to its care instructions. Step 8: Enjoy your tie-dyed clothing Now you have a uniquely designed piece of tie-dyed clothing. Show off your creation and enjoy the vibrant colors and patterns. Remember that experimentation and practice are key to perfecting your tie-dye technique. Try different folding and tying methods, as well as different dye combinations to find your favorite styles and designs."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

As he investigates, Strachey becomes convinced Rutka and Santin are staging the various attacks, quits the case, and returns the unused portion of the retainer. The next morning, a news program reports Rutka's death. When Santin indignantly calls him, Strachey apologizes, returns with Santin to retrieve Rutka's files for safekeeping, and retakes the case.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Controversial Rally Set to Take Place at Gettysburg National Military Park on October 5 Subtitle: Park Officials Defend the Group's Right to Hold Event Under the First Amendment Date: September 30 Gettysburg National Military Park in Pennsylvania is set to host a rally on October 5 despite concerns raised by some surrounding its controversial nature. Park officials have stated that the group organizing the event has the right to hold the rally, as guaranteed by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which protects freedom of speech, assembly, and the right to petition the government for redress of grievances. The group in question, which has chosen to remain anonymous, has faced widespread criticism for its views and messages conveyed during previous demonstrations, prompting public backlash and debates over the appropriateness of rallying at such a historic and symbolically significant site. Gettysburg National Military Park, established in 1895, commemorates and preserves the site of the Battle of Gettysburg, a turning point in the American Civil War that effectively ended Confederate General Robert E. Lee's second and arguably his most ambitious invasion of the North. The decision to allow the event to proceed appears to be an effort to balance the protection of First Amendment rights and respect for the historical significance of the park, which continues to draw intense public interest and discussion. As one of the most visited national military parks in the country, Gettysburg remains a symbolic site representing the struggle for unity and civil liberties in the United States. Park officials have defended their position by emphasizing the importance of upholding the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution, even in the face of potentially provocative and contentious topics. They cited the First Amendment not only as protection for the organizers' right to assemble and express their views but also as a bulwark that ensures the preservation of historical sites like Gettysburg, where the lessons of the past can be confronted and discussed openly. The upcoming rally on October 5 is not the first event of its kind held at the park; the group organized a similar demonstration in early September, which also sparked controversy and debates over free speech and historical preservation. Critics of the rallies argue that allowing these potentially divisive events at such hallowed ground might detract from Gettysburg's primary purpose: to provide a space where visitors can reflect on the gravity of the Civil War and its impact on American history. On the other hand, proponents of the group's right to hold the event state that allowing them to rally at Gettysburg might serve as a timely reminder of the very liberties and principles that the site represents. As the park itself bears witness to a nation divided, it is crucial to uphold the constitutional rights that ultimately define the freedoms and values the United States was built upon. As the October 5 rally approaches, park officials, participants, and the public alike will be forced to grapple with the delicate balance between the exercise of First Amendment rights and the respectful preservation of the nation's historical landmarks. Gettysburg National Military Park will undoubtedly remain a site of reflection for the ongoing triumphs and challenges faced by the United States as a nation committed to upholding the ideals of civil liberties and unity."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Victoria lacked a great deal of patience. So while Emily continued to develop her sewing skills, Victoria decided to try something else that might suit her temperament better. She thought about what kind of hobbies she could dedicate her time to, ones that would bring her more immediate satisfaction. After some research, she stumbled upon painting. Intrigued, Victoria bought some basic supplies and set up her first canvas. Emily, on the other hand, was finding a lot of joy in sewing. She took her time to learn various stitches, patterns, and techniques, eagerly following tutorials to create intricate designs. She found the process to be soothing and rewarding, as her patience allowed her to produce beautiful, detailed work. Eventually, she started working on more elaborate projects, such as quilting and creating custom clothing. Victoria dove headfirst into the world of painting, quickly discovering that she enjoyed the spontaneity and creative freedom it provided. Unlike sewing, which required her to follow specific patterns and be meticulous, painting allowed her to quickly capture her emotions and ideas on the canvas. Without the need for extensive planning or preparation, Victoria felt more in control and excited to see immediate results. One day, Emily and Victoria decided to combine their newfound skills and collaborate on a project. They brainstormed ideas and settled on creating a unique piece of artwork together. Emily sewed a beautiful tapestry, featuring intricate patterns and designs. Victoria, feeling inspired, added vibrant colors and bold strokes of paint to the tapestry, enhancing the visual impact of the piece. The finished tapestry was a stunning combination of both their skills, showcasing the harmonious blend of sewing and painting. Emily's patience and dedication to detail in the sewing perfectly complemented Victoria's spontaneous and expressive painting style. Their friends and family were amazed by the incredible piece of art they had created together. Through this experience, Emily and Victoria learned that, despite their contrasting personalities and individual interests, they could still find a way to collaborate and create something beautiful. They continued to explore their respective passions while also encouraging and supporting each other's creative journey.

First, they had to pay a 10 cover charge, which might have led them to expect certain quality facilities and entertainment.

Given those answer options, answer the question: U.S. President Donald Trump says he may veto a 1.3 trillion spending bill because it does not offer protections for young undocumented immigrants who arrived as children and does not fully fund the border wall. In a Twitter post Friday morning, Trump said he is considering a veto of the omnibus spending bill based on \\"the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded.\\" Previously, White House officials said Trump would sign the spending package, a move that would head off a potential government shutdown due to a lack of funding. The measure funds the federal government through September 30. If Trump does not sign the legislation into law, the federal government will shut down at 12:01 a.m. Saturday. The Senate passed the bill by a 65-32 vote early Friday morning after the House of Representatives approved the measure Thursday. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill considers major legislation this year. The measure fulfills Trump’s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill includes a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides 1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the 25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Just because he might not have shown interest in the past doesn't mean he can't grow to like you in the future.\\" Evalle nodded half-heartedly, trying her best to believe in Lanna's words. She couldn't shake the nagging feeling that she had messed up, that she had pushed him away by revealing her emotions too soon. Their friendship had always been the perfect blend of laughter, understanding, and support – perhaps adding romantic feelings into the mix had ruined everything. The thought was unbearable. \\"Why don't you try talking to him?\\" Lanna suggested, leaning toward Evalle as she placed a comforting hand on her arm. \\"Get his perspective on things.

Yet, the thought of rejection loomed over her like a dark cloud, threatening to send her spiraling into a pit of loneliness and despair.

It is held on the last Wednesday of August.?","completion":"The festival you are referring to is called \\"La Tomatina.\\" La Tomatina is a unique and world-famous event held annually in the Valencian town of Buñol, Spain, on the last Wednesday of August. The festival is centered around a massive tomato fight, where participants engage in throwing tomatoes at each other for fun and amusement. La Tomatina's origin dates back to 1945, when a group of young people were participating in a parade with musicians, giants, and big-heads figures in Buñol's town square. A participant accidentally fell off one of the big-heads, causing a fight to ensue in which someone grabbed tomatoes from a nearby vegetable stall and started throwing them as a form of retaliation. The following year, people brought tomatoes from their homes to engage in a tomato fight without any official permission. Eventually, after several years of being banned and embraced, La Tomatina festival became part of Buñol's official annual festivities in 1975. The event now attracts thousands of participants from all over the world, who gather in Buñol to be part of this exciting and fun-filled spectacle. The festival begins early in the morning when trucks carrying loads of ripe tomatoes make their way through the town square. Once the event starts, people throw tomatoes at each other for approximately one hour, resulting in the streets and participants being covered in a sea of red tomato pulp. To ensure safety and order, certain rules are put in place during La Tomatina. Participants are required to crush the tomatoes before throwing them to avoid injuring anyone. It is prohibited to bring any hard objects, wear flip-flops, or throw anything other than tomatoes during the event. The tomato fight ends with the firing of a second shot, signaling participants to stop throwing tomatoes. Once La Tomatina's tomato fight is over, the town's streets and participants are hosed down, leaving Buñol clean and spotless. Participants can also make use of public showers or take a dip in the local river to wash off the tomato residue. Following the cleaning, the remaining festival activities commence, including music, dancing, and food events, as people celebrate the unique tradition and joy of La Tomatina."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Read this article and answer this question Somers and his company remained in Bermuda for 10 months, living on food they could gather on the island and fish from the sea. Some commentators believe that this incident inspired William Shakespeare's play The Tempest. During their time on the islands, the crew and passengers built a church and houses, the start of the Bermuda colony. Somers and Sir Thomas Gates oversaw the construction of two small ships, the Deliverance and the Patience. They were built from local timber and the salvaged spars and rigging of the wrecked Sea Venture. In May 1610 the ships set sail for Jamestown, with the surviving 142 castaways on board taking food from the island. When they reached the settlement, they found it nearly destroyed by the famine and disease of what has been called the \\"Starving Time\\". Few of the supplies from the Supply Relief Fleet had arrived , and only 60 settlers survived. Only the food and help offered by those on the two small ships from Bermuda, followed by a relief fleet in July 1610 commanded by Lord Delaware, enabled the colony to survive and avoided the abandonment of Jamestown. Somers returned to Bermuda in the Patience to collect more food, but he became ill on the journey. He died in Bermuda on 9 November 1610 at age 56.

Federal prosecutors involved in escapee’s case get protection BY FRANK MAIN AND FRAN SPIELMAN Staff Reporters Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center at 71 W. Van Buren St. Last week, Banks told U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, “You’ll hear from me!” after he was found guilty of bank robbery. | FBI photo storyidforme: 41897451 tmspicid: 15470045 fileheaderid: 7004157 Updated: Even though he made an apparent threat to a judge last week, Joseph “Jose” Banks wasn’t under extra security in the federal jail in downtown Chicago. The convicted bank robber escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center early Tuesday with fellow bank robber Kenneth Conley. They apparently crawled through a hole bashed in their 17th-floor cell and slid down a rope fashioned from sheets. Last week, Banks told U.S. District Judge Rebecca Pallmeyer, “You’ll hear from me!” after he was found guilty of bank robbery. An apparent threat like that would typically land a prisoner in a special housing unit where he would be allowed out just one hour a day until authorities checked it out, said a source familiar with the jail’s procedures. The decision to house Banks in the general jail population raises questions about the security there, the source said. Indeed, Pallmeyer and the federal prosecutors in Banks’ case are now being given special protection because of the apparent threat. On Wednesday, authorities said a videotape from a private surveillance camera showed the robbers fleeing in a cab on Congress Parkway around 2:40 a.m. Tuesday. Officials continued the manhunt Wednesday and the FBI offered a 50,000 reward for information leading to the escapees’ capture. On Wednesday, the head of the national jail guards union and Chicago Police Supt. Garry McCarthy raised questions about the escape, but federal prison officials didn’t have many answers. Dale Deshotel, president of the Council of Prison Locals 33, said the escape raises key concerns about whether there was enough staffing at the jail and whether it was an “inside job” that involved a bribed jail employee. He also wondered whether jail officials assigned anyone to conduct regular patrols outside the facility to look for signs of an escape. McCarthy said the daring breakout will almost certainly result in disciplinary action — and it should. “There’s probably some sort of a systematic problem, and I’m sure that they will address it,” he said. Banks and Conley were accounted for at a 10 p.m. Monday head count. Jail employees discovered the escape at 7 a.m. Tuesday. It’s unclear what happened during the usual head counts at midnight, 3 a.m. and 5 a.m. Ed Ross, spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Prisons, said escapes from “secured facilities” like the MCC are rare. “From time to time, we have inmates who walk away from camps, but those are not considered secured facilities, and they don’t have fences and perimeter patrols,” he said. Ross said the last escape from a secured federal facility was in 2006, when convicted murderer Richard McNair busted out of the U.S. penitentiary in Pollock, La. Ross said he couldn’t provide details of the circumstances surrounding Tuesday’s escape. In 1985, two inmates engineered a similar breakout from the MCC. They smuggled a barbell from a workout area into their sixth-floor cell and punched a hole in the cinder-block wall. They used a cord connected to a floor buffer to rappel down the wall to the plaza below. Last year, a Chicago narcotics kingpin testified about several glaring security breaches at the MCC. Saul Rodriguez told a jury he recruited his wife and an inmate to smuggle a cellphone into the jail. He also said he used his job as a jail orderly to get close to a Mexican drug cartel leader who wanted government witnesses killed. ||||| Two convicted bank robbers who pulled off a daring overnight escape from a high-rise Chicago jail had changed from their prison garb by the time they hopped into a cab near the lock-up, investigators said Wednesday as they expanded their manhunt for the men.

Chicago Police Sgt. Michael... (Associated Press) Authorities were raiding houses and combing through records looking for anybody with ties to the inmates who climbed out a jail window and descended 20 stories using a makeshift rope. The FBI said surveillance footage from a camera near the Metropolitan Correctional Center shows Kenneth Conley and Joseph Banks getting into a cab at about 2:45 a.m. Tuesday _ about two hours before guards were supposed to do a bed check and four hours before workers spotted the rope dangling from the federal jail. The pair had changed from their orange jail-issued jumpsuits into light-colored pants and shirts, the FBI said. \\"We don't know if they fashioned their own clothes, or what,\\" said Special Agent Frank Bochte. The FBI was offering a 50,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of Conley and Banks, with the manhunt focused mainly on Chicago and its suburbs. Law enforcement officials said at least three homes in the suburbs south of Chicago where one of the inmates once lived were searched Tuesday, and a suburban strip club where Conley once worked confirmed that investigators had visited. Investigators believe the men had been at a home in Tinley Park, 25 miles southwest of Chicago, just hours before police SWAT teams stormed it. A law enforcement official said the home was that of Conley's mother and that after the woman refused to let the escapees in, the men used a rock to break a window. The person, who was not authorized to discuss the investigation so would speak only on condition of anonymity, said authorities also searched the home of a former girlfriend of Conley in nearby New Lenox, where the escapees had eaten breakfast. In Orland Park, which borders Tinley Park, police Chief Timothy McCarthy said records revealed Conley had been arrested several years ago on a robbery charge. \\"We looked at our own files and came up with a former colleague, a past associate,\\" he said. Orland Park officers helped search a house where the associate lives or once lived, he said, but there was no evidence the escaped inmates had been there. But the chain of events illustrates just the kind of thing investigators are doing: looking through records, arrest reports and even traffic tickets in the hopes of finding where the men went. Authorities have not said exactly how many people are involved with the search. But the entire 35-member staff of the U.S. Marshals Service's Chicago office was involved, a show of force that spokeswoman Belkis Cantor said \\"was rare.\\" Many questions remained about how the two managed to pull off such an escape from the federal prison in the heart of downtown Chicago. At the top of the list is how they could have smashed a gaping hole into the wall at the bottom of a 6-inch wide window being heard or seen by correctional officers. Another question is why, in the federal facility that houses some 700 inmates, the correctional officers didn't notice the men were missing between a 10 p.m. headcount and one at 5 a.m. A guidebook for jail inmates indicates there would have been headcounts at midnight and 3 a.m. But inmates aren't required to stand for those headcounts, only for ones at 4 p.m. and 10 p.m. It's unclear if guards may have been fooled by items the FBI said the men stuffed under their beds to make it appear they were there. It's also unclear what happened between when authorities have said guards first realized the men were missing and when the rope was spotted at 7 a.m. Authorities also have not said how the two men managed to collect 200 feet of bed sheet or how the broke through the wall. The escape bore a striking resemblance to one at the same jail in 1985. In that case, convicted murderer Bernard Welch and an accomplice, Hugh Colomb, smashed through a window with a bar from a weight set and used bed sheets and an electrical cord attached to a floor buffer to descend six stories to the ground. William Rollins, a Washington, D.C., police detective at the time who was brought in by the U.S. Marshals Service to investigate, said the noise of breaking the wall would have been deafening. But he thinks other inmates would have gladly made a lot of noise to drown out the sound. \\"They will lure a guard into the laundry room and have all the dryers going,\\" said Rollins, now retired, whose investigation is included in a book about Welch by Jack Burch and James B. King called \\"Ghost Burglar.\\" Not only that, but he said his investigation revealed that inmates had hidden hacksaw blades in ceiling tiles and drill bits in bed frames. \\"And they used a vacuum cleaner motor to power the drill bit,\\" he said. \\"These guys are really creative.\\" Rollins said it's likely Conley and Banks are still in the area. The vast majority of escapees don't stray too far, he said. \\"They stay where they feel comfortable in that environment,\\" he said. ||||| The mother of one of the two bank robbers who daringly escaped from a Chicago jail cell by breaking through the window and scurrying down the building, notified the police of their visit to her Tinley Park suburban home. Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks and Kenneth Conley turned up at the home of Sandy Conley after they scaled the wall of the jail using a rope fashioned from bed sheets and blankets. Once they arrived at the home where Conley's mother lived with her other children on Tuesday morning, they were quickly turned away, her landlord said. \\"He came into the house and he was with the other guy, and they came up and she said, 'I can't help you.' Then she called the police,\\" Ron Bailey, Sandy Conley's landlord, told ABCNews.com. \\"I don't know if I'd have been able to do that to my own kid.\\" As a massive manhunt for the two bank robbers, who police said should be considered \\"armed and dangerous,\\" entered its second day, the FBI announced it would offer a 50,000 reward for information leading to their apprehension, ABC-owned Chicago station WLS reported. An upstairs neighbor told landlord Ron Bailey that Banks and Conley showed up at the home and Conley's mother took a gun away from him before they left, WLS reported. The FBI stormed the house but believe they missed the escapees by a few hours. Banks, 37, and Conley, 38, were being held at the Metropolitan Correctional Center, a federal jail in Chicago's Loop District. Police said the two men, who were cell mates, were last seen in the jail Monday at 10 p.m. during a head count. Bailey said that he was sitting at the bar he owns in Tinley Park watching the television when he saw news footage of his property being swarmed by police. \\"I just saw the SWAT team and the feds coming at the house,\\" he said. \\"I jumped in my car and got over there, but they wouldn't let me near the place. I waited half an hour, and then left.\\" Bailey said that he had spoken to Sandy Conley, who works as a home nurse, several times since her encounter with her son and Banks. \\"She's upset, she's crying,\\" he said. \\"She's a good woman.\\" In an FBI affidavit filed Tuesday night, authorities said sometime after the head count the two men stuffed their beds with clothes in the shape of bodies and broke the window inside their cell. They squeezed through the 5-inch window and scaled down more than 20 stories using a rope made of bed sheets, towels and blankets. To cover up their escape, Banks and Conley made fake bars to put over the window and placed the actual metal bars inside a mattress, according to the affidavit. Police did not realize the men had escaped until approximately 7 a.m. Tuesday when arriving employees noticed the rope that led the men to freedom still dangling from the building. Four elementary schools and a middle school were put on a soft lockdown, and all after school activities were canceled after police got word the escapees had been spotted in Tinley Park, WLS reported. FBI spokeswoman Joan Hyde said the trail had since gone cold, and that no one should take matters into their own hands if Banks and Conley were spotted. Banks, known as the Second-Hand Bandit because he wore used clothes during his heists, was convicted last week of robbing two banks and attempting to rob two others. Court records show that he stole less than 600,000, but more than 500,000 of it is still missing, and he could have access to it, WLS reported. Banks, who represented himself at trial, had to be restrained at one point and vowed he would seek retribution, telling the judge, \\"You'll hear from me,\\" WLS reported. Conley was scheduled to be sentenced on Jan. 10 after he pleaded guilty to robbing 4,000 from a bank, according to WLS. ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"Two convicted bank robbers, Joseph \\"Jose\\" Banks and Kenneth Conley, escaped from the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Chicago by scaling down the 17th-floor building using a rope made from bed sheets.

Here is an article: Another reason why England's gun confiscation was a bad idea.. Mom could have offed it with a 9mm pistol.. Murders are as high as ever in jolly old England and the police are carrying assault weapons and pistols now because of the high instances of violence.. The US has far less violent crime per capita then they do but they are supposed to be a model for our future?? US street gangs are the big problem and Obama is ignoring that his people are the problem.. Take away American citizen's guns and arm Jihadists and revolutionaries of the world along with passing thousands of weapons to Mexican drug cartels, Obama's great plan?? US High in Gun Ownership, Low in Murder Rate Several reports on gun ownership around the world clearly refute the assertion that the abundance of guns in the United States leads to a high rate of firearm homicides. Americans are the biggest gun owners by far, with an estimated 270 million civilian firearms, in addition to those used by law enforcement and the military. That’s according to the Small Arms Survey of 178 nations conducted by the Switzerland-based Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies. In sheer numbers of civilian firearms, the No. 2 nation, surprisingly, is India with 46 million, followed by China (40 million), Germany (25 million), Pakistan (18 million), and Mexico (15 million). The United States also leads in gun ownership rate, with about 88 firearms per 100 people, according to the most recent Small Arms Survey compiled in 2007. That is far ahead of No. 2 Yemen, which has 55 firearms per 100 people. Switzerland is third with 46 per 100 people, followed by Finland (45), Serbia (38), Cyprus (36), Saudi Arabia (35), and Iraq (34). But when it comes to the firearm homicide rate, the United States doesn’t even make the top 25. According to figures collected by the United Nations’ Office on Drugs and Crime through its annual crime survey, 9,146 Americans were victims of a firearm homicide in the most recent year. That translates to a rate of 2.97 firearm homicides per 100,000 population, only the 27th highest rate in the world. The highest rate by far can be found in Honduras, 68 homicides per 100,000, followed by El Salvador (40), Jamaica (39), Venezuela (38.9), Guatemala (34), and Colombia (27). For America’s neighbors, the rate in Mexico is 9.9 per 100,000, and in Canada, 0.5 per 100,000. It is interesting to note that not only does the United States have a relatively low homicide rate compared to its gun ownership rate, but Switzerland, which ranks third in the civilian gun ownership rate, has only the 46th highest homicide rate, and Finland, with the fourth highest ownership rate, is 63rd on the list. “The most obnoxious liberal talking points on guns involve the idea that guns, in and of themselves, cause gun violence,” writes CNS News commentator Stephen Gutowski. “In other words, more guns must mean more gun violence.” But in light of the ownership and homicide figures, he observes: “More guns do not, in fact, mean more gun violence. Guns can be, and commonly are, used in a responsible manner, especially here in the United States.” Write a title for it.","completion":"\\"US Leads in Gun Ownership but Not in Firearm Homicide Rates: Debunking the Gun Violence Myth\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the question: I can use this background: In the U.S., the majority of electricity is produced by burning coal or other fossil fuels. This causes air pollution, acid rain, and global warming. Fossil fuels are also limited and may eventually run out. Like fossil fuels, radioactive elements are limited. In fact, they are relatively rare, so they could run out sooner rather than later. On the other hand, nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause the other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels. This is the major advantage of using nuclear fission as a source of energy. Now, I have a new situation: Jennifer is currently looking for a new city to move to since she is looking to change her life and just do something different. Jennifer is a strong environmentalist and doesn't want to move to a city that contributes a lot to climate change since she feels it's every person's duty to take care of the Earth. She looks online and finds out about two cities in Minnesota that are several hundred miles apart. Jamestown has a very famous water park and uses coal to generate the city's electricity. Dapperton, the other city she is considering, has a neat hobby shop that Jennifer likes and the city uses nuclear power for its electricity needs. Answer this question please: Will Dapperton have a higher or lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown? The answer is:","completion":"Dapperton will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown. Step 1: Identify the sources of electricity generation for both cities - Jamestown uses coal - Dapperton uses nuclear power Step 2: Understand the environmental impact of the different sources of electricity generation - Coal burning produces air pollution, acid rain, and contributes to global warming - Nuclear fission does not release air pollution or cause other environmental problems associated with burning fossil fuels Step 3: Compare the cities based on their electricity generation methods - Since coal burning contributes to acid rain, and Jamestown uses coal for electricity generation, Jamestown will have a higher chance of acid rain - Dapperton, on the other hand, uses nuclear power, which does not cause acid rain Conclusion: Dapperton, which uses nuclear power for its electricity needs, will have a lower chance of acid rain than Jamestown, which relies on coal for electricity generation."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The Marco Polo Bridge Incident on 7 July 1937 provoked full-scale war between China and Japan. The Nationalist and Communist Chinese suspended their civil war to form a nominal alliance against Japan, and the Soviet Union quickly lent support by providing large amount of materiel to Chinese troops. In August 1937, Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek deployed his best army to fight about 300,000 Japanese troops in Shanghai, but, after three months of fighting, Shanghai fell. The Japanese continued to push the Chinese forces back, capturing the capital Nanking in December 1937 and committed which was known as Nanking Massacre. In March 1938, Nationalist forces won their first victory at Taierzhuang. but then the city of Xuzhou was taken by Japanese in May. In June 1938, Japan deployed about 350,000 troops to invade Wuhan and captured it in October. The Japanese achieved major military victories, but world opinion—in particular in the United States—condemned Japan, especially after the Panay Incident.

Please answer the following question: A friend asked me to answer this question: Where were sixty thousand more were sold in 2005?, using the article: The mountainous terrain and geographic features of El Hatillo have made it difficult to extend the Caracas Metro to southeast Caracas, so the main transportation methods in the municipality are private vehicles and road public transportation. An extension of the Metro – Line 5 – has been proposed, but construction has not been initiated as of 2007; phase 2 of Line 4 is still under construction. Urban planning in the municipality has been unorganised; news archives show that at least since 1998, neighbors have been complaining about the dense traffic caused by new residential and commercial construction, yet new or enhanced alternative roads to resolve the traffic problems have not been completed. A south beltway suggested 25 years ago has not been constructed due to its high cost. However, as of January 2006, a new route that will connect La Lagunita with Macaracuay – a neighborhood in northeast Caracas – is under construction and is planned to be completed in 2010; according to Mayor Catalán, 23% of El Hatillo's inhabitants will eventually use this transit way. Its cost was estimated in early 2006 as US19,572,000.Local solutions – such as the proposed Metro extension line and the road connecting La Lagunita and Macaracuay – may improve the traffic congestion around El Hatillo, but the traffic issue affects all of Caracas. It is estimated that one million vehicles transit Caracas daily, causing a collapse of the transportation network. Automobiles travel at an average speed of 15 km/h (9 mph) on the streets and highways of Caracas. There are numerous factors contributing to the traffic problem in Caracas. According to the Venezuelan Society of Transportation Engineers, a city should allocate 20% of its public area to transportation; in Caracas, less than 12% is allocated. In 2004, fifty thousand new vehicles were sold in Caracas. In 2005, sixty thousand more were sold, and as of November, 2006, seventy thousand more had been sold.

He rolled the torn yellow paper up like a tight little spliff, then unrolled it, smoothed it out flat, and then rolled it again. I was midway through my third cup of coffee with no intention of stopping soon. I was tired and edgy, irritated at William for dragging me out at this time of night, and getting even more irritated at his refusal to get to the point. 'Did you know Philip K. Dick had a twin sister?' I stared at him blankly. 'Her name was Jane. She died shortly after their birth. They were six weeks premature,' he continued, his eyes drifting off to the window to his right. I wasn't sure if he was looking at something through it or staring at his own reflection in it. 'Dick never got over Jane's death; her ghost haunted him throughout his life, and the idea of a phantom twin pops up throughout his work. Some have even speculated that Dick's inability to make peace with the loss of his sister contributed to his drug abuse, and by extension also his death at the relatively young age of 53.' He unrolled the sweetener packet, laid it on the table, placed both index fingers together in its center, and then spread them outward, smoothing the paper flat. I reached out and slammed my own hand on top of the packet, preventing him from fiddling with it anymore. 'Sorry,' he said sheepishly. I let out a sigh.

Answer the following question: What is the missing first step of the following process: - Bread absorbs water from the air - Bread absorbs warmth from the air - Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread - Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy - Mold colonies grow until they are visible. Answer:","completion":"The missing first step of the process is \\"Exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment.\\" To provide a detailed explanation, here are the complete steps of mold growth on bread: 1. Exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment: Bread, or any other food item for that matter, begins to develop mold when it is exposed to a conducive environment. For mold to grow, it requires warmth, moisture, and a suitable food source. By placing bread in a humid and warm area, the chances of mold growth increase significantly. 2. Bread absorbs water from the air: As bread comes into contact with moist air, its porous structure enables it to absorb water from the surrounding environment. The absorbed water provides the necessary moisture for mold growth. If the bread is stored in a particularly damp or humid area, it will absorb more water, further increasing the likelihood of mold development. 3. Bread absorbs warmth from the air: In addition to moisture, mold also requires warmth to grow. As bread absorbs warmth from its surroundings, the temperature within the bread becomes more favorable for mold growth. If the bread is stored near a heat source or in a room with a high ambient temperature, the rate of mold growth can accelerate. 4. Dust particles with mold spores fall on bread: Mold spores are microscopic organisms that are present almost everywhere, including air, surfaces, and even food. These spores may land on the bread through contact with hands, utensils, or airborne dust particles. Additionally, insects or other pests attracted to the bread may leave spore-contaminated feces on the food. 5. Mold spores start to consume the bread for energy: Once the mold spores come into contact with the moist and warm bread, they begin to germinate and form tiny structures called hyphae. Hyphae secrete enzymes that break down the bread's nutrients into simpler compounds, which are then absorbed by the mold spores to provide energy for growth. 6. Mold colonies grow until they are visible: As the mold continues to consume the bread, the number of mold spores and hyphae increases rapidly, forming a dense network called mycelium. When the mold colony reaches a certain size and density, it becomes visible to the naked eye, often appearing as green, black, or white fuzzy patches on the surface of the bread. Thus, exposing the bread to a humid and warm environment represents the missing first step in this process. By understanding these steps, precautions can be taken to reduce the likelihood of mold growth on bread, such as storing it in a cool, dry place and using clean utensils when handling it."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Once we know what shirt we want, we need to gather materials. We'll need: - Big paper (like gift wrapping paper or newspaper) - Scissors - A tape measure or ruler - A pencil or marker - A shirt we like (to use as a guide) - Tape or pins (to hold things in place) 3. Let's start by laying out the paper on a flat surface. Make sure it's big enough to cover the entire shirt. 4. Place the shirt you like on the paper. It's important to smooth out the shirt and make sure it's lying flat. If you need help, don't hesitate to ask a grown-up. 5. Now, we will trace around the shirt using a pencil or marker. While drawing, add some extra space (about 1 inch or 2.5 centimeters) around the edges to make the shirt a little bigger. This extra space is for sewing the shirt together later. 6. When you finish tracing, let's cut out the shape with scissors. Be careful and ask for help if you need it. Cut along the lines you drew to create a shirt-shaped paper piece. 7. Now, we have our basic shirt pattern! But remember, shirts have sleeves too, right? Let's create a pattern for the sleeves. Fold the paper in half and place the shirt's sleeve on it, following the same steps as before. Trace around the sleeve, add extra space, and cut it out. 8. Great job!

Article: Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This sperm whale was one of a number stranded on this beach in the Netherlands Large solar storms, responsible for the northern lights, may have played a role in the strandings of 29 sperm whales in the North Sea early in 2016. A new study says these geomagnetic disruptions may have confused the whales' ability to navigate, diverting them into the shallow waters. Trapped and lost, the whales died on European beaches, attempting to escape. The research has been published recently in the International Journal of Astrobiology. Mysterious losses Researchers have been puzzled by the losses as autopsies showed that the animals were mainly well fed, young and disease-free. The 29 strandings generated a great deal of public interest and a large number of theories among scientists. These ranged from poisoning, to climatic changes driving prey into the North Sea which the large cetaceans followed to their doom. Sperm whales live in deep, warm-to-temperate waters all around the world. Many groups live around the Azores in the eastern Atlantic. When they are between 10 and 15 years old, young males head north towards the polar region, attracted by the huge quantities of squid found in the colder waters. Image copyright Reuters Image caption Two sperm whales that washed up on a beach near Gibraltar Point in Skegness in January 2016 Their journey sometimes takes them up along the west coasts of the UK and Ireland and into the Norwegian sea. They normally return by the same route. But in less than a month in early 2016, 29 sperm whales were found stranded on the coasts of Germany, the Netherlands, the UK and France. Now a team of researchers say they think they understand what happened to them. The argue that sperm whales navigate using the Earth's geomagnetic field. Rather than being uniform, the field is stronger in some places and weaker in others, and scientists believe that species learn to read these anomalies and use them for navigation in the way that humans read contours on maps. Dr Klaus Vanselow from the University of Kiel, Germany, and his colleagues say that large-scale solar storms may have distorted the magnetic field and caused the whales to lose their way. Triggered by coronal mass ejections from the Sun, these storms contain large amounts of charged particles and radiation. When they hit the Earth's upper atmosphere, they produce the spectacular displays of the polar lights over the Arctic, however the most powerful storms can also damage communications systems and satellites. Scientists already have some evidence that solar storm activity can impact the navigating abilities of birds and bees. Image copyright KLAUS VANSELOW Image caption This map shows the 'magnetic mountain' anomaly off the coast of Norway. The whales should have followed the white arrow but the authors argue that the solar storms made the mountains invisible and the whales instead followed the red arrow to the North Sea Dr Vanselow and his colleagues studied the connection between whale strandings and two major solar storms that took place at the very end of December in 2015. These produced huge displays of the Aurora Borealis that were seen in many parts of Scotland and elsewhere. Looking specifically at the region around Shetland, the scientists found that these solar events would have caused short-term shifts in the magnetic field of up to 460km, in the area between the islands and Norway. This could have caused sperm whales in the region to move in the wrong direction. They also believe that sperm whales see a regular magnetic anomaly off the Norwegian coast as a \\"geomagnetic mountain chain\\", a kind of guardrail that prevents them from entering the North Sea. The solar storms may have nullified this effect, rendering the mountain chain invisible and allowing the whales to swim through into the North Sea. \\"Where the polar lights are seen, that's the region with the most geomagnetic disruptions on the Earth's surface,\\" Dr Vanselow told BBC News. \\"Sperm whales are very huge animals and swim in the free ocean so if they are disrupted by this affect, they can swim in the wrong direction for days and then correct it. \\"But in the area between Scotland and Norway, if the whales swim in the wrong direction for one or two days, then it is too late for them to go back, they are trapped.\\" Dr Vanselow believes that his theory makes sense with the timeline of the discovery of the stranded whales up to six weeks after the storms. He believes that because young males grow up around the Azores, an area that sees minimal impacts from solar storms, the creatures have little experience of the abrupt and powerful events that affect the poles. Dr Vanselow's research is a theory that is very difficult, if not impossible, to prove. However, other scientists say it is plausible. Image copyright Getty Images Image caption This whale was beached at Hunstanton and was one of the last to die in the stranding event in early 2016 \\"It would be difficult to say that 'yes this was the cause', we would be cautious in saying that,\\" said Abbo Van Neer from the University of Hannover who carried out the autopsies on the 16 whales that stranded in Germany. \\"But it is a valid hypothesis and a potential reason for the stranding.\\" Nasa has also been investigating the question of whether solar storms can affect a whole range of cetaceans around the world. A team of researchers is shortly to publish a research paper on the connection between strandings in Cape Cod and geomagnetic storms. They say the Venselow paper is \\"well founded\\". \\"It is one potential mechanism for having animals confused, I think it's a credible theory,\\" Dr Antti Pulkkinen, who is leading the Nasa project, told BBC News. \\"But does their paper prove that is the case? I don't think so.\\" \\"Having looked at this problem from a data analysis point of view, it is not a single factor that contributes to this. \\"Things need to line up from multiple different perspectives for these events to take place.\\" Follow Matt on Twitter and on Facebook. ||||| Alerstam , T.

As Gizmodo reported at the time, the whales entered the sea’s shallow waters, where their internal sonar-like systems stopped working, causing them to become stranded and die. But scientists didn’t know why the whales entered these dangerous shallow waters in the first place. A new team has come up with a cosmic hypothesis for the mysterious beachings: Perhaps the whales got stranded after trying to navigate using the Earth’s geomagnetic field during a solar storm. The Sun could have broken the whales’ GPS. Advertisement The idea is that if you have a map and a navigation system in your car, they might glitch and send you driving the wrong way, study author Klaus Henrich Vanselow from the University of Kiel in Germany told Gizmodo. “I think it’s the same for whales. They do not realize that the Sun is changing the geomagnetic environment for a short time.” Mass sperm whale strandings have been recorded since the Middle Ages, but Vanselow was specifically interested in one that occurred in the winter of 2016, when 29 male sperm whales washed ashore in Germany, Britain, France and The Netherlands. Autopsies revealed that the whales were all healthy aside from some debris in nine of their bellies, not enough to kill them. Vanselow realized that many animals, including cetaceans, navigate via the Earth’s magnetic field (he has studied the effect of magnetic anomalies on whale behavior in the past). The team collected data on the magnetic field’s strength and the angles it made with the Earth, and noticed that just before the strandings began, some measuring stations recorded magnetic field changes from solar storms, flares of particles blasting off of the Sun and streaming at Earth. He and his co-authors published their findings in the International Journal of Astrobiology last month. Advertisement The timing of a strong solar storm prior to the whale beachings led the researchers to a hypothesis. While female sperm whales remain closer to the equator to raise their calves, males swim north to feed. Perhaps, then, the males adapt to a quieter magnetic field in those more equatorial waters, making them susceptible to random and large magnetic field fluctuations from solar storms they face further north. As the BBC notes, this paper merely offers a plausible explanation and a hypothesis about a single event that would be difficult to prove. There are plenty of other factors to take into account, such as increased whale populations due to decreased whaling pressure, earthquakes, boats and oil development. “It would be difficult to say that ‘yes this was the cause’, we would be cautious in saying that,” Abbo Van Neer from the University of Hannover, who performed some of the whale autopsies, told the BBC. “But it is a valid hypothesis and a potential reason for the stranding.” I have reached out to other researchers for further comment. So, next time you hear about an incredibly powerful aurora borealis, keep your eyes open. You might spot some lost whales. Advertisement [International Journal of Astrobiology via BBC] ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A large solar storm may have been the cause of 29 sperm whales getting stranded in the North Sea in early 2016, according to a recent study published in the International Journal of Astrobiology. The study suggests that these large movements of electrical charge from the solar storms potentially disrupted the Earth's geomagnetic field, which sperm whales rely on for navigation. The unexpected change in the field strength may have thrown off the animals' navigational abilities, leading them into dangerously shallow waters and eventually causing them to be stranded on multiple European beaches. Whales like these navigators are thought to interpret anomalies in the Earth's magnetic field to navigate similar to how humans use contour lines on maps. Large solar storms have the potential to alter the Earth's magnetic field strength, which can confuse whales and potentially lead them into perilous waters. Large-scale geomagnetic disruptions, due to solar storms, have been known to cause issues with human telecommunications and satellites and have even shown to impact the navigating abilities of birds and bees. The researchers analyzed two significant solar storms at the end of December 2015, focusing on the region around the Shetland islands, a location where many young male sperm whales are known to pass by during their journey northward. The team identified these solar events as they would have caused the temporary magnetic field shifts of up to 460km, enough to disorient any whales in the region. Yet, this theory presents a Catch-22. It is difficult, if not impossible, to prove due to its cosmic and large-scale nature. Nevertheless, other scientists agree that it is logically plausible and potentially a contributing factor to the stranding. Additional research is required to fully validate this theory; however, it has sparked interest and taken us a step closer to understanding the perennial mystery surrounding whale strandings. The main takeaway from this study adds another layer of complexity to our understanding of the interconnection between solar activity, the Earth's geomagnetic field, and the behaviors of terrestrial and marine lifeforms. It illustrates how our planet and its numerous life forms are all bound together by invisible forces within the cosmos. As we continue to study and understand these complex interactions, we will inevitably unlock fundamental secrets about our world, further enriching our respect and admiration for planet Earth and its diverse life forms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: BEIJING, Oct. 13 (Xinhuanet) -- A recent sudden temperature drop in most areas of China has set off fears of a possible return of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and the country has mobilized to prepare for another outbreak. North China's Tianjin Port resumed a temperature reporting system on Sunday. Any passengers through the port with a temperature above 38 degrees Celsius would be provided medical observation and reported to relevant authorities. Zhong Nanshan, a well-known anti-SARS scientist during the last outbreak, said it was unlikely the SARS virus would die out naturally and it would definitely come back, but predicted no widespread epidemic outbreak and the epidemic would not cause serious damage again. Caught unprepared this spring, Chinese authorities have learned to act quickly before the epidemic can take a hold. Chinese Vice-Premier Wu Yi Thursday urged strictly implementing the daily SARS epidemic reporting system and warned that people delaying reporting or hiding the true situation would be severely punished. In Beijing, the disease control center in Dongcheng District has recovered a 24 hour schedule for possible epidemic breakout. Every afternoon before 3:00 o'clock, the center receives SARS reports from every hospital in the district and then reports to the Beijing municipal disease control center and health bureau. In Beijing Xiehe Hospital, plans are ready for fever patients to receive treatment in a special section. Doctors in that ward, wearing protective clothing, will observe patients for any possible respiratory diseases. Patients with high fever and symptoms of respiratory diseases are required to be observed for one or two weeks. North China's Shanxi Province and Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the two other hardest-hit areas in the last SARS crisis, have both set up an emergency response mechanism and mobilized all concerned departments.

Ireland is the second-largest island of the British Isles, the third-largest in Europe, and the twentieth-largest on Earth. - The British Isles are a group of islands off the north-western coast of continental Europe that consist of the islands of Great Britain, Ireland and over six thousand smaller isles. Situated in the North Atlantic, the islands have a total area of approximately 315,159 km, and a combined population of just under 70 million. Two sovereign states are located on the islands: Ireland (which covers roughly five-sixths of the island with the same name) and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The British Isles also include three Crown Dependencies: the Isle of Man and, by tradition, the Bailiwick of Jersey and the Bailiwick of Guernsey in the Channel Islands, although the latter are not physically a part of the archipelago. - The Irish Sea (, , , Ulster-Scots: \\"Airish Sea\\"), separates the islands of Ireland and Great Britain. It is connected to the Celtic Sea in the south by St George's Channel, and to the Inner Seas off the West Coast of Scotland in the north by the North Channel. Anglesey is the largest island within the Irish Sea, followed by the Isle of Man. The sea is occasionally, but rarely, referred to as the Manx Sea. - Europe is a continent that comprises the westernmost part of Eurasia. Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - An island or isle is any piece of sub-continental land that is surrounded by water. Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands is called an archipelago, e.g. the Philippines.

I was working a shift at a chain cafe one afternoon in England, it was during the lunch rush, so we had a back up of customers lined up to the exit. See the problem with the chain is that all of our customers mostly range from midlife crisis to half-a-foot in the grave, so once a customer lines up, they don’t leave and they extend the queue. Plus this is a chain cafe so I've got a manager who's constantly on my back to speed up because someone is on her back to drive numbers up: this results in the line putting stress on my air-hostess smile, but they don't call it work for nothing. Now I'm not the only one stressed, a customer lines up during lunch, they're hungry and wish that Euclidean laws would suspend themselves so that they did not have to deal with the fact that I can't deal with a customer at the speed of light. Well one eldritch horror declares that my coffee took too long and does her rendition of the 1933 Hitler speech to the rest of the customers with an addendum that she will take her business elsewhere. Now my chain are pretty big in England, so if a customer wants to slap me around with a ‘customer is always right’ the script dictates that I do everything in my power to make sure they come back, and Cthulu knows this, well: I'm stressed, I don't like her face and she's given me an opportunity for me to give her the polite ‘fuck off'.

Given the question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Part 1[edit] The film begins in the Seattle, Washington area with increasingly severe earthquake activity. A quake of magnitude 7.9 is measured at the Earthquake centre, where Dr. Samantha Hill takes command, displacing Dr. Jordan Fisher. U.S. President Paul Hollister and FEMA Director Roy Nolan are informed about the situation. A magnitude 8.4 earthquake opens a crack which engulfs a train east of Redding, California. As a result, Governor Carla Williams, who had just seen her daughter and ex-husband off on a camping trip, agrees to help the Governor of Washington. Amanda Williams and her father Clark Williams arrive at a town named Browning, where everything is covered in a thick red haze. They discover a car with a dead family inside, and are nearly trapped in quicksand. Roy Nolan constructs a task force of the best geologists and seismologists, including Dr. Fisher and Dr. Hill. Dr. Hill mentions her Hidden Fault theory, and is eventually given permission to prove it. She and Dr. Fisher visit a lake, where they see some animals that died from carbon monoxide poisoning, and are almost poisoned themselves. Back at the Task Force Center, Dr. Hill predicts that the next quake will be near San Francisco, California. It is deemed too risky to evacuate the entirety of San Francisco, which is eventually destroyed by a 9.2 magnitude earthquake. After that Dr. Hill predicts the next quake will happen at the San Andreas fault, which would wipe out the West Coast in its present shape killing 50 million people on the way. Dr. Hill hypothesizes that they could \\"weld\\" the fault shut by letting it experience immense heat, which could only be created with nuclear bombs.

What is the title of this article: Boston has a continental climate with some maritime influence, and using the −3 °C (27 °F) coldest month (January) isotherm, the city lies within the transition zone from a humid subtropical climate (Köppen Cfa) to a humid continental climate (Köppen Dfa), although the suburbs north and west of the city are significantly colder in winter and solidly fall under the latter categorization; the city lies at the transition between USDA plant hardiness zones 6b (most of the city) and 7a (Downtown, South Boston, and East Boston neighborhoods). Summers are typically warm to hot, rainy, and humid, while winters oscillate between periods of cold rain and snow, with cold temperatures. Spring and fall are usually mild, with varying conditions dependent on wind direction and jet stream positioning. Prevailing wind patterns that blow offshore minimize the influence of the Atlantic Ocean. The hottest month is July, with a mean temperature of 73.4 °F (23.0 °C). The coldest month is January, with a mean of 29.0 °F (−1.7 °C). Periods exceeding 90 °F (32 °C) in summer and below freezing in winter are not uncommon but rarely extended, with about 13 and 25 days per year seeing each, respectively. The most recent sub-0 °F (−18 °C) reading occurring on February 14, 2016 when the temperature dipped down to −9 °F (−23 °C), the coldest reading since 1957. In addition, several decades may pass between 100 °F (38 °C) readings, with the most recent such occurrence on July 22, 2011 when the temperature reached 103 °F (39 °C). The city's average window for freezing temperatures is November 9 through April 5.[c] Official temperature records have ranged from −18 °F (−28 °C) on February 9, 1934, up to 104 °F (40 °C) on July 4, 1911; the record cold daily maximum is 2 °F (−17 °C) on December 30, 1917, while, conversely, the record warm daily minimum is 83 °F (28 °C) on August 2, 1975.

Summarize this article: Thomas de Maiziere said refugees could \\"not choose\\" their host countries and called on other EU states to do more. Trains between Germany and Austria have been suspended for 12 hours. Germany's vice-chancellor has said the country is \\"at the limit of its capabilities\\" as more than 13,000 migrants arrived in Munich on Saturday. Germany expects 800,000 migrants to arrive this year. \\"The aim of these measures is to limit the current inflows to Germany and to return to orderly procedures when people enter the country,\\" Mr de Maiziere told a news conference. He gave no details. The move goes against the principle of the Schengen zone, which allows free movement between many European countries. However, the agreement does allow for temporary suspensions. Germany's rail service Deutsche Bahn said train services with Austria would be stopped until 03:00GMT on Monday. Politically this is a shrewd move by Thomas de Maiziere. His announcement comes just a day before he travels to Brussels to meet other EU interior ministers to discuss the migrant crisis. The measure will help him put pressure on other European countries to do their bit. It highlights just how much Germany is struggling to cope. The move could also serve as a useful threat; after all, Mr de Maiziere said Germany was controlling the border with Austria \\"first\\", the implication being more could follow. The possibility that Germany might suddenly decide to control its other borders could well help jolt EU partners into action. For migrants, the announcement means Germany is not pursuing an open-door policy. After weeks of confusion, Berlin is now sending out the clear message that the Dublin Regulation does still hold, meaning that people have to apply for asylum in the first EU country they arrive in. After that, if Berlin gets its way, they will then be sent elsewhere in Europe according to a strict quota system. Lyse Doucet: Where does this crisis end? Caring for solo child refugees Crisis explained in graphics What next for Germany's asylum seekers? Many migrants have been refusing to register in countries such as Greece or Hungary, fearing it will stop them being granted asylum in Germany or other EU states. The city of Munich, in the German state of Bavaria, has taken the brunt of arrivals over the weekend. Bavarian Premier Horst Seehofer said the controls sent an \\"important signal\\". Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who has taken a tough line on the migrant crisis, told Germany's Bild newspaper he welcomed the new controls, saying they were \\"necessary to protect German and European values\\". On Sunday, the Czech Republic also said it would boost border controls with Austria. Europe as a whole is struggling to deal with an enormous influx of people, mostly from Syria but also Afghanistan, Eritrea and other countries, fleeing violence and poverty. On Sunday, Greek coastguards said at least 34 people, including 11 children, drowned when a boat carrying about 100 migrants capsized off the island of Farmakonisi in the southern Aegean Sea. The BBC's Lyse Doucet in Greece says it is the largest loss of life in a single incident in the Aegean since the crisis began. Earlier on Sunday, Germany's Vice-Chancellor Sigmar Gabriel, who is also economy minister, warned the country was being stretched to its limits by the new arrivals. \\"It is not just a question of the number of migrants, but also the speed at which they are arriving that makes the situation so difficult to handle,\\" he told the Tagesspiegel newspaper. Mr Gabriel also called on European countries, Gulf states and the US to give billions of euros towards schools, accommodation and food in refugee camps in the Middle East. A steady stream of migrants is travelling from Greece, through Macedonia, Serbia and Hungary, to Austria and Germany. Hungary is aiming to complete a four-metre-high (13ft) fence along the border with Serbia by 15 September, when tougher measures, including arresting illegal immigrants, come into force. The European Commission announced plans last week for mandatory quotas to share out 120,000 additional asylum seekers among 25 member countries. Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Romania are opposed to this.","completion":"Germany announced last week that they are re-imposing border controls along its border with Austria, to help stem the flow of migrants.

Movie title: 300: Battle of Artemisia Movie plot: Note: this film is actually a prequel as well as a sequel to the original '300' film (with the events happening before, concurrently, and after the events of the previous film).In the opening scene, Queen Gorgo (Lena Headey) narrates about King Darius (Igal Naor) leading his army of Persians into Greece in the Battle of Marathon in 490 BC during the first Persian invasion of Greece. The Athenian general Themistocles (Sullivan Stapleton) led his own army against them at the shores. The Greeks brutally and effortlessly take down the invading Persians one by one, paving the way for Themistocles to take aim at Darius, who is watching the massacre of his men from his ship offshore. Themistocles raises a bow and arrow, ready to commit the act that would make him known as a legend. He releases the bow just in time for Darius's son, Xerxes (Rodrigo Santoro) to watch. He runs to his father's side but is too late to save him as the arrow pierces him. Xerxes holds his father in his arms and locks eyes with Themistocles. The latter walks away, with Gorgo stating that he knew in his heart that he made a mistake not to kill Xerxes when he had the chance.Darius is returned to his kingdom to lie in his deathbed. He and Xerxes are joined by Artemisia (Eva Green), Darius's commanding naval officer, said to be as vicious as she is beautiful. She holds Darius's hand. In his dying moments, he tells Xerxes that it is best to leave the Greeks alone, for only the gods can defeat them. Artemisia pulls the arrow out of his chest to end his suffering. For a week, Xerxes sits and mourns the death of his father. On the eighth day, Artemisia holds Xerxes and tells him that his father's last words were not a warning, but a challenge. If only the gods can defeat the Greeks, then, she tells him, he is to become the god king.Artemisia has Xerxes sent into the desert wearing chains until he walks into a cave with a pool of bright gold liquid.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"300: Battle of Artemisia,\\" which is a prequel and sequel to the original \\"300\\" film, the character Themistocles is an Athenian general who plays a significant role in the story. He is known for leading the Athenians against the Persian army during the Battle of Marathon. Throughout the film, Themistocles faces several challenges and dangers, particularly as he battles against the forces of Xerxes and Artemisia. However, there isn't a specific character who rescues Themistocles directly in this plot. He is a capable and skilled general and, for the most part, manages to navigate the challenges he faces with his own intelligence, skill, and leadership abilities. Instead, the concept of rescue and assistance among the characters can be seen as more collective in nature – the Greeks, under the guidance of leaders such as Themistocles and Queen Gorgo, work together to overcome the challenges posed by the powerful Persian army and their vengeful leaders. United in their common goal, they eventually manage to stand firm against the Persian threat and maintain their homeland's freedom. In deciding whether or not to invest in this film proposal, consider the following factors: 1. The original \\"300\\" film was well-received by audiences, and this prequel/sequel could potentially continue that success by offering familiar characters and themes in a new story. 2. The movie's plot combines aspects of ancient Greek history and mythology with exciting action sequences and intense battles, which may appeal to a broad range of viewers. 3. The central character, Themistocles, is a compelling figure who showcases bravery, intelligence, and strategic prowess throughout the film, potentially making the movie appealing to fans of strong heroes and thrilling battle scenes. 4. As a prequel and sequel, the film offers an opportunity to further explore the world and characters of the original movie, potentially drawing in audiences who enjoyed the first film and are interested in learning more about its universe. 5. The film has potential for stunning visual effects and action-oriented direction, which can be major selling points for fans of the action and epic genres. Overall, while Themistocles isn't rescued by a specific individual in \\"300: Battle of Artemisia,\\" he remains an engaging and dynamic character in a plot that combines elements of history and action-oriented storytelling. If you believe that this combination of factors would make the film a successful and profitable investment, it may be worth considering supporting the project."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which solution has higher pH value, soution A or solution B? Hint: If a solution has a higher concentration of hydronium ions than pure water, it has a pH lower than 7. A solution with a pH lower than 7 is called an acid . As the hydronium ion concentration increases, the pH value decreases. Therefore, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value is. Did you ever taste vinegar? Like other acids, it tastes sour. Stronger acids can be harmful to organisms. For example, stomach acid would eat through the stomach if it were not lined with a layer of mucus. Strong acids can also damage materials, even hard materials such as glass. A:","completion":"Based on the information provided in the paragraph, we can deduce that solution A is an acid since Mike selected it while studying the properties of acids. It is also mentioned that a solution with a pH lower than 7 is an acid, and the paragraph further explains that as the concentration of hydronium ions increases, the pH value decreases. In other words, the more acidic a solution is, the lower its pH value. Now, let's consider solution B. Mike chose solution B as a comparison to solution A, specifically selecting a solution that is not an acid. As a non-acidic solution, its pH value must be either equal to or greater than 7, because solutions with a pH greater than 7 are classified as basic or alkaline, while solutions with a pH of exactly 7 are considered neutral. Comparing the pH values of the two solutions, it is clear that solution B will have a higher pH value than solution A. This is because solution A is an acid characterized by a pH value lower than 7, while solution B is not an acid leading to a pH value that is equal to or greater than 7."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lancaster's career designing for the theatre began and ended with Gilbert and Sullivan. His first costumes and scenery were for the Sadler's Wells Ballet's Pineapple Poll (1951), John Cranko's ballet with a story based on a Gilbert poem and music by Sullivan. His last were for the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company's revival of The Sorcerer (1973). In between, he designed more productions for the Royal Ballet, as well as for Glyndebourne Festival Opera, the Old Vic and the West End. It was a matter of mild regret to him that of the twenty plays, operas and ballets that he designed between the two, only one was for a thoroughly serious piece, Britten's Peter Grimes, for the Bulgarian National Opera in Sofia in 1964.Only two of Lancaster's theatre designs have remained in use in 21st-century productions, both by the Royal Ballet: Pineapple Poll and La fille mal gardée. In an article on the latter in 2016, Danielle Buckley wrote, \\"Lancaster's surrealist and stylized designs for Fille amplify the story's pantomime quality, and the exaggerated burlesque of its comedy – but the backdrops of fields that roll into the distance, bundles of hay, dreamy skies and village cottages provide the idealized, pastoral context that the story needs\\". Buckley adds that Lancaster’s designs have been criticised for locating the ballet in no particular time or place – \\"except, that is, of a 1960s London view of idyllic country life\\".Lancaster's stated view was that stage sets and costumes should reflect reality, but \\"through a lens, magnifying and slightly over-emphasising everything which it reflects\\".

Read the following paragraph and extract the answer for the question: What paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp? The third Chinook carried half of the enhanced A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but had been unable to determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had to wait in the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.The returning Chinook, carrying the remainder of the A Company group including second-in-command (2IC) Captain Danny Matthews, came under fire from a heavy machine gun in Magbeni, which was promptly strafed by one of the 657 Squadron Lynx helicopters until it ceased firing. The soldiers in Matthews' helicopter exited and joined the first half of the company group on the ground. As the company group moved forward, an explosion—possibly a mortar fired by the British fire support group—injured seven men, including company commander Major Matthew Lowe, one of the platoon commanders, a signaller, and two of Lowe's headquarters staff. Another signaller radioed in a casualty report, and one of the Chinooks en route to Gberi Bana to extract the Royal Irish (who had just been freed by the SAS) landed on the track through the village. The casualties were loaded onto the helicopter, which then picked up the Royal Irish and flew to RFA Sir Percivale where all 13 men were assessed by medics.The operation continued under the leadership of Matthews, the company 2IC, who had taken command almost immediately after the company commander was wounded.

They help us determine what is right or wrong and offer a framework for evaluating our actions and their consequences, both for ourselves and for others. Ethics can be shaped by a multitude of factors, including cultural, religious, and personal beliefs, and can vary from person to person. Nevertheless, society and professional fields often establish shared ethical standards and guidelines that individuals are expected to abide by to ensure harmony, fairness, and respect for the rights and well-being of others. Examples of ethics can be found in various aspects of life, such as personal relationships, workplace etiquette, and societal norms. These examples often align with concepts like honesty, integrity, empathy, and responsibility. Personal relationships: 1. Being truthful to a friend, even if the truth may be unpleasant or difficult to hear. 2. Remaining loyal and supportive during tough times. 3. Respecting the boundaries and privacy of others. 4. Apologizing and seeking to make amends after causing harm to others. Workplace etiquette: 1. Giving credit where credit is due, instead of claiming someone else’s work as your own. 2. Treating all colleagues fairly, regardless of their race, gender, or social background. 3. Ensuring a safe and non-hostile work environment for all employees. 4. Protecting the privacy and confidentiality of sensitive information. Societal norms: 1. Taking care of the environment by recycling and conserving natural resources. 2.

Q: Q: Salts are important in maintaining what balance of the blood? A: A:","completion":"Salts are crucial in maintaining the balance of the blood, particularly with regard to electrolytes. Electrolytes are minerals that break down into small, electrically charged particles called ions when dissolved in water. They are essential for several vital functions within the body, including maintaining proper fluid balance, ensuring normal muscle and nerve functions, and regulating acid-base balance (pH) in the blood. The main electrolytes found in blood are sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, chloride, bicarbonate, and phosphate. The proper balance of these electrolytes is critical for the body to function properly. For example, sodium and potassium help to maintain fluid balance within and around cells, while calcium and magnesium contribute to muscle contractions and nerve signaling. The balance of these electrolytes in the blood is maintained through several mechanisms, including: 1. Kidneys: The kidneys filter and regulate the levels of various electrolytes in the blood by either excreting excess amounts in urine or reabsorbing them as necessary. This helps to maintain a stable concentration of electrolytes in the bloodstream. 2. Hormones: Certain hormones, such as aldosterone and antidiuretic hormone (ADH), help regulate electrolyte levels in the blood by signaling the kidneys to retain or excrete specific electrolytes. 3. Diet: Consuming a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of electrolyte-rich foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and dairy products, is essential for maintaining an appropriate electrolyte balance in the blood. In summary, salts are critical in maintaining the proper balance of electrolytes in the blood, which in turn ensures normal fluid balance, muscle and nerve function, and acid-base regulation within the body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Karadzic guilty of Bosnia genocide, jailed for 40 years THE HAGUE, March 24 (Reuters) - Former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic was sentenced to 40 years in jail by U.N judges who found him guilty of genocide for the 1995 Srebrenica massacre and of nine other war crimes charges. Karadzic, 70, the most senior political figure to be convicted by the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia in The Hague, was found guilty of 10 out of 11 war charges. He was acquitted of a second count of genocide in various towns across Bosnia during the war of the 1990s. SEE ALSO: Surviving Paris attacks suspect wants to return to 'explain himself': Lawyer The judges said Karadzic was criminally responsible for the siege of Sarajevo and had committed crimes against humanity in Bosnian towns. They said he had intended to eliminate the Bosnian Muslim males in the town of Srebrenica, where 8,000 Muslims died in Europe's worst war crime since World War Two. Presiding judge O-Gon Kwon said the three-year Sarajevo siege, during which the city was shelled and sniped at by besieging Bosnian Serb forces, could not have happened without Karadzic's support. His sentence will be reduced by slightly more than 7 years for time already spent in detention. It will be served in an as yet undetermined state prison. He is expected to appeal, a process that could take several more years. As the judges described the siege of Sarajevo, Karadzic looked pained and his face tightened into a grimace. Victims' families in the courtroom, some of then elderly, listened intently when the genocide at Srebrenica was discussed. One wiped away tears as the judge described men and boys being separated from their families. After that, Karadzic stared ahead vacantly. When he was ordered to stand for sentencing, he listened with eyes mostly downcast. After the sentence was read and judges departed, he sat back heavily in his chair. After the hearing was closed, several victims' families embraced before quietly leaving the courtroom. Karadzic was arrested in 2008 after 11 years on the run, following a war in which 100,000 people were killed as rival armies carved Bosnia up along ethnic lines that largely survive today. He headed the self-styled Bosnian Serb Republic and was Supreme Commander of its armed forces. He said in an interview ahead of the verdict that he had worked to uphold peace and deserved praise, not punishment. \\"My permanent fight to preserve the peace, prevent the war and decrease the sufferings of everyone regardless of religion were an exemplary effort deserving respect rather than persecution,\\" he told news portal Balkan Insight. Serbian Prime Minister Aleksandar Vucic said he would stand by the Serbs of Bosnia. \\"We will stand by our people and we will protect their existence and their right to have their own state,\\" he said. ICTY prosecutor Serge Brammertz said the world had decided that victims in the former Yugoslavia deserved justice. \\"For two decades now, those victims have put their trust in us to deliver it. Thousands came here to tell their stories and courageously confront their tormentors. Today, with this conviction, that trust has been honored. Justice has been done.\\" The only more senior official to face justice before the Tribunal was the late Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, who died in custody a decade ago before a verdict was reached. Ratko Mladic, the general who commanded Bosnian Serb forces, was the last suspect to be detained over the Srebrenica slaughter and is also in a U.N. cell awaiting judgment. Munira Subasic, whose son was among the victims of Srebrenica, said the \\"verdict is very important to show new generations, especially those in Serbia who have been poisoned with hatred already, what really happened in Bosnia.\\" The Srebrenica massacre and the years-long Serb siege of Sarajevo were events that turned world opinion against the Serbs and prompted NATO air strikes that helped bring the war to an end. Karadzic defended himself through his 497-day trial and called 248 witnesses, poring over many of the millions of pages of evidence with the help of a court-appointed legal adviser. Rejecting the charges against him, Karadzic sought to portray himself as the Serbs' champion, blaming some of the sieges and shelling on Bosnian Muslims themselves. He says soldiers and civilians who committed crimes during the war acted individually. Opponents of the ICTY say its prosecutors have disproportionately targeted Serbs as 94 of 161 suspects charged were from the Serbian side, while 29 were Croat and nine Bosnian Muslim. Prosecutors have been criticized for not bringing charges against two other leaders of that era who have since died - Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic. \\"If you had got prosecutions of those three (including Milosevic) then you'd get a really good picture of the way the violence was produced but we're not getting it,\\" said Eric Gordy, an expert on the court at University College London. Many Serbs, both in Bosnia and Serbia, regard the court as a pro-Western instrument, say Karadzic is innocent and believe his conviction would be an injustice for all Serbs. Their belief is strengthened by the fact that the sentencing coincides with the anniversary of the 1999 NATO bombing of Serbia that led to independence for the ethnic Albania-dominated province of Kosovo. Prosecutor Brammertz worries that its work, which is winding down, has done little to heal the war's deep wounds. \\"I'm not convinced everyone has really understood the wrongdoings from the past,\\" he said.

Q: ROLAND HELD HIS BODY STIFF AS HE FACED THE CATHAR FORTRESS and watched the tall wooden doors swing open. He saw now that the fire of that final night's battle, now fifteen days past, had left no structure standing but the stone keep. Inside the limestone walls stood forlorn, crude shelters made of tent cloths spread over blackened beams. Cries of farewell and loud wailing came from the battlements above and from the open gateway, as the condemned emerged from the fortress, a long line of men and women in black. Roland's heartbeat broke its rhythm. During the fifteen days of grace granted under the terms of surrender, he had waited in camp with the other crusaders. Now that Diane and Perrin were safely off on the road to Paris, he felt impelled to be with the Cathars in their final moments, to bear witness. He had volunteered, despite his dread, to help escort the prisoners to their execution. Those Cathars who joined the Catholic religion would now be allowed to leave in peace, though they would be forced to give everything they owned to the Church and wear the yellow crosses for the rest of their lives. But those who clung to their faith would die. As the Cathars emerged, a man-at-arms directed each to stop at a table beside the doorway, where two Dominican friars sat with parchment scrolls. The friars recorded the name of each person about to die. This meticulous record-keeping, Roland thought, was one source of the Inquisition's power. At the head of the procession was the Cathar bishop. Bertran d'en Marti's head glowed with the red-gold rays of the low afternoon sun striking his white hair, as if it were already enveloped in flames. \\"Form around them,\\" called the leader of Roland's party. Roland reluctantly stepped forward with the other crusaders. His longsword and dagger swung heavy at his waist. He wore them only because, as a knight, he was expected to. He had left his helmet and mail shirt back in his tent. According to the above context, answer the following question. Roland was a: Select from: (1). Prisoner (2). not enough information (3).

Trivia question: Which long-running British TV series featured the characters Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms, Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Grainger and Mr. Lucas? And the answer is?","completion":"The answer to the trivia question is the long-running British TV series \\"Are You Being Served?\\" which featured the characters Captain Peacock, Mrs. Slocombe, Mr. Humphries, Miss Brahms, Mr. Rumbold, Mr. Grainger, and Mr. Lucas. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" was a British sitcom set in the fictional Grace Brothers Department Store. It was created by Jeremy Lloyd and David Croft, who were also known for the popular show \\"Dad's Army.\\" Produced by the BBC, the show first aired on September 8, 1972, and ran for ten seasons, ending on April 1, 1985, with a total of 69 episodes. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" was known for its double entendres and innuendos, which earned it both praise and criticism. The show revolved around the staff of the men's and women's clothing departments, with an ensemble of characters who worked together but were often at odds with one another. The key characters played an important role in the show's success and humor: 1. Captain Stephen Peacock (played by Frank Thornton) was the floorwalker at Grace Brothers who oversaw the staff in his department and was often seen as pompous and aloof while trying to enforce order and provide customer service. 2. Mrs. Betty Slocombe (played by Mollie Sugden) was the head of the ladies' department and was known for her bright-colored hair, which changed hues each episode, and her propensity to make shocking references about her \\"pussy\\" (her cat). 3. Mr. Wilberforce Clayborne Humphries (played by John Inman) was the senior sales assistant in the men's department, known for his campy demeanor and the catchphrase, \\"I'm free!\\" He was popular among viewers and appreciated for his wit and humor. 4. Miss Shirley Brahms (played by Wendy Richard) was Mrs. Slocombe's assistant in the ladies' department and was known for her cockney accent and for being street-smart and perceptive about the department store politics. 5. Mr. Cuthbert Rumbold (played by Nicholas Smith) was the store manager who often displayed incompetence and a lack of understanding of the employees' concerns. His large ears and bald head were frequent subjects of ridicule by the staff. 6. Mr. Ernest Grainger (played by Arthur Brough) was the senior salesman in the men's department, known for his grumpy demeanor, love of routine, and commitment to customer service. 7. Mr. Dick Lucas (played by Trevor Bannister) was a junior salesman in the men's department and was known as a charming but lazy character who constantly flirted with Miss Brahms, the ladies' department assistant. \\"Are You Being Served?\\" remains a beloved classic of British TV comedy. Its characters are memorable and well-developed, and the sitcom proved to be influential for many subsequent shows. The series spawned a 1977 film adaptation and a sequel series titled \\"Grace & Favour\\" (or \\"Are You Being Served? Again!\\") which aired from 1992 to 1993."},{"prompt":"Question: Title: Not impressed Review: The whole ballet takes place in a dark blue scenario that does not change throughout the 146 minutes that lasts the ballet...I bought this CD because I could not find the Raymonda's version directed by Mikhail Nikolaevich Baryshnikov with the French ballet in the 1980s.Well, the lack of color in this CD version of Bolshioi Ballet under the direction of Alexander Glazunov was a big disappointment.
