Article: Childhood is a time of fun and games. Many people still remember when they were young, they often played games like hide-and-seek and chess. Playing teaches children how to get along with others, and it also helps to exercise the mind and body. However, children today spent most of their playing time in front of the computer, playing video games. A recent survey found that in the US children between 8 and 12 spent at least 13 hours a week playing video games or \\"gaming\\". Boys of this age spend even more time, almost 16 hours a week. Although some people will say that gaming is helpful, it brings many problems as well. One big problem is that kids who spend most of their time on games might have difficulty communicating with real people. They might have trouble sharing and resolving problems because they do not practice these shills when sitting alone at a computer. Another problem is about health. Game players usually sit for hours without doing any exercise. And they might not eat healthily. As a result, they might be out of shape. Next, game players might have trouble with their lessons. Many of them spend more time playing games than working on their homework. In the end, _ . Finally, it is always possible that the gamers become addicted . Some people play four or five hours a day or even all day. This happened to a 28-year-old Korean man. He spent about 50 hours playing an online game without sleeping or eating well. He died while gaming! This is one example of the dangers of video gaming. It tells us that video gaming, like everything else, should not be done too much.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What did the wild rumors in Europe claim the Mongols had successfully re-captured? , can you please find it? After Arghun's death, he was followed in rapid succession by two brief and fairly ineffective leaders, one of whom only held power for a few months. Stability was restored when Arghun's son Ghazan took power in 1295, though to secure cooperation from other influential Mongols, he made a public conversion to Islam when he took the throne, marking a major turning point in the state religion of the Ilkhanate. Despite being an official Muslim, however, Ghazan remained tolerant of multiple religions, and worked to maintain good relations with his Christian vassal states such as Cilician Armenia and Georgia. In 1299, he made the first of what were to be three attempts to invade Syria. As he launched his new invasion, he also sent letters to the Franks of Cyprus (Henry II, King of Cyprus; and the heads of the military orders), inviting them to come join him in his attack on the Mamluks in Syria. The Mongols successfully took the city of Aleppo, and were there joined by their vassal King Hethum II, whose forces participated in the rest of the offensive. The Mongols soundly defeated the Mamluks in the Battle of Wadi al-Khazandar, on December 23 or 24, 1299. This success in Syria led to wild rumors in Europe that the Mongols had successfully re-captured the Holy Land, and had even conquered the Mamluks in Egypt and were on a mission to conquer Tunisia in northern Africa. But in reality, Jerusalem had been neither taken nor even besieged. All that had been managed were some Mongol raids into Palestine in early 1300. The raids went as far as Gaza, passing through several towns, probably including Jerusalem. But when the Egyptians again advanced from Cairo in May, the Mongols retreated without resistance.In July 1300, the Crusaders launched naval operations to press the advantage.

Write a title for this article: Sunday, August 4th 2002, 2:33AM Today, 8 p.m., ESPN Classic In the calmest of times, Americans pay little attention to intercollegiate wrestling. In the spring of 1970, which was not calm, those watching U.S. college campuses probably weren't handicapping 123- or 167-pound grapplers. Which makes it all the more astonishing that a wrestling match that spring, in the NCAA championships, popped out as one of the most startling sports stories of the century. The word \\"legend\\" suffers from severe overuse, but it fits Gable, and today he remains arguably the best-known legitimate wrestler the country has ever produced. Gable was a machine, as the rerun of the ESPN \\"SportsCentury\\" on his life this night demonstrates. He didn't take up wrestling until he was a teenager, after discarding sports like baseball and swimming because he didn't like breaks in the action. Once he began wrestling, driven in part by the murder of his sister (see related story), he went through Waterloo West High School in Iowa with a 64-0 record. Moving to Iowa State, he won 117 of his first 117 matches. At one point he recorded 25 straight pins. In practice, he would challenge and beat every other wrestler on the Iowa State team, up to the heavyweights. He weighed about 140. His final collegiate match was against Larry Owings of Washington, a sophomore who called on some higher power and took a 7-2 lead. Gable came back to tie him, 8-8. But Owings got a takedown and went on to a 13-11 victory that, as upsets go, ranks right up with Buster Douglas beating Mike Tyson and the Jets beating the Colts. Gable, while shocked, put his head back down and aimed for the 1972 Olympics, where he won a gold medal by finishing six matches without allowing opponents a single point. Not one. He wouldn't even let anyone have an escape. By the mid-'70s he was coaching at Iowa. He proved almost as good at recruiting and teaching as he was at wrestling, probably because he was just as demanding. In 20 years his teams had a 355-21-5 record in dual meets and won 15 national championships. He retired after the 1997 season, when all those years of obsessive training had broken him down so much - more than a dozen knee and back surgeries - that he could no longer get down on the mat to demonstrate holds. His secret? Single-minded devotion, he tells \\"SportsCentury,\\" and that would be hard to argue. He didn't even have the best wrestling technique in the world, his opponents say, but he was a buzzsaw who never wore out. He kept coming and you couldn't stop him. Gable's biggest loss didn't come on wrestling mat The best-known bad thing that happened to Dan Gable was losing his first match ever in the 1970 NCAA Finals. But that wasn't close to the worst thing. Not even a little bit close. The worst thing happened Memorial Day weekend of 1964. Gable, then 15, went away for the weekend on a fishing trip with his parents, Mack and Katie. When they returned home at the end of the weekend, they found Gable's older sister Diane, his only sibling, dead on the living room. She had been sexually assaulted and murdered. She was 19. Traumatic as this would have been under any circumstance, it was compounded because of something Gable now remembers. A 16-year-old neighborhood boy named Tom Kyle, who had recently dropped out of school, had told Dan that he wanted to have sex with Diane and that if she wasn't interested, he might have to hurt her. Dan told his father about this, while they were driving somewhere together. His father stopped the car and started to beat him, suggesting that never saying anything about this conversation made him responsible in part for his sister's murder. It is probably also significant that this wasn't the first time Mack Gable acted on a violent impulse. An investor/real estate salesman, he had been a wrestler himself in high school and he was not reluctant to use corporal punishment on either Dan or Diane while they were growing up. At least once the police were called to the Gable home in Waterloo, Iowa, because Mack Gable seemed to be doling it out a bit too enthusiastically. It didn't help that he also drank too much. Tom Kyle was arrested, tried, convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Diane Gable. Dan Gable imposed his own sentence. He would become the best wrestler in the world, which involved enough sacrifice and discipline to sound a lot like penance. But the real reason he vowed to excel in wrestling, as he explains in \\"Sports Century,\\" is that he was convinced that his parents needed something big enough to keep them together after this awful tragedy. He was it, wrestling was it, and once he started, it snowballed into his life - a life that has been, in a sense, lived for two.

Premise: and so that really cuts into your backyard space and Hypothesis: The dihydrogen really cuts into your backyard space Does the premise entail the hypothesis?","completion":"In order to determine whether the premise entails the hypothesis, we must first clearly understand the meanings and context of both statements. Premise: \\"and so that really cuts into your backyard space and\\" The premise is an incomplete statement that suggests something unspecified is affecting or reducing the available backyard space. Since it is incomplete, the context and the factor causing the reduction in backyard space is unclear. Hypothesis: \\"The dihydrogen really cuts into your backyard space\\" The hypothesis proposes that \\"dihydrogen\\" is the cause of the reduction in backyard space. It's worth noting that \\"dihydrogen\\" usually refers to a molecule of two hydrogen atoms (H2), which is an odorless, colorless, and tasteless gas. Nevertheless, without proper context, it is difficult to understand how dihydrogen gas would directly affect or reduce backyard space. Now, let's analyze if the premise entails the hypothesis: Entailment occurs when the truth of one statement (the premise) guarantees the truth of another statement (the hypothesis). In this particular case, the incomplete nature of the premise makes it impossible to fully assess whether the dihydrogen mentioned in the hypothesis is the factor causing the reduction in backyard space. Moreover, the mention of dihydrogen in the hypothesis adds an element that is not present in the original premise. Entailment typically requires the hypothesis to be based solely on the information provided in the premise without adding any new data. In conclusion, due to the incomplete nature of the premise and the introduction of dihydrogen as a new element in the hypothesis, it is not possible to definitively infer that the premise entails the hypothesis. A more detailed premise that outlines the factor(s) causing the reduction in backyard space would be necessary to establish a stronger connection between the two statements."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Information: - The Swedish Empire refers to the Kingdom of Sweden's territorial control of much of the Baltic region during the 17th and early 18th centuries, a time when Sweden was one of the great European powers. The beginning of the Empire is usually taken as the reign of Gustavus Adolphus, who ascended the throne in 1611, and the end as the loss of territories in 1721 following the Great Northern War. In Swedish history, the period is referred to as \\"stormaktstiden\\", literally meaning \\"the Great Power era\\". - Yakov Karlovich Grot ( Russian : ) ( December 27 ( O.S. December 15 ) 1812 -- June 5 ( O.S. May 24 ) 1893 ) , was a nineteenth - century Russian philologist of German extraction who worked at the University of Helsinki . Grot was a graduate of the Tsarskoye Selo Lyceum . In his lifetime he gained fame for his translations of German and Scandinavian poetry , his work on the theory of Russian orthography , lexicography , and grammar , and his approach to literary editing and criticism , exemplified in a full edition of the works of Derzhavin ( 1864 -- 1883 ) . His Russkoye Pravopisaniye ( 1878 , 1885 ) ( , Russian orthography ) became the standard textbook of Russian spelling and punctuation until superseded by the decrees of 1917 -- 1918 , although his definition of the theoretical foundations remains little changed to this day . Shortly before his death , he assumed the compilation of Academic dictionary of Russian ( 1891 -- 1923 ) , which , although continued by Aleksey Shakhmatov , was never to be completed . He was a member of the Russian Academy of Sciences from 1858 , its chairman from 1884 , and its vice-president from 1889 . He was appointed Russian - language tutor to the future tsars Alexander II and Alexander III. His spelling primers \`\` reduced words to historical hieroglyphs of a kind , mismatched with the living spoken language of most Russians '' ; later linguists like Baudouin de Courtenay and Filipp Fortunatov promoted reforms that would make spelling a better reflection of spoken language . - A university (\\"a whole\\", \\"a corporation\\") is an institution of higher (or tertiary) education and research which grants academic degrees in various subjects. Universities typically provide undergraduate education and postgraduate education. - The University of Helsinki (, , abbreviated UH) is a university located in Helsinki, Finland since 1829, but was founded in the city of Turku (in Swedish \\"Åbo\\") in 1640 as the \\"Royal Academy of Turku\\", at that time part of the Swedish Empire. It is the oldest and largest university in Finland with the widest range of disciplines available. Around 36,500 students are currently enrolled in the degree programs of the university spread across 11 faculties and 11 research institutes. - The Royal Academy of Turku (or \\"Åbo Kungliga Akademi\\", ) was the first university in Finland, and the only Finnish university that was founded when the country still was a part of Sweden. In 1809, after Finland became a Grand Duchy under the suzerainty of the Russian Tzar, it was renamed the \\"Imperial Academy of Turku\\". In 1828, after the Great Fire of Turku, the institution was moved to Helsinki, in line with the relocation of the Grand Duchy's capital. It was finally renamed the University of Helsinki when Finland became a sovereign nation-state in 1917. - Helsinki is the capital and largest city of Finland. It is in the region of Uusimaa, in southern Finland, on the shore of the Gulf of Finland. Helsinki has a population of , an urban population of 1,214,210, and a metropolitan population of over 1.4 million, making it the most populous municipality and urban area in Finland. Helsinki is located some north of Tallinn, Estonia, east of Stockholm, Sweden, and west of Saint Petersburg, Russia. Helsinki has close historical connections with these three cities. - Turku is a city on the southwest coast of Finland at the mouth of the Aura River, in the region of Southwest Finland. Turku, as a town, was settled during the 13th century and founded most likely at the end of the 13th century, making it the oldest city in Finland. It quickly became the most important city in Finland, a status it retained for hundreds of years. After Finland became part of the Russian Empire (1809) and the capital of the Grand Duchy of Finland was moved to Helsinki (1812), Turku continued to be the most populous city in Finland until the end of the 1840s, and it remains a regional capital and an important business and cultural center. - Finland , officially the Republic of Finland, is a sovereign state in Northern Europe. A peninsula with the Gulf of Finland to the south and the Gulf of Bothnia to the west, the country has land borders with Sweden to the northwest, Norway to the north, and Russia to the east. Estonia is south of the country across the Gulf of Finland. Finland is a Nordic country situated in the geographical region of Fennoscandia, which also includes Scandinavia. Finland's population is 5.5 million (2014), staying roughly on the same level over the past two decades. The majority of the population is concentrated in the southern region. In terms of area, it is the eighth largest country in Europe and the most sparsely populated country in the European Union.

Cavalry Sunday is the annual parade of the Combined Cavalry Old Comrades Association which takes place in Hyde Park each year. Retired members of the cavalry regiments march to a service and commemoration around the band stand in the SE corner of Hyde Park and the nearby memorial to the bombing which took place there. The old troopers typically wear bowler hats and march with furled umbrellas. Does this next sentence follow, given the preceding text? cavalry sunday is a bicentennial parade","completion":"In order to determine whether the next sentence follows, I will analyze the information provided in the preceding text and compare it with the claim in the next sentence. Preceding text states: 1. Cavalry Sunday is an annual parade. 2. It is organized by the Combined Cavalry Old Comrades Association. 3. The parade takes place in Hyde Park. 4. Retired members of the cavalry regiments participate. 5. The participants wear bowler hats and march with furled umbrellas. 6. The event includes a service and commemoration. Next sentence claim: Cavalry Sunday is a bicentennial parade. (happens every 200 years) Analysis: - The preceding text states that Cavalry Sunday is an annual parade, meaning it happens every year. - The next sentence states that Cavalry Sunday is a bicentennial parade, which means it happens every 200 years. Conclusion: Based on the information provided in the preceding text and the claim made in the next sentence, the next sentence does not follow given the preceding text. The main contradiction is the frequency of the event, with the preceding text stating it is annual (every year) and the next sentence claiming it is bicentennial (every 200 years)."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Q: Companies, communities, families, clubs, and other clumps of humans all have some inherent social dynamics. At a simple level there are leaders and followers, but in reality the lines are rarely as clear as that. Many leaders, with a common example being some founders, have tremendous vision and imagination, but lack the skills to translate that vision into actionable work. Many followers need structure to their efforts, but are dynamic and creative in the execution. Thus, the social dynamic in organizations needs a little more nuance. This is where traditional management hierarchies break down in companies. You may have your SVPs, then your VPs, then your Senior Directors, then your Directors, and so on, but in reality most successful companies don’t observe those hierarchies stringently. In many organizations a junior-level employee who has been there for a while can have as much influence and value, if not more, than a brand new SVP. As such, the dream is that we build organizations with crisp reporting lines but in which all employees feel they have the ability to bring their creativity and ideas to logically influence the scope, work, and culture of the organization. Sadly, this is where many organizations run into trouble. It seems to be the same ‘ol story time after time: as the organization grows, the divide between the senior leadership and the folks on the ground widens. Water cooler conversations and bar-side grumblings fuel the fire and resentment, frustrations, and resume-editing often sets in. So much of this is avoidable though. Of course, there will always be frustration in any organization: this is part and parcel of people working together. Nothing will be perfect, and it shouldn’t be…frustration and conflict can often lead to organizations re-pivoting and taking a new approach. I believe though, that there are a lot of relatively simple things we can do to make organizations feel more engaging. Question: Employees feel frustration as: === The answer to the above question is A:","completion":"Employees feel frustration in organizations primarily due to factors such as a lack of clear communication, inadequate leadership, limited opportunities for growth and development, inefficient decision-making processes, restricted employee autonomy and creativity, a misalignment of personal and company values, and the development of a toxic or uncollaborative working environment. These factors can lead to resentment, frustrations, and potentially job dissatisfaction, ultimately causing employees to disengage and reconsider their career options. 1. Lack of clear communication: In many organizations, information tends to get lost or distorted as it travels up and down the hierarchical structure, creating confusion and misinterpretation. When employees do not receive adequate information or are left in the dark, they may feel undervalued and disconnected from the company's mission and goals. 2. Inadequate leadership: Leadership plays a pivotal role in creating a supportive, motivating, and inclusive atmosphere in any organization. However, when leaders fail to provide the necessary direction and support, employees may struggle to find a sense of purpose or belonging, leading to frustration and disengagement. 3. Limited opportunities for growth and development: A lack of career development opportunities, mentorship, or training can make employees feel stagnant, frustrated, and disengaged. Without an avenue for growth, employees may feel unfulfilled in their roles and begin to seek other opportunities. 4. Inefficient decision-making processes: Bureaucratic processes, red tape, and slow decision-making can lead to employees feeling frustrated and disempowered. If employees feel that they have little to no influence over the direction and execution of their tasks, they are more likely to experience frustration and burnout. 5. Restricted employee autonomy and creativity: When employees are discouraged from taking initiative and expressing their creativity, they may feel stifled and undervalued. Such situations can create a hostile environment where employees feel invisible and disconnected from their work. 6. Misalignment of personal and company values: When employees perceive a disconnect between their own values and those espoused by the organization, they may experience cognitive dissonance, unease, and dissatisfaction in their roles. This misalignment can cause employees to feel frustrated and disenchanted with the company and its objectives. 7. Toxic or uncollaborative working environment: A workplace fraught with toxicity, competition, or blame culture can contribute significantly to employee frustration. Such an environment prevents employees from developing strong and supportive relationships with their colleagues, which can impact overall team collaboration and effectiveness. Addressing these sources of frustration and working towards creating an inclusive, nurturing, and efficient work environment can help mitigate the risks associated with employee unrest and disengagement. Organizations should prioritize open communication, employee empowerment, growth opportunities, and a culture that values transparency, mutual respect, and collaboration to ensure the overall wellbeing and satisfaction of their workforce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: Information: - A cement is a binder, a substance used in construction that sets and hardens and can bind other materials together. The most important types of cement are used as a component in the production of mortar in masonry, and of concrete, which is a combination of cement and an aggregate to form a strong building material. - Europa-Park is a theme park and the largest in Germany, and the second most popular theme park resort in Europe, following Disneyland Paris. - Asphalt (, occasionally ), also known as bitumen is a sticky, black and highly viscous liquid or semi-solid form of petroleum. It may be found in natural deposits or may be a refined product; it is a substance classed as a pitch. Until the 20th century, the term asphaltum was also used. The word is derived from the Ancient Greek \\"ásphaltos\\". - Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general use around the world, used as a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar, stucco, and most non-speciality grout. It was developed from other types of hydraulic lime in England in the mid 19th century and usually originates from limestone. It is a fine powder produced by heating materials in a kiln to form what is called clinker, grinding the clinker, and adding small amounts of other materials. Several types of Portland cement are available, with the most common being called ordinary Portland cement (OPC) which is grey in color, but a white Portland cement is also available. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe. It includes 16 constituent states, covers an area of , and has a largely temperate seasonal climate. With about 82 million inhabitants, Germany is the most populous member state of the European Union. After the United States, it is the second most popular immigration destination in the world. Germany's capital and largest metropolis is Berlin. Other major cities include Hamburg, Munich, Cologne, Frankfurt, Stuttgart and Düsseldorf. - A lift hill, or chain hill, is an upward-sloping section of track on a roller coaster on which the roller coaster train is mechanically lifted to an elevated point or peak in the track. Upon reaching the peak, the train is then propelled from the peak by gravity and is usually allowed to coast throughout the rest of the roller coaster ride's circuit on its own momentum, including most or all of the remaining uphill sections. The initial upward-sloping section of a roller coaster track is usually a lift hill, as the train typically begins a ride with little speed, though some coasters have raised stations that permit an initial drop without a lift hill. Although uncommon, some tracks also contain multiple lift hills. - Polymer concretes are a type of concrete that use polymers to replace lime-type cements as a binder. In some cases the polymer is used in addition to portland cement to form Polymer Cement Concrete (PCC) or Polymer Modified Concrete (PMC). Polymers in concrete have been overseen by Committee 548 of the American Concrete Institute since 1971. - Asphalt concrete (commonly called asphalt, blacktop, or pavement in North America, and tarmac or bitumen macadam in Great Britain and Ireland) is a composite material commonly used to surface roads, parking lots, and airports. It consists of mineral aggregate bound together with asphalt, laid in layers, and compacted. The process was refined and enhanced by Belgian inventor and U.S. immigrant Edward de Smedt. It is increasingly being used as the core of embankment dams. - Temple of the Night Hawk is an enclosed roller coaster located at Phantasialand . Founded in 1988 after 18 months of construction , the ride was originally called \`\` ' Space Center ' '' . The ride led passengers past models of rockets and emulated asteroids and the darkened hall was dimly lit with thousands of tiny spots of light to resemble stars . Due to the construction of the neighbouring Wurze Town in 2001 , the roller coaster was redeveloped with a fantasy jungle theme and was renamed as the Temple of the Night Hawk . The roller coaster is now completely dark . Until 2006 there were some green moving lights and strobe lights in the first lifthill , still present today , but not operational . In 2008 the Lights on the coaster trains were turned off or broke down and have never been repaired since then . Till 2010 there was a green laser projection with the outlines of a flying hawk and until June 2012 , there were some red strobe - lights at the final brakerun . In 2011 , the park installed new strobe lights in the first lifthill , which broke down after about two months , and were never repaired since then . The ride has four trains and one spare train for repairs each with seven cars . Each car has two rows of seats each holding two people . During the four - minute ride time the trains are lifted by three lift hill chains , 1.174 metres of track . The roller coaster is therefore one of the longest indoor roller coasters in the World , slightly beaten by \`\` Mindbender '' in Galaxyland Amusement Park , Canada . The hall in which the track is located is around 120,000m³ in size and rests on 180 concrete pillars which are 12 metres deep in the ground . In the basement of the hall is the \`\` ' Hollywood Tour '' ' darkride . The total investment for the ride was around 15 million DM . With the redevelopment of the ride in 2001 the park tried greening the roof of the hall by installing an irrigation system , however the results were n't as good as expected .

The park was opened in 1967 by Gottlieb Löffelhardt and Richard Schmidt. Although starting as a family-oriented park, Phantasialand has also added thrill rides, especially during recent years. Furthermore, following the example of Europa-Park, they have decided to attract business customers beside the regular ones, calling it \\"Business der neuen Dimension\\" (\\"business of a new dimension\\"). - Road surface or pavement is the durable surface material laid down on an area intended to sustain vehicular or foot traffic, such as a road or walkway. In the past, gravel road surfaces, cobblestone and granite setts were extensively used, but these surfaces have mostly been replaced by asphalt or concrete laid on a compacted base course. Road surfaces are frequently marked to guide traffic. Today, permeable paving methods are beginning to be used for low-impact roadways and walkways. - A roller coaster is an amusement ride developed for amusement parks and modern theme parks. LaMarcus Adna Thompson obtained a patent regarding roller coasters on January 20, 1885, which were made out of wood, but this patent is considerably later than the \\"Russian mountains\\" described below. In essence a specialized railroad system, a roller coaster consists of a track that rises in designed patterns, sometimes with one or more \\"inversions\\" (such as vertical loops) that briefly turn the rider upside down. The track does not necessarily have to be a complete circuit, as shuttle roller coasters demonstrate. Most roller coasters have multiple cars in which passengers sit and are restrained. Two or more cars hooked together are called a train. Some roller coasters, notably wild mouse roller coasters, run with single cars. - Concrete is a composite material composed of coarse aggregate bonded together with a fluid cement that hardens over time. Most concretes used are lime-based concretes such as Portland cement concrete or concretes made with other hydraulic cements, such as ciment fondu. However, asphalt concrete, which is frequently used for road surfaces, is also a type of concrete, where the cement material is bitumen, and polymer concretes are sometimes used where the cementing material is a polymer.

Help as much as you can. In the cosmic scheme of things, this was relatively minor. But very annoying. I had met a woman. Actually, at 19, she was still a girl. I lived in Pittsburgh. She lived in London, Ontario. She was, to put it bluntly, hotter than hell. On top of that, she’s one of the sweetest, nicest people you were ever going to meet. Needless to say, I was quite smitten, and quickly arranged to spend a week in London with her. When I showed up, she was wearing very interesting pajamas. At least for a few minutes. Unfortunately, my two cats, who had never spent a night in my home without me being there, were, less than impressed when I didn’t show up by 5 PM the day I left, despite having arranged for one of my parents to come over each day to feed them and make sure they had water, etc. Playing with them was optional, but neither would show themselves during that week. Nothing looked amiss on the first floor to Mom or Dad. The food was eaten, the water, apparently drunk, etc. When I got home and went upstairs I found something quite different. There was a trail of toilette paper strewn all over the hallway. My pillow was in the bedroom door and shredded. My alarm clock was on the floor. The power cord had been pulled from the wall and chewed through. There were several…uhmmm… “presents” in the middle of the bed, where they had pulled the sheets back. Some of them were still wet. I figure that trip cost me somewhere in the neighborhood of 1k to repair the damage. So I did what any 24 year old would do when faced with that situation. I cleaned up, went to bed, and went back to London a few weeks later. But I cat proofed the house first. (Yes, they still lived with me for another 12 years before passing away.)

Upon hearing Jeff's remark about his soil, Brandon states that the soil on his own farm is not hypoxic. Brandon is relieved when he notices the bartender is finally walking over to them. Does Brandon's soil have more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, it is not possible to definitively determine whether Brandon's soil has more or less toxic compounds than Jeff's. Hypoxia in soil refers to low oxygen levels, which can be harmful to plant roots and certain soil organisms. However, this does not directly indicate the presence or absence of toxic compounds. Toxic compounds in soil can result from various sources, such as chemical contamination from industrial activities, sewage, agricultural practices, or natural processes. Whether or not a soil has more or less toxic compounds depends on several factors, including the type and concentration of contaminants and the ability of the soil to degrade or otherwise neutralize them. In summary, while hypoxia can be a problem for plant growth and soil health, it does not directly correlate with the presence of toxic compounds. To determine the soil's toxicity, further analysis would be needed, such as testing for specific contaminants and evaluating the overall health of the soil ecosystem."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

During my days as an inmate in Bridges House at the University of New Brunswick, I shared this space with about 99 other testosterone-addled 'young adults' whose charming tendency to get completely out of hand was barely held in check by the rod of authority of the Don and Resident Fellow. This is not to say that these two worthies weren't good at their jobs; more accurately, their task was more akin to herding cats -- fairly obtuse, barely socialized cats. Given the state of controlled chaos that existed, it wasn't unusual for little conflicts to arise from time to time. Being rather physically small and odd, I came in for a certain amount of abuse from someone called Scut, a large and obnoxious Newfie (hmmm, that's like saying that water is wet). I can't remember what it was he did to me, but it was serious enough that I decided to get my own back. It's been said that revenge is a dish best enjoyed cold. I think revenge is a dish best enjoyed in secret with no chance of counter-revenge to spoil the occasion. And so it was that I laid my plans against Scut. The occasion and place were set.

Is the sentiment of the following sentence positive or negative? sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait","completion":"Based on the sentiment analysis, the sentiment of the sentence \\"sentimental but entirely irresistible portrait\\" is positive. Here is the step-by-step analysis and justification: 1) The sentence consists of descriptive words such as \\"sentimental\\" and \\"irresistible\\". Sentimental might be seen as a neutral term depending on the context, it largely can be positive as it reflects feelings or emotions. 2) The keyword \\"irresistible\\" is typically seen as a positive word because it implies that something is too attractive or appealing to be resisted. 3) \\"Entirely\\" acts as an intensifier for the adjective \\"irresistible\\". When combined, it strengthens the positivity of the sentiment expressed in the sentence. 4) The use of the word \\"but\\" could be seen as a turning point in the sentence, implying a shift from a possibly less positive concept \\"sentimental\\" to a highly positive one \\"entirely irresistible\\" Therefore, the overall sentiment can be deemed as positive due to the influential weight of the term \\"entirely irresistible\\". However, it's important to consider that sentiment analysis often needs to consider the broader context in which the sentence is placed."},{"prompt":"Question: What does Oliver do that infuriates the workhouse officials?

However, when another worker maligns his dead mother, Oliver flies into a rage and attacks him, earning the orphan a whipping. Oliver runs away to London. The Artful Dodger (Anthony Newley), a skilled young pickpocket, notices him and takes him to Fagin (Alec Guinness), an old man who trains children to be pickpockets. Fagin sends Oliver to watch and learn as the Dodger and another boy try to rob Mr. Brownlow (Henry Stephenson), a rich, elderly gentleman. Their attempt is detected, but it is Oliver who is chased through the streets by a mob and arrested. Fortunately, a witness clears him. Mr. Brownlow takes a liking to the boy, and gives him a home. Oliver experiences the kind of happy life he has never had before, under the care of Mr. Brownlow and the loving housekeeper, Mrs. Bedwin (Amy Veness).

The first five-year plan allocated ₹ 52.7 million to Himachal. More than 50% of this expenditure was incurred on road construction since it was felt that without proper transport facilities, the process of planning and development could not be carried to the people, who mostly lived an isolated existence in far away areas. Himachal now ranks fourth in respect of per capita income among the states of the Indian Union.\\" Answer: Answer:","completion":"The country that rose from the mentioned context is India. Himachal Pradesh is a state in northern India, and the passage details the beginning of its development planning, which coincided with the overall planning and development efforts across India starting in 1948. India's planning era dates back to its independence from British rule in 1947, which marks the beginning of a period of socio-economic planning and resource allocation to improve the overall infrastructure, development, and living standards of its diverse states. The first five-year plan kicked off in 1951, aiming to emphasize balanced regional development and to cater to each state's unique development needs. Himachal Pradesh, known for its natural beauty and vast mountainous terrain, experienced significant challenges in terms of accessibility and transportation. Proper infrastructure development and connecting the remote areas within Himachal Pradesh were crucial parts of its developmental goals. During the first five-year plan, ₹ 52.7 million was allocated to Himachal Pradesh, with more than 50% of the budget dedicated to road construction. The priority for transportation infrastructure was critical as it played a significant role in facilitating the overall development process by connecting people living in remote and isolated areas to essential services and opportunities. The investment in infrastructure and other development projects within Himachal Pradesh eventually paid off, as the state now ranks fourth in terms of per capita income among the states of the Indian Union. This ranking signifies the effectiveness of the state's planning efforts and the ability to improve the quality of life for its residents since the beginning of the planning era. In conclusion, the planning era in Himachal Pradesh began alongside India's broader planning initiatives post-independence in 1948. Through various projects and investments, particularly focusing on transportation infrastructure, the state of Himachal Pradesh has experienced progress and development, leading to an improved quality of life and economic standing within India."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: Formulate an answer to this elaborate question: What formal dance has a tradition of female students asking the male students to the dance? A:","completion":"The formal dance that traditionally involves female students asking male students to the dance is known as a Sadie Hawkins Dance. This idea was first introduced in a daily comic strip called \\"Li'l Abner\\" by cartoonist Al Capp. The tradition has been incorporated into school cultures across the United States, especially in high schools and colleges. The general idea behind a Sadie Hawkins Dance is to reverse typical gender roles and encourage female students to take initiative, allowing them to break from traditional gender norms. Named after a character in Cap's popular comic strip, Sadie Hawkins was considered the \\"homeliest gal in all them hills\\" and her father, in a desperate attempt to marry her off, created a day where a footrace was held and all the town's eligible bachelors were given a fair start. Sadie would then chase after them, and the bachelor she was able to catch would be obligated to marry her. From this zany comic premise has grown the popular culture phenomenon known today. The Sadie Hawkins dance trend began in the late 1930s, just a couple of years after the comic strip debuted the idea. It was first adopted by high schools and later spread to colleges and universities. Today, the dance is often held as a winter formal or spring semi-formal dance in these settings. Students typically execute the Sadie Hawkins dance just like other formal dances – with a theme, decorations, and formal attire. The key difference is the role reversal. This dance was and continues to be a significant event in American culture as it challenges the convention that men should always initiate romantic interest. Typically, the female students invite their prospective partners either in person or through creative invitations (often called \\"proposals\\") involving humorous ideas, puns, or even elaborate schemes. It's a welcome opportunity for girls to experience the pressure of asking someone out and boys to experience the apprehension of accepting or declining an offer, effectively serving as a social exercise in empathy. Besides the fun and entertaining aspect of the Sadie Hawkins dance, it also serves as an empowering event for young women, in which they are given the opportunity to take control and make decisions usually associated with boys. This goes hand in hand with promoting the idea of gender equality by opposing old-fashioned societal norms. The Sadie Hawkins Dance is a tradition still cherished by many schools even today because of the unique and interesting role-reversal which it advocates."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Landowski was born in Paris as the son of a Polish refugee father of the January uprising and a French mother .","completion":"To analyze the meaning of these two sentences, we need to break down their structural elements and compare them: 1. \\"Landowski was born in Paris of a Polish refugee father of the January Uprising, and a French mother.\\" 2. \\"Landowski was born in Paris as the son of a Polish refugee father of the January uprising and a French mother.\\" They both describe the same character \\"Landowski\\" and the location of his birth \\"Paris\\". They both mention the same parents - a Polish refugee father who took part in the January Uprising and a French mother. The only difference is the way this information is phrased - the first sentence states \\"born in Paris of a Polish refugee father\\", the second one phrases it as \\"born in Paris as the son of a Polish refugee father\\". Although the structural elements and the choice of words slightly differ, both sentences carry the same semantic meaning which is focused on Landowski's birth in Paris, his Polish father who was a refugee and a participant in the January Uprising, and his French mother.

In 1898 and again in 1899 Norman Heathcote visited the islands and wrote a book about his experiences. During the 19th century, steamers had begun to visit Hirta, enabling the islanders to earn money from the sale of tweeds and birds' eggs but at the expense of their self-esteem as the tourists regarded them as curiosities. It is also clear that the St Kildans were not so naïve as they sometimes appeared. \\"For example, when they boarded a yacht they would pretend they thought all the polished brass was gold, and that the owner must be enormously wealthy\\". The boats brought other previously unknown diseases, especially tetanus infantum, which resulted in infant mortality rates as high as 80 percent during the late 19th century. The cnatan na gall or boat-cough, an illness that struck after the arrival of a ship off Hirta, became a regular feature of life.By the early 20th century, formal schooling had again become a feature of the islands, and in 1906 the church was extended to make a schoolhouse. The children all now learned English and their native Scottish Gaelic. Improved midwifery skills, denied to the island by John Mackay, reduced the problems of childhood tetanus. From the 1880s, trawlers fishing the north Atlantic made regular visits, bringing additional trade. Talk of an evacuation occurred in 1875 during MacKay's time as minister, but despite occasional food shortages and a flu epidemic in 1913, the population was stable at between 75 and 80, and no obvious sign existed that within a few years the millennia-old occupation of the island was to end.

He noticed that Ecuador is within fifteen degrees north or south of the equator, but Norway is farther north of the equator. Bob starts to see how a country's location on a map affects how they look. Would Norway be closer to or further from its true dimentions? Answer:","completion":"When using a map with the Mercator projection, the way countries are depicted in terms of size and shape can be significantly distorted. In the case of Norway and Ecuador, their respective locations on the Earth play a vital role in understanding how their true dimensions may be affected by this particular projection method. The Mercator projection, developed by Flemish cartographer Gerardus Mercator in 1569, is a cylindrical map projection in which the Earth's surface is projected onto a cylinder, and then the cylinder is flattened to create a map. Due to the nature of this projection technique, the closer a country is to the poles, the more distorted its size and shape become when depicted on a Mercator map. This distortion is a direct consequence of the exaggerated increase in scale as one moves further away from the equator. In other words, the projection stretches areas near the poles to fill the gaps created when the globe is flattened into a two-dimensional surface. Now, let's focus on Norway and Ecuador's positions on the Earth. As Bob noticed, Ecuador is located within fifteen degrees north or south of the equator, which means it is relatively close to the equator. In contrast, Norway is situated at a significantly higher latitude, much farther north of the equator. Since the Mercator projection tends to produce minimal distortion near the equator, countries such as Ecuador would appear relatively close to their true dimensions in size and shape. On the other hand, countries like Norway, which are farther from the equator, will experience much greater distortion. Consequently, when looking at a Mercator map, Norway would be depicted as being further from its true dimensions than Ecuador. In fact, the landmass of Norway would appear significantly larger than it actually is, while its shape would be stretched horizontally, making it look wider than it is in reality. In summary, due to the inherent distortions that occur in the Mercator projection, Norway would be depicted further from its actual size and shape as compared to Ecuador. It is essential to keep these distortions in mind when using the Mercator projection or any other map projection, as they may impact the accuracy with which one can analyze and interpret geographical concepts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

He suggests they stay in a deserted local building, but McKaskel senses danger and they leave. Shabbit decides to steal two of their horses. Con Vallian (Sam Elliott) is chasing a half-breed Indian, the latest recruit to Shabbit's gang who, it transpires, Vallian has tracked for hundreds of miles for personal reasons.

Against Susanna's advice, Duncan rides into town and tries to reclaim the horses. An intense gunfight ensues when Vallian, who has secretly followed him, shoots some of the Shabbit gang.

Briefly summarize this sentence: californians will be asked to vote on at least five statewide ballot initiatives in the november general election , continuing a trend of letting those who go to the polls act as legislators .","completion":"Californians are set to participate in direct democracy actions by voting on a minimum of five statewide ballot initiatives during the upcoming November general election. This indicates the continuation of the democratic trend where voters, instead of elected representatives, make legislative decisions. Direct democracy is a form of governance that gives citizens the right to directly participate in the decision-making process. In the context of the given sentence, Californians will exercise this right during the November general election, where they will vote on at least five statewide ballot initiatives. These initiatives might revolve around issues like education, healthcare, environment, or tax reforms, depending on what has been put forward for public decision-making. The sentence also talks about “continuing a trend” which indicates that similar practices have taken place before where residents of California were asked to vote on legislative matters. This concept of direct democracy exemplifies the power of citizens to make decisions on policies, laws, or governmental actions that directly impact them. Moreover, the sentence refers to those who go to the polls as \\"legislators\\". Typically, a legislator is a person who makes laws, usually as a member of a legislative body. But in this situation, the citizens going to polls are acting as legislators. They are the decision-makers, deliberating and deciding on specific policies or laws proposed in the ballot initiatives. This again highlights the principle of direct democracy where citizens are not merely electing representatives to make decisions on their behalf, but rather making those decisions themselves. Thus, this sentence not only informs us about the upcoming voting event in California but also illustrates the thriving implementation of direct democracy in the state. With a minimum of five statewide ballot initiatives up for decision, Californians are once again ready to take on the legislative roles, reaffirming their active involvement in the political and legislative processes of their society."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The question is asking about the party that Don Chipp separated to form in 1977. A better and detailed answer would be: Don Chipp, an Australian politician, separated from the Liberal Party in 1977 to form a new political party known as the Australian Democrats. Chipp, who initially represented the Liberal Party, grew disillusioned with some of the party's policies and practices, and he sought to establish a political force that would act as a centrist, moderate alternative between the major parties of the time, the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party. The Australian Democrats aimed to bring a more transparent, accountable, and consultative form of politics. The party's key policy focus areas included social justice, environmental protection, human rights, and government accountability. Under Chipp's leadership, the Democrats achieved considerable success in gaining balance-of-power positions in the Australian Senate, which allowed them to influence legislation and negotiate changes to government proposals. Notably, Don Chipp played an essential role in the formation and early development of the Australian Democrats, serving as the party's first parliamentary leader from its inception in 1977 until his retirement in 1986. Although the Australian Democrats have lost much of their influence in recent years, Don Chipp's decision to form the party in 1977 still remains an important moment in Australian political history, as it offered voters an alternative choice in a predominantly two-party system."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the above question based on the context below: Gloria, a downtrodden housewife, lives with her husband Antonio, mother-in-law and two sons in a small, shabby and overcrowded apartment located by the Madrid motorway. Besides taking care of her home and family, Gloria also works as a cleaning lady to make ends meet and takes amphetamines to keep going. Her marriage to Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, is on the rocks. Fifteen years earlier, in Germany, Antonio worked as a driver for Ingrid Muller, a German singer with whom he had a brief affair. His only mementos of their liaison are a signed photograph and a tape of her song Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen which he constantly plays and which Gloria detests. Antonio's services for Ingrid involved copying letters that she had allegedly received from Hitler himself. In his taxi Antonio meets the writer Lucas and Antonio casually mentions this fact to Lucas, who suggests that they forge Hitler's diaries for big profit. There is also a book of Ingrid's memoirs written by a friend which contains letters from Hitler which Antonio helped forge. Antonio is trying to teach the art of forgery to one of his sons, as this talent will be his only inheritance. The younger son, Miguel, who is twelve, sleeps around with older men. When Gloria confronts Miguel, telling him she knows he has been sleeping with older men (including his friend's father), Miguel responds: \\"I'm the master of my own body.\\" Gloria's eldest son, Toni, who is fourteen, wants to become a farmer and is saving up enough money to buy a farm by peddling heroin. The grandmother, who is addicted to soft drinks, shares the same dream of returning to her native village. Gloria's friends are her two neighbors: Cristal and Juani. Cristal is a prostitute with a heart of gold. Juani, is a bitter woman obsessed with cleanliness and vulgar ornaments, her daughter, Vanesa, has telekinetic powers, which she uses to destroy their apartment. A:","completion":"In this context, it is Antonio, Gloria's husband, who constantly plays the song \\"Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen.\\" Antonio, a male chauvinist taxi driver, has an emotional connection to this song because it reminds him of his brief affair with Ingrid Muller, a German singer he had met fifteen years earlier when he worked as her driver in Germany. The song acts as a memento of their past relationship. The constant playing of \\"Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen\\" only adds to the friction in Antonio and Gloria's marriage. Gloria, a downtrodden housewife, detests the song as it serves as a reminder of her husband's infidelity in the past. She must also deal with a number of other issues, such as taking care not only of her family but also of her work as a cleaning lady, relying on stimulants to keep her going. Additionally, she faces numerous problems with her two sons and her mother-in-law. Antonio's past work for Ingrid Muller involved copying letters she had allegedly received from Hitler. As a result, their lives later become intertwined with the writer Lucas, who proposes forging Hitler's diaries to make money. This whole ordeal only puts more pressure on the already strained family dynamics. In summary, Antonio is the individual who constantly plays the song \\"Nur nicht aus Liebe Weinen,\\" which has become a source of controversy in his and Gloria's troubled marriage. It serves as a constant reminder of their past problems and Antonio's infidelity, further complicating their challenging lives that are filled with numerous family issues and difficulties."},{"prompt":"Information: - Cheng Yanqiu (1 January 1904 9 March 1958) was a Chinese Peking opera singer.

Scary Monsters and Super Creeps (1980) produced the number-one hit \\"Ashes to Ashes\\", featuring the textural work of guitar-synthesist Chuck Hammer and revisiting the character of Major Tom from \\"Space Oddity\\". The song gave international exposure to the underground New Romantic movement when Bowie visited the London club \\"Blitz\\"—the main New Romantic hangout—to recruit several of the regulars (including Steve Strange of the band Visage) to act in the accompanying video, renowned as one of the most innovative of all time. While Scary Monsters used principles established by the Berlin albums, it was considered by critics to be far more direct musically and lyrically. The album's hard rock edge included conspicuous guitar contributions from Robert Fripp, Chuck Hammer, and Pete Townshend. As \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" hit number one on the UK charts, Bowie opened a three-month run on Broadway on 24 September, starring as John Merrick in The Elephant Man.Bowie paired with Queen in 1981 for a one-off single release, \\"Under Pressure\\".

Coinciding with its transmission, a five-track EP of songs from the play, recorded earlier in Berlin, was released as David Bowie in Bertolt Brecht's Baal.

It is transformed to \\"racquetballu\\" due to declension rules that require a change in the ending of the word. The result might not be widely understood, as racquetball is a less known sport in Czech Republic, so you may need to provide extra explanation or context for the listener. So, putting it together and adjusting for proper Czech sentence structure, we have: \\"Jo, hrál jsem trochu racquetballu.\\" This translation maintains the casual, informal tone of the original English phrase and effectively communicates the same message. However, it is important to note that racquetball may not be widely familiar in the Czech Republic, so you might need to explain the sport or use a more common term like \\"squash,\\" which is \\"squash\\" in Czech, if the listener is unfamiliar with racquetball."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

The plunge on Monday began during Asian hours and spread around the globe. Late in the day, news of explosions at the site of the Boston Marathon added to market jitters. Stocks continued to slide on the back of worries about economic growth in China and a steep tumble in commodity prices. John Shipman reports. But for most of the day, attention was centered on the dive in gold prices. For the second straight session, gold plummeted, losing 140.40, or 9.4%, to settle at 1360.60 a troy ounce. The drop was the largest one-day percentage fall since February 1983. Monday's decline brought the two-day losses to 203.70, or 13%.

As investors exited riskier investments, small-company stocks were particularly hard hit. The Russell 2000 index shed 3.8%, to 907.21, its worst point and percentage decline since November 2011. For weeks, stocks have defied expectations for a pullback and on many days, an early selloff was pared by the end of trading. But Monday's retreat saw the Dow industrials sink into the close and mark their worst one-day point and percentage decline since Nov. 7. Declines in commodity-linked sectors far outpaced losses in other categories on Monday. Shares in the materials and energy sectors both declined 3.9%. Mining company Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold was the biggest decliner in the S&P 500, shedding 2.65, or 8.3%, to 29.27. \\"When you talk about the sectors that are leading on the way down, they're all commodity-backed in some fashion,\\" said Will Bertsch, head of U.S. equity trading for BMO Capital Markets.

Among ETFs Monday, there was record trading volume in the SPDR Gold Trust, which tracks the price of physical gold. More than 93 million shares of the ETF changed hands, shattering the previous record of 79 million. Despite the turmoil, traders said stock trading was smooth. \\"Ironically, it's not as busy as you would expect when you see moves like this,\\" said Mr. Bertsch.

Davis said simultaneous explosions occurred around 2:50 p.m. ET within 50 and 100 yards of each other, causing multiple casualties. Davis wouldn't confirm a number for casualties, but other media reports have suggested that as many as 12 people died in the blasts. Earlier in the trading session, reports came that China, the world's second-largest economy, grew 7.7% in the first quarter, trailing economist projections. China's economy expanded 7.9% in the fourth quarter. Economists were expecting an increase in the first quarter of 8%, according to apoll. \\"The explosions at the Boston Marathon pretty much added to the negative sentiment because it's such an uncertainty,\\" said Sam Stovall, S&P's New York-based chief equity strategist. \\"First off, it's a tragedy, you feel for the people who were there . . . the next question is could there be more things there or elsewhere, and those kind of worries are very very hard to factor in to equity prices.\\" According to ABC, Massachusetts General Hospital had received at least 4 patients from the explosion. There are various reports of several people having lost limbs during the explosion, though nothing is confirmed at this time. Reports of the casualty count are varying as information is being released and updated. Boston Police is tweeting that two people have died, while 22 are injured. Theis reporting that two additional explosive devices were found, but are now being disarmed. The Boston Marathon headquarters is on lockdown, according to reports. The explosions took place as global markets were already down on reports showing that industrial output in China, the world's second-largest economy, had missed expectations, prompting an early-morning sell-off in commodities.

Thermo Fisher Scientific ( TMO), the lab equipment giant located in the Boston suburb of Waltham, gained as much as 6.2% after announcing a deal to acquire genetic testing equipment maker Life Technologies ( LIFE) for 76 a share in cash or about 13.6 billion, making the deal one of the largest corporate takeovers of the year. By day's end, Thermo Fisher was down 1.3% to 78.58. Life Technologies gained 7.5% to 73.11. Sprint Nextel ( S), the country's third-largest mobile phone operator, surged 14% to 7.06 after satellite-TV provider Dish Network ( DISH) offered to acquire the U.S. wireless carrier for 25.5 billion in cash and stock. The buyout offer could frustrate Japanese carrier Softbank's efforts to buy Sprint, or create a bidding war that might benefit investors. Dish fell 2.3% to 36.77. The longer-term impact of the Boston explosions remained unclear. The apparent attack took place on a day when investors were already digesting reports indicating that all is not well in the global economy despite the S&P 500's 11.4% advance for 2013 before Monday. Global market reaction in the days ahead is more likely to be a product of investor sentiment about the strength or weakness of the world economy than the events in Boston, said Michael Shaoul, chairman of New York-based Marketfield Asset Management LLC. The 2004 Madrid commuter train and 2005 London subway terrorist attacks occurred at a time when the global economy was largely stable, he said, and markets rebounded shortly after both of those incidents. \\"If we're looking at what happened today through a simple financial prism, it isn't likely to be a determinant of where any of the major market prices are going to be in the week's ahead,'' Shaoul said in a phone interview. \\"Yet gold collapsed on a day in which you had poor Chinese data, so it's possible that this adds to an already unfolding story. Conversely, Madrid and London were really bad terrorist attacks in the middle of reasonable economies, so markets recovered.

Summarize: Millennials generally don’t want to delay happiness in return for career advancement, and as such are not willing to sacrifice their personal lives for their work lives. This does not mean that they’re not willing to work hard - rather, Millennials will work extremely hard during their defined work hours, but they expect to have their “off” times (such as weekends and nights) free from work. In general, Millennials believe that their productivity should not be measured by the number of hours they work, since someone can work for 8 hours and accomplish next to nothing of significance for the company. Instead, Millennials measure their productivity levels by the quality of the work they perform. For example, a Millennial worker might feel better having finished a huge project in 6 hours than having spent an 8 hour day doing “busy work” or answering emails. Millennials are often stereotyped as “entitled” workers and such a perspective can be hard to debunk from the outside. However, in reality, Millennials simply want to feel like more than a “cog in a massive machine.” Instead, Millennial workers want to work on projects that matter to themselves, the company, or the world at large. Give Millennials their own projects or a small piece of ownership over a larger project. Millennials are joining the workforce when there are countless companies and newly-forming startup jobs available daily, so they don’t feel the need to stay working at a company whose values don’t align with their own. Focus on being ethical and fair, and creating a mission that works to make the world a better place. This won’t just help your Millennial workers, but all company employees!","completion":"Millennials prioritize happiness and work-life balance over career advancement and do not want to sacrifice their personal lives for work. They are hardworking during work hours but expect time off for leisure. They value productivity based on quality, not hours worked, and prefer meaningful projects over routine tasks. Often labeled as \\"entitled,\\" they seek a connection with their company's values and mission. Offering them ownership in projects and focusing on ethical, fair business practices can benefit both millennials and the entire company."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Direct Effect: Filling more trays with water and placing them in the freezer will directly result in the production of more ice cubes. As each tray gets filled with water and undergoes the freezing process, it will produce a new set of ice cubes. Consequently, the total number of ice cubes made will increase with the number of trays filled. Indirect Effect: 1. Time: Filling more trays might increase the spreading of cool temperature across the trays evenly, causing a slightly longer overall freezing time for the ice cubes to form. This extended time occurs because the freezer now needs to cool all the additional trays and their water content. 2. Space: Adding more trays to the freezer will take up space, potentially limiting the area available for other frozen items. If the freezer is close to capacity, this space concern may force users to remove items from the freezer to accommodate the extra trays. 3. Energy Consumption: More energy will be needed to maintain the frozen state as the freezer deals with the additional trays and water. Freezers perform best when two-thirds to three-quarters full, but packing too many items inside could lead to increased energy consumption. In conclusion, the perturbation of filling more trays with water will have a direct effect on producing more ice cubes and an indirect effect on the freezing time, space management, and energy consumption. Despite these indirect effects, the central goal of creating more ice will still be achieved."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

OPT: [-] no [-] yes","completion":"Yes, those questions are essentially the same. Both are seeking information about certified checks, their role in transferring funds between banks, and the process for cashing them. A certified check is a type of bank-issued check that is highly secure and guaranteed to clear when it's deposited or cashed. It provides a level of certainty and trust for parties in a financial transaction and is commonly used for making large payments. These checks function as an alternative to personal checks, which carry a higher risk of bouncing due to insufficient funds in the account. How certified checks work between banks: 1. Requesting a certified check: When a customer wants to create a certified check, they request one from their bank. The bank will first verify the customer's account balance to ensure adequate funds are available for the amount of the check. The customer's account is then typically debited instantly, or the funds may be placed on hold to secure the transaction. 2. Bank certification: After verifying the funds, the bank certifies the check by stamping, signing, or endorsing it. This certification process confirms that the check is legitimate and that the bank guarantees the payment. Additionally, the bank assigns a unique tracking number to the check for authentication purposes. 3. Transfer of funds: Once the check is certified, it can be given to the payee (the person or entity that is receiving the payment). The payee then deposits or cashes the check at their own bank. The payee’s bank is responsible for contacting the payer's (the person who issued the check) bank to authenticate the certified check and request the transfer of funds. 4. Clearing the check: The payer's bank verifies the certified check, confirms its authenticity, and transfers the funds to the payee's bank account. This process usually takes place through an electronic clearing system or a check clearinghouse. 5. Availability of funds: Once the payee's bank receives the funds from the payer's bank, the certified check is considered cleared. At this point, the payee can access the funds in their account. Depending on the banks involved and their policies, the funds might be available immediately or within a few business days. It is important to note that while certified checks significantly reduce the risk of non-payment, they are not entirely risk-free. Payees should still take precautions to verify the authenticity of a certified check and ensure it is not a counterfeit or altered check. Contacting the issuing bank directly can help confirm the check's legitimacy. In summary, certified checks work between banks by offering a safe and guaranteed method of payment. The bank issuing the check verifies the customer's account balance, then certifies and secures the check before it is transferred to the payee. The check is considered cleared when the payee's bank receives the funds, and the payee can then access them."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Ainsley is urinating, Sampson falls silent; Ainsley finds Sampson killed. He grabs his harpoon, only to be murdered by a monstrous being. During a Mardi Gras celebration in New Orleans, a group of friends including Ben and his best friend Marcus decide to go on a haunted swamp tour. They find the tour closed because the guide, Rev. Zombie, was sued for negligence. Rev. Zombie suggests they try a place farther down the street, owned by the over-the-top, inexperienced tour guide Shawn. Marcus decides to leave but changes his mind upon seeing two topless girls: Misty, a ditzy porn star, and Jenna, a bossy, boastful, up-and-coming actress.

Fortran (; formerly FORTRAN, derived from \\"Formula Translation\\") is a general-purpose, imperative programming language that is especially suited to numeric computation and scientific computing. Originally developed by IBM in the 1950s for scientific and engineering applications, Fortran came to dominate this area of programming early on and has been in continuous use for over half a century in computationally intensive areas such as numerical weather prediction, finite element analysis, computational fluid dynamics, computational physics, crystallography and computational chemistry. It is a popular language for high-performance computing and is used for programs that benchmark and rank the world's fastest supercomputers. Fortran encompasses a lineage of versions, each of which evolved to add extensions to the language while usually retaining compatibility with prior versions. Successive versions have added support for structured programming and processing of character-based data (FORTRAN 77), array programming, modular programming and generic programming (Fortran 90), high performance Fortran (Fortran 95), object-oriented programming (Fortran 2003) and concurrent programming (Fortran 2008). The names of earlier versions of the language through FORTRAN 77 were conventionally spelled in all-capitals (FORTRAN 77 was the last version in which the use of lowercase letters in keywords was strictly non-standard). The capitalization has been dropped in referring to newer versions beginning with Fortran 90.

The cereal was full of nutrition, but the breakfast bar was unhealthy, because the","completion":"latter was packed with excessive amounts of sugar, harmful trans fats, artificial preservatives, and colourings that significantly overshadowed any vitamins or nutrients it might contain. Analyzing in depth, it's understood that breakfast bars can seem like a healthy choice at first glance due to the clever marketing strategies they often employ. They are easy and convenient, and many are fortified with vitamins and minerals. However, the fact remains that many breakfast bars are high in sugar – some of them even contain different forms of sugar listed multiple times in their ingredients list. An excessive intake of sugar can lead to various health concerns like dental cavities, obesity, type-2 diabetes and heart disease. It also provides a quick surge of energy followed by a crash, which is not the most ideal way to start the day. Moreover, the trans fats in these breakfast bars are another cause of concern. These unhealthy fats raise your bad (LDL) cholesterol levels and lower your good (HDL) cholesterol levels. Eating trans fats increases your risk of developing heart disease and stroke, and it's also associated with a higher risk of developing type-2 diabetes. Artificial preservatives in these bars, while enhancing their shelf-life, can have adverse effects too. Some preservatives have been linked to health problems such as heart damage, cancer, and allergic reactions. Similarly, artificial colourings used to make the bars more visually appealing may also pose health risks. Some studies have linked specific artificial colours to health problems, including allergies in children, and possibly cancer in animals. On the other hand, the cereal, even though it may not be as convenient or marketed in the same appealing way, has proven to be a more nutritious choice. Cereals are typically low in fat and provide an initial source of energy for the day ahead. Depending on the type, they often contain essential nutrients, like dietary fibre, iron, and B vitamins, which are crucial for maintaining good health. Thus, when choosing between a cereal and a breakfast bar, it’s not just about the taste or convenience, but more importantly, about the nutritional values. It is crucial to read and comprehend the nutritional information on product packaging, and make health-conscious decisions based on the understanding of this information. However, it's essential to note that not all cereals and breakfast bars fall into these categories. Some breakfast bars can be nutritious, especially those made from whole foods and minimal added sugars. Similarly, some cereals can be high in sugar and low in fibre. The key is to make a conscious effort to choose products that are high in nutrients but low in added sugars, fats, and artificial additives."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: FINAL EXAM Question 1.

But the Giants didn't seem to have an answer for Peyton or the Colts' running game, which was led by Joseph Addai and Donald Brown. The Giants were shut out at the half for the third time in their last four games (dating back to last year) after the Colts scored the first 24 points of the night. Brown recorded a 7-yard scoring run, and Dallas Clark and Austin Collie caught touchdown passes of 50 and 3 yards, respectively. The Colts defense held the Giants to 75 yards of offense in the first half, including just 17 passing yards for Eli. The Giants finally got on the board on the first drive of the second half, when Eli connected with Mario Manningham for a 54-yard strike. But on the Giants' next drive, an Eli fumble was picked up in the end zone by Fili Moala, effectively taking the Giants out of the game. Two additional scores occurred in the fourth quarter; Peyton connected with Reggie Wayne for a 10-yard score, and Eli threw a 31-yard touchdown to Week 1 star Nicks.

Scroll down for video. Taylor Lianne Chandler has revealed that swimmer Michael Phelps pursued her on Tinder. The real thing: Chandler explained that once she'd met up with Phelps, their relationship seemed quite serious. I'm yelling Tinder: A look at Phelps' alleged Tinder profile, which is how he and Chandler first met. She told The Daily Beast’s Aurora Snow: ‘He pursued me [on Tinder]. He was actually outside the age range for what my account was setup for. But what I’ve learned is when someone looks at whatever and likes you, even if they’re younger it shows up in your feed. ‘But at the time I just didn’t think it was real. You just figure it’s fake.’ Chandler explained that once they’d met up, their relationship seemed quite serious. She said: ‘We talked about the fact that I wasn’t looking to get involved with someone unless it was serious. I’m not ugly, so its not like men don’t approach me, but I wanted something real. And it felt real with him. I’ve been to his house four times, we talk everyday, and I’ve slept with him more than once.’ Chandler recently admitted on a Facebook post that she’d been born an ‘intersex’ - someone who had male genitalia, but no testicles, while also having a uterus and no ovaries.

In costume: Chandler dressed as Wonder Woman for Halloween with a pal. 'One thing led to the next, and we made love during halftime,' she claims in the interview. 'Later, we had sex again. The intimacy with him was amazing! It was the first time in my life that someone has made me feel like a true woman.' She also told the magazine that she never lied to the swimmer about her past, saying it just never came up. Chandler claims she was with Phelps when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI on September 30 in Baltimore, Maryland. The swimmer entered rehab just a few days after the incident and completed his program on Wednesday according to Chandler. Her choice: Chandler began taking testosterone blockers in her teens, and had corrective surgery in her early twenties to get rid of her male genitalia. Phelps, the most decorated Olympian of all time with 22 medals, is currently serving a six month suspension from swimming as a result of his DUI. In her post, Chandler also takes some time to discuss the difficulties she has faced in her life. 'In my early teens I was medically diagnosed and went on testosterone blockers, at 15 estrogen enhancers. My birth certificate was modified along with my name while I was a teenager, prior to any corrective surgery,' she explains. 'I originally changed my name to Paige Victoria Whitney. At 16 I legally emancipated from my family. I had already left home at 15. At 18 I got in trouble twice, once for a bad check and then a DUI.' 'At 19 I thought it would be smart to blackmail someone into giving me the money for my surgery. As soon as I received the money I was arrested and charged with extortion.' 'I spent 30 days in jail because I was too ashamed to tell my family what happened thinking no one knew. Even though my birth certificate and drivers license said female they put me in a cell with 3 men and I was raped.' She has since spent much of her life crusading for gender rights.

During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at 60 for on e day or 160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at 649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air. Of course, you can always shop in the city of Hamilton's upscale small goods arts and crafts shops.

Smith, 33, said Shaun Derry persuaded him to sign for Notts. Article:","completion":"Title: Alan Smith Chooses Meadow Lane Over America Thanks to Shaun Derry Introduction: Alan Smith, the 33-year-old former England star, has recently spoken out about his decision to sign for Notts County, revealing that he doesn't care about the money he earns while playing at Meadow Lane. Smith also mentioned that it was Shaun Derry who was the driving force behind his choice to join Notts, passing up on offers from clubs in the United States. In this article, we will delve into the details of Smith's journey and how he ended up at Notts County. Step 1: Smith's decision not to prioritize financial aspects One of the key points in Smith's decision to join Notts County was his willingness to put aside monetary considerations in favor of other motivating factors. At 33, Smith has already had a successful career, having represented England and played for renowned clubs such as Manchester United and Leeds United. This experience has likely given him the financial stability to prioritize other aspects of his career rather than focusing solely on his paycheck. Step 2: Offers from America Despite the interest from clubs in the United States, Smith ultimately decided to turn down their offers for various reasons. It's possible that the lifestyle, culture, or distance may have played a role in Smith's decision, but he has made it clear that his choice was not financially motivated. Step 3: Shaun Derry's influence on Smith's decision The most significant factor in Smith's decision to sign for Notts County seems to be Shaun Derry's persuasion. As the manager of Notts County, Derry has been able to convince Smith that Meadow Lane is the place for him to continue his football career. Derry's passion for the club, his vision for its growth, and possibly even their personal relationship may have all played a part in Smith choosing to sign for Notts. Conclusion: In conclusion, former England star Alan Smith has demonstrated his dedication to the sport and the drive to pursue his love for football beyond financial gains. Turning down offers from America, Smith was won over by Shaun Derry's enthusiasm and commitment to Notts County, ultimately choosing to sign for the club at Meadow Lane. Fans and followers of both Smith and Notts County will undoubtedly be eager to see his impact on the team in the coming season."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

However, I can discuss each of the given options in detail to give you an idea of the different possibilities that may play out for Aubrey. Option A - Remorseful: If Aubrey feels remorseful after sending text messages to her friends indicating her departure, it suggests that she might not be completely sure about her decision or could be feeling guilty for not discussing it with her friends in person. In this situation, she might choose to reach out to her friends and explain her decision in more detail or even reconsider her choice. The extent to which her friends react positively to her remorse and understand her feelings will depend on the closeness of their relationships and their ability to empathize with her situation. Option B - Be ignored by friends: In this scenario, Aubrey's friends may choose to ignore her text messages and not respond to her announcement. This might be due to their feelings of hurt, anger, or sadness about her decision to leave. They might feel that she did not consider their feelings, or they could be in disbelief about her choice. If this happens, Aubrey may feel isolated and unsupported in her decision. Depending on her personality and the strength of her relationships, this might lead her to reassess her choice or try to mend her relationships by reaching out, apologizing, and explaining her reasons for leaving in more detail. Option C - Be given a party: Some of Aubrey's friends might decide that the best way to support her and show their love is to throw her a farewell party. They could use this event as an opportunity to gather memories and spend quality time together before she leaves. This would be a positive outcome, as it demonstrates that her friends understand her decision and are still willing to support her as she moves on to the next chapter of her life. A farewell party could also serve as closure for the group, allowing them to say their goodbyes and express their appreciation for the time spent together. In conclusion, Aubrey's circumstances may lead to different outcomes depending on the dynamics of her friendships, her personality, and the reactions of her friends to her decision to leave. It could result in her feeling remorseful, being ignored, or being given a farewell party. The exact outcome cannot necessarily be predicted, but these scenarios offer insight into the range of possibilities that may occur in her situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Detailed Instructions: A ploynomial equation is a sum of terms. Here each term is either a constant number, or consists of the variable x raised to a certain power and multiplied by a number. These numbers are called weights. For example, in the polynomial: 2x^2+3x+4, the weights are: 2,3,4. You can present a polynomial with the list of its weights, for example, equation weights = [6, 4] represent the equation 6x + 4 and equation weights = [1, 3, 4] represent the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. In this task, you need to compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituing a given value of x in the given polynomial equation. Equation weights are given as a list. Problem:x = 2, equation weights = [9, 0, 5] Solution:","completion":"Part #1: Understand the polynomial equation structure. Usage: In the polynomial 2x^2 + 3x + 4, the weights are 2, 3, and 4. The structure of the polynomial equation is defined such that each term is a constant number or the variable x raised to a certain power multiplied by its weight. Example: In the example 2x^2 + 3x + 4, the structure is as follows: - The term 2x^2 has a weight of 2 and x is raised to the power of 2. - The term 3x has a weight of 3 and x is raised to the power of 1. - The term 4 is a constant weight of 4 and x is raised to the power of 0. Part #2: Represent polynomial equations as a list of weights. Usage: Given equation weights = [1, 3, 4], this represents the equation 1x^2 + 3x + 4. Example: Using the example of 1x^2 + 3x + 4, the list representation is [1, 3, 4] because: - The weight of x^2 is 1. - The weight of x is 3. - The constant term is 4. Part #3: Compute the result of a polynomial expression by substituting a given value of x. Usage: For the input x = 2 and equation weights = [9, 0, 5], compute the result. Example: With x = 2 and equation weights = [9, 0, 5], the polynomial equation is 9x^2 + 0x + 5. To compute the result: - Substitute x with 2: 9(2)^2 + 0(2) + 5. - Calculate the result: 9(4) + 0(2) + 5 = 36 + 0 + 5 = 41. So, the solution is 41."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

Below are some of the reviews that supported this consensus: 1. Roger Ebert of Chicago Sun-Times: Ebert noted the film was \\"an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained.\\" Although acknowledging the movie's stunning visual effects, he expressed concern about the plot weaknesses and implausibilities. 2. Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly: Gleiberman stated, \\"Armageddon is an in-your-face movie, and yet this mother of all disaster films, a lavish visual-effects party, is spectacularly unexciting.\\" He further mentioned that while the film boasts impressive visuals, its intelligence and emotional depth are severely lacking. 3. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone: Travers commented, \\"Michael Bay's Armageddon is a work of staggering inefficiencies. Its ineptitude at telling anything resembling a coherent story is matched only by the bombastic presentation.\\" He added that despite its grandiose visuals, the film is unable to draw viewers into any meaningful emotional journey. 4. Janet Maslin of The New York Times: Maslin stated that Armageddon \\"looks and sounds like a deluxe lava lamp, with its ooziness enhanced by digital effects.\\" She further criticized the film's intelligence, describing it as typically displaying short attention span, favoring action and special effects over any actual storytelling. 5. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times: Turan described the film as \\"technologically first-rate yet dramatically second-class.\\" He pointed out that although the film showcases fantastic special effects and a star-studded cast, it ultimately fails to deliver an engaging narrative or emotional depth. 6. Jonathan Rosenbaum of Chicago Reader: Rosenbaum noted: \\"This 150-minute chunk of hokum about the end of the world has plenty of spectacular mayhem, but it's virtually unwatchable if you have the slightest interest in narrative coherence.\\" He stresses that the movie heavily leans on the visual aspect while ignoring the importance of a solid storyline. In conclusion, the critic consensus on Armageddon is supported by various reviews that continually point out the movie's remarkable visual effects, while simultaneously criticizing its lack of intelligence, weak storyline, and emotional depth. This combination of features reflects the cinematic legacies of producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would \\"On February 22, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Lewis the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award .\\" be a reasonable answer? Answer:","completion":"Jerry Lewis's real name is Joseph Levitch. He was born on March 16, 1926, in Newark, New Jersey, and became a famous American comedian, actor, singer, producer, and director, as well as a philanthropist for his work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association. Regarding the statement \\"On February 22, 2009, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences awarded Lewis the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award,\\" it certainly highlights an essential accolade in his career but does not directly answer the question about his real name. However, it can provide additional information about Jerry Lewis's accomplishments and humanitarian contributions, which gives a fuller picture of his persona and impact. The Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award is an honorary Oscar presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences (AMPAS) to an individual in the motion picture industry whose exceptional philanthropic and humanitarian work has made an outstanding impact in society. The award is named after Jean Hersholt, a Danish-American actor, who was a prime founder of the Motion Picture Relief Fund (later known as the Motion Picture & Television Fund) and served as its president for 18 years. Jerry Lewis was indeed awarded the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award on February 22, 2009, during the 81st Academy Awards ceremony. This accomplishment reflected his decades-long dedication to fighting muscular dystrophy, a group of genetic diseases that progressively weaken muscles and limit mobility. Lewis's work with the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) began in the 1950s, and he went on to host the annual Labor Day MDA Telethon from 1966 to 2010, raising over 2.6 billion for the cause throughout his tenure. To summarize, while the statement regarding Jerry Lewis receiving the Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award is undoubtedly noteworthy, it does not directly answer the question about his real name. It can still be used in conjunction with information about his actual name, Joseph Levitch, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the man, his career, and his philanthropic efforts."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Answer:","completion":"The RBE2 (Radar à Balayage Electronique 2 plans) is an advanced multirole radar system that was developed in the 1990s specifically for the Dassault Rafale, a versatile and powerful French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft. The development and production of the Rafale aircraft as well as the RBE2 radar system are attributed to the organization called Dassault Aviation. Dassault Aviation, a leading aerospace company in France, has a long-standing history of designing and constructing military and civilian aircraft. It was founded by Marcel Dassault in 1929 and eventually emerged as one of the renowned global aerospace manufacturers. Dassault Aviation is responsible for a range of innovative aircraft models such as the Mirage and Rafale series in the military domain and the Falcon series in the civilian sector. The inception of the Rafale, which has become a significant milestone in Dassault's portfolio, dates back to the 1970s and 1980s. At that time, the French government was seeking a new generation multirole fighter aircraft that could replace a variety of existing planes and cater to the French Air Force and Navy's diverse operational requirements. As such, the Rafale was designed to be a potent and multipurpose aircraft, capable of performing air supremacy, interdiction, aerial reconnaissance, ground support, in-depth strike, anti-ship strike, and even nuclear deterrence missions. Recent export successes have also proven the Rafale's attractiveness to foreign air forces, with India, Egypt, Qatar, and Greece selecting the aircraft for their fleets. A crucial aspect of the Rafale's operational capability lies in its advanced avionics and sensor systems, including the RBE2 radar. This radar system is developed by Thales, a multinational corporation specializing in advanced technological solutions in aerospace, defense, and other sectors. The RBE2 radar is characterized by its innovative electronic scanning technology, which enables it to operate in two planes, and is composed of passive electronically scanned array (PESA) antennas. The radar system provides the Rafale with superior situational awareness, air-to-air and air-to-ground combat capabilities, target detection and tracking, as well as advanced terrain-following navigation and weather monitoring features. Upgrades to the radar system were introduced in 2014 with the RBE2-AA, an active electronically scanned array (AESA) variant that further enhances performance and reliability while reducing maintenance and support costs. In conclusion, the RBE2 (Radar à Balayage Electronique 2 plans) is a state-of-the-art multirole radar developed during the 1990s for the Dassault Rafale, a high-performance French twin-engine, canard delta wing, multirole fighter aircraft. The entire development and manufacturing process of the Rafale and its integrative systems, including the RBE2 radar, can be credited to Dassault Aviation, a well-known and reputable French aerospace organization."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In other words, the instrument is tuned G-G-D-D-A-A-E-E, taking into consideration each individual string. When you're holding the mandolin correctly, the highest string pair (E) should be the closest to the floor. If you play guitar, it can also be helpful to think of it as the lowest four guitar strings (E-A-D-G), but in reverse. That can also help you get familiar with the fingerings when you're first getting started on the instrument. On most mandolins, the tuners for both G strings and both D strings will be on the side of the headstock closest to you, while the tuners for both A strings and E strings will be on the side of the headstock closest to the floor, in order. As you tune, you generally want to tune in that clockwise pattern on the tuners, around the headstock, working your way down the instrument and higher in pitch. What makes tuning a mandolin more difficult than tuning a violin, of course, is that there are 8 strings instead of 4, meaning that you have to be precise or the instrument will be out of tune. It can be difficult to know which string is out of tune when you're striking them both in unison. Use \\"rest strokes\\" (in which you dampen each string with the pick after playing) to isolate each note individually as you're tuning. This will get a clearer tone on the electronic tuner, or whatever other tuning method you're using. As with any stringed instrument, you generally want to tune from flat to sharp, tuning the string up in pitch, rather than down from a higher note to the correct tone. This is because you want to settle the tension in the string toward the gear, not away from it. When you tune down, you risk letting the tension slip on the tuning gear as you play, making the string will go flat. This is especially true with new strings. Worn out or rusty strings will go out of the tune more easily and bedevil your fingers as you're learning. Make sure you change your strings out regularly to keep your instrument in tune. You don't need to change them every night unless you're Tim O'Brien, but consider changing them every 4-6 weeks of moderate to heavy usage. It can be frustrating to tune immediately after putting new strings on the mandolin, because it'll slip out after only a few minutes. After putting new strings on, each string puts lots of pounds per square inch of tension on the neck, and the wood will flex slightly. You need to account for this by getting the strings close and then letting the instrument rest for a second before fine-tuning. You'll get it in tune more quickly and more accurately this way.","completion":"A mandolin, a stringed instrument, is traditionally tuned G-D-A-E, from the lowest to the highest pitch, with each pair of strings having the same tone (G-G-D-D-A-A-E-E). When properly held, the highest string pair, E, should be nearest to the floor. Guitar players can relate to this as the reversed order of the four lowest guitar strings (E-A-D-G). This understanding helps in familiarizing oneself with the finger placements on the instrument. The tuning pegs for the G and D strings are located on the side of the headstock closest to the player, whereas those for the A and E strings are on the opposite side. The tuning process involves following a clockwise pattern, beginning from the top and working downwards to higher pitches. Tuning a mandolin can be challenging due to its eight strings compared to a violin's four, requiring precision to maintain accurate tuning. Isolating each string using \\"rest strokes\\" can help determine which string is out of tune. Generally, it is advisable to tune from a lower pitch to a higher one to maintain the string's tension, preventing potential slippage during play, especially with new strings. Replacing old or worn-out strings regularly (about every 4-6 weeks) ensures optimal tuning and performance. Be prepared for some initial difficulty in tuning when installing new strings, as they tend to slip out of tune due to the tension applied to the neck. To counteract this, get the strings close to their desired pitch, let the instrument rest for a moment, and then fine-tune it. This method results in quicker and more accurate tuning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Group Sex: What is a threesome like?","completion":"No, these questions do not have the same meaning. While both questions ask about group sex experiences, they refer to two distinct types of sexual encounters. Allow me to explain the differences between the two concepts and how they shape the specific meanings of each question. 1. \\"Group Sex: What is it like to have an orgy?\\" An orgy typically refers to a sexual encounter that involves a large number of participants who engage in various sexual activities with each other simultaneously or in turns. It often includes partner swapping, oral or penetrative sex, and other forms of physical intimacy. The term \\"orgy\\" is commonly associated with a more extensive, uninhibited, and potentially anonymous social atmosphere. Asking about the experience of having an orgy likely refers to seeking first-hand information and insights from individuals who have participated in such events. Enquiring about specific feelings, emotions, and physical sensations, as well as the social dynamics or etiquette involved, are crucial components of the question. 2. \\"Group Sex: What is a threesome like?\\" A threesome is a sexual encounter involving three individuals who are simultaneously engaged in physical intimacy with one another. Threesomes can include any gender combination (e.g., two men and one woman, two women and one man, or three people of the same gender), and they often involve various sexual activities, such as oral or penetrative sex and touching or caressing. When asking about the experience of a threesome, the focus is often on the unique configuration and interaction between the three involved individuals. This might entail learning about the dynamic play between partners, feelings of jealousy or possessiveness, communication strategies, or specific suggestions to ensure all participants feel comfortable and satisfied. In summary, although both questions address experiences within the broader context of group sex, they are centered on different types of encounters – orgies and threesomes – which have their own set of unique characteristics, dynamics, and potential implications for those involved. By understanding these distinctions, we can ensure that the intended meaning of each question is accurately conveyed and addressed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Would the answer to the question \\"How many bones are there in the human hand ?\\" be an entity, an abbreviation, a description, a human, a location, or a numeric value?","completion":"The answer to the question \\"How many bones are there in the human hand?\\" would be a numeric value. To provide a detailed and long answer, the human hand is a complex and intricate structure made up of numerous bones, muscles, tendons, and ligaments that work together to perform a variety of tasks such as grasping, holding, and manipulating objects. The human hand can be divided into two main parts: the wrist (carpus) and the hand itself, which includes the fingers (digits) and the metacarpals. In the wrist, there are 8 small bones known as carpal bones, which are organized in two rows, each containing four bones. The proximal row, located closer to the forearm, consists of the scaphoid, lunate, triquetrum, and pisiform bones. The distal row, positioned closer to the fingers, contains the trapezium, trapezoid, capitate, and hamate bones. The carpal bones are important for providing stability to the wrist and allowing for its various movements. The hand itself consists of 5 metacarpals and 14 phalanges. The metacarpal bones, one corresponding to each finger, form the foundation of the palm. Each finger (except the thumb) is made up of three phalanges—proximal, middle, and distal—while the thumb has only two phalanges—proximal and distal. The phalanges are essential for forming functional digits, enabling the hand to grasp and manipulate objects of various sizes and shapes. To summarize, there are a total of 27 bones in the human hand. This breaks down to 8 carpal bones in the wrist, 5 metacarpal bones in the palm, and 14 phalanges in the fingers. This answer is a numeric value, which is 27."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer.

Answer the following question: You are given a new situation: Bobby and Ned are two neighbors who both have medium sized gardens in their backyards. They regularly talk to each other about what they are growing and share gardening tips. Bobby is out working in his garden when Ned comes over to chat. Ned mentions that the garden at his house is currently flooded, but he's not sure why since it didn't rain. He asks him if Bobby's garden experienced the same thing. Bobby replies that his garden is not currently flooded. He does mention that he did see Ned's daughter walking around near Ned's garden carrying a hose turned on to full power. and a hint : Diffusion of carbon dioxide and oxygen is approximately 10,000 times slower in water than in air. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen, becoming hypoxic (an environment with O2 concentration below 2 mg/liter) and eventually completely anoxic where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. Water also influences the intensity and spectral composition of light as it reflects off the water surface and submerged particles. Aquatic plants exhibit a wide variety of morphological and physiological adaptations that allow them to survive, compete, and diversify in these environments. For example, their roots and stems contain large air spaces (aerenchyma) that regulate the efficient transportation of gases (for example, CO2 and O2) used in respiration and photosynthesis. Salt water plants (halophytes) have additional specialized adaptations, such as the development of special organs for shedding salt and osmoregulating their internal salt (NaCl) concentrations, to live in estuarine, brackish, or oceanic environments. Anaerobic soil microorganisms in aquatic environments use nitrate, manganese ions, ferric ions, sulfate, carbon dioxide, and some organic compounds; other microorganisms are facultative anaerobes and use oxygen during respiration when the soil becomes drier. The activity of soil microorganisms and the chemistry of the water reduces the oxidation-reduction potentials of the water. Carbon dioxide, for example, is reduced to methane (CH4) by methanogenic bacteria. The physiology of fish is also specially adapted to compensate for environmental salt levels through osmoregulation. Their gills form electrochemical gradients that mediate salt excretion in salt water and uptake in fresh water. Please answer this question : Who has more anaerobic bacteria in their garden's soil? Answer:","completion":"Based on the information given, Ned's garden is currently flooded while Bobby's garden is not. When soils are flooded, they quickly lose oxygen and become hypoxic, creating an environment where anaerobic bacteria thrive among the roots. As a result, Ned's garden will have more anaerobic bacteria in the soil than Bobby's garden."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

This company is very good at making fun places for people to play a smaller version of football called five-a-side football. Just like its name, five-a-side football is a game played with five players on each team instead of the usual eleven players. For a very long time, 12 years to be exact, Goals Soccer Centres was very successful and made money every year. Making money means that they had more money coming in from people playing football at their centers than they needed to spend on things like taking care of their football courts and paying their helpers. When companies are able to make money like this, it's called a pre-tax profit. But this year, Goals Soccer Centres had a little bit of bad luck. For the first time in 12 years, they did not make enough money to cover their costs. Instead, they lost money. When companies lose money, it means they spend more than they get. This is called a pre-tax loss. So, this year is an unusual year for Goals Soccer Centres because they lost money for the first time in 12 years. It is like winning a game of football for a very long time and then suddenly losing one.

Budget cutbacks at the school jeopardize the continuation of its music program, which would result in its teacher, Marty Streb, being laid off. Concerned for both his colleague and his students, Scott attempts to raise the 48,000 necessary to keep the music program alive. He moonlights as a night instructor for an adult citizenship class, where student Niko asks him for outside tutoring.

Answer the following question: What may be the reason why the television show lacked funding ?","completion":"The reason behind the television show's lack of funding could be attributed to several factors, which can be interrelated or independent of each other. It is essential to note that a well-crafted narrative with great character development and plotlines does not necessarily guarantee a show's sustainability on the airwaves, especially if the target audiences and the revenue-generating activities fall short of ensuring continued production. Each option given could contribute to or hint towards potential reasons for a television show's insufficient funding. a) None of the above choices: This option suggests that there might be other reasons apart from the given options as to why the show lacked funding. It could be because of more complex and nuanced factors, such as the show not fitting into the network's current programming theme, competition with other popular shows, or cancellation due to other shows performing better. b) The actors demanded more money: In some cases, the success of a television show can lead to actors demanding higher salaries, which may put financial constraints on the show's production and limit the available funds for future episodes. If these demands cannot be met, it may cause the show to cease or significantly affect the show's quality and appeal to the audiences. c) There weren't enough viewers: A television show predominantly depends on viewer ratings to sustain its funding and ensure continued production. Advertisers are more prone to invest in those shows that can yield high viewership. If a show fails to attract a large and devoted audience, it may not generate enough revenue from advertisements, leading to a lack of funding. d) Rich people didn't like the show: This option implies that the show might not have appealed to a particular demographic with a disposable income that otherwise could have contributed to the revenue generated from products and partnerships directly related to the show. In other words, even if the show had a considerable audience, the lack of appeal to more affluent viewers who could invest in merchandise, event tickets, or other revenue-generating activities could explain why the show failed to secure enough funding. In conclusion, any single factor or a combination of these factors may have led to the television show's lack of funding. To maintain relevance and viability, a show needs to captivate its target audience, secure revenue streams, and continuously adapt and evolve to keep up with the changing landscape of the entertainment industry, rendering the funding scarcity a multifaceted issue."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Paragraph: Radio Televizioni Shqiptar (RTSH) is the public radio and TV broadcaster of Albania, founded by King Zog in 1938. RTSH runs three analogue television stations as TVSH Televizioni Shqiptar, four digital thematic stations as RTSH, and three radio stations using the name Radio Tirana. In addition, 4 regional radio stations serve in the four extremities of Albania. The international service broadcasts radio programmes in Albanian and seven other languages via medium wave (AM) and short wave (SW). The international service has used the theme from the song \\"Keputa nje gjethe dafine\\" as its signature tune. The international television service via satellite was launched since 1993 and aims at Albanian communities in Kosovo, Serbia, Macedonia, Montenegro and northern Greece, plus the Albanian diaspora in the rest of Europe. RTSH has a past of being heavily influenced by the ruling party in its reporting, whether that party be left or right wing. According to the Albanian Media Authority, AMA, Albania has an estimated 257 media outlets, including 66 radio stations and 67 television stations, with three national, 62 local and more than 50 cable TV stations.

Step 2: Identify the relevant part of the article. In this case, it is the conversation between the grandmother and the person with long hair. The grandmother asks if the person can see the girl under the big tree, and the person corrects her by saying it's their brother, Mike. Step 3: Look at the options given and see which one matches the information from the article. The grandmother assumed the person was a girl based on their physical appearance. Step 4: Justify the answer using the context from the article. The only option that matches the context is A: Because he has long hair. The grandmother's assumption was likely due to the person's long hair, as the article highlights the difficulty in differentiating boys and girls when boys have long hair and wear similar clothing to girls."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The world's fastest woman has been revealed as a British mother-of-two who smashed the land speed record by going 264mph on a motorbike her husband built. IT analyst Becci Ellis set the record on her modified Suzuki bike, smashing the existing fastest land speed by 20mph. Mrs Ellis, from Scunthorpe in Lincolnshire, bought the off-the-shelf bike second hand in 2008 to use as spares but after testing it on a track she realised it had potential to be a record-breaker. Scroll down for video. Becci Ellis, who has been named the fastest woman in the world after breaking the existing land speed record. Mrs Ellis set the record on a modified Suzuki bike, smashing the existing fastest land speed by 20mph. The 46-year-old has been riding motorbikes since she was a youngster and says it give her an adrenalin rush. Her husband Mick has spent the last two years tweaking the 1300cc bike and developing a one-of-a-kind turbo system so his wife can reach break-neck speeds. And his hard work finally paid off when Mrs Ellis blasted down the mile-long course at Elvington airfield in North Yorkshire on her beloved 500bhp Suzuki Hayabusa bike at 264.1mph, destroying American rider Jennifer Robertson's existing record of 243.6mph. The lightning-quick speed is the equivalent of travelling at a 118 metres a second and it took her just over 20 seconds to complete the course. It also makes her the fourth fastest rider in the world, just 30mph behind the overall world record set by the late American rider Bill Warner who died in a crash during the record attempt. The 46-year-old has been riding motorbikes since she was a youngster but it wasn't until she met her husband, who was a motorbike drag racer in the early 1990s that she started racing. Mrs Ellis with her husband Mike, who built the bike she used to break the land speed record in their garage. Mrs Ellis says Mick, pictured had been building the bike's boost system for a number of years to allow her to reach such fast speeds. She started attempting speed records and soon set her sights on becoming the fastest woman in the world on two wheels. She explained: 'I've had a passion for bikes since I was nine years old and I knew that was what was going to help me live my dream. 'I met Mick when I was 25 and working as a bike instructor. He had been drag racing since the 1970s and got me into it. 'I've always had a passion to be the best at something and it became obvious to me that I was going to try to be the fastest woman on two wheels. 'In 2008 I bought a second-hand Suzuki Hayabusa for spares but after testing it on the track I realised it was quick enough to set records on. The second hand Suzuki, with 25,000 miles on the clock, which Mrs Ellis was riding when she broke the record. 'Mick has been building my bike's boost system for a number of years and we're the only people in the world using it. 'The amazing thing is my bike is basically a street bike - I could put lights and indicators on it and it would be road legal. 'The record for a standing mile on a conventional motorcycle ridden by a woman stood at 243.6mph which had been held by an American rider since September last year. 'In June this year I managed 248.5mph and then in August I did 264.1mph. There is no other woman who has ever gone faster than me on a conventional bike. 'It was a dream come true. Mrs Ellis pictured in 1995, left, and 1985, right, said it was always her dream to ride motorcyles. 'I know going that quickly could be dangerous but I don't find it scary at all. I wouldn't get on the bike if I didn't have full confidence in it and the team running it. And now she predicts her new record will stand for years to come - but has vowed to keep trying to go quicker. She added: 'I get up to about 90mph in first gear and then the boost from the turbo kicks in - it's like being shot out of a gun, it's so fast. 'I get an adrenaline rush but there's no nerves. I'm totally focused and I know exactly what I'm doing. 'The feeling is phenomenal. I absolutely love it - I can't get enough. 'Completing the mile only takes just over 20 seconds so everything's over very quickly. It's utterly exhilarating. 'I think my record will stand for some time. 20mph is a big increase - it's the biggest increase in 40 years. 'I'll keep trying to set speed records for as long as I can. I've no intention of stopping any time soon. 'Age is against me but I love it and when I can't do it any longer I'll help someone else to.'

When Alexander the Great died at Babylon in 323 BC, his mother Olympias immediately accused Antipater and his faction of poisoning him, although there is no evidence to confirm this. With no official heir apparent, the Macedonian military command split, with one side proclaiming Alexander's half-brother Philip III Arrhidaeus (r. 323 – 317 BC) as king and the other siding with the infant son of Alexander and Roxana, Alexander IV (r. 323 – 309 BC). Except for the Euboeans and Boeotians, the Greeks also immediately rose up in a rebellion against Antipater known as the Lamian War (323–322 BC). When Antipater was defeated at the 323 BC Battle of Thermopylae, he fled to Lamia where he was besieged by the Athenian commander Leosthenes. A Macedonian army led by Leonnatus rescued Antipater by lifting the siege. Antipater defeated the rebellion, yet his death in 319 BC left a power vacuum wherein the two proclaimed kings of Macedonia became pawns in a power struggle between the diadochi, the former generals of Alexander's army.A council of the army convened in Babylon immediately after Alexander's death, naming Philip III as king and the chiliarch Perdiccas as his regent. Antipater, Antigonus Monophthalmus, Craterus, and Ptolemy formed a coalition against Perdiccas in a civil war initiated by Ptolemy's seizure of the hearse of Alexander the Great. Perdiccas was assassinated in 321 BC by his own officers during a failed campaign in Egypt against Ptolemy, where his march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 of his men. Although Eumenes of Cardia managed to kill Craterus in battle, this had little to no effect on the outcome of the 321 BC Partition of Triparadisus in Syria where the victorious coalition settled the issue of a new regency and territorial rights. Antipater was appointed as regent over the two kings. Before Antipater died in 319 BC, he named the staunch Argead loyalist Polyperchon as his successor, passing over his own son Cassander and ignoring the right of the king to choose a new regent...","completion":"The name of the person whose march along the Nile River resulted in the drowning of 2,000 men is Perdiccas."},{"prompt":"Q: Read the following article and answer the question. Article: In the north of Scotland there is a lake called Loch Ness. It is the biggest lake in Britain. It is over thirty kilometres long and in places nearly 300 meters deep. It is cold and dark and not many people went there until after 1930. Then a road was made around the lake. Holiday makers began to use the road, and this was when the stories began. Someone said that he had seen a monster in the lake. He said it was twelve meters long. It had a long neck and a small head. Then someone else said he had seen it. Others said the same thing and in 1933 a London doctor took a photo. It looked like a monster with a long neck and a thick body but the photo was not dear. The newspapers printed the picture and called it the Loch Ness monster, or \\"Nessie\\". Then the argument began. Some people, however, were certain there was something living in the lake. Others said there was nothing there. In 1961, a lot of people joined together to make a real effort to see and photograph the monster if there was one! Several times people thought they saw something but after ten years there was still no real proof. Later underwater television cameras were used, but no one found any real proof. However, they did find something interesting: a huge underwater cave. It was big enough to be home of a monster, but of course, this was not a proof. In 1975, however, some American scientists formed a search group. They used an underwater camera. It took pictures every seventy seconds. Some of the pictures seemed to show a red-brown creature. Its body was about four meters long and had a very ugly head on the end of a four meter neck. Many people then began to believe in the monster. But even today we can not be certain.

Background: The Incredible String Band (sometimes abbreviated as ISB) were a psychedelic folk band formed by Clive Palmer, Robin Williamson and Mike Heron in Scotland in 1966. The band built a considerable following, especially in the British counterculture, notably with their albums The 5000 Spirits or the Layers of the Onion, The Hangman's Beautiful Daughter, and Wee Tam and the Big Huge. They became pioneers in psychedelic folk and, through integrating a wide variety of traditional music forms and instruments, in the development of world music. Following Palmer's early departure, Williamson and Heron performed as a duo, later augmented by other musicians. Context: In 1963, acoustic musicians Robin Williamson and Clive Palmer began performing together as a traditional folk duo in Edinburgh, particularly at a weekly club run by Archie Fisher in the Crown Bar which also regularly featured Bert Jansch. There they were seen in August 1965 by Joe Boyd, then working as a talent scout for the influential folk-based label Elektra Records. Later in the year, the duo decided to fill out their sound by adding a third member, initially to play rhythm guitar. After an audition, local rock musician Mike Heron won the slot. The trio took the name \\"the Incredible String Band\\". Early in 1966 Palmer began running an all-night folk club, Clive's Incredible Folk Club, on the fourth floor of a building in Sauchiehall Street in Glasgow, where they became the house band. When Boyd returned in his new role as head of Elektra's London office, he signed them up for an album, beating off a rival bid from Transatlantic Records. They recorded their first album, entitled The Incredible String Band, at the Sound Techniques studio in London in May 1966. It was released in Britain and the United States and consisted mostly of self-penned material in solo, duo and trio formats, showcasing their playing on a variety of instruments. It won the title of \\"Folk Album of the Year\\" in Melody Maker's annual poll, and in a 1968 Sing Out! magazine interview Bob Dylan praised the album's \\"October Song\\" as one of his favourite songs of that period, stating it was \\"quite good\\". The trio broke up after recording the album. Palmer left via the hippie trail for Afghanistan and India, and Williamson and his girlfriend Licorice McKechnie went to Morocco with no firm plans to return. Heron stayed in Edinburgh, playing with a band called Rock Bottom and the Deadbeats. However, when Williamson returned after running out of money, laden with Moroccan instruments (including a gimbri, which was much later eaten by rats), he and Heron reformed the band as a duo. Question: Where did they play?.

Their number is less than 1,000 in the wild. The hunting of pandas has been banned for many years, so this is not the problem. Destruction of its habitat, when areas are cleared for growing crops, is one of the main reasons for panda's decline . Another reason is that the bamboo on which they mainly feed, is dying back. The pandas find it difficult to move to new feeding areas. As the bamboo disappears, the pandas simply starve to death. Bamboo is a poor source of food, and pandas have to eat up 45kg of it every day, a process that takes them up to 16 hours. The process goes on day and night, with the pandas in a constant cycle of eating for eight hours and sleeping for four. They can eat other foods, but will rather starve than change their diet when bamboo is scarce. Giant pandas are very good climbers, and use this skill to escape from the enemy. The giant panda lives alone for most of its life, only coming together with another of its species for long enough to mate. A newborn panda baby is born hairless and blind, is about 15cm long and weighs only 100g. The baby will stay with its mother for about 18 months, until it is able to set up its own territory Chinese and American scientists are studying giant pandas and their habits in order to put in place a major conservation programme. Zoos around the world are taking part in panda breeding programmes. There is still hope that with human's help, the giant panda can survive in the wild. Question: How much bamboo does a panda eat every year? Yes or no, is the answer \\"Nearly 2 tons\\"?

Help as much as you can. Q:At an early meeting of the British Sociological Association’s “Activism in Sociology Forum” members met to discuss how we might play a more campaigning role in the world outside the academy. Pragmatically, academics tend to work long hours. We are faced with multiple and competing demands: teaching, administration, publishing, marketing, research, grant-bidding, and so on. The REF has ramped up the requirement to demonstrate the efficacy of our research in “the real world” (our impact upon society, economy, and culture rather than upon knowledge per se, or upon the academic discipline). Maybe here – I suggested, as my contribution to the meeting – was a chance for those of us interested in progressing social justice to lever officially sanctioned space, in our busy day-to-day lives, to do more of this sort of work? Maybe we should welcome the REF impact agenda? I learned afterwards that eminent British sociologists, whom I respect enormously, regarded such a viewpoint as “naïve” and “embarrassing”. Indeed, critics interpret REF as just one mode of the heightened, neoliberal, managerial control that is degrading academic life and infesting universities. So, how should we think about the REF impact agenda? Because of its obvious connections with social improvement and reform through policy action, social policy is regarded as one disciplinary area that is well-placed to meet and benefit from the impact agenda. Yet there has been surprisingly little concerted discussion amongst scholars about REF and impact. This is despite the fact that many millions of pounds of public funding accrue to the proposed or claimed impact of research (with monies channelled through research councils to individual projects or via regular, six-yearly centralised assessments of the quality of research in university departments). In addition, there is substantial funding directed toward the “impact industry”; the consultants, think tanks, PR firms, funding schemes, new software programmes, impact managers, specialist impact case study...

He loved the brightness, different sizes and shapes, and the way they could help him navigate darkness. This fascination began when he was a child, frequently joining his father on camping trips, learning firsthand the importance of a good flashlight. When James grew older, he began collecting various flashlights and came across a thriving online community of flashlight enthusiasts. One day, he stumbled upon an amazing deal on a peculiar online shopping website. The site offered a package of 30 high-end flashlights at just a fraction of their usual cost. Excited by this discovery, he ordered one set without a moment's hesitation. Step 1: Order the set of flashlights online. Feeling proud of his decision, James shared the news with his flashlight aficionado friends. They couldn't believe what they were hearing and asked James if he could order a set for them too. As more friends heard about the deal, the number of requests grew, and so, with the intention of spreading joy among his friends, James agreed to order those sets. Step 2: Order additional sets of flashlights on behalf of friends. While James awaited his shipment, he continued researching the flashlights online. He discovered various modifications, accessories, and upgrades that could enhance his soon-to-arrive flashlights. As his excitement grew, he spent nights imaging all the possibilities for his new high-end collection. Step 3: Research more about flashlights and possible customizations. The day the package arrived, James was ecstatic. But when he opened the box, he was perplexed. Inside were not 30 flashlights but 30 sets of flashlights – each containing 30 flashlights within. It seemed that he had misunderstood the initial listing. He checked his order history and realized his mistake in ordering quantity had caused him to receive 900 flashlights! Step 4: Receive the package and recognize it contains many more flashlights than anticipated. James immediately shared the news with his friends and spent hours trying to figure out how to fix the situation. He began trying to contact the website's customer service; however, he received no response. Additionally, he found out that there would be a hefty fee to return the package. Step 5: Attempt to contact customer service and find a solution. Frustrated with the situation, James decided to keep the 900 flashlights. He distributed the sets he purchased for his friends, but still, he was left with a considerable amount of flashlights. His room, garage, and even his living room were filled with flashlights of all sizes and colors. Step 6: Distribute flashlights to friends and store the remaining ones. As time passed, James learned to deal with his enormous flashlight collection. He would gift some to family members for birthdays or special occasions, but the majority remained in his home. He realized that although he still loved flashlights, the overwhelming number of them seemed to weigh on him. Whenever friends would visit and ask about his flashlight collection, he'd give a half-hearted laugh and, with a hint of embarrassment, say, \\"My house is now full of flashlights I don't know what to do with.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article based on this summary: Cambridge United forwards Uche Ikpeazu and Adam McGurk have been ruled out for the rest of the League Two season. Article:","completion":"Title: Cambridge United's Forwards Ikpeazu and McGurk Sidelined for the Rest of League Two Season Cambridge United's promising season has hit an unfortunate speed bump, as forwards Uche Ikpeazu and Adam McGurk have been ruled out for the remainder of the League Two campaign due to injuries. This sudden development has dealt a significant blow to the team's attacking arsenal and will no doubt impact their chances in the fight for promotion. The 26-year-old Nigerian striker, Uche Ikpeazu, has been a driving force for the U's this season, scoring impressive goals and providing key assists. He joined the club in 2016 from Watford and has since more than proved his worth, helping the club cement their position in League Two and pushing towards promotion. His strong physical presence and commanding nature on the field will be sorely missed by the team. On the other hand, Northern Ireland international, Adam McGurk, has been a consistently reliable partner to Ikpeazu, with the two often forming a formidable striking partnership in the final third. His experience has been vital in elevating Cambridge United's performance this season. McGurk's injury will deprive the team of an important goal-scoring option, complicating manager Mark Bonner's plans in the remaining fixtures. Details about their injuries have not been fully disclosed, but reports suggest that both players suffered setbacks during the team's recent training sessions. While they are expected to make full recoveries, any hopes of a return this season have been ruled out. The club issued a statement expressing their disappointment but also their commitment to providing the necessary support and treatment for their swift recovery. With the notable absences of Ikpeazu and McGurk, manager Mark Bonner will have a significant challenge on his hands when reshaping the team's attacking structure. He will need to tap into the remaining squad's resources and consider alternate options in order to maintain a competitive edge in the race for promotion. Several players may rise to the occasion in the remainder of the season, as the team collectively pushes towards achieving their ultimate goal of moving up to League One. The likes of Paul Digby, Wes Hoolahan, and Hiram Boateng could become even more influential figures within the squad, while younger talents such as Joe Ironside and Shilow Tracey must seize the opportunity to showcase their abilities in the absence of the injured forwards. Cambridge United fans will have a keen eye on upcoming matches, particularly on how their team adapts to the loss of key players. There is a sense of increased urgency to secure results in the remaining fixtures, as the fight for promotion heats up in the closing stages of the League Two season. Undoubtedly, this development not only tests the team's resilience but also reveals the true depth and potential of the entire Cambridge United squad. In conclusion, though this is an undeniably tough blow to Cambridge United's season, it is also an opportunity for other players to step up and make their mark. As the team navigates this challenging situation, success can still be achieved if the squad comes together and finds the determination to make a strong push for the final stretch of the League Two campaign. The resilience and adaptability displayed by the team in the face of adversity will be crucial in determining their ultimate fate this season."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This is some data: Loch Fyne food Fast food; Loch Fyne customer rating low; Loch Fyne area city centre; Loch Fyne near The Rice Boat. Generate a detailed description of this data","completion":"The given data provides a snapshot of some pertinent information about a dining establishment named Loch Fyne, known to serve food options under the category of 'Fast food.' The various data points highlighted include customer rating, area, and proximity to another restaurant named The Rice Boat. Let's take a closer look at each of these components in detail. 1. Food: Loch Fyne is primarily a fast-food establishment. If you are looking for a quick bite to eat, this may be an ideal place to indulge in. Fast food generally refers to dishes that can be prepared and delivered to customers rapidly. This may include a range of options such as sandwiches, fried foods, and grab-and-go snacks. Loch Fyne would cater to this segment of the food market, providing options for those patrons who are time-strapped and looking to refuel on the go. 2. Customer Rating: The customer rating for Loch Fyne has been specified as 'low.' This indicates that the patrons who have dined at the establishment have rated it poorly on various factors, including food quality, ambience, and service. A low rating would suggest that Loch Fyne may not be meeting the expectations of its clientele, leading to dissatisfaction and possibly fewer repeat customers. 3. Area: The data states that Loch Fyne is located in the city centre. This gives it potential advantages, such as easy access to public transportation and proximity to other key businesses and attractions. Customers who are looking for a meal to-go or a place to eat while they are in the heart of town might find Loch Fyne a conveniently accessible option. However, it is important to note that the city centre is often a densely populated and competitive location for eateries. So, Loch Fyne needs to provide impressive food and quality service to stand out from other establishments in the vicinity. 4. Proximity to The Rice Boat: The data highlights that Loch Fyne is situated near The Rice Boat, which may be a well-known or relevant dining option. The proximity to The Rice Boat could have an impact on Loch Fyne's business, as it introduces an element of competition between the two establishments. Situating Loch Fyne nearby could be an advantage in terms of attracting foot traffic to both restaurants from those looking for various cuisines. Alternatively, the competition could prove challenging if The Rice Boat has a comparably higher customer rating than Loch Fyne and effectively draws patrons away from the latter, especially given Loch Fyne's low customer rating. Overall, this data paints a picture of an easily accessible fast-food establishment named Loch Fyne, offering quick meals at the city centre but struggling to satisfy its customers in terms of food quality and service. The establishment's location near another restaurant, The Rice Boat, further adds an element of competition and could be a challenging factor for its performance."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Second question: If athletes keep getting better why has no one matched Bruce Lee? Are these two questions asking the same thing? Select from: -- no; -- yes;","completion":"First question: How does one get a body like Bruce Lee, lean and muscular? Achieving a body like Bruce Lee requires a combination of factors, including diet, exercise, and an unwavering commitment to your fitness goals. The following steps can guide you in attaining that desirable lean and muscular physique: 1. Set realistic goals: Have a clear understanding of what you want to achieve and by when. Consider your current fitness level and design achievable short-term goals that lead to your long-term objectives. 2. Maintain a balanced diet: Adopt a balanced diet rich in proteins, vitamins, minerals, and healthy fats. Stick to whole foods and avoid processed and sugary products. Protein sources like lean meats, fish, and legumes aid muscle growth, while fruits and vegetables provide essential nutrients for overall health. 3. Focus on functional exercises: Engage in a mix of strength training, cardiovascular activities, and stretching. Bruce Lee was known for his functional fitness, focusing on exercises that enhance natural body movements and muscles used in daily life. This includes calisthenics, bodyweight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups, and functional training that improves balance, coordination, and flexibility. 4. Customize your workout routine: Incorporate exercises that work on all muscle groups, aiming for a total-body approach. Vary your routine to avoid boredom and to continually challenge your muscles. Bruce Lee practiced various forms of martial arts, which contributed to his overall fitness. 5. Recovery and rest: Allow your muscles to recover by scheduling rest days and having a proper sleep routine. This is essential for muscle growth, repair, and preventing injuries. 6. Implement progressive overload: Gradually increase the intensity, duration, or frequency of your workouts. This progressive challenge helps you build muscle and strength while avoiding plateaus. 7. Stay consistent and disciplined: Remaining focused and consistent with your routine helps in achieving fitness goals and maintaining them. Bruce Lee was known for his incredible discipline and dedication to his training regimen. Second question: If athletes keep getting better, why has no one matched Bruce Lee? While it's true that athletes continue to improve in terms of speed, strength, and skill, Bruce Lee's unmatched status can be attributed to multiple factors: 1. Multidisciplinary approach: Lee didn't specialize in just one martial art. He developed his unique style known as Jeet Kune Do, which combines elements from different martial arts disciplines. This approach allowed him to become proficient in various techniques and movements, making him a versatile martial artist. 2. Physical conditioning: Bruce Lee was known for his supreme fitness levels, which enabled him to perform incredible feats of strength, agility, and speed. His lean physique and muscular endurance were results of his rigorous training regimen, which he followed religiously. 3. Mental strength and discipline: Aside from physical prowess, Bruce Lee possessed exceptional mental fortitude and self-discipline that contributed to his unmatched status. His mental focus, dedication, and ability to adapt to different situations made him formidable. 4. Role model and cultural icon: Lee's impact on popular culture transcends sports. As an Asian-American actor and martial artist, he broke barriers in Hollywood and inspired generations of fans globally. This, combined with his exceptional skills, elevated him to iconic status. 5. Time and context: Bruce Lee lived in a specific era, where his accomplishments and impact were unique to those times. Comparing athletes across different time periods can be challenging as the context of their achievements may differ.

One of the most dramatic changes in priorities proposed by the City Council would shift 25.6 million from funding for court-appointed lawyers to the Legal Aid Society. In a document released yesterday to justify its reordered priorities, the Council contended that Legal Aid can achieve greater economies of scale than lawyers appointed pursuant to Article 18-B of the County Law. The Council document also noted that \\"inexplicably\\" 18-B lawyers are handling 50 percent of the indigent criminal cases in New York City, even though their mandate is to handle only multi-defendant cases where the Legal Aid Society had a conflict. In past years, the City Council had consistently added 5.6 million to the 54.7 million proposed for the Legal Aid Society by former Mayor Giuliani, bringing the total to just a shade over 60 million. But this year for the first time, the Council is proposing shifting more than 20 million in funds earmarked by the Mayor for 18-B lawyers to the Legal Aid Society, which would increase its total funding to 80.4 million. That would reflect a jump in its current finding of about one-third. Meantime, the City Council proposed slashing the Mayor's allocation of 62.8 million for 18-B lawyers by 66 percent, to 21.4 million.

Answer:","completion":"Recycling is an essential practice in reducing our reliance on landfills and easing the strain on our planet's finite resources. Among the answer choices provided, the statement that recycling \\"reduces negative impacts\\" best captures the overall effect of recycling on our environment. To understand the significance of recycling in protecting and preserving the environment, it is important to highlight some of the major environmental benefits that recycling provides: 1. Conservation of natural resources: Recycling helps in reducing the demand for raw materials, leading to a decrease in resource depletion. As a result, essential natural resources such as water, trees, and minerals are conserved. 2. Reduced energy consumption: The process of recycling materials like aluminum, plastic, and paper involves less energy as opposed to extracting and processing these materials from their raw form. Lower energy consumption translates to reduced greenhouse gas emissions, contributing to a healthier environment. 3. Reduction in pollution: Recycling minimizes the release of pollutants from landfills and incinerators, where harmful chemicals from waste can seep into soil and groundwater or be released into the air. Moreover, recycling saves energy, which, in turn, results in decreased emissions of air pollutants produced by burning fossil fuels. 4. Lowering of waste in landfills: The more waste recycled, the less that ends up in landfills or incinerators. This reduces the risk of soil and water contamination and prevents the emission of greenhouse gases like methane, which is produced when organic waste decomposes in landfills. 5. Diminished deforestation: By recycling and reusing paper and wood products, the demand for virgin materials is decreased, and this helps in reducing deforestation rates. This conserves essential ecosystems and habitats and contributes to a healthier global climate. 6. Reduced mining: Mining of metals like aluminum and copper not only consumes large amounts of energy but also damages the environment through process waste, emissions, and land degradation. Recycling these metals can substantially lessen the need for such environmentally harmful activities. Thus, it is evident that recycling plays a vital role in reducing the environmental impacts of waste, pollution, and resource consumption. It is our collective responsibility to recycle as much as possible to help protect and preserve the environment for future generations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Information: - The House of Wettin is a dynasty of German counts, dukes, prince-electors and kings that once ruled territories in the present-day German states of Saxony and Thuringia. The dynasty is one of the oldest in Europe, and its origins can be traced back to the town of Wettin, Saxony-Anhalt. The Wettins gradually rose to power within the Holy Roman Empire. Members of the family became the rulers of several medieval states, starting with the Saxon Eastern March in 1030. Other states they gained were Meissen in 1089, Thuringia in 1263, and Saxony in 1423. - The Elbe (; Low German: \\"Elv\\") is one of the major rivers of Central Europe. It rises in the Krkonoše Mountains of the northern Czech Republic before traversing much of Bohemia (Czech Republic), then Germany and flowing into the North Sea at Cuxhaven, northwest of Hamburg. Its total length is . - Wettin is a small town and a former municipality in the Saalekreis district of Saxony-Anhalt, Germany, situated on the River Saale north of Halle. Since 1 January 2011, it is part of the town Löbejün-Wettin. It is known for Wettin Castle, the ancestral seat of the House of Wettin, ruling dynasty of Saxony and Poland. Wettin sights include the Tower of Bismarck, the town hall, and the castle (used as the Burggymnasium). - Dresden is the capital city and after Leipzig the second-largest city of the Free State of Saxony in Germany. It is situated in a valley on the River Elbe, near the border with the Czech Republic. - A duke (male) (British English: or American English: ) or duchess (female) can either be a monarch ruling over a duchy or a member of the nobility, historically of highest rank below the monarch. The title comes from French \\"duc\\", itself from the Latin \\"dux\\", 'leader', a term used in republican Rome to refer to a military commander without an official rank (particularly one of Germanic or Celtic origin), and later coming to mean the leading military commander of a province. - The Free State of Thuringia is a federal state in central Germany.

The term \\"eastern march\\" or \\"ostmark\\" comes from the Latin term \\"marchia Orientalis\\" and originally could refer to either a march created on the eastern frontier of the Duchy of Saxony or another on the eastern border of the Duchy of Bavaria: the Bavarian Eastern March, corresponding to later Austria. - The Holy Roman Empire was a multi-ethnic complex of territories in central Europe that developed during the Early Middle Ages and continued until its dissolution in 1806. The largest territory of the empire after 962 was the Kingdom of Germany, though it also came to include the Kingdom of Bohemia, the Kingdom of Burgundy, the Kingdom of Italy, and numerous other territories. - Meissen porcelain or Meissen china is the first European hard-paste porcelain. It was developed starting in 1708 by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus. After his death that October, Johann Friedrich Böttger continued von Tschirnhaus's work and brought porcelain to the market. The production of porcelain at Meissen, near Dresden, started in 1710 and attracted artists and artisans to establish one of the most famous porcelain manufacturers, still in business today as \\"Staatliche Porzellan-Manufaktur Meissen GmbH\\". Its signature logo, the crossed swords, was introduced in 1720 to protect its production; the mark of the crossed swords is one of the oldest trademarks in existence. It dominated the style of European porcelain until 1756. - Count (male) or countess (female) is a title in European countries for a noble of varying status, but historically deemed to convey an approximate rank intermediate between the highest and lowest titles of nobility. The word \\"count\\" came into English from the French \\"comte\\", itself from Latin \\"comes\\"in its accusative \\"comitem\\"meaning companion, and later companion of the emperor, delegate of the emperor. The adjective form of the word is \\"\\". The British and Irish equivalent is an earl (whose wife is a \\"countess\\", for lack of an English term).

Its capital is Dresden, and its largest city is Leipzig. - The Albrechtsburg is a Late Gothic castle that dominates the town centre of Meissen in the German state of Saxony. It stands on a hill above the river Elbe, adjacent to the Meissen Cathedral. - Meissen (in German orthography: \\"Meißen\\") is a town of approximately 30,000 about northwest of Dresden on both banks of the Elbe river in the Free State of Saxony, in eastern Germany. Meissen is the home of Meissen porcelain, the Albrechtsburg castle, the Gothic Meissen Cathedral and the Meissen Frauenkirche. The \\"Große Kreisstadt\\" is the capital of the Meissen district. - The Saale, also known as the Saxon Saale and Thuringian Saale, is a river in Germany and a left-bank tributary of the Elbe.

I do nt have a problem with it becuz I know the person who did it , had some serious mental problem and that he was a product of his life . Answer the following question: Why is the writer able to let go of what happened to her ?","completion":"The writer is able to let go of what happened to her due to several factors that contribute to her perspective on the situation and her resilience. Here are some key reasons that may have helped her come to terms with the abuse and cope with it: 1. Understanding the perpetrator's background: The writer acknowledges that the person who abused her had \\"serious mental problems\\" and was a product of their own life experiences. By recognizing the factors that potentially influenced the abuser's behavior, she seems to have developed a level of empathy or understanding towards the person, which can help in processing the emotional impact of the abuse. 2. Separating self-worth from abuse: The writer does not indicate any feelings of self-blame or guilt, which often accompany traumatic experiences like abuse. By not internalizing the abuse as something that is a result of their own actions or choices, they have maintained a sense of self-worth that is independent of the abuse, allowing them to let go of the emotional baggage associated with it. 3. Acceptance: It appears that the writer has reached a point of acceptance of the situation that happened in her past. By accepting the reality of the abuse and not being in denial about it, they have taken an essential step in healing from the experience. Accepting the past does not mean it is justified or condoned; rather, it is acknowledging the reality of that experience in order to move forward. 4. Resilience: Individuals respond differently to traumatic experiences, with some being more resilient than others. The writer's apparent ability to let go of the abuse could be a result of innate resilience or coping mechanisms they have developed over time to manage stress and negative emotions. Resilience can also be fostered through supportive social networks, effective problem-solving skills, and a positive outlook on life. 5. Time and healing: The writer talks about the abuse happening when they were five years old, implying that a significant amount of time has elapsed since the incident. Time can often play an important role in the healing process, giving the person space to process the trauma, develop coping mechanisms, and emerge stronger. 6. Seeking support: While it's not explicitly stated, the writer's openness to discussing their experience and seeking others' perspectives and experiences may indicate that they have sought or received support from friends, family, or professionals. This support can play a pivotal role in coping with trauma and moving forward in a healthier way.

Directed by Frank Darabont, this timeless classic takes the audience on a journey through the dark corridors of a prison system that, against all odds, blooms with the light of friendship, perseverance, and redemption. Based on Stephen King's novella, the film follows the story of Andy Dufresne (Tim Robbins), a banker who is falsely convicted of two murders and sentenced to life imprisonment at Shawshank State Penitentiary. There, he meets Red (Morgan Freeman), a longtime inmate and skilled contraband smuggler. Over the course of two decades, they forge an unbreakable bond amidst the harsh realities of prison life. Tim Robbins and Morgan Freeman give powerful performances that invoke a wide range of emotions, leaving the viewer completely invested in their journey. Each supporting character is skillfully played, adding depth and richness to the story. The cinematography masterfully captures the bleakness of the prison environment, contrasting it with the stunning beauty of the outside world—a visual representation of the ongoing struggle between despair and hope. The film's carefully crafted plot unravels with deliberate pacing, effectively building suspense and curiosity until the exhilarating, jaw-dropping conclusion that leaves viewers in awe. Thomas Newman's evocative score complements the narrative by infusing the film with a haunting yet uplifting atmosphere. Despite its somber setting, The Shawshank Redemption is brimming with positive messages about the power of friendship, the importance of staying true to oneself, and the ultimate redemption achievable through unwavering hope. This masterful film earns every accolade it has received, including seven Academy Award nominations, and rightfully claims its place as one of the greatest movies of all time. In summary, The Shawshank Redemption is an emotionally stirring and unforgettable film that explores the depths of human spirit, making it a must-watch cinematic experience for audiences of all ages."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Problem:Playing in their second game of the season, the Cincinnati Bengals had a lot of things go wrong. Playing Ohio state rivals Cleveland Browns, the defense looked the exact opposite as they did in week one. Browns quarterback Derek Anderson started and threw for 328 yards and five touchdowns. It was only the third time in NFL history that two quarterbacks had thrown at least five touchdown passes in the same game. Jamal Lewis had 215 yards rushing with one touchdown and the Browns had two receivers with over 100 yards, Braylon Edwards and Kellen Winslow. The Bengals offense tried their best to keep the team in the game, however, as Carson Palmer threw for 6 TD's and Chad Johnson caught for 209 yards. The game started out slowly in the first quarter but the second quarter saw a combined 35 points scored. It was close in the end, when the Bengals started a drive with under one minute left. They managed to get the ball to the 50-yard line when Carson Palmer was intercepted by Leigh Bodden on an intended pass for Chad Johnson. This game ended up being the eighth highest scoring game in NFL history, but not the highest scoring game between these two teams. In 2004, the Bengals beat the Browns 58-48 for the second-most combined points. The Redskins (72) and Giants (41) combined for 113 points in 1966 for the most.

One weekend all of the hotels were full because of a large business meeting being held in the city. On Sunday night, three men came into Mr. Black's hotel and asked for rooms. Mr. Black told them that there were no more rooms available. The men didn't know what to do because they had no place to stay in. Mr. Black wanted to help them. He remembered that there was an empty room at the far end of the first floor -- Room 112. It was a very small room, and had rarely been used as a guest room before. So, he asked the three men if they would mind sharing that small room. They replied that they would be very satisfied so long as there was a room for them to stay in for the night. Mr. Black then told them that the room would cost them 30 in total. On hearing this, each of the three men gave Mr. Black 10 before they left for their room. However, Mr. Black soon began to think that 30 was really too much for that small room. He called his assistant over and said, \\"Here is 5. Give it back to the three men in Room 112. Each of them paid me 10. That's too much.\\" The assistant took the money. While he was on the way to that small room, he thought, \\"How can three men divide 5?

We have the equation: 604 * g - 8288 = 86 * g First, let's try to get all the g's together. We can do that by moving the 86 * g from the right side to the left side of the equation. When we move it, we have to change its sign to the opposite, so it becomes -86 * g. Now, the equation looks like this: 604 * g - 86 * g - 8288 = 0 Next, let's combine the g's. So, when we have 604 * g - 86 * g, that's like having 604 apples minus 86 apples which gives us 518 apples. Similarly, it gives us 518 * g: 518 * g - 8288 = 0 Now, we want to find the value of g. To do that, let's move 8288 to the other side of the equation. When we move it, we have to change its sign to the opposite, making it positive 8288: 518 * g = 8288 Almost there! Now we just need to divide both sides of the equation by 518 to find g: g = 8288 ÷ 518 Finally, when we do the division, we find that g equals 16: g = 16 So, g in our equation is 16!

Question: New York: When the first plane struck 1 World Trade Center at 8:48 am on Tuesday, the people in 2 World Trade Center who saw the instant damage to the other tower realized clearly what they, too, must do: get out fast. Katherine Ilachinsiki, who had been knocked off her chair by the blast of heat exploding from the neighboring tower, was one of those. Despite her 70 years of age, Mrs Ilachinsiki, an architect working on the 91 floor of 2 World Trade Center, the south tower, went for the stairs. Twelve floors above her, Judy Wein, an executive , cried sharply and set off too. But others up and down the 110 floors, many without seeing the damage across the way and thus unclear about what was happening, were not so sure. And the 18 minutes before the next plane would hit were ticking off. Most people had no idea about what was the best thing to do, formal announcements inside the south tower asked people to , assuring them that the building was sound and the threat was limited to the other tower. Some left, others stayed. Some began to climb down and, when met with more announcements and other cautions to stop or return, went back up. The decisions made in those instants proved to be of great importance, because many who chose to stay were killed completely when the second plane crashed into the south tower. One of those caught in indecision was the executive at Fuji Bank USA. Richard Jacobs of Fuji Bank left the 79 floor with the other office workers, but on the 48 floor they heard the announcement that the situation was under control. Several got in the lifts and went back up, two minutes or so before the plane crashed into their floor. \\"I just don't know what happened to them,\\" Mr Jacobs said.

So, we should get rid of the \\"+32\\" by subtracting 32 from both sides of the equation: 8 * m = -32 We're almost there!

One of the most popular professional soccer teams recently played a game in an empty stadium that can seat more than100,000 people. It's swine flu that has made life in Mexico City grind to a halt . Seemingly out of nowhere, swine flu has caused confirmed deaths in 12 countries as of April 30. It has sent a wave of alarm around the world. Governments are trying to find ways to prevent further out-breaks. The World Health Organization has raised its swine flu global threat level to five out of six. People may be familiar with bird flu, but they know little about swine flu. Swine flu is a contagious respiratory disease in pigs. It is caused by a type-A influenza virus. Humans can also catch swine flu. The virus causes regular outbreaks in pigs, but people usually do not catch it. However, there have been cases of the virus spreading to people, and then from one person to another. The symptoms of swine flu are similar to the common flu. They include fever, lethargy , lack of appetite, coughing, runny nose, sore throat, nausea , and vomiting . The high proportion of young adults among the deaths is one of several mysteries about this virus. Most of the dead had lung damage. What caused it is not yet known. The virus spreads the same way the common flu does. When an infected person coughs or sneezes around another person, the latter is put at risk. People can get the disease by touching something with the flu virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose or eyes. There are medicines to treat swine flu. Doctors suggest using anti - viral drugs. They keep the virus from reproducing inside the body. Although there are no vaccines for it now, several everyday steps can help prevent the spread of the virus: washing hands frequently; avoiding close contact with people who are sick; and avoiding touching surfaces that might have the virus on it. People may worry that they will get swine flu from eating or preparing pork. In fact,...

Now, let me explain why, kiddo. You see, a paraphrase is like wearing different clothes - the person (or idea) is still the same, but it looks a bit different. Now, in these two sentences, the main idea is different. The first one says that the person was representing Koonung first and then the Eastern Metropolitan Region till 2006. The second one says that they represented the Eastern Metropolitan Region till 2006 and then they've been representing Koonung ever since.

Epigenetics is the study of mitotically and/or meiotically heritable changes in gene function that cannot be explained by changes in the underlying DNA sequence but cause the organism's genes to behave (or \\"express themselves\\") differently. One example of epigenetic change is the marking of the genes by DNA methylation which determines whether they will be expressed or not. Gene expression can also be controlled by repressor proteins that attach to silencer regions of the DNA and prevent that region of the DNA code from being expressed. Epigenetic marks may be added or removed from the DNA during programmed stages of development of the plant, and are responsible, for example, for the differences between anthers, petals and normal leaves, despite the fact that they all have the same underlying genetic code. Epigenetic changes may be temporary or may remain through successive cell divisions for the remainder of the cell's life. Some epigenetic changes have been shown to be heritable, while others are reset in the germ cells.

Anaheim, California (CNN) -- Disney's Cars Land opens June 15 at Disney California Adventure, and it's big, bold and amazing. As Mater says, \\"If I'm lying, I'm crying.\\" Kids of all ages will rev their engines and step on the gas. Cars Land is the capstone of a five year, estimated 1.1 billion dollar reimagining of Disney California Adventure. While Cars Land shifts California Adventure into the fast lane, only time will tell if it will save the town (as Lightning McQueen did for Radiator Springs) and turn Disneyland into the world-class destination it aspires to be. No doubt the top dogs at Disney hope the renewed focus on movie magic will mean magic for the resort that executives have admitted is not up to brand standards. Soon you enter a nighttime section, where you'll find old friends from Radiator Springs and have adventures including tractor tipping with","completion":"Mater, racing with Lightning McQueen, and cruising along the iconic Route 66. Radiator Springs is brought to life with dazzling neon lights and familiar landmarks such as Flo's V8 Café, Luigi's Casa Della Tires, and Ramone's House of Body Art. The attention to detail in recreating the heart and soul of the beloved movie franchise is truly breathtaking, and it's evident that Disney's Imagineers have poured every ounce of their creativity into making Cars Land a truly immersive experience. In addition to the park's eye-popping visuals, there are three new attractions in Cars Land that are sure to rev up the excitement for visitors. The first is Luigi's Rollickin' Roadsters, a family-friendly ride where guests can hop into fun Italian roadsters and dance along to catchy tunes as they swerve and spin around a charming piazza. Next is Mater's Junkyard Jamboree, a whirling, twirling ride set to the tune of Mater's favorite songs, where riders sitting in adorable tractors are towed by Mater himself as they perform a cute choreographed dance. The crown jewel of Cars Land, however, is Radiator Springs Racers, an innovative and thrilling attraction that combines the best of dark rides, immersive storytelling, and fast-paced racing. Guests join Lightning McQueen and his friends in a high-speed race through the picturesque landscape of Ornament Valley, skillfully dodging obstacles and navigating sharp turns along the way. The stunning attention to detail, convincing animatronics of the beloved characters, and exhilarating speeds make Radiator Springs Racers an instant classic. Of course, after all the fun and thrills, visitors will find themselves famished, and Cars Land has this covered with a variety of dining options. Whether you crave some comfort food at Flo's V8 Café, a satisfying snack at the Cozy Cone Motel, or something lighter at Fillmore's Taste-In, the eateries are bound to keep everyone's engines running.

With Cars Land, Disney has transformed a once-underwhelming park into a go-to destination, showcasing the power of stories and characters that can captivate the hearts of its audience. While it remains to be seen whether Cars Land alone will transform Disneyland Resort into the world-class destination it aspires to be, it surely sets the stage for Disney to continue redefining and evolving the theme park experience. For now, Cars Land has sped Disney's California Adventure into the fast lane, and guests are in for a ride filled with magic, camaraderie, and unforgettable memories."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Each soy vanilla latte starts with a double shot of espresso, which requires 3¾ tablespoons (20 g) of coffee. Measure 3¾ heaping tablespoons of beans to get the right amount of grounds. (a). Transfer the beans to a grinder and pulse until the beans have been finely ground. Finely ground coffee beans are slightly smaller than table salt. (b). The espresso grounds should be near the top of the pot, but the bottoms should be below the rim of the pot. Use a sharp coffee grinder to grind the beans until they turn into thick powder. (c). Then pour the coffee grounds into a disposable coffee filter and set the machine to a medium low setting. It's best to use the same machine that you used for the soy spring punch because the coffee filter will slow down the process and transfer the desired amount of grounds. (d).

They give creators more power to moderate and block comments, and add new sorting mechanisms to ensure that better, more relevant discussions appear at the top. The new system restored the ability to include URLs in comments, which had previously been removed due to problems with abuse.

To mix concrete at home, you need to follow these simple steps: 1. Gather your materials: You will need cement, sand, gravel (also called aggregate), water, a bucket or wheelbarrow, a shovel, and a stick or tool for stirring. 2. Measure the ingredients: The basic ratio for making concrete is 1 part cement, 2 parts sand, and 3 parts gravel. You can use a smaller container like a cup to measure equal parts of each material. For example, use 1 cup of cement, 2 cups of sand, and 3 cups of gravel. 3. Mix the dry ingredients: In your bucket or wheelbarrow, mix together the cement, sand, and gravel using the shovel. Make sure you mix it well, so all the ingredients are evenly combined. 4. Add water: Slowly pour water into the dry mixture while stirring with your stick or tool. You don't want the concrete too wet or too dry. It should be like a thick mud that holds its shape when you squeeze it in your hand. 5. Keep stirring: Keep stirring the mixture until everything is well combined, and there are no dry spots or puddles of water. Now you've made concrete at home! Remember, when using concrete, it's important to work quickly because it starts to harden in about 30 minutes. If you have help from a grown-up, they can help you pour the concrete into a mold or shape you want.

He fixes the fan belt by using Lisa's expensive belt and replenishes the radiator with the girls drinking water. In return, he asks to be driven to Las Vegas. The girls get to Las Vegas first.

(I'm leaning toward rip off.) After that it gets worse and then surprisingly gets better, almost to the point of being original. Bad acting and amateurish directing bog down a fairly interesting little story, but the film already surpasses many in the \\"Yankee comes down South to get killed by a bunch of rednecks\\" genre because it is actually shot in the South. A group of college girls head to Ft. Lauderdale for summer vacation and are waylaid in Georgia by a flat tire after getting off the main road. (Note to Yankees: stay on the highway when you go to Florida.) Sue Ellen (Lisa Stahl) has to pee so she heads into the woods. When she finally finds a good spot to do her business she witnesses the local sheriff (Tony March) strangle his mistress (Merry Rozelle) to death. (Note to Yankees: do not wander off into the woods when in the South; not because you might witness a murder, but you may run across a marijuana plantation.) This is the point where the story, not the movie, actually comes close to being good. While Tony March will never have to practice his Oscar speech, his Sheriff Dean becomes a creepy facsimile of a normal guy torn by what he has done and what he must do. Tom Law is likable as Deputy Scott and is as authentic a Southern deputy as I've seen since Walton Goggins (Deputy Steve Naish) in HOUSE OF 1000 CORPSES.

And in the strangest scene, Sheriff Dean makes like he's about to rape Patty (Carol Cadby) and tells her to take off her clothes. Dean has turned the radio up to drown out the noise of what he's about to do. The preacher on the radio needs to go back and read his Bible.

The story begins with the phrase, \\"Sometimes,\\" he said, squatting down by the fire and holding his hands to the open flame,\\" showing that there's a fire at the center of their gathering. As the story proceeds, it is also clear that the firelight is the group's primary source of light in the scenario depicted. References to the glow of the firelight and shadows cast by it create a vivid picture of men gathered around a fire, engaged in conversation. The interactions and tone of their conversation indicate that these men are likely part of a team, possibly a group of guards or soldiers based on the comment regarding \\"guarding the King's own jewels\\". They are relaxing around the fire, sharing a meal and jesting with one another, engaging in a crude camaraderie common amongst those who live and work in close quarters under conditions that might be dangerous or stressful. The fire serves as both a source of light and warmth, as well as a focal point for the men's social interaction. They eat by it, warm their hands with it, and direct their conversations towards those illuminated by it. The character of Sartas is on the spotlight in this scenario, being the subject of both teasing and advice from his older and likely more experienced comrades, who warn him about the potential dangers of fatigue and hallucinations from the harsh sun when combined with their demanding outdoor duties. From the given narrative, there's no direct reference or mention regarding whether the sun is potentially setting or rising during this interaction. However, it is implied that the day's activities are over, implying that it's possibly evening or nighttime. Despite this, the sun is referenced several times in their conversation, mainly in connection to its intense heat and the potential impact it had on Sartas's perception of hearing voices. Therefore, the sun and its effects are an essential part of the scene, even if it doesn't directly illuminate the men's gathering. There's no mention of any other lights in the narrative, so we can ascertain that the primary source of light anchoring the scene is the fire. Each flare and flicker from the flames influencing the storytelling and the emotional undertones of the conversation, casting its glow on the men's faces, gestures, and expressions, as well as creating looming shadows that add suspense and intrigue. This intimate setting fostered by the firelight emphasizes the camaraderie and banter among the group, while also painting an atmospheric backdrop well-suited to the esoteric nature of the exchanges."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art. Here, over several days, Stravinsky and Roerich finalised the structure of the ballet. Thomas F. Kelly, in his history of the Rite...

Summarize: They look abandoned, but the 25 tonnes of scrap metal are at the heart of a major religious recycling project - the plan is to transform them into the first Catholic church built in Communist Cuba since the 1959 revolution. The engineer in charge of the project in Santiago de Cuba admits it is ambitious, not only because it is unprecedented but because the beams were once part of the stage built for Pope Benedict XVI's historic visit to the city in 2012. \\"Re-using the metal means keeping alive the memory of something good for us Catholics. It gives it new life, so it can serve future generations,\\" Fausto Veloz explains. The team need one, final permit of five to get started. But they argue there is also a pressing, practical motivation for the project: Cuba's Catholics say they need more places to worship. Once officially atheist, this Communist-run island is now a secular state. The days when believers would baptise their children in secret or attend mass surreptitiously in distant neighbourhoods have passed, and even Communist Party members now practice their religion openly. And yet after Fidel Castro took power more than five decades ago, the Catholic Church was only permitted to renovate existing properties or rebuild where old ones collapsed. New churches were never sanctioned, suggesting lingering ideological doubts on high. The apparent change of heart is particularly timely in Santiago - a few months after the papal visit, Hurricane Sandy tore through the city with devastating results. The little wooden church of San Pedrito was one of seven totally destroyed, made vulnerable by old age and poor maintenance. Another 28 churches were damaged. The storm killed 11 people and wrought huge destruction across the east of the island. Almost two years on, its traces are still visible. Siboney was one of the hardest-hit areas. The beachgoers are now back but they sip their beer in the shell of their former sea-front cafe. The gaping holes in the local primary school have been filled in but the house opposite remains in ruins, complete with the huge boulder flung through its walls by the raging sea. The owner was offered space in a state-run shelter but chose to stay, squeezed into the only corner of his home still standing and waiting for the construction materials the government promised. Back in the city, a smooth concrete floor and the outline of the altar are all that remains of the 93-year-old church of San Pedrito. Across the road, an elderly parishioner has stored the few items salvaged from the wreck - a couple of candlesticks, a wooden lectern and two chipped figurines from the nativity scene. \\"The rest were carried off by thieves,\\" Marta Perez explains, shaking her head. She says the congregation still gathers in the street outside for mass whenever a peripatetic priest can visit. \\"We really need our church back,\\" Ms Perez insists. The archdiocese is planning to rebuild San Pedrito. But Communist Cuba's first, brand new church should take shape close by. \\"The Catholic community is big here but they've never had a church,\\" says Mr Veloz, gesturing towards the modern apartment blocks of Santiago's Jose Marti district. The area was born after the revolution when religion was not a factor in town planning. Nowadays, local Catholics meet to pray in casas de culto - private houses used for worship - but say they are struggling with gradually increasing numbers. Across Cuba, the Catholic Church says around 60% of the population are baptised, though only a small fraction regularly practice their faith. \\"I don't know how long it will take to complete but I'm sure we'll do it,\\" Mr Veloz insists referring to the ground-breaking new church, surveying the site already allocated. It is currently a car park, beside the district police station. The steel beams - worth around 20,000 (Â£12,000) - were donated by the state when the stage was dismantled following Pope Benedict's visit. An architect's sketch envisages them in their new incarnation - soaring above the arched roof of the new Church of the Assumption, built to hold more than 600 worshippers and, Mr Veloz is keen to stress, withstand earthquakes and future hurricanes. There is a fair way still to go - as well as the final permit, acquiring building materials here is always a challenge and there is the small task of raising 250,000 to finance the project - most likely from parishes abroad. But Church officials are optimistic, sensing warming relations with the state. \\"I think this doesn't only show improving attitudes in Cuba to the Catholic Church, but to churches in general. I think there's a better understanding of religious affairs,\\" believes the Archbishop of Santiago, Dionisio Garcia. Archbishop Garcia points to Cuba's closer ties with socialist but devout countries like Venezuela, in possible explanation. \\"That's why we hope it won't only be this church that we build,\\" he says. \\"We hope there'll be more.\\" Summary:","completion":"A religious recycling project in Communist Cuba aims to convert 25 tonnes of scrap metal into the first Catholic church built in the country since the 1959 revolution.

By Luke Salkeld Last updated at 1:50 AM on 5th January 2012 Having twin babies can often be a handful – unless, as with Reuben Blake and his sister Floren, they arrive five years apart. The siblings were born from the same batch of embryos created during their parents’ IVF treatment. But while Reuben was successfully implanted in 2006, seven-week-old Floren was kept on ice until last year. Delight: Simon and Jody, who underwent fertility treatment, with their two children You took your time! Reuben Blake, five, with his twin sister Floren (seven weeks). They were conceived from the same batch of embryos ‘We obviously had nine months to get it straight and to think “Gosh, we’re having","completion":"twins but with a five-year age gap,”’ said their mother, Jody Blake, who underwent multiple rounds of IVF with her husband, Simon, to conceive the children. The couple had struggled with infertility for years, and after deciding to try IVF, they were overjoyed when Jody became pregnant with Reuben. During the IVF process, multiple embryos were created, and after Reuben's successful implantation, the remaining embryos were cryopreserved for potential future use. As the couple had always wanted more than one child, they decided to wait until they felt Reuben was ready for a sibling before undergoing another round of IVF using the remaining embryos. The Blakes were thrilled when they learned that one of the frozen embryos had successfully implanted and Jody was pregnant with Floren. Although the age gap between the twins may seem unconventional, it allowed the family to better prepare for the arrival of their newest addition, and to give their full attention and focus to each child's unique needs during their early years. As the children grow, the family expects that Reuben and Floren will share a special bond, having been conceived from the same group of embryos, though they will undoubtedly have their own distinct personalities and interests. The siblings will face the standard challenges of any brother-sister duo, though their unique circumstances may also prompt interesting questions about nature vs. nurture, and whether or not they will display any significant similarities beyond their genetic connection. This news story highlights how advances in medical technology have not only expanded options for those struggling with infertility but also opened the door for unique family dynamics and stories, such as that of Reuben and Floren. The article emphasizes that, despite the unconventional nature of their conception and the age gap between them, the siblings will be raised in a loving and supportive environment. The Blakes are now using their experiences and story to raise awareness about the benefits of IVF and the potential for success with frozen embryos. They hope that their journey can offer hope to other couples facing infertility and show that there are diverse and viable options available, even if it means expanding the definition of what it means to be twins. In conclusion, the story of Reuben and Floren serves to show how science, technology, and love can work together to create beautiful and unique families. Their tale will likely inspire hope in other couples experiencing fertility challenges and provide an interesting perspective on the concept of sibling relationships. As the pair grow up, they will undoubtedly have many fascinating stories to share about their one-of-a-kind bond as both twins and siblings with a significant age difference."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Please answer the following question: Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What was the full name of the person that had their heir created in 1776? In 1754, Belton was inherited by Sir John Cust, the son of previous owner Viscount Tyrconnel's widowed sister. Cust was a distinguished politician active during the politically turbulent 1760s, and his monument at Belton blames his death at the age of 51 to the \\"unusual fatigues of his office\\". His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776, and Belton was owned by successive Lords Brownlow for the next 200 years.In the last three decades of the 19th century the 3rd Earl Brownlow spent much time and money restoring Belton, and consequently the house entered the 20th century in a good state of repair and preservation. However, the 20th century was to present Belton and its estate with serious problems. These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.At the beginning of World War I, like many other British landowners, the 3rd Earl Brownlow offered his house and park to the Government for war service. The offer was accepted, and the largest and most drastic changes were made in the park since the time of Viscount Tyrconnel's folly building. In August 1914, the house and park were used as the assembly point for the 11th (Northern) Division before its deployment. In 1915, the home depôt and training ground of the Machine Gun Corps were established in the southern part of Belton park. The lie of the land there, where the River Witham passes between the Lower Lincolnshire Limestone and the Upper Lias mudstone, lent itself to the development of the necessary firing ranges close to good communications by way of the Great North Road and Grantham railway station on the East Coast Main Line. The depôt was closed in 1919, the site cleared and the land restored to Lord Brownlow in 1920. Little sign of the Machine Gun Corps's stay remains in the park, but plaques and inscriptions can be followed from the south gate of Belton park to the memorial gate on the way from there to the town centre and in the north aisle of Grantham parish... Answer:","completion":"The full name of the person who had their heir created in 1776 is not explicitly mentioned in the text provided. However, it can be deduced that the person in question is Sir John Cust, as the text states that \\"His heir was created Lord Brownlow in 1776.\\" Considering that the Lordship of Brownlow was created for the heir of Sir John Cust, it implies that it was Sir John Cust's full name that you were asking about."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Angela was very knowledgeable of tax laws.;","completion":"The sentence ends with: Erin always had a steady stream of clients unlike Angela who only had a few clients because, as a professional, Erin was very knowledgeable of tax laws. This sentence indicates that Erin's extensive knowledge of tax laws is one of the key factors responsible for her success in attracting and maintaining a constant flow of clients. In contrast, Angela's client base remains limited, indicating that her level of expertise or proficiency in tax laws might not be on par with Erin's. By finishing the sentence with option A, the writer emphasizes the importance of being well-versed in the field and also highlights the apparent difference in professional competence between Erin and Angela. Possessing a deep understanding of tax laws is essential for professionals working in the tax or accounting sector. It ensures that they can provide accurate advice to their clients, helping them navigate the complex world of taxation, minimize tax liabilities, and keep their financial affairs in compliance with relevant regulations. In this case, Erin's knowledge of tax laws likely contributes to her reputation as a trustworthy and skilled professional who can offer valuable guidance and support to her clients. This translates into client retention and word-of-mouth referrals, which ultimately leads to a steady stream of clients for her service. On the other hand, Angela's limited client base suggests that she might lack the same depth of knowledge in tax laws or other factors that are important to her clients. As a result, she may face difficulties in attracting new clients, keeping existing clients satisfied, and standing out among her peers in the competitive tax and finance industry. To sum up, the sentence ends by attributing Erin's successful professional performance and consistent client base to her extensive knowledge of tax laws, revealing the importance of expertise in this field, and drawing a contrast to Angela's situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You can also add 1/2 tsp (2.5 g) of cinnamon to the grounds to enhance both the flavor and the health benefits, if desired.","completion":"After adding the turmeric and optional cinnamon to the coffee grounds in the paragraph above, the process of preparing and enjoying turmeric-infused coffee continues as follows: 1. Brew the coffee as usual: With the turmeric and cinnamon incorporated into the coffee grounds, proceed to brew the coffee using your preferred method, such as a drip coffee maker, French press, or espresso machine. Follow the manufacturer's instructions and guidelines for brewing the perfect cup. Make sure to use freshly ground coffee beans and fresh water for optimal taste and quality. If you have a reusable coffee filter, it is recommended to use it to prevent any tiny turmeric particles from passing through the filter. 2. Prepare your sweetener and creamer: While the coffee is brewing, gather any sweeteners or creamers you'd like to add to your turmeric-infused drink. Honey, maple syrup, or agave nectar are natural sweetening options that pair well with the earthy flavors of turmeric. For creamer, consider using a dairy or non-dairy alternative such as milk, almond milk, or oat milk. These will complement the flavors and help create a smooth, creamy texture in your coffee. 3. Pour the brewed coffee into a mug: Once the brewing process is complete, carefully pour the coffee into your favorite mug. As turmeric can stain surfaces, make sure you protect your countertop or table by placing a coaster or napkin underneath the mug. 4. Add the sweetener and creamer: Add the desired amount of sweetener and creamer to your coffee, stirring well to ensure that they are fully incorporated. The heat from the coffee will help dissolve the sweetener and blend the flavors. 5. Taste and adjust: Take a sip of your turmeric-infused coffee to assess the sweetness and creaminess. Adjust the flavor as desired by adding more sweetener or creamer until you achieve your preferred taste. 6. Enjoy the health benefits: Savor your turmeric-infused coffee, knowing that you are consuming a beverage with numerous potential health benefits. Turmeric contains a compound called curcumin, which has antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anticancer properties. This supports both your overall health and immune system, while the cinnamon adds more flavor and potential benefits, such as blood sugar regulation and anti-inflammatory effects. 7. Clean up: As mentioned earlier, turmeric may stain surfaces and utensils, so clean up any spills or residue promptly to avoid long-lasting stains. Wash your coffee maker, mug, and any other tools used in the brewing process, ensuring that all traces of turmeric and cinnamon are removed. 8. Experiment with variations: Once you have enjoyed and gotten accustomed to your turmeric-infused coffee, you may want to experiment with variations. Try using different spices like ginger, cardamom, or nutmeg to create unique flavor profiles. You may also try combining turmeric with alternative beverages such as hot chocolate or chai tea for a delicious twist. By following these steps and suggestions, you can enjoy a delicious and healthful turmeric-infused coffee while reaping the potential benefits of turmeric and cinnamon."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This reduction in food intake can affect the digestion process indirectly. Here's a step-by-step justification: 1. Since less food is consumed during dieting, there might be less saliva production. This could lead to slightly slower initial breakdown of food chemicals. However, the overall process of saliva breaking down the food remains the same. 2. The function of the tongue and teeth in breaking down the food remains the same during dieting, making it an indirect impact. 3. The esophagus continues to function and transport food, but with less food to transport, the frequency of esophageal contractions might be reduced. Still, the overall process of moving food from the back of the throat to the stomach remains the same. 4. With less food entering the stomach, the stomach's function and gastric juice production might decrease, possibly slowing down the speed at which food is broken down. However, the overall process of breaking down food in the stomach is not directly impacted. 5. The movement of food through the intestines might be slower due to the reduced amount of food. The overall process of digestion in the intestines is not directly affected. In conclusion, dieting has an indirect impact on digestion due to less food intake. The steps of the process remain the same, but the overall speed or efficiency might be affected by changes in diet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

It seemed there was nothing more I could do or say to get him through his days without extreme sadness and lack of self esteem.

Given the task definition and input, reply with output. In this task, you are given an article. Your task is to summarize the article in a sentence. Not a recommendation you'd hear very often, frankly, about most companies' financial reporting. But rather than seeming designed to confuse and mislead, Next's report crisply spells out the challenges it's facing. And of course it's not just Next that's up against it, it's the High Street as a whole. A stark reminder of the difficulties came just yesterday when \\"value\\" shoe retailer Brantano went into administration, its pricier sister company Jones Bootmaker is up for sale. One of the administrators said the fall in the pound and a change in shopping habits were key factors. Next's results reflect these trends in spades. It's annual profits have fallen for the first time in eight years and it doesn't seem in the mood to pull any punches. The most obvious challenge is the continuing gravitation to online shopping. Next Directory sales have been rising every year for the past 10. This time they rose by 4% to Â£1.7bn but sales in the stores - pretty much flat for the past 10 years - fell by nearly 3% to Â£2.3bn. It's still a significant chunk of business, and as Next points out in its statement, it's still opening new shops. However, it concedes that with increasing amounts of business being transferred online \\"it is legitimate to question the long term viability of retail stores and whether the possession of a retail portfolio is an asset or a liability\\". Its conclusion is that the stores are indeed \\"valuable\\" assets which will remain profitable \\"even in very difficult circumstances\\". Nevertheless it has painstakingly worked through a scenario of what would happen if retail sales continued to decline at \\"high rates\\" for the next decade, and it says the stores could be \\"managed down profitably\\". Another issue which leaps out from the pages of Next's statement is the change in what the UK consumer is prepared to spend money on. A new dress or pair of shoes is no longer the go-to quick fix of choice, it seems. Instead Next quotes Barclaycard figures which show the growth in spending on pubs, restaurants and entertainment, compared with High Street clothing in the last three months of 2016. \\"We believe that these numbers demonstrate the continuing trend towards spending on experiences away from 'things',\\" says Next. \\"Shifts in consumer spending patterns are not unusual and we expect that the trend will stabilise and reverse at some point,\\" it continues. As if the fickleness of shoppers were not enough, of course, consumers have finally woken up to the fact that higher inflation means their money spreads more thinly. The fall in sterling since the Brexit vote has pushed up the cost of imports for the likes of Next, although it says it doesn't expect price rises to be any worse in the second half of the year, and \\"they may be a little better\\". Nevertheless, it doesn't see inflationary pressures easing until the second half of next year. Meantime, it says, inflation is \\"slowly rising to the level of general wages growth and look set to continue to do so for the remainder of the year, we therefore expect a continuing squeeze on real incomes in the year ahead\\". Added to this Next has is own internal problems which it's dealing with, including taking its eye off the ball in terms of stocking its \\"heartland\\" products. That is \\"easy to wear styles that can be delivered in large volumes and great prices across several colours\\". In short, Next reckons the year ahead looks \\"tough\\" with a \\"combination of economic, cyclical and internal factors working against us\\". But it's worth remembering this is not the first time Next - or retailers in general - have confronted such a mountain of adversity. Back at the start of the financial crisis in 2008, the number of retailers exiting the High Street seemed unstoppable. Woolworths went, and that was the last time Next saw profits drop. As chairman John Barton points out today \\"by the following year our profits had started to grow again and our share price recovered strongly in the following years. \\"I believe that by focusing on our core strengths as we did during 2008, we will see Next emerge from this period stronger than before\\" he adds. Investors may well agree. Next's shares were up following the release of the results, and not just because they were a textbook example of how a company should get its message across.","completion":"Next, the UK High Street retailer, has posted its first fall in annual profits for eight years, with the increasing popularity of online shopping and shifts in consumer spending cited as significant factors in confounding the retail industry. According to the Next Directory, online sales rose 4% to £1.7bn (2.11bn), while in-store sales fell nearly 3% to £2.3bn."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Let me start off with that I am a huge fan of build your own burger joints and this place isn't bad, but it's just not that great. I have been a few times since they opened to give them a chance to work out any issues in the kitchen and in the service. Overall the ingridients used in the burger are top quality and I am a huge fan of the onion strings as they taste both delicious as a topping and as a side.

And every time, it looks and tastes well done even when I have asked for it to be as rare as possible, like just sear the outside and I want it dripping in blood. But when the staff asks me how my food is and I say the meat is over cooked, they tell me its the lighting in the that restaurant makes it look well done and not their grill cooks in the back.

Lettie's Aunt Hortense, fearing that Barton is a fortune hunter, tells Lettie she is not the heiress she thought she was and that she has been living off her aunt's charity. With no fortune to hunt, Barton informs Lettie that an artist cannot be burdened with the responsibility of a wife.

After the demise of the migratory Turkish colony, the northern bald ibis was known to survive in the wild only at the Moroccan sites, although occasional sightings of birds in Yemen, Eritrea, Saudi Arabia, and Israel during the 1980s and 1990s suggested that there was still a colony somewhere in the Middle East. Intensive field surveys in spring 2002, based on the knowledge of Bedouin nomads and local hunters, revealed that the species had never become completely extinct on the Syrian desert steppes. Following systematic searches, 15 old nesting sites were found, one, near Palmyra, was still hosting an active breeding colony of seven individuals. Although the ibis had been declared extinct in Syria more than 70 years earlier, the bird appears to have been relatively common in the desert areas until 20 years ago, when a combination of overexploitation of its range lands and increasing hunting pressures initiated a dramatic decline.The Moroccan breeding birds are resident, dispersing along the coast after the nesting season. It has been suggested that coastal fog provides extra moisture for this population, and enables the ibises to remain year-round. In the rest of its former range, away from the Moroccan coastal locations, the northern bald ibis migrated south for the winter, and formerly occurred as a vagrant to Spain, Iraq, Egypt, the Azores, and Cape Verde.Satellite tagging of 13 Syrian birds in 2006 showed that the three adults in the group, plus a fourth untagged adult, wintered together from February to July in the highlands of Ethiopia, where the species had not been recorded for nearly 30 years.

Article: Research by the Institute of Education (IOE) in London found that men who went to single-sex schools were not only more likely to be separated from a partner or divorced, but also more likely to be depressed by middle age. The chances of women having successful marriages were not affected by whether they were educated in mixed or single-sex schools.Separate research by the IOE found that going without boys was beneficial for women in other ways since there was a \\" statistically significant positive association between single-sex schooling and wages for women\\". The study into marital success interviewed 17,000 adults who were taught in a range of schools including private boarding schools to state comprehensives.It found that single-sex education does not compromise the chances either of men or women of getting married. However, researchers found that boys educated on their own were more likely to divorce in later life.While for women, there was no significant link.The research also found men taught in boys' schools were more likely to suffer from depression by age 42--perhaps because of their increased chances of marital breakdown.But Professor Leonard's team was unable to identify why those men educated in a single-sex environment were more likely to divorce. The study asked married and _ g couples where men had attended both single-sex and mixed schools to rate how happy they were and found no marked difference in their happiness levels or willingness to share domestic chores. Mary Boust, general secretary of the Association of Teachers and Lecturers, said the IOE research confirmed what was always suspected.\\"All the research shows single-sex schools are good for girls but bad for boys--both in terms of academic performance and socialization,\\" she said.\\"Boys learn better when they are with girls and they actually learn to get on better.\\" The findings were presented at a conference on gender in education hosted by Perse School for Girls in Cambridge.

Title: Dragonfly Movie plot: Joe and Emily Darrow are doctors in a Chicago hospital. Seven months pregnant Emily travels to Venezuela to help natives in the Amazon area. She dies when a bus is hit by a landslide and plunges into the river below. Her body is never found by the local authorities. Without taking time to grieve Joe returns to work. One night he is awakened by his wife's dragonfly paper weight that falls and rolls across the room. His wife always had a passion for dragonflies and even had a birthmark on her shoulder which resembled a dragonfly. Joe starts visiting EmilyÂ´s patients at the pediatric oncology in the hospital. One of his wife's patients is brought in unconscious. Joe hears the child calling his name and follows the staff who are trying to revive him without success - the childÂ´s heart flatlines. As Joe approaches the child, suddenly the heart begins beating again. The following afternoon Joe returns to the child who asks him if he is \\"Emily's Joe\\" and tells him she sent him back to tell Joe something. All over the room are drawings of a curvy cross, but the boy doesn't know what the symbol means. The boy tells about his near death experience, that he saw a light, and a woman showing him an image of Joe, and that the cross symbol was what he saw at the end of the rainbow. Later, while passing by another child's room, Joe sees the same drawing. That boy immediately knows who Joe is and tells him that he must \\"go to the rainbow\\". When Joe arrives at home, his parrot mysteriously goes into a rage breaking a pot making the same wavy cross symbol drawn in the spilled soil on the floor. Joe spots a dragonfly flying outside the window, and briefly sees Emily reaching for him outside that same window. Joe's neighbour, Miriam Belmont, tries to talk him back into reality. Instead, he goes to Sister Madeline, a controversial nun who investigated near-death experiences. Sister Madeline advises Joe that Emily is indeed trying to contact him from the other side.

Answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What did the company that toured the United States in 1984 produce in 1990? , can you please find it? Productions during the 1980s included the company's first presentations of Pelléas and Mélisande (1981), Parsifal (1986) and Billy Budd (1988). 1980s productions that remained in the repertory for many years included Xerxes directed by Hytner, and Rigoletto and The Mikado directed by Jonathan Miller. In 1984 ENO toured the United States; the travelling company, led by Elder, consisted of 360 people; they performed Gloriana, War and Peace, The Turn of the Screw, Rigoletto and Patience. This was the first British company to be invited to appear at the Metropolitan Opera in New York, where Patience received a standing ovation and Miller's production of Rigoletto, depicting the characters as mafiosi, was greeted with a mixture of enthusiasm and booing. In 1990 ENO was the first major foreign opera company to tour the Soviet Union, performing the Miller production of The Turn of the Screw, Pountney's production of Macbeth, and Hytner's much-revived Xerxes.The 'Powerhouse' era ended in 1992, when all three of the triumvirate left at the same time. The new general director was Dennis Marks, formerly head of music programmes at the BBC, and the new music director was Sian Edwards. Pountney's post of director of productions was not filled. Marks, inheriting a large financial deficit from his predecessors, worked to restore the company's finances, concentrating on restoring ticket sales to sustainable levels. A new production by Miller of Der Rosenkavalier was a critical and financial success, as was a staging of Massenet's Don Quixote, described by the critic Hugh Canning as \\"the kind of old-fashioned theatre magic which the hair-shirted Powerhouse regime despised\\".Marks was obliged to spend much time and effort in securing the funding for an essential restoration of the Coliseum, a condition on which ENO had acquired the freehold of the theatre in 1992. At the same time the Arts Council was contemplating a cut in the number of opera performances in London, at the expense of ENO, rather than Covent Garden. By...

In fact, PR can be quite effective in connecting with potential employers and building a professional network. This statement is based on the fundamental misunderstandings of the aims and objectives of the public relations profession. Public relations is the practice of managing and maintaining a positive image and relationships between an organization or individual and the public. Professionals working in PR engage in a range of activities, such as media relations, event planning, crisis management, and social media management, to promote their organization or clients and build valuable relationships within various industries and sectors. Public relations can actually play a crucial role in helping individuals get in touch with potential employers or companies, as it offers several key advantages: 1. Networking: PR professionals work extensively with diverse media, businesses, and public personalities to promote their clients or organizations. This involvement provides you with numerous opportunities to expand your professional network and put you in direct contact with company executives, key decision-makers, and industry influencers who may become potential employers. 2. Building relationships: Public relations is built on the foundation of nurturing long-lasting relationships with key stakeholders, making it possible for PR professionals to connect with these stakeholders on a personal level. Maintaining a strong professional network can lead to job offers or referrals, as well as providing access to valuable resources and information that may not be available through other channels. 3. Reputation management: One of the primary goals of PR is to improve the public image and perception of an individual or organization. By building and managing your personal brand and reputation, you may be able to catch the attention of potential employers who are interested in your specific skills, experiences, and values. 4. Job opportunities within the PR industry: If you are interested in a career in PR, there is a wide range of job opportunities available within the industry, from working in PR agencies to in-house roles within a company or organization. Having a PR background or education can be highly valuable in securing a position in the field, allowing you to work directly for or with a range of companies and employers. In summary, public relations can be highly effective in connecting individuals with potential employers and companies, through its focus on networking, relationship-building, and reputation management. The statement \\"Public relations will not help you get into contact with companies or employers.\\" is not accurate and does not do justice to the essential role PR plays in the professional world, benefiting both individuals and organizations alike."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: what are the goals of the organization of American states? Would \\"Its members are the 35 independent states of the Americas .\\" be a reasonable answer? The answer is:","completion":"The Organization of American States (OAS) is an international organization that seeks to bring together the 35 independent states of the Americas to promote peace, democracy, security, development, and cooperation within the region. While the statement \\"Its members are the 35 independent states of the Americas\\" accurately identifies the member countries of the OAS, it does not fully capture the organization's goals and objectives. A more detailed and comprehensive answer to this question would discuss the key goals and initiatives of the OAS. Some of the primary goals of the Organization of American States include: 1. Strengthening Democracy: The OAS aggressively promotes democracy and its institutions by actively encouraging political dialogue, providing electoral observation missions, and strengthening the political institutions of member countries. 2. Protecting Human Rights: The OAS leads efforts to protect and advance human rights across the region. It achieves this goal through monitoring and enforcing human rights laws and treaties, addressing violations, and providing support to member countries in strengthening their domestic human rights systems. 3. Fostering Integral Development and Prosperity: The OAS works to foster economic growth, reduce poverty, and promote sustainable development throughout the Americas. It does so by collaborating with member countries to implement policies and initiatives aimed at boosting productivity, innovation, and economic competitiveness. 4. Promoting Multidimensional Security: The OAS is committed to addressing a range of security issues, including combating organized crime, drug trafficking, and terrorism. It also aims to promote disarmament, advance cybersecurity, and build the capacity of security institutions in member countries. 5. Facilitating Regional Cooperation: The OAS encourages cooperation and collaboration among its member states to tackle shared challenges and create opportunities for mutual benefit. Such initiatives include promoting trade, investment, and academic exchanges, as well as working together to address common environmental and diplomatic challenges. 6. Supporting Inter-American Legal Cooperation: The OAS seeks to establish a framework for cooperation among its members in matters of law, justice, and judicial cooperation. This contributes to the harmonization of the legal systems in the region and fosters a greater understanding of the rule of law and the importance of international treaties in addressing common challenges. In summary, while the statement \\"Its members are the 35 independent states of the Americas\\" accurately describes the membership of the Organization of American States, it does not capture the organization's full scope of goals and objectives. The OAS works to promote peace, democracy, human rights, development, security, and cooperation among its members, striving to make the Americas a more prosperous and stable region for all its citizens."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The answer to the question: What is the first name of the the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap? is inside the article: The most significant early research of Early Netherlandish art occurred in the 1920s, in German art historian Max Jakob Friedländer's pioneering Meisterwerke der Niederländischen Malerei des 15. und 16. Jahrhunderts. Friedländer focused on the biographical details of the painters, establishing attribution, and examining their major works. The undertaking proved extremely difficult, given the scant historical record of even the most significant artists. Fellow-German Erwin Panofsky's analysis in the 1950s and 1960s followed and in many ways challenged Friedländer's work. Writing in the United States, Panofsky made the work of the German art historians accessible to the English-speaking world for the first time. He effectively legitimized Netherlandish art as a field of study, and raised its status to something similar to the early Italian renaissance. Panofsky was one of the first art historians to abandon formalism. He built on Friedländer's attempts at attribution, but focused more on social history and religious iconography. Panofsky developed the terminology with which the Netherlandish paintings are usually described, and made significant advances identifying the rich religious symbolism especially of the major altarpieces. Panofsky was the first scholar to connect the work of Netherlandish painters and illuminators, noticing the considerable overlap. He considered the study of manuscripts to be integral to the study of panels, though in the end came to view illumination as less significant than panel painting – as a prelude to the truly significant work of the northern artists of the 15th and 16th centuries.Otto Pächt and Friedrich Winkler continued and developed on Panofsky's work. They were key in identifying sources of iconography and ascribing attribution, or at least differentiating anonymous masters under names of convenience. The paucity of surviving documentation has made attribution especially difficult, a problem compounded by the workshop system.

In multicellular organisms, mutations can be subdivided into germline mutations and somatic mutations. Germline mutations occur in the DNA of sex cells, or gametes, and are therefore potentially very serious. These mutations can be passed to the next generation. If the zygote contains the mutation, every cell in the resulting organism will have that mutation. If the mutation results in a disease phenotype, the mutation causes what is called a hereditary disease. Somatic mutations , which occur in somatic, or body, cells, cannot be passed to the next generation (offspring). Mutations present in a somatic cell of an organism will be present (by DNA replication and mitosis) in all descendants of that cell. If the mutation is present in a gene that is not used in that cell type, the mutation may have no effect. On the other hand, the mutation may lead to a serious medical condition such as cancer.

When there is plenty of food and other resources, organisms can easily reproduce, so the birth rate is high. As the population increases, the food supply, or the supply of another necessary resource, may decrease. When necessary resources, such as food, decrease, some individuals will die. Overall, the population cannot reproduce at the same rate, so the birth rates drop. This will cause the population growth rate to decrease. A team of biologists has been monitoring the deer population in the state of Wisconsin. They use past data and current conditions to predict how the population will grow or shrink and recommend how many hunting licenses the state should issue during hunting season to keep the population stable. Will deer birth rates be higher or lower if there has been less available food this year when compared to last year? Answer:","completion":"Lower"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Would a linguist find the following sentence to be a valid English sentence grammatically? Rory may be eating the muffins. Choose your answer from: 1. unacceptable 2. acceptable","completion":"2. acceptable A linguist would find the sentence \\"Rory may be eating the muffins\\" to be a valid English sentence grammatically. Let's break down the components of the sentence to understand why it is acceptable: 1. Subject: \\"Rory\\" is the subject of the sentence. The subject is the person, place, thing, or idea that the sentence is about, or who is performing the action. In this case, Rory is the one performing the action, which makes it function as the subject of the sentence. 2. Modal verb: \\"may\\" is a modal verb. Modal verbs are auxiliary verbs that express likelihood, ability, permission, or obligation. In this sentence, \\"may\\" is used to express the probability or possibility that the action is happening. Modal verbs are followed by the base form of the main verb (without \\"to\\"), which, in this case, is \\"be.\\" 3. Auxiliary verb: \\"be\\" is an auxiliary verb, which functions as a helping verb in the sentence. Auxiliary verbs usually work with other verbs to indicate tense, voice, or mood. In this case, \\"be\\" works together with the modal verb \\"may\\" and the main verb \\"eating\\" to convey the progressive aspect of the verb, showing that the action is an ongoing process. 4. Main verb: \\"eating\\" is the main verb of the sentence. It is the primary action that Rory might be performing. In this sentence, the main verb is presented in its -ing form (gerund), which works together with the auxiliary verb \\"be,\\" creating the present progressive tense. The present progressive tense is used to portray an action that is likely happening at the moment or is an ongoing process. 5. Object: \\"the muffins\\" is the object of the sentence. The object is the recipient of the action performed by the subject. In this case, the muffins are the items potentially being consumed by Rory. The sentence follows the Subject-Verb-Object (SVO) structure, which is a common structure in English. Furthermore, the sentence is clear, with each word serving a particular function. Based on these factors, the sentence \\"Rory may be eating the muffins\\" would be considered grammatically acceptable by a linguist."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

If \\"Two people embrace outside of a red car at night in a brightly-lit city.\\", does it logically follow that \\"A man an his wife hugging after a date.\\"?","completion":"Let us analyze the two statements step by step and compare them to see if the second statement logically follows the first one: Statement 1: \\"Two people embrace outside of a red car at night in a brightly-lit city.\\" - Two people are involved. - They are embracing (hugging) each other. - The location is outside of a red car. - The time is at night. - The setting is in a brightly-lit city. Statement 2: \\"A man and his wife hugging after a date.\\" - Two people are involved (a man and his wife). - They are hugging each other. - The situation implies they might have had a date. To determine if the second statement logically follows the first, we need to evaluate whether the details match or can be inferred from the first statement. 1. Both statements involve two people hugging (embracing) each other. 2. The first statement provides more location-specific information (beside a red car, at night, in a brightly-lit city) that isn't explicitly mentioned in the second statement. However, the second statement does not contradict these circumstances, as it still could happen in the specified location. 3. The second statement implies that a man and his wife are hugging after a date. This cannot be conclusively inferred from the first statement, as it only mentions \\"two people\\" without specifying their relationship or the context of their embrace. Given these observations, while there are similarities between the two statements, it does not logically follow that the second statement (\\"A man and his wife hugging after a date\\") is true based solely on the information provided in the first statement. They may be two different scenarios, or the second statement could be true within the context of the first statement, but we cannot be sure based on the given information."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Lawrence Morton, in a study of the origins of The Rite, records that in 1907–08 Stravinsky set to music two poems from Sergey Gorodetsky's collection Yar. Another poem in the anthology, which Stravinsky did not set but is likely to have read, is \\"Yarila\\" which, Morton observes, contains many of the basic elements from which The Rite of Spring developed, including pagan rites, sage elders, and the propitiatory sacrifice of a young maiden: \\"The likeness is too close to be coincidental\\". Stravinsky himself gave contradictory accounts of the genesis of The Rite. In a 1920 article he stressed that the musical ideas had come first, that the pagan setting had been suggested by the music rather than the other way round. However, in his 1936 autobiography he described the origin of the work thus: \\"One day [in 1910], when I was finishing the last pages of L'Oiseau de Feu in St Petersburg, I had a fleeting vision ... I saw in my imagination a solemn pagan rite: sage elders, seated in a circle, watching a young girl dance herself to death. They were sacrificing her to propitiate the god of Spring. Such was the theme of the Sacre du Printemps\\".By May 1910 Stravinsky was discussing his idea with Nicholas Roerich, the foremost Russian expert on folk art and ancient rituals. Roerich had a reputation as an artist and mystic, and had provided the stage designs for Diaghilev's 1909 production of the Polovtsian Dances. The pair quickly agreed on a working title, \\"The Great Sacrifice\\" (Russian: Velikaia zhertva); Diaghilev gave his blessing to the work, although the collaboration was put on hold for a year while Stravinsky was occupied with his second major commission for Diaghilev, the ballet Petrushka.In July 1911 Stravinsky visited Talashkino, near Smolensk, where Roerich was staying with the Princess Maria Tenisheva, a noted patron of the arts and a sponsor of Diaghilev's magazine World of Art.

With Truss stepping down, Joyce, who is currently serving as the Nationals leader, is poised to fill the leadership vacuum in the Australian political landscape. In this article, we delve into Barnaby Joyce's political career and take a look at his policies and vision for the future of Australia. Early Life and Political Career: Born on April 17, 1967, in Tamworth, New South Wales, Barnaby Joyce spent his early years working on his family's farm, which proved to be a formative experience and nurtured his deep connection with the agricultural industry. After completing his studies in rural science at the University of New England, Joyce held various finance and accounting positions before venturing into the world of politics. Joyce entered the political arena by joining the Nationals, eventually being elected to the Senate in 2005 representing Queensland. During his tenure as a Senator, Joyce was known for his outspoken views and advocating for policies that focused on the welfare of rural communities. In 2013, he was elected as a Member of Parliament for the electorate of New England, transitioning smoothly from the Senate to the House of Representatives. From Agriculture Minister to Nationals Leader: In 2015, Barnaby Joyce was appointed as Australia’s Minister for Agriculture, showcasing his unparalleled passion for agricultural development. As the minister, Joyce introduced several initiatives that positively impacted Australia's agricultural industry, such as the 4 billion Agricultural Competitiveness White Paper aimed at boosting agricultural productivity, and forming the Country of Origin Labelling Taskforce. Also, he played a significant role in trade negotiations and increasing export opportunities for the country. As of February 2022, Barnaby Joyce assumed the position of Nationals leader, and consequently became Australia's deputy prime minister in the wake of Warren Truss' retirement. As a member of the coalition government, Joyce's role as Nationals leader ensures the party continues to represent rural voices and needs in the decision-making process at the highest level of the Australian government. Vision for the Future: As Australia prepares to welcome a new deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce brings to the table a comprehensive understanding of the nation's rural regions and their economic potential. Some key areas where Joyce is expected to focus his attention include: 1. Infrastructure Development: Joyce has signaled his commitment to improving rural infrastructure, such as upgrading regional roads and railway connections, improving water storage facilities, and investing in better telecommunications networks. 2. Agriculture and Regional Growth: With experience as Australia's Agriculture Minister, Joyce is expected to double down on supporting regional communities and their vital agricultural industries. This involves policies that promote innovation, export expansion, and amplify rural industries to compete on a global scale. 3. Energy Resources and Environment: Joyce has been a vocal advocate for utilizing Australia’s extensive natural resources, particularly focusing on coal and gas development.

Solve this instance: Problem: bob wants to run a mile in the same time as his sister . if bob ’ s time for a mile is currently 10 minutes 40 seconds and his sister ’ s time is currently 5 minutes 20 seconds , by what percent does bob need to improve his time in order run a mile in the same time as his sister ? Options: a ) 3 % , b ) 50 % , c ) 8 % , d ) 10 % , e ) 12 % Student:","completion":"First, we need to find the difference in time between Bob's and his sister's mile times. Bob runs a mile in 10 minutes 40 seconds, while his sister runs a mile in 5 minutes 20 seconds. To compare their times, we should convert them into seconds. Bob takes 10 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 40 seconds = 640 seconds to run a mile. His sister takes 5 minutes * 60 seconds/minute + 20 seconds = 320 seconds to run a mile. Next, we need to find the difference in their times which is 640 seconds - 320 seconds = 320 seconds. Now, we can find the percentage improvement Bob needs to make. The improvement needed is 320 seconds (the difference in their times) and we need to find what percentage this is of Bob's original time of 640 seconds. Percent improvement = (Improvement needed / original time) * 100 Percent improvement = (320 / 640) * 100 Percent improvement = 0.5 * 100 Percent improvement = 50% So, the correct answer is b) 50%. I used the definition of percentages and the given information to calculate the improvement needed for Bob to run a mile at the same time as his sister."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

They were important to the Greeks. When they took place, all wars were stopped. No one dared to break the truce of Olympic. Criers announced the names of winning athletes everywhere in the land. Artists made statues of them. Poets wrote about the Olympic heroes. The first Olympians raced the length of the stadium at Olympia--about 200 yards. But later other events were added:longer races, broad jumping, the javelin throw, the marathon race, and the discus throw. Then boxing, wrestling and horseback riding were also added. In the beginning, only Greeks competed in the Games. But in later centuries, athletes from other lands joined. In 146 B.C. the Romans conquered Greece. Soon the Games began to change. Under the Romans, they became rougher, wilder, and bloodier. Many professionals took part, which was against the spirit of the Olympics. Finally, Emperor Theodosius of Rome decided that the Olympics were a public danger. He died away with them after the Games of A.D. 392. They had lasted over 1,000 years. Fifteen hundred years passed.

Q:Given the following passage \\"The existence of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2n combinations where n is the number of differing characteristics in the original peas.

Given the context: How would you describe Robin? Select from the following. (A). a good person; (B). a generous friend; (C). a bad friend; The answer is:","completion":"(C). a bad friend; In the given context, Robin is described as someone who never gave her friends anything for their birthday parties. Birthday gifts are often seen as a token of appreciation, friendship, and love among friends. It's a way of celebrating someone's special day by showing that you value their presence in your life. By continually not giving her friends birthday gifts, Robin may come across as lacking in consideration and generosity towards them, characteristics that are typically seen as negative in a friendship.

A little-known 1948 contract between the estate of Orville Wright and the Smithsonian has the museum legally bound to call the Wright brothers first in flight: \\"The Smithsonian shall [not state] any aircraft ... earlier than the Wright aeroplane of 1903 ... was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight,\\" it states. One aviation historian claims that contract is wrong, however, forcing the museum to ignore the truth. And for the first time, the museum has released the contract publicly to FoxNews.com, to let the world make its own decisions. According to most anyone you ask, Orville and Wilbur sailed into history books on Dec. 17, 1903, following their historic flight at Kitty Hawk, North Carolina. The Smithsonian features the Wright Flyer prominently today. A 1948 contract between the Smithsonian museum and Orville Wright requires the museum to call the Wright Flyer the first real airplane, critics argue. Here, the relevant excerpt from the contract: “Neither the Smithsonian Institution nor its successors, nor any museum or other agency ... or its successors shall publish or permit to be displayed a statement or label in connection with or in respect of any aircraft model or design of earlier date than the Wright Aeroplane of 1903, claiming in effect that such aircraft was capable of carrying a man under its own power in controlled flight.” Read the full contract here. But Australian aviation historian John Brown argues that a recently uncovered photograph proves German immigrant Gustav Whitehead flew first (over Connecticut, in the wee hours of Aug. 14, 1901). Brown says the Smithsonian is bound by that contract to ignore Whitehead’s feat. And the secrecy has to go, he wrote last week to the Smithsonian’s senior curator. “With apologies to Ronald Reagan and Mikhail Gorbachev: ... Mr. Crouch, tear up that contract!” The contract was signed in 1948 between surviving Wright brother Orville and the museum; it secured ownership of the Flyer from London’s Science Museum for 1, with a stipulation: The Wright plane must always be recognized as the first true airplane. “Jane’s: All the World’s Aircraft” -- widely considered the essential bible of flight -- recently acknowledged Whitehead's achievement, and agreed with Brown about the contract. “History is normally written by researchers who have dispassionately analyzed all relevant data and not, as here, by the lawyers of interested parties,” the book reads. The contract does exist and still holds, said Tom Crouch, senior curator of aeronautics at the museum, in a recent blog post. &quotThe contract remains in force today, a healthy reminder of a less-than-exemplary moment in Smithsonian history.&quot The Smithsonian was involved in pioneering efforts to achieve flight in the first years of the 20th century, it turns out. An airplane created by the museum was on display in the teens, labelled “first airplane capable of flight.” - Peter Jakab, associate director of curatorial affairs for the Smithsonian Museum “That was a very misleading statement,” Peter Jakab, associate director of curatorial affairs for the Smithsonian Museum, told FoxNews.com -- one that angered Orville. Wright sent his plane to London in 1928 in protest, with Charles Lindbergh's help, where it remained until 1942 when the museum published an extensive article about the Smithsonian's &quotLangley plane&quot that set the record straight. “The plane was put in storage during World War II at a quarry with the Magna Carta and the crown jewels. After the war, arrangements were made to bring it back,” Jakab said. Those arrangements were between the executors of the estate -- Orville having died of a heart attack -- and the Smithsonian. To avoid paying high taxes on the transfer, a contract was signed. “The executors put in the agreement a label that always would be displayed with the flyer … directed toward the Langley issue,” he told FoxNews.com. In an open letter sent March 24 to the Smithsonian's Crouch, Brown argued that the letter was coloring his view of history. “You saying the Wrights flew first is like Bill Gates saying Microsoft products are good -- except that Bill is more credible because no contract actually requires him to say that,” Brown wrote. In an open response two days later, Crouch dismissed those claims. “I can only repeat that if substantial evidence of a pre-Wright flight claim were to be produced, I hope I would have the courage to admit it.” Ultimately, the question of who flew first is less important than the legacy left by the Wright's design anyway, Jakab argued. “[The Wright Flyer] was able to evolve into something we have today. And that’s its real powerful significance -- in addition to being the first to fly.” What was this article about?","completion":"This article is about the Wright brothers, who were known as the first people to fly an airplane. The article talks about a contract between the Smithsonian museum and Orville Wright from 1948 that says the museum must always recognize the Wright brothers' airplane as the first in flight.

The Smithsonian museum has now released the contract to the public so everyone can make their own decision about who was truly the first to fly an airplane."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: Question: what is the organic layer in an amoled screen I found the following answer on Google: Prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec Is that a correct answer? Yes or no. Answer:","completion":"No, the answer you found on Google about a prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec is not the correct answer to your question regarding the organic layer in an AMOLED screen. Allow me to provide you with a detailed explanation of the organic layer in an AMOLED screen. AMOLED stands for Active Matrix Organic Light-Emitting Diode. It is a type of display technology that is commonly used in various electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and televisions. AMOLED screens consist of a combination of organic materials and an active matrix to create an advanced and high-quality display. The organic layer in an AMOLED screen plays a crucial role in the functioning of the display. It is made of organic compounds, which enable the screen to emit light when an electric current is applied. This organic layer is composed of two primary materials: 1. Emissive Layer: The emissive layer consists of molecules or polymers that emit light when an electrical current is supplied. This layer is responsible for generating the bright, vivid colors and high contrast ratios that are characteristic of AMOLED screens. The emissive layer is typically made up of various organic materials such as fluorescent and phosphorescent compounds. 2. Conductive Layer: The conductive layer, also composed of organic materials, is responsible for transporting electrical charges across the display. It acts as a medium through which electrons from the negative terminal of the power source can flow towards the emissive layer, ultimately producing light when the electric current interacts with the organic materials. In an AMOLED screen, these organic layers are sandwiched between electrodes, such as an anode (positive electrode) and a cathode (negative electrode). When an electric current is applied, the electrodes inject positively charged holes and negatively charged electrons into the organic layers, which leads to the emission of light. The use of organic materials in AMOLED displays offers several advantages, such as higher contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and more vibrant colors compared to traditional LCD screens. Additionally, AMOLED screens are thinner and more flexible, allowing them to be utilized in a wide variety of applications, from foldable smartphones to wearable devices. In conclusion, the organic layer in an AMOLED screen refers to the combination of the emissive and conductive layers made of organic compounds. These layers play a vital role in producing the high-quality visuals and performance that AMOLED screens are known for. The prototype OLED lighting panel developed by Lumiotec is not the correct answer to your question because it is a specific application of OLED technology, whereas your question concerns the organic layer in AMOLED screens in general."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Europe is bordered by the Arctic Ocean to the north, the Atlantic Ocean to the west, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south. To the east and southeast, Europe is generally considered as separated from Asia by the watershed divides of the Ural and Caucasus Mountains, the Ural River, the Caspian and Black Seas, and the waterways of the Turkish Straits. Yet the non-oceanic borders of Europea concept dating back to classical antiquityare arbitrary. The primarily physiographic term \\"continent\\" as applied to Europe also incorporates cultural and political elements whose discontinuities are not always reflected by the continent's current overland boundaries. - Athens (\\"Athína\\" ) is the capital and largest city of Greece. Athens dominates the Attica region and is one of the world's oldest cities, with its recorded history spanning over 3,400 years, and its earliest human presence starting somewhere between the 11th and 7th millennia BC. Classical Athens was a powerful city-state that emerged in conjunction with the seagoing development of the port of Piraeus, which had been a distinct city prior to its 5th century BC incorporation with Athens. A centre for the arts, learning and philosophy, home of Plato's Academy and Aristotle's Lyceum, it is widely referred to as the cradle of Western civilization and the birthplace of democracy, largely because of its cultural and political impact on the European continent, and in particular the Romans. In modern times, Athens is a large cosmopolitan metropolis and central to economic, financial, industrial, maritime, political and cultural life in Greece. In 2015, Athens was ranked the world's 29th richest city by purchasing power and the 67th most expensive in a UBS study. - A grassroots movement (often referenced in the context of a political movement) is one which uses the people in a given district as the basis for a political or economic movement. Grassroots movements and organizations utilize collective action from the local level to effect change at the local, regional, national, or international level. Grassroots movements are associated with bottom-up, rather than top-down decision making, and are sometimes considered more natural or spontaneous than more traditional power structures. Grassroots movements, using self-organization, encourages community members to contribute by taking responsibility and action for their community. Grassroots movements utilize a variety of strategies from fundraising and registering voters, to simply encouraging political conversation. Goals of specific movements vary, but the movements are consistent in their focus on increasing mass participation in politics. - Greece (' ), officially the Hellenic Republic (Greek: ' ), historically also known as Hellas (\\"\\" ), is a country in southeastern Europe. Greece's population is approximately 10.955 million as of 2015. Athens is the nation's capital and largest city, followed by Thessaloniki. - Thessaloniki is the second-largest city in Greece and the capital of Greek Macedonia, the administrative region of Central Macedonia and the Decentralized Administration of Macedonia and Thrace. Its nickname is (\\"Symprotévousa\\"), literally \\"the co-capital\\", a reference to its historical status as the (\\"Symvasilévousa\\") or \\"co-reigning\\" city of the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire, alongside Constantinople. - Wireless Thessaloniki is an experimental wireless community network growing in the air of Thessaloniki , Greece . It is one of the first wireless networks deployed in the city . It was founded by Konstantinos Natsakis and Athanasios Kanaris on November , 2002 . The primary goals of this project was twofold : Development of a floppy linux distribution that would provide encryption better than WEP Construction of low - cost antennas and routers based on old PCs , placed in water resist boxes in order to be placed on rooftops The linux floppy distribution formed , named Paladir , was named after the palantíri in J. R. R. Tolkien 's The Lord of the Rings , as it provided insight to other wireless routers running Paladir . The first wireless link , connecting two points with distance of 4.5 km , was achieved on March 1st , 2003 , in 11 Mbit / s. Since then , the wthess network counts more than 20 nodes sparged on rooftops of the city . It is connected with TWMN and SWN to provide connectivity with other community networks , and it is also connected through wired network with AWMN and other wireless communities in Greece . - Wireless community networks or wireless community projects are the organizations that attempt to take a grassroots approach to providing a viable alternative to municipal wireless networks for consumers. - Municipal wireless network (Municipal Wi-Fi, Muni Wi-Fi or Muni-Fi) is a city-wide wireless network. This is usually done by providing municipal broadband via Wi-Fi to large parts or all of a municipal area by deploying a wireless mesh network. The typical deployment design uses hundreds of wireless access points deployed outdoors, often on poles. The operator of the network acts as a wireless internet service provider. - The euro (sign: €; code: EUR) is the official currency of the eurozone, which consists of 19 of the member states of the European Union: Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Spain. The currency is also officially used by the institutions of the European Union and four other European countries, as well as unilaterally by two others, and is consequently used daily by some 337 million Europeans . Outside of Europe, a number of overseas territories of EU members also use the euro as their currency. What is the relationship between 'wireless thessaloniki' and 'municipal wireless network'? Answer:","completion":"Wireless Thessaloniki and Municipal Wireless Network are related in the sense that both involve providing wireless internet access to specific areas or communities. Wireless Thessaloniki is an experimental wireless community network in Thessaloniki, Greece, which was initiated as a grassroots effort to create a low-cost alternative to traditional internet service providers. On the other hand, a Municipal Wireless Network (also known as Municipal Wi-Fi or Muni-Fi) is a city-wide wireless network provided by the local government, usually by deploying a wireless mesh network using wireless access points placed outdoors. The main difference between the two is the entity responsible for creating and maintaining the network. Wireless Thessaloniki is a grassroots project managed by individuals and community members, while a Municipal Wireless Network is typically set up and operated by the local government or a government-affiliated entity. Both approaches aim to increase internet access and connectivity for the public, but their organizational structures and funding sources may vary significantly."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant, who knows every language and how to translate one language to another.

Please answer the following question: At what structure can you see people you use a puck professionally? Choose the most suitable option to answer the above question. Options: - hockey rink - locker room - sporting goods store - used in hockey game - teachers Answer:","completion":"The most suitable option to answer the question, \\"At what structure can you see people you use a puck professionally?\\" is a hockey rink. A hockey rink is a specialized venue designed and utilized for ice hockey games and other ice sports. It houses all the essential equipment and facilities needed for professional hockey players to participate in the sport. In these arenas, skilled players who use pucks professionally can be seen in action, showcasing their talents during matches and practice sessions alike. The other choices provided do not accurately respond to the question: 1. Locker room: While it is true that professional hockey players can be found in locker rooms, the main purpose of these rooms is for athletes to change, store personal belongings, and have team meetings. Locker rooms are generally closed to the public, so seeing the players using a puck professionally is quite unlikely in this setting. 2. Sporting goods store: Although sporting goods stores sell equipment related to hockey, including pucks, you would not typically see a professional hockey player using a puck inside the store. These establishments are primarily for the sale of merchandise, and it would be unusual for a professional player to demonstrate their skills inside one. 3. Used in hockey game: This option is a bit ambiguous, but it seems to refer to the activity of using a puck in a game rather than the location where you can observe professional players using a puck. 4. Teachers: This option does not seem related to the question at all, as teachers generally work in educational settings and not in sports structures, like hockey rinks, where professional players use pucks. In conclusion, the most appropriate place to see people using a puck professionally is a hockey rink. This location is specifically designed for ice hockey games, providing ample opportunities to observe skilled players in action."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Process: - Chemicals like sulfur dioxide and nitrogen are released into the air - These substances rise into the high atmosphere - They react with water and oxygen - This creates a more acidic rain - The rain with the high acid content falls. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the rain will have higher acidic properties happens, how will it affect LESS damage by acid rain. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? A:","completion":"The described process outlines the formation of acid rain, which is caused mainly by the release of sulfur dioxide (SO2) and nitrogen oxides (NOx) into the air. These compounds react with water and oxygen in the atmosphere to produce more acidic rain. The perturbation hypothesis suggests that rain with even higher acidic properties could lead to less damage caused by acid rain. However, higher acidic properties in rain can actually cause more damage to the environment, ecosystem, and infrastructure. Higher acidity in rain can: 1. Leach nutrients from the soil, making it less fertile and negatively impacting agriculture and plant growth. 2. Cause harm to aquatic life due to increased acidity in water bodies, affecting the overall aquatic ecosystem's balance and potentially leading to the decline of some species. 3. Damage infrastructure, such as buildings and monuments, as acidic substances erode and corrode certain materials like limestone and concrete. 4. Impact human health, as inhaling acid particles suspended in the air can contribute to respiratory issues and other health problems. The proposed perturbation would indeed have an effect on the process, but it would likely lead to more damage due to acid rain rather than protecting from it. To mitigate or prevent the damage caused by acid rain, a more effective approach would involve reducing SO2 and NOx emissions from sources like power plants, factories, and vehicles, along with implementing strategies for cleaner energy production and cleaner transportation solutions."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

While Nashiri was in Afghanistan, Nibras and Khamri saw their chance. They piloted the explosives-laden boat alongside the USS Cole, made friendly gestures to crew members, and detonated the bomb. Quso did not arrive at the apartment in time to film the attack. Back in Afghanistan, Bin Laden anticipated U.S. military retaliation. He ordered the evacuation of al Qaeda's Kandahar airport compound and fled- first to the desert area near Kabul, then to Khowst and Jalalabad, and eventually back to Kandahar. In Kandahar, he rotated between five to six residences, spending one night at each residence. In addition, he sent his senior advisor, Mohammed Atef, to a different part of Kandahar and his deputy, Ayman al Zawahiri, to Kabul so that all three could not be killed in one attack. There was no American strike. In February 2001, a source reported that an individual whom he identified as the big instructor (probably a reference to Bin Laden) complained frequently that the United States had not yet attacked. According to the source, Bin Laden wanted the United States to attack, and if it did not he would launch something bigger. The attack on the USS Cole galvanized al Qaeda's recruitment efforts. Following the attack, Bin Laden instructed the media committee, then headed by Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, to produce a propaganda video that included a reenactment of the attack along with images of the al Qaeda training camps and training methods; it also highlighted Muslim suffering in Palestine, Kashmir, Indonesia, and Chechnya. Al Qaeda's image was very important to Bin Laden, and the video was widely disseminated. Portions were aired on Al Jazeera, CNN, and other television outlets. It was also disseminated among many young men in Saudi Arabia and Yemen, and caused many extremists to travel to Afghanistan for training and jihad. Al Qaeda members considered the video an effective tool in their struggle for preeminence among other Islamist and jihadist movements.

Q:Found the following article online, use it to answer the question: What are the last name of the two art critics who wrote about Virgin of Solitude? A number of plates in this group reveal a scepticism towards idolatry of religious images. There are instances in the group where early Christian iconography, in particular statues and processional images, are mocked and denigrated. Plate 67, Esta no lo es menos (This is no less curious), shows two statues carried by two stooped members of clergy. One statue is recognisable as the \\"Virgin of Solitude\\". In Goya's image, the statue is not carried vertically in processional triumph, rather it lies flat and undignified on the backs of the two almost crouched men. Shown horizontal, the object loses its aura, and becomes a mere everyday object. Art critics Victor Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch wrote, \\"It is in effect a deposed, toppled image, stripped of its powers and its connotations.\\" Goya is making a general statement: that the Church's attempts to support and restore the Bourbons were \\"illusory, since what they proposed was nothing more than the adoration of an empty form\\".The published edition of The Disasters of War ends as it begins; with the portrayal of a single, agonized figure.

In 1973, Ray Davies dived headlong into the theatrical style, beginning with the rock opera Preservation, a sprawling chronicle of social revolution, and a more ambitious outgrowth of the earlier Village Green Preservation Society ethos. In conjunction with the Preservation project, the Kinks' line-up was expanded to include a horn section and female backup singers, essentially reconfiguring the group as a theatrical troupe.Ray Davies' marital problems during this period began to affect the band adversely, particularly after his wife, Rasa, took their children and left him in June 1973. Davies became depressed; during a July gig at White City Stadium he told the audience he was \\"fucking sick of the whole thing\\", and was retiring. He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was taken to hospital. With Ray Davies in a seemingly critical condition, plans were discussed for Dave to continue as frontman in a worst-case scenario. Ray recovered from his illness as well as his depression, but throughout the remainder of the Kinks' theatrical incarnation the band's output remained uneven, and their already fading popularity declined even more. John Dalton later commented that when Davies \\"decided to work again ... I don't think he was totally better, and he's been a different person ever since.\\"Preservation Act 1 (1973) and Preservation Act 2 (1974) received generally poor reviews. The story on the albums involved an anti-hero called Mr Flash, and his rival and enemy Mr Black (played by Dave Davies during live shows), an ultra-purist and corporatist. Preservation Act 2 was the first album recorded at Konk Studio; from this point forward, virtually every Kinks studio recording was produced by Ray Davies at Konk. The band embarked on an ambitious US tour throughout late 1974, adapting the Preservation story for stage. Musicologist Eric Weisbard: \\"[Ray] Davies expanded the Kinks into a road troupe of perhaps a dozen costumed actors, singers and horn players. ...

We'll start by moving the terms containing x to one side. In this case, we'll move the 204*x term to the right side of the equation. 204*x - 7751 - 204*x = 541*x - 204*x Step 2: Simplify the equation. Now, simplify the equation by subtracting the x terms: -7751 = 337*x (Since 541*x - 204*x = 337*x) Step 3: Solve for x. To find the value of x, divide both sides of the equation by 337: -7751 / 337 = 337*x / 337 Now, perform the division: x = -23 (approximately, since -7751 / 337 is approximately -23) The solution to the equation 204*x - 7751 = 541*x is x ≈ -23."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Stewards finally alerted by coach David Platt and he was arrested.","completion":"Title: Simon Brodkin's Prank as Jason Bent at Goodison Park: From Stretching to Arrested Introduction: Behind every iconic prank, a tale of guts, wits, and comedic timing wraps the audience on an unforgettable entertaining journey. One such event took place at Goodison Park when a British comedian, Simon Brodkin, left the crowd stunned and amused. His clever antics not only put smiles on the faces of thousands of spectators but also earned him a page in history as one of the boldest pranksters. Here's an in-depth analysis of the adventurous day when Brodkin hopped onto Goodison Park dressed as his alter ego, Jason Bent, and pulled an incredible prank that ultimately led to his arrest. The Audacious Arrival: The date was the 16th of March, 2013, an ordinary weekend on the pitch in the world of soccer. Little did the attendees know that laughter and shock awaited them. Goodison Park was bustling with excitement and anticipation for the Premier League clash between Everton and Manchester City. Simon Brodkin, known for his daring pranks and impersonations, decided to take advantage of this opportune moment and execute a bold prank. Disguised as his alter ego, Jason Bent, a fictitious footballer renowned for his ostentatious lifestyle, Brodkin entered the prestigious grounds of Goodison Park. With his unmatched comedic timing, Simon turned his character, Bent, into an international star, making viewers think he was a new signing on Manchester City ready to take the field. Stretching Alongside the Football Stars: Gaining access to the pitch, Brodkin, in character as Jason Bent, joined the Manchester City football squad, including the likes of Joe Hart and Kolo Toure. He effortlessly integrated himself into the group, making fans and players alike question his identity. Adding to the prank's authenticity, Brodkin began stretching alongside the City stars as if he were a member of the team. Confusion and intrigue spread among the crowds, players, and team management as Brodkin continued to warm up in plain sight, unbeknownst to most that they were witnessing a truly unforgettable prank. The Moment of Realization and Confrontation: Brodkin's impersonation as Bent had everyone on the pitch fooled for some time. However, upon noticing the apparent imposter, Manchester City coach David Platt alerted the stewards to their uninvited guest. Hastily, the stewards sprang into action, confronting Brodkin and escorting him off the field. The tension in the air eventually turned to amusement as the situation became apparent and the crowd realized the lengths Simon Brodkin had gone to pull off an awe-inspiring prank. The sheer audacity and brilliant execution of the prank amped up the excitement leading into the Everton vs. Manchester City match. Arrest and Aftermath: Despite the laughter and bewildered reactions from the crowd, the prank wasn't taken as lightly by authorities. Brodkin was arrested under the suspicion of pitch encroachment, a serious offense in the footballing world. Subsequently, he was charged and summoned to court, where he plead guilty to charges related to the incident. Though this seemingly harmless prank led to Brodkin's arrest, it goes to show that not everyone appreciates humor and pranks, especially when it concerns their profession. The consequences of Brodkin's prank should be a lesson for future pranksters to consider when pushing the boundaries of comedy and entertainment. Conclusion: Simon Brodkin's audacious prank as Jason Bent at Goodison Park goes down in memory as one of the most well-executed and daring pranks in modern football history. From sneaking onto the pitch to doing stretches with the stars to the eventual arrest, the unforgettable day showcased Brodkin's commitment to his comedic craft and talent for impersonation. While he may have paid a price for his prank, Brodkin delighted thousands of fans that day, and the story of his escapades as Jason Bent remains a symbol of humor, audacity, and cleverness in the era of elaborate pranks."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The process describes echolocation, a technique used by bats to navigate and find prey by emitting sound waves and analyzing the echoes that return after bouncing off objects in their environment. The steps involved in this process are: 1. Bats fly through an area. 2. The bat makes sounds with their mouth or nose. 3. The sound waves travel away from the bat. 4. The sound waves hit objects. 5. The sound waves bounce off the objects back towards the bat. 6. The bat hears the sound waves echoing off the objects. 7. The bat knows where the objects are because of where the sound echoed from. 8. The bat doesn't hurt itself by hitting the objects. Now, let's consider the scenario where more factories are created and more sound waves are produced outside. The presence of additional sound waves in the environment would not directly impact any specific step of the echolocation process. The bat would still perform echolocation in the same way, and the steps themselves would remain unchanged. However, the presence of more sound waves from external sources, such as factories, would indirectly impact the process of echolocation. These additional sound waves might make it more difficult for the bat to differentiate between the echoes generated by its own echolocation calls and the ambient noise from the factories. This could potentially interfere with the bat's ability to accurately perceive its surroundings (step 6, where the bat hears the sound waves echoing off objects), leading to an indirect impact on the process. In summary, the increased presence of external sound waves caused by more factories would indirectly impact the process of echolocation, particularly regarding the bat's ability to hear and interpret the echoes of their own calls amidst the additional ambient noise."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Founded on June 13, 1942, Wild Bill Donovan headed what wartime intelligence agency that eventually became the CIA????","completion":"The wartime intelligence agency founded on June 13, 1942, and headed by William Joseph \\"Wild Bill\\" Donovan was the Office of Strategic Services (OSS). This agency was a precursor to what would later become the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the United States. William J. Donovan, a highly decorated World War I veteran, lawyer, and Republican politician, was appointed as the chief of the OSS by President Franklin D. Roosevelt. Donovan previously served as the Coordinator of Information (COI), which was a position created by Roosevelt in 1941 to directly oversee various intelligence activities in the United States. Due to the disjointed nature of intelligence operations during WWII and an urgent need for more centralized and coordinated efforts, the OSS was formed. The OSS had a comprehensive mandate consisting of five main branches: 1. Research and Analysis (R&A): This branch was responsible for conducting strategic analysis, gathering and evaluating information, and providing it to policymakers to make well-informed decisions. This section employed multiple researchers, scholars, and analysts who possessed expertise in various fields such as economics, history, and languages. 2. Special Operations (SO): The SO branch focused on unconventional warfare methods and involved itself in covert military operations against the Axis powers, such as sabotage and guerrilla warfare. This teamwork closely with the British Special Operations Executive (SOE) and conducted joint operations with them. 3. Secret Intelligence (SI): This division was primarily responsible for espionage activities, including the recruitment and management of human intelligence sources (spies). 4. Counterintelligence (X-2): As the name suggests, the X-2 branch was responsible for maintaining the security of OSS operations and countering enemy intelligence activities. It was mandated to detect and eliminate enemy spies and conduct counterespionage to prevent the leakage of sensitive information. 5. Morale Operations (MO): This branch conducted psychological warfare and propaganda operations targeting the morale and beliefs of enemy soldiers and civilians. This would include the creation and distribution of disinformation, leaflets, and radio broadcasts to demoralize the enemy and rally support for the Allied cause. After World War II, the OSS was disbanded on September 20, 1945, and its functions were temporarily delegated to various departments of the U.S. government. However, because of the urgent need for a centralized intelligence operation during the early Cold War, President Harry S. Truman signed the National Security Act in 1947 that led to the creation of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA). Many former OSS operatives and personnel became the founding members of the CIA, transferring their experience and expertise to the newly established organization. The CIA continues to be a crucial entity in America's national security apparatus, playing a significant role in intelligence gathering and analysis, counterterrorism, and covert operations."},{"prompt":"User will you give you a task with some instruction.

Paragraph: The H7 subtype avian influenza threatens public health with respect to poultry and humans. Thus, a specific and sensitive diagnostic test is essential for the management of H7 subtype influenza infections. In this study, five mouse monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against hemagglutinin (HA) of influenza A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) were produced and characterized by the Western blot, immunofluorescence, and hemagglutination inhibition assays. All five specific mAbs reacted with the HA protein of H7N9 but not with that of H1N1, H3N2, or H5N1. With the combination arrays of capture and detection antibodies, the matched pair mAbs (1C4-coated and 2D7-labeled) were selected and employed in a double-antibody sandwich ELISA (DAS-ELISA). Detection limits of the sandwich ELISA were 0.45 ng mL -1 for the HA protein derived from A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9); or 1 and 2 HA units/50 µL for A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) and A/GD/17SF003/2016 (H7N9), respectively.

Summarize this article: The money - worth Â£119bn this year - could be used to provide more joined-up care across the hospital, mental health and care sectors, the party believes. In a speech on Thursday, shadow health secretary Andy Burnham will say the current arrangements are outdated. He will claim \\"dangerous\\" gaps between services put the vulnerable at risk. The proposal could see councils get much more involved in making decisions about the NHS, while the biggest hospitals may end up expanding into the community, perhaps even running care homes. But government sources suggested such a move could end up undermining clinical commissioning groups - the new bodies which are taking control of the health budget under the government reforms. That would mean \\"taking power away from doctors and nurses\\", they said. Combining the budgets will also require changes to the way money is distributed round the system. And it would raise a question mark over the means testing of social care. Currently those with assets over Â£23,250 have to pay for help, but how that could be enforced in a combined system is unclear. But Mr Burnham will deny the plan is any sort of reorganisation when he addresses an audience of health professionals in London. He will dub the proposal, which is being put out to consultation, as \\"whole-person care\\". \\"As we live longer, people's needs become a blur of physical, mental and social. \\"It is just not possible to disaggregate them and meet them through our three separate services. \\"But that's what we're still trying to do.\\" He will say that hospitals are at risk of becoming \\"warehouses\\" for the elderly as social care support is being cut back. \\"We are paying for failure on a grand scale, allowing people to fail at home and drift into expensive hospital beds and from there into expensive care homes. \\"The trouble is no-one has the incentive to invest in prevention.\\" Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents health managers, said: \\"Mr Burnham is absolutely right to highlight the long-term pressures facing the NHS and the need for radical change to address them. \\"A cocktail of financial pressure and demographic change means that the NHS needs to adapt to meet the needs of today's patients. \\"We urgently need an all-party debate about these issues, with radical solutions very much allowed.

Patrick Tourneboeuf / tendance floue A sofa in a psychoanalyst's office, Paris, France. On Saturday, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) finalized a 13-year process of revising the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, commonly known as the DSM, the most important book in the field of mental illness. The DSM attempts to designate and code all the ways our minds can go awry. It defines depression, anxiety, schizophrenia — as well as more than 300 other problems from obsessive-compulsive disorder to stuttering to fetishism. Insurance companies require DSM codes for reimbursement, and the National Institutes of Health require them for research grants. It’s no exaggeration to say that the new DSM — the fifth full edition, one that more than 1,500 mental-health experts help write — will change the world of mental health. Here are some of the biggest changes: 1. Autistic disorder will become autism-spectrum disorder. That spectrum will incorporate Asperger’s syndrome, which generally involves milder forms of autism’s social impairments and previously had its own code number (299.80). To guide clinicians, the DSM will include specific examples of patients meeting criteria for the different disorders making up the spectrum, from autistic disorder to Asperger’s, childhood-disintegrative disorder and pervasive developmental disorder (not otherwise specified). Combining autism and Asperger’s is especially controversial partly because autism can be so much more serious than Asperger’s. Although some autistic people function extremely well (the livestock expert Temple Grandin has helped change her field), others affected by the disorder need lifelong care for basic needs. The change will likely cause considerable debate, however, since the diagnosis is a requirement for access to some of the educational and social services that make up this care, and it’s not clear yet how the change in definition will affect such eligibility in the future. (MORE: DSM-5 Debate: Committee Backs Off Some Changes, Reopens Comments) 2. Binge-eating disorder will be moved from DSM‘s Appendix B — a category of proposed conditions that require “further study” — to a full-blown illness in the main part of the book. The shift will create a significant new market for mental-health professionals who will now be able to apply for insurance reimbursement for patients who binge eat. A major criticism of considering binge eating a distinct disorder is the difficulty in distinguishing whether consuming an entire pint of Ben & Jerry’s could be a sign of depression or anxiety rather than an illness of its own. But in recognizing recent research that suggests that there are unique features to binge eating involving distorted-body-image issues, the APA in its press release on the DSM changes says that “the [binge-eating-disorder] change is intended to better represent the symptoms and behaviors of people with this condition.” 3. The new DSM will remove the exception for bereavement from the definition of depression, which means psychiatrists will be able to diagnose depressive disorder even among those who have just lost a loved one. For years, skeptics have criticized the APA for its expansive meaning of depression; now that definition is even broader. 4. Continuing the expansion of diagnostic criteria, the new DSM will also include a controversial new diagnosis called “disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD),” a label that can be attached to “children who exhibit persistent irritability and frequent episodes of behavior outbursts three or more times a week for more than a year.” Earlier this year, the Huffington Post called DMDD the “tantrum diagnosis,” and a blogger for Wired warned that the new disorder “could be anything, like the meltdown when the shoes can’t be found, the homework got lost, or the braids aren’t quite right.” But the APA says the new diagnosis “is intended to address concerns about potential over-diagnosis and over-treatment of bipolar disorder in children.” (MORE: The Trouble with Talk Therapy) 5. DSM-5 will also incorporate the extremely rare disorders of excoriation (skin picking) and hoarding. The current DSM does list trichotillomania (obsessive hair pulling), but adding reality-show problems such as skin picking and hoarding has bolstered criticisms of diagnosis creep. Hoarding was previously considered a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. What will not be added to the DSM is hypersexual disorder — sex addiction — even though many APA members argued for its inclusion. According to one member of the APA’s board of trustees: “The evidence just wasn’t there.” Other mental-health professionals note that the DSM is subject to political influence. “This is a huge moneymaker for the American Psychiatric Association,” says Marsha Linehan, a University of Washington professor and a leading expert on personality disorders. The decisions reflect the votes of the APA’s board of trustees; the entire membership will vote on the revisions later in the spring, but experts don’t expect additional alterations. Which means that the approval this weekend of DSM-5 ends years of editing but begins years of debate.

The APA announced it would drop Asperger's syndrome from its upcoming fifth edition of the psychiatrists' handbook, among the first changes to the manual in about 20 years. / Amazon.com Asperger's syndrome will be dropped from the latest edition of the psychiatrist's \\"bible,\\" the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, or DSM-5. The American Psychiatric Association (APA) announced on Saturday the changes to its flagship manual that doctors use to diagnose patients with mental disorders. It's the first major rewriter to the DSM in nearly 20 years. The familiar \\"Asperger's,\\" along with some similar disorders, will be lumped together under autism spectrum disorder, \\"to help more accurately and consistently diagnose children with autism,\\" the APA said in a statement. Other changes include entries for new disorders such as \\"hoarding disorder\\" or \\"disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD),\\" the latter characterized by abnormally bad and frequent temper tantrums. \\"Dyslexia\\" and other learning disorders that some feared would be removed from the manual, remained. \\"We developed DSM-5 by utilizing the best experts in the field and extensive reviews of the scientific literature and original research, and we have produced a manual that best represents the current science and will be useful to clinicians and the patients they serve,\\" APA president Dr. Dilip Jeste, said in a written statement. Full details of all the revisions will come in May 2013 when the APA's new manual is published, but the impact will be huge, affecting millions of children and adults worldwide. The manual also is important for the insurance industry in deciding what treatment to pay for, and it helps schools decide how to allot special education. It \\"shapes who will receive what treatment,\\" said Dr. Mark Olfson, a Columbia University psychiatry professor who was not involved in the revision process. More important, he said, \\"Even seemingly subtle changes to the criteria can have substantial effects on patterns of care.\\" The aim is not to expand the number of people diagnosed with mental illness, but to ensure that affected children and adults are more accurately diagnosed so they can get the most appropriate treatment, said Dr. David Kupfer, who chaired the task force in charge of revising the manual, and is a psychiatry professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Autism: Can it be outgrown? Study links flu with autism risk Autism-spectrum disorders: 24 warning signs One of the most hotly argued topics ahead of the revisions was how to define the various ranges of autism. Some advocates opposed the idea of dropping the specific diagnosis for Asperger's. People with that disorder often have high intelligence and vast knowledge on narrow subjects but lack social skills. Some who have the condition embrace their quirkiness and vow to continue to use the label. And some Asperger's families opposed any change, fearing their kids would lose a diagnosis and no longer be eligible for special services. Lori Sherry, president of the Asperger Syndrome Education Network, told the New York Times in March, \\"Our fear is that we are going to take a big step backward. If clinicians say, 'These kids don't fit the criteria for an autism spectrum diagnosis,' they are not going to get the supports and services they need, and they're going to experience failure.\\" But the revision will not affect their education services, experts say. The new manual adds the term \\"autism spectrum disorder,\\" which already is used by many experts in the field. Asperger's will be dropped and incorporated under that umbrella diagnosis, which will also include kids with severe autism, who often don't talk or interact, as well as those with milder forms. Kelli Gibson of Battle Creek, Mich., who has four sons with various forms of autism, said Saturday she welcomes the change. Her boys all had different labels in the old diagnostic manual, including a 14-year-old with Asperger's. \\"To give it separate names never made sense to me,\\" Gibson said. \\"To me, my children all had autism.\\" Three of her boys receive special education services in public school; the fourth is enrolled in a school for disabled children. The new autism diagnosis won't affect those services, said Gibson, who also has a 3-year-old daughter without autism. People with dyslexia also were closely watching for the new updated doctors' guide. Many with the reading disorder did not want their diagnosis to be dropped -- and it won't be. Instead, the new manual will have a broader learning disorder category to cover several conditions including dyslexia, which causes difficulty understanding letters and recognizing written words. The trustees on Saturday made the final decision on what proposals made the cut; recommendations came from experts in several work groups assigned to evaluate different mental illnesses. The revised guidebook \\"represents a significant step forward for the field. It will improve our ability to accurately diagnose psychiatric disorders,\\" Dr. David Fassler, the group's treasurer and a University of Vermont psychiatry professor, said after the vote. Group leaders said specifics won't be disclosed until the manual is published but they confirmed some changes. A 2000 edition of the manual made minor changes but the last major edition was published in 1994. Olfson said the manual \\"seeks to capture the current state of knowledge of psychiatric disorders. Since 2000 ... there have been important advances in our understanding of the nature of psychiatric disorders.\\" Dr. Catherine Lord, an autism expert at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who was on the psychiatric group's autism task force, said anyone who met criteria for Asperger's in the old manual would be included in the new diagnosis. One reason for the change is that some states and school systems don't provide services for children and adults with Asperger's, or provide fewer services than those given an autism diagnosis, she said. Autism researcher Dr. Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer for the advocacy group Autism Speaks, expressed \\"cautious optimism\\" at the revisions. She said small studies have suggested the new criteria will be effective. But she said it will be crucial to monitor so that children don't lose services, a major concern of the organization that it has discussed with the committee during the revision process. \\"We are reassured that the DSM-5 committee has stated that all individuals who currently have a diagnosis on the autism spectrum, including those with Asperger syndrome, will be able to retain an ASD diagnosis,\\" Dawson wrote on Autism Speaks' website. \\"This means that no one with a current diagnosis on the autism spectrum should \\"lose\\" their diagnosis because of the changes in diagnostic criteria.\\" Other changes to the manual include: *Hoarding disorder will be added to the DSM-5 to help characterize people who can't part with possessions, regardless of their actual value. The APA says the disorder usually has emotional, physical, social, financial and even legal effects for a hoarder and family members. *A new diagnosis called disruptive mood dysregulation disorder, or DMDD, for children with recurrent temper tantrums. Critics say it will medicalize kids' who have normal tantrums while supporters argue it will address concerns about too many kids being misdiagnosed with bipolar disorder and treated with powerful psychiatric drugs. Bipolar disorder involves sharp mood swings and affected children are sometimes very irritable or have explosive tantrums. *A new obsessive-compulsive and related disorder called excoriation, or skin-picking, disorder. *Removing a bereavement exclusion from depression criteria that previously applied to people who experienced symptoms lasting less than two months following the death of a loved one. The APA now says bereavement is a severe psychosocial stressor that can trigger major depression soon after the death of a loved one. *Eliminating the term \\"gender identity disorder,\\" which has been used for children or adults who strongly believe that they were born the wrong gender. But many activists believe the condition isn't a disorder and say calling it one is stigmatizing. The term would be replaced with \\"gender dysphoria,\\" which means emotional distress over one's gender. Supporters equated the change with removing homosexuality as a mental illness in the diagnostic manual, which happened decades ago. ||||| What is a one-paragraph summary of the above article?","completion":"The American Psychiatric Association (APA) has revised the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), a book used by mental health professionals to diagnose mental illnesses.

Martin's first recording session with the Beatles took place at EMI's Abbey Road Studios in London on 6 June 1962. Martin immediately complained to Epstein about Best's poor drumming and suggested they use a session drummer in his place. Already contemplating Best's dismissal, the Beatles replaced him in mid-August with Ringo Starr, who left Rory Storm and the Hurricanes to join them. A 4 September session at EMI yielded a recording of \\"Love Me Do\\" featuring Starr on drums, but a dissatisfied Martin hired drummer Andy White for the band's third session a week later, which produced recordings of \\"Love Me Do\\", \\"Please Please Me\\" and \\"P.S. I Love You\\".Martin initially selected the Starr version of \\"Love Me Do\\" for the band's first single, though subsequent re-pressings featured the White version, with Starr on tambourine. Released in early October, \\"Love Me Do\\" peaked at number seventeen on the Record Retailer chart. Their television debut came later that month with a live performance on the regional news programme People and Places.

Steve Huey of AllMusic wrote that Thriller refined the strengths of Off the Wall; the dance and rock tracks were more aggressive, while the pop tunes and ballads were softer and more soulful. Its tracks included the ballads \\"The Lady in My Life\\", \\"Human Nature\\", and \\"The Girl Is Mine\\", the funk pieces \\"Billie Jean\\" and \\"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\\", and the disco set \\"Baby Be Mine\\" and \\"P.Y.T.

The album's title track suggested to the critic a parallel between Jackson and Stevie Wonder's \\"oddball\\" music personas: \\"Since childhood his main contact with the real world has been on stage and in bed.\\" With Thriller, Christopher Connelly of Rolling Stone commented that Jackson developed his long association with the subliminal theme of paranoia and darker imagery.

The acid in the lemon juice helps make the dead and dry skin easier to remove. After your feet have soaked for the 10 minutes, use a pumice stone or foot file to remove the dead and dry skin. Foot razors/shavers are available for purchase at many drug and department stores, but are not recommended by doctors. They have also become illegal to use in a spa setting in many states. The reason is that they can cause nicks and cuts on your feet which can very easily become infected - especially in a spa environment. Put a spoonful of olive oil in a small bottle with a lid. Add a few drops of lemon or lavender oil to the bottle. Place the lid tightly on the bottle and shake until the liquid inside the bottle turns thick and milky. Apply to your feet, especially your heels, to help moisturize your skin. You can store the bottle for future use, just remember to shake it each time. Start by having a bath or shower where you wash your feet, or wash your feet on their own. Dry your feet off with a towel, including between your toes. Apply a layer of vegetable oil all over your feet and then put on a thick pair of socks. Go to bed and leave the socks on. You may find your dry feet feeling a lot better in only a few days. The oil may stain fabric, like your socks, so choose a pair of socks you don't mind if they get stained by the oil. The socks will also help prevent your sheets from being stained by the oil. Combine 1 tablespoon (14.8 ml) of Vaseline (or a similar product) and the juice from 1 lemon into a bowl, then mix the two ingredients together. Either have a bath or shower where you wash your feet, or just wash your feet on their own. Dry your feet completely with a towel. Apply ALL the mixture to both your feet, then put on a pair of thick wool socks. Go to bed. In the morning, take off the socks and scrub the excess dead skin off your feet. Wool socks are used in this case as they won't allow the mixture to soak through and stain your bedsheets. Choose socks that you don't mind if they get this oily mixture on them. First, melt the wax in a large bowl in the microwave (or a double boiler if you have one). Add an equal amount of mustard oil to the melted wax. Check to make sure that the wax is safely warm to the touch before dipping one foot into the bowl and covering your foot with the wax mixture. Take your foot out of the bowl and allow the wax to dry, then dip the same foot again. Wrap your foot in plastic wrap, or put it inside a plastic bag. Repeat the same procedure on your other foot. Sit for about 15 minutes, then remove the wax and plastic. Mustard oil helps to strengthen and moisturize the skin on your feet.

Protests Planned Across Europe While Germany Delays Signing ACTA Protests against Internet censorship will blanket Europe this weekend, while Germany and Latvia announced Friday they would put the brakes on signing a copyright treaty that has sparked controversy across the continent. More than 200,000 people have committed to attending rallies in 200 cities to protest the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, or “ACTA.” “The map of planned protests is just breathtaking,” said Holmes Wilson, co-founder of anti-ACTA group Fight for the Future. “You’ve got tens of thousands of people taking to the streets in small cities, in countries where large street protests are not common.” Proponents of ACTA say that the treaty will help fight global copyright theft. Opponents, fresh off the SOPA and PIPA battlefields, argue that ACTA will harm free speech on the Internet. They also accuse the treaty’s architects of holding negotiations away from the public eye. “This is truly the Internet’s Arab Spring,” said Fight for the Future co-founder Tiffiniy Cheng. “People are rising up against anti-democratic laws that stifle individual freedoms. And they’re organizing spontaneously, without leaders, using tools available to everyone.” Public opposition to the treaty has already struck Europe. Last month, thousands of people in Poland took to the streets in protest while the European rapporteur for ACTA resigned after calling the negotiation process a “charade.” It appears some European leaders have been listening to ACTA’s naysayers. Germany and Latvia’s decision to delay signing ACTA puts them in league with Poland, the Czech Republic and Slovakia, who have also halted the process. A German foreign ministry spokesperson said that the country needed “time to carry out further discussions” about the treaty, the BBC reported. ACTA was signed by the U.S. and Japan in 2006. Australia, Canada, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore and South Korea signed on last year and the European Union signed last month, but no country’s legislature has yet ratified the treaty. ACTA will go into force when ratified by at least six countries. Would you hit the streets to protest ACTA? Is ACTA just as bad as SOPA and PIPA? Let us know in the comments below.

The other 'mandate': Foes of contraception rule to sustain legal battle if ObamaCare upheld A Supreme Court ruling on the federal health care overhaul is expected Thursday, and all eyes are on the fate of the individual mandate -- the endangered provision requiring most Americans to buy health insurance. But unless the entire law is struck down, another \\"mandate\\" that's nearly as controversial will live on. And opponents of the so-called contraception mandate are planning to sustain their legal challenge against the rule once the frenzy over the Supreme Court decision dies down. The lawsuits will \\"all go forward\\" if any part of the health care overhaul is left standing, said Hannah Smith, senior counsel with The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty. Smith's group spearheaded the legal fight against the contraception mandate and is currently engaged in four separate federal lawsuits on behalf of four religious institutions. Earlier this year, dozens of other Catholic universities and groups filed their own set of coordinated lawsuits against the regulation. All told, Smith said there are now 23 lawsuits in 14 states and the District of Columbia involving more than 50 plaintiffs. At issue is the requirement from the federal health care overhaul that employers provide access to contraceptive care. The Obama administration several months ago softened its position on the mandate, but some religious organizations complained the administration did not go far enough to ensure the rule would not compel them to violate their religious beliefs. Smith said the rule has forced religious organizations to make a choice between violating their beliefs and potentially shutting down. \\"It's a very significant choice,\\" she said. Smith said her group's clients would all opt to disobey the Obama administration rule -- in turn subjecting themselves to a 2,000-per-employee fine. She estimated this could cost those groups between 300,000 and 600,000 a year starting in 2013. The Becket Fund argues that the provision violates what's known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act -- a federal law that bars rules that would impose a substantial burden on religious expression. The Obama administration is currently trying to get the case dismissed, to allow time for the federal government to come up with its compromise measure. The Obama administration originally pitched the free birth control plan as another way to expand access to health care and coverage -- the overarching goal of the federal health care law. President Obama claimed this year that while many had \\"genuine concerns\\" about the proposal, others were using it as a \\"political football.\\" The contraception rule does include an exemption for religious organizations -- but that exemption does not cover many religious-affiliated organizations like schools and charities. Complaints about the narrowly tailored exemption prompted a stand-off between the Obama administration and religious groups earlier this year. As a compromise, Obama and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius decided insurers -- and not the religious-affiliated organizations themselves -- would be required to offer contraceptive coverage directly. If the Supreme Court throws out the entirety of the health care overhaul this week, then the lawsuits over the contraception mandate would fizzle. But the challenges are expected to continue in every other scenario -- even if the court strikes down the individual mandate only. Doing that would not impact the administration's contraception rule. Like many foes of the health care law, Smith said her group was \\"cautiously optimistic\\" the court would strike down the entire law and in turn make the ongoing suits unnecessary. She claimed that would be a \\"great victory for religious liberty.\\" What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"The article reports on the continuous legal battles related to the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as ObamaCare). Specifically, it focuses on the controversial contraception mandate that requires most American employers to provide access to contraceptive care. While a Supreme Court ruling on the overall health care act is anticipated, critics of the contraception mandate are preparing to continue their legal fight if the overall law is not brought down. This mandate has led to multiple lawsuits by religious institutions and groups, who argue that the rule forces them to compromise their religious beliefs. They claim that refusal to obey the rule may result in substantial fines and pose a threat to their operational viability. It is noted that the issue could be dissolved if the entire Affordable Care Act is overturned by the Supreme Court. However, legal challenges are expected to persist in the event that only parts of the act, other than the contraception mandate, are annulled. The opponents are hopeful about the complete overturning of the act, considering it to be a victory for religious liberty."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

This blog aims to provide further understanding of AP and transparency in our operations and mission. ||||| Widely Cited The Times is one of the first major news organizations to take a firm stand against a growing and disliked practice. The Times has dismantled its environmental pod and discontinued the Green blog. The public editor looks into a test drive of an electric car that caused a storm. The statistical wizard's offer to wager on the outcome of the presidential race is a bad choice. How does The Times decide which comments to post on NYTimes.com? The public editor gets answers from The Times's online commenting managers. Readers complained to the public editor over The Times's decision to display a photograph of the unconscious ambassador in Libya. Government Secrecy and Bradley Manning Those who reveal classified material are being punished like never before. When the government asks newspapers to keep quiet, the bar should be very high for saying yes. Editors were asked by the C.I.A. to withhold information and did so for months before publishing it online Tuesday night. Scott Shane, a Times national security reporter, was referred to in the government’s prosecution of a former C.I.A. official. Bradley Manning and WikiLeaks are a major story for The Times, so why was the paper so late to cover the soldier’s pretrial hearing? The testimony is riveting and the surrounding issues are newsworthy. Just who is it that the United States is killing with strikes by unmanned aircraft in Yemen and Pakistan? The First Amendment matters for many reasons, some of them not on the world stage. False Balance and Objectivity in Reporting The public editor travels to Harvard’s Shorenstein Center. With audio. Is the concept outdated or even more important in the new media era? The journalistic ideal of impartiality is coming under attack. My column for this week. The public editor speaks with Times editors about how they plan to fact-check the first presidential debate. When opinion appears in news pages, it needs to be labeled and displayed as just that. Whatever the conclusions, whatever the effectiveness, of challenging facts, the idea that we have to debate the necessity of the media doing so strikes me as absurd. Language and Semantics The Times is reconsidering the use of the term \\"illegal immigrant.\\" An article coyly wrote around a business name that used an unprintable word according to The Times's standards. A crisis in North Africa and a reader’s query bring up crucial distinctions in usage. Families are rightfully upset by some of the early reporting done on the Newtown, Conn., shootings. The research and development team’s Chronicle tool may distract you while you’re waiting for the returns to come in. Unidentified sources make it difficult for readers to know what to believe regarding negotiations between the United States and Iran. The public editor's judgment is not about immigration reform; it's about clarity and accuracy. An activist wants The Times to stop using the term \\"illegal immigrant\\" in its reporting. Gender, Race and Ethnicity After criticism on Twitter and elsewhere, the first sentence of an obituary for Yvonne Brill was changed. A front-page article involving the New York Police Department's internal communication could have provided greater context. A headline ignites a discussion about its \\"undermining\\" question. News organizations should evaluate the motivations of parents who want to take their child’s story public. Parental approval and the child’s own willingness should rule the day. Readers complained about the absence of people of color in T: The Times Style Magazine. The Times Magazine interviewer offended some high-profile female writers with his questions. Where, after what seemed like women's night on Tuesday at the Democratic National Convention, was the coverage of pay equity, along with gender-economic issues in general? Culture Criticism Michael Kimmelman views architecture in terms of public policy as well as aesthetics. The criticism of a new restaurant in Times Square was delicious, even if the food was not. The critic Pete Wells gave his first “poor” restaurant rating in The Times -- and he did it memorably. Cathy Horyn's work can't please everyone -- but this is ridiculous. ||||| Associated Press rethinks ‘illegal immigrant’ The Associated Press announced this Stylebook change on Tuesday afternoon: AP notice “Illegal immigrant” no more The AP Stylebook today is making some changes in how we describe people living in a country illegally. Senior Vice President and Executive Editor Kathleen Carroll explains the thinking behind the decision: The Stylebook no longer sanctions the term “illegal immigrant” or the use of “illegal” to describe a person. Instead, it tells users that “illegal” should describe only an action, such as living in or immigrating to a country illegally. Why did we make the change? The discussions on this topic have been wide-ranging and include many people from many walks of life. (Earlier, they led us to reject descriptions such as “undocumented,” despite ardent support from some quarters, because it is not precise. A person may have plenty of documents, just not the ones required for legal residence.) Those discussions continued even after AP affirmed “illegal immigrant” as the best use, for two reasons. A number of people felt that “illegal immigrant” was the best choice at the time. They also believed the always-evolving English language might soon yield a different choice and we should stay in the conversation. Also, we had in other areas been ridding the Stylebook of labels. The new section on mental health issues argues for using credibly sourced diagnoses instead of labels. Saying someone was “diagnosed with schizophrenia” instead of schizophrenic, for example. And that discussion about labeling people, instead of behavior, led us back to “illegal immigrant” again. We concluded that to be consistent, we needed to change our guidance. So we have. Is this the best way to describe someone in a country without permission? We believe that it is for now. We also believe more evolution is likely down the road. Will the new guidance make it harder for writers? Perhaps just a bit at first. But while labels may be more facile, they are not accurate. I suspect now we will hear from some language lovers who will find other labels in the AP Stylebook. We welcome that engagement. Get in touch at stylebook@ap.org or, if you are an AP Stylebook Online subscriber, through the “Ask the Editor” page. Change is a part of AP Style because the English language is constantly evolving, enriched by new words, phrases and uses. Our goal always is to use the most precise and accurate words so that the meaning is clear to any reader anywhere. # The updated entry is being added immediately to the AP Stylebook Online and Manual de Estilo Online de la AP, the new Spanish-language Stylebook. It also will appear in the new print edition and Stylebook Mobile, coming out later in the spring. It reads as follows: illegal immigration Entering or residing in a country in violation of civil or criminal law. Except in direct quotes essential to the story, use illegal only to refer to an action, not a person: illegal immigration, but not illegal immigrant. Acceptable variations include living in or entering a country illegally or without legal permission. Except in direct quotations, do not use the terms illegal alien, an illegal, illegals or undocumented. Do not describe people as violating immigration laws without attribution. Specify wherever possible how someone entered the country illegally and from where. Crossed the border? Overstayed a visa? What nationality? People who were brought into the country as children should not be described as having immigrated illegally. For people granted a temporary right to remain in the U.S. under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, use temporary resident status, with details on the program lower in the story. —- From a Tuesday post on the Minnesota Public Radio (MRP) website: “Today, MPR ran an Associated Press story — Bill: Instate tuition for illegal immigrants — that used the term [‘illegal immigrant’] three times.” UPDATE: New York Times is also reconsidering its use of “illegal immigrant” (nytimes.com) if( class_exists('Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget') ) { Add_to_Any_Subscribe_Widget::display(); } ?

If Far more progressive than the Archaics, the Anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest., can we conclude that \\"The Anasazi were the first to develop agricultural techniques such as irrigation.\\"?","completion":"From the given statement, one can infer that the Anasazi were more advanced in their agricultural techniques compared to the Archaics and utilized formal methods such as irrigation. However, this statement does not definitively mean that the Anasazi were the first to develop agricultural techniques such as irrigation. To conclusively attribute the origin of a specific agricultural technique, like irrigation, to the Anasazi society, a more comprehensive analysis of archeological evidence, historical records, and comparisons with other contemporary societies is necessary. Irrigation, as an agricultural technique, has been discovered to have originated in several civilizations across the globe, often independently, driven by their own distinct environmental and socio-cultural necessities. For instance, some of the oldest irrigation systems have been found in the Middle East, particularly in ancient Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq) and Egypt, dating back to around 6000 BCE. These early systems primarily used the water from the Tigris and Euphrates rivers in Mesopotamia, as well as the Nile River in Egypt, to irrigate nearby lands for farming purposes. Other ancient civilizations, such as the Indus Valley civilization in modern-day Pakistan and India, also incorporated early forms of irrigation techniques. The Anasazi, also known as the Ancient Pueblo People, inhabited the Four Corners region of the modern United States (where Utah, Colorado, Arizona, and New Mexico meet) between approximately 100 CE and 1300 CE. They indeed developed sophisticated agricultural techniques, including irrigation systems to manage their water supply in the arid desert environment. This was critical for the growth of crops such as corn, beans, and squash, which formed the backbone of their diet. While it is evident that the Anasazi successfully implemented irrigation techniques as part of their agricultural system, asserting that they were the first to develop such techniques would be misleading without taking into account the broader historical and geographical context. The development of irrigation systems predates the Anasazi civilization, and other ancient societies had already been employing these techniques for several millennia. In summary, the Anasazi were indeed more progressive in agricultural methods, such as irrigation, when compared to the Archaics. However, based on the available historical knowledge, it cannot be concluded that the Anasazi were the first to develop agricultural techniques such as irrigation, as these techniques have been evidenced in multiple ancient civilizations around the world who predate the Anasazi."},{"prompt":"Title: Land of Forever by 2002 Review: I thoughly enjoy this CD.

The tweet mentions two situations that have an impact on the person's mood: rainy days and Mondays. Both of these are commonly associated with negative emotions by many people.

This means that, according to the bill, such institutions cannot simply impose additional fees or charges for new services on their clients without first ensuring that these clients have expressly agreed to receive the new services and the associated costs. This legislation, if enacted, would provide a level of protection to consumers, as it promotes transparency in the way that businesses operate and create awareness for the clients about the terms and conditions of the new services they are agreeing to. In essence, the bill recognizes that clients have a right to be informed about the services they are paying for, and as such, it seeks to prevent institutions from charging them for services that they are either unaware of or haven't explicitly agreed to. Thus, the bill removes an institution's ability to automatically charge clients for these new services, reaffirming the importance of obtaining customer consent before making any billing changes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

On their first series, QB Brett Favre attempted a pass, but he was hit from behind and was intercepted by Bills CB Drayton Florence. Favre was slow to get up afterwards and he was able to walk off the field on his own power, but did not return to the game, citing a shoulder injury (later revealed to be a sprain in his throwing shoulder). At 297 consecutive starts over 19 seasons, this injury would put an end to Favre's all-time NFL consecutive start streak. In his place, backup QB Tarvaris Jackson took over for the rest of the game. They got off to a bad start after Jackson's pass was intercepted by CB Drayton Florence and returned 40 yards for a touchdown. They overcame this deficit with Jackson getting a 31-yard TD pass to WR Sidney Rice. It was originally ruled an interception, but Frazier challenged the play and the officials sided with the Vikings, saying that Rice had two hands on the ball, resulting in a touchdown. It was followed in the second quarter by RB Adrian Peterson getting a 2-yard and a 3-yard TD run. Then Jackson found Rice again on a 6-yard TD pass, followed by kicker Ryan Longwell nailing a 38-yard field goal. They continued to dominate in the fourth quarter when Peterson ran 43 yards to the end zone for a touchdown. The Bills responded with QB Ryan Fitzpatrick getting a 12-yard TD pass to TE David Nelson. However, the Bills were unable to overcome such a large deficit and couldn't come up with another come-from-behind victory. Question: Who played as QB later in the game Favre or Jackson?

I had my appendix removed in about 1970 before keyhole surgery and the surgeon had not properly stitched the inside incision. This meant I was slowly “leaking” blood into the area between my abdominal cavity lining and my skin. I was kept in the hospital for two weeks and every day the same nurse would come along and open the end of the incision in my skin to relieve the pressure caused by the pooling of my blood. That was fine for the first five days, but the weekend came and she was off duty. Apparently, nobody else knew what to do. By Monday morning, I was in agony and when she arrived, she was appalled I had not been drained during the weekend. The other thing that happened during the weekend was the end of the skin incision, which she had opened, had mostly healed meaning there was no convenient hole for the blood to be drained. The nurse used a sharp pair of scissors to reopen one end of the partly-healed incision, but still the blood would not simply drain of its own accord. She used both hands to squeeze downwards onto the swollen blood reservoir. At first, there was no reaction except agonizing pain, but after a few seconds and a very hard squeeze, the stinking, coagulated blood jetted out of the hole she’d made squirting across the ceiling, down the wall and down her full-length coating her face and the front of her uniform. Despite the pain, I couldn’t keep myself from laughing loud and long. She then dressed the wound, directed some junior nurses to clean the ceiling and the wall while she went to clean herself. I apologized for laughing the following day when she returned. She told me she appreciated the humor of the situation so there was no “hard feelings.” Question: Why didn't the patient get proper treatment?

Counselors play a steadying role in schools as the economy weighs on families, college admission becomes even more competitive, immigration continues to reshape the population and state-testing pressures many students. They use computers to search through attendance data, grades and standardized test scores for kids who might need extra help. Schlatter, director of guidance and counseling at Prince William County's Woodbridge Senior High School, has checked attendance records against grades and test results to start peer groups for students who are failing classes but not skipping them. She said group counseling is another way to reach more students though it can be difficult. \\"Kids really do start helping and sharing with each other.\\" At Fairfax High School, counselors found through surveys that students who transferred to the school after ninth grade enjoyed school significantly less than those who had been there all four years.

Given the question: I read this background article the other day: Tropical forests (rainforests) receive more insolation and rainfall over longer growing seasons than any other environment on earth. With these elevated temperatures, insolation and rainfall, biomass is extremely productive leading to the production of as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year. Higher temperatures and larger amounts of water contribute to higher rates of chemical weathering. Increased rates of decomposition cause smaller amounts of fulvic acid to percolate and leach metals from the zone of active weathering. Thus, in stark contrast to soil in forests, tropical forests have little to no podzolization and therefore do not have marked visual and chemical contrasts with the soil layers. Instead, the mobile metals Mg, Fe and Al are precipitated as oxide minerals giving the soil a rusty red color. I am facing a new situation today: John was studying the characteristics of tropical forests. For that, he chose forests in Laos. To compare the forests in Laos with the temperate zone forests he chose forests in Ireland. He could clearly see that how they differed in important ways. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which forests would receive less rainfall, Laos or Ireland? The answer is:","completion":"Ireland's forests would receive less rainfall than Laos' tropical forests. This is because tropical forests, like the ones in Laos, typically receive more rainfall and insolation throughout longer growing seasons than any other environment on Earth. As a result, they exhibit heightened productivity, with as much as 800 grams of carbon per square meter per year being produced.

Today, we're going to talk about two important events from history: the Battle of Marciano and the Treaty of Chambord. We will find out which one happened later. Imagine these events as two characters in a story, and we want to know who arrived at the party later! First, let's meet the Battle of Marciano. This battle was like a big, loud argument between two groups of people from a country called Italy. These groups were called the Republic of Florence and the Republic of Siena. It took place on August 2, 1554. The reason they were fighting was that they didn't agree on who should be in charge of their lands. After a lot of noise and effort, the group from Florence won, and they took control of the area. So, remember, the Battle of Marciano happened in 1554. Now, let's meet our second character, the Treaty of Chambord. A treaty is like a special agreement or promise between two or more groups, deciding some rules they will follow to keep peace and work together. The Treaty of Chambord was between a country named France and some princes from a place called Germany. These people wanted to team up to fight against another powerful group from Germany. They signed this important agreement on January 15, 1552. The Treaty of Chambord helped France and the German princes to work together, and it resulted in some changes in who was in control of certain places. Now, let's remember the dates. The Battle of Marciano happened in 1554, and the Treaty of Chambord happened in 1552. Just like when you count numbers, higher numbers come after lower ones. So, 1554 (the year of the Battle of Marciano) came after 1552 (the year of the Treaty of Chambord). Ready for the answer? The event that happened later was the Battle of Marciano! It was like the guest that came to the party after the Treaty of Chambord had already arrived. And that's the end of our story about the Battle of Marciano and the Treaty of Chambord! Have fun learning more about history and always remember how to find out which event happened later. Thanks for reading!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Jones said that she realized that her new daughter was not going to wait until they had reached hospital to make her entrance. Scroll down for video. I'm here: The baby cries loudly as she makes her dramatic entry in the car as her parents attempt to drive to the hospital where she was scheduled to be born. Shock: Diamond Jones, wearing a yellow top holds onto her baby as her boyfriend shouts words of encouragement to her and the newborn. That's when proud dad Griffith took out his iPhone and captured the dramatic moment which unfolded at 5 am on September 8. Jones told WLBT: ‘I think we had just passed the airport exit and I felt the head come out and I had to push.’ In the video, Griffith can be heard shouting words of encouragement to his unborn daughter: ‘Yea. Talk to me girl. We going to get you there. You just hold on.’ Griffith said: ‘I thought it was a false alarm and I reached over and sure enough, it was. ‘I hit the gas immediately, and she said one more push and here she is.

In the cell phone video, Griffith tries to comfort both his newborn daughter and his fiancé. He tells Jones: ‘Rub her baby. Let her know you love her.’ Proud dad Griffith says that he had planned to tape the birth on his iPhone. But he never imagined doing so in the car. He said: ‘I had my phone in my hand because I had just called the nurse and thank God for the iPhone because you can just hit it and the camera is right there.’ Doting: Proud dad Griffith had planned to tape the birth on his iPhone but never imagined doing so in a car. Meanwhile Jones recalls that she inspected her baby after the birth to check that her umbilical cord was not wrapped around her neck. ‘I just wanted to make sure it wasn't tangled or wrapped around her and once I saw that and I was sitting her up, I figured we would be ok. We'll make it to the hospital and let them cut the cord.

Here's a question: When I was home, I was comfortable. But I had a crippling fear of going where? Here are possible answers to this question: - outside - vacation - idle - apartment - neighborhood I believe the correct choice is \\"outside\\", here's why:","completion":"In order to determine the correct choice from the given options, we need to analyze the context of the question and compare it to each alternative. Let's break down the question and evaluate each option step-by-step. 1. Analyze the context of the question: The question states that the person was comfortable when they were at home. This implies that they were at ease in their own living environment. However, they had a crippling fear of going to a certain place. Our goal is to find the place that is most likely to instill such fear. 2. Evaluate each option: a) Outside: If the person was comfortable at home, it is logical that going outside their home might cause fear or anxiety, especially if they suffer from agoraphobia or have a fear of open spaces or social situations. b) Vacation: Generally, vacations are supposed to be enjoyable and provide relaxation. However, it's unclear whether the person's fear is specifically related to going on vacation or if it's related to leaving their home environment. Considering this, the option might be correct, but it's not as directly relevant as \\"outside.\\" c) Idle: This option doesn't seem to be a specific location or place. The term \\"idle\\" usually refers to not doing anything or being unoccupied. Given that it's not a location, we can rule out this option. d) Apartment: Since the person was comfortable at home, it wouldn't make sense for the same person to have a crippling fear of going to an apartment, which is a type of home. Therefore, this option is not likely to be the correct answer. e) Neighborhood: This could be a possibility as well, as some people might fear leaving their immediate home environment (their house or apartment) and interacting with neighbors or being in the vicinity of other homes. However, the fear associated with going to the neighborhood is not as specific and direct as that of going outside. 3. Draw a conclusion: Based on our analysis, the option \\"outside\\" is the most logical choice because it directly relates to the person's anxiety tied to leaving the home environment and entering an open space or social situation. Additionally, compared to the other options, \\"outside\\" is the most specific and directly relevant answer. Consequently, I believe the correct choice is \\"outside,\\" and here's a summary of the reasoning: - Directly relates to the person's comfort at home and fear of departing from that environment - Most specific and directly relevant answer in comparison to other options - Aligns with common fears and anxieties such as agoraphobia or social anxiety disorder"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Does the word \\"sex\\" mean the same thing in \\"We had sex in the back seat.\\" and \\"(The believers ... those ...) who abstain from sex.\\"?","completion":"The word \\"sex\\" generally refers to the act of engaging in sexual intercourse or the classification of individual beings as male or female based on their reproductive anatomy and functions. In both examples you provided, the word \\"sex\\" is used in distinct contexts, but it shares the same root concept. Let's analyze each example for a deeper understanding. 1. \\"We had sex in the back seat.\\" In this example, \\"sex\\" refers to the act of engaging in sexual intercourse, which typically involves physical and emotional intimacy between two people. Sexual intercourse can encompass various forms of sexual activity, with the most common being penetrative sex, including vaginal, anal, or oral penetration. In this context, the speaker emphasizes the experience of intimacy, connection, and pleasure shared between two individuals. 2. \\"(The believers ... those ...) who abstain from sex.\\" In the second example, \\"sex\\" again refers to the act of engaging in sexual intercourse, but this time the emphasis is on the absence of or the decision not to engage in sexual activity. Some individuals or groups may choose to abstain from sex for various reasons, including personal beliefs, religious teachings, or personal preferences. Abstinence may also be a temporary choice or enforced as part of a social or cultural tradition. In this context, the term \\"sex\\" has a broader meaning as it could encompass various forms of sexual activity that one is abstaining from. In summary, while the word \\"sex\\" is used in different contexts in each example, it retains the same core meaning - sexual intercourse or the act of engaging in sexual activities. However, the specific focus differs: in the first example, it's about having the experience of sex, while in the second example, it's about refraining or abstaining from it. The word \\"sex\\" is versatile and can be used in diverse contexts and discussions, but its fundamental meaning remains consistent."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Problem:PersonX washes PersonX's dirty linen in public Solution:","completion":"Task Explanation: 1. The given event is \\"PersonX washes PersonX's dirty linen in public.\\" 2. Identify the person who does the action in the event, which is PersonX. 3. Write PersonX's emotional reaction to the event, describing how they feel after doing the action. Solution: After PersonX washes their dirty linen in public, they might feel a mixture of embarrassment and relief. They are embarrassed because exposing their personal issues in front of others can be uncomfortable and make them feel vulnerable. However, they may also feel a sense of relief as they no longer need to hide their problems, which can be liberating. Using the task guidelines: 1. We identified the event: \\"PersonX washes PersonX's dirty linen in public.\\" 2. We focused on the person who does the action: PersonX. 3. We described PersonX's emotional reaction to the event: a mixture of embarrassment and relief."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Premise: \\"Trent Lott recently called the agency intrusive, abusive, and out of control.\\" If this premise is true, what does that tell us about whether it entails the hypothesis \\"The agency has not lived up to its former glory in a while.\\"?","completion":"To evaluate if the premise entails the given hypothesis, let's break down both statements. Premise: \\"Trent Lott recently called the agency intrusive, abusive, and out of control.\\" - It implies negative criticisms towards the agency. - It suggests the agency may be currently behaving in ways that are labeled as 'intrusive', 'abusive', and 'out of control'. Hypothesis: \\"The agency has not lived up to its former glory in a while.\\" - It suggests that the agency used to have higher standards or more positive performance in the past. - It implies there is a perceived degradation in the performance or behavior of the agency over time. The premise does not specifically reference the past performance or previous 'glory' of the agency, it only comments on the agency's current state. Nonetheless, if we interpret the criticism from Trent Lott as a suggestion that the agency is currently not meeting standards or expectations it used to meet, then there might be an indirect implication supporting the hypothesis. However, 'glory' is something positive and often related to achievements, success, and respect that can't strictly be interpreted as the absence of negative traits. It's entirely possible for an agency to never have been intrusive, abusive, or out of control, but also not to have achieved anything particularly glorious. Therefore, applying a strict, linguistic approach to inference, we can say that the premise doesn't necessarily entail the hypothesis as the negative critiques in the premise do not directly equate to a lack of 'former glory'. Yet, a broader, interpretive approach may suggest a loose connection between the premise and the hypothesis. Ultimately, to definitively validate the hypothesis based on the premise, we would need more specific information about the agency's past performance or standards for a direct comparison. This involves a notable degree of interpretation and assumption."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task. Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can.

Q:Article: My life, as it really is, is always filled with sadness and little joy. However, no matter what happens, I can always face it bravely. In July, last year, I couldn't believe the news that I was allowed to enter the only key high school in my hometown. Then I rushed to my home and told my parents. But my father didn't seem as excited as I was. They didn't say a word. My father just kept smoking and my mother put her head down and couldn't help crying. What I saw didn't make me surprise. I knew very well what my family was like. My mum had been in bed for two years because of her disease. I knew my family lived a hard life and couldn't afford my tuition fee . I felt so upset at that moment, but I could say nothing to my parents. I decided to help my father with his work to support my family instead of continuing my schooling. To my surprise, things completely changed just three days before the beginning of the new term. My head teacher who had taught me three years came to my family with some money, which had been raised by my schoolmates. He encouraged me, \\"Always have dreams.\\" At the same time,my father also earned some extra money so that he could afford part of my tuition fee. I knew I was such a lucky dog and decided to study harder in return. With tears in my eyes, I stepped into the key high school that I had dreamed of. I have been studying hard since I entered the high school. Whenever I meet difficulties, I always think of my teacher and schoolmates, and I can always get enough courage to go on, because I have a college dream and must work hard for it no matter how hard the life is.

Well that is all completed now but I’ve had some other family stuff going on and with looking after my baby daughter spare time for blogging is pretty scarce at the moment. I haven’t lost my enthusiasm though and am busy planning all sorts of new posts for the future, so watch this space! Today I wanted to tell you all about a fantastic natural brand, Moogoo. Regular readers of Beauty Best Friend may recall that I reviewed their Full Cream Moisturiser last year, but having received this Oil Cleansing Method* cleanser in a goody bag from a blogger event a couple of months ago it fired up my love for them all over again! MooGoo is an Australian natural skincare brand that was first created when the founder adapted a cream used in dairy farms to help a family member with a skin problem. Their products contain lots of natural oils and are not tested on animals – well, apart from the very first of their products that was created for cows! Moogoo Oil Cleansing Method is an all natural cleansing oil that can be used in two ways…. you can use it like a wash-off cleanser by applying a few drops to the face then rinsing it off with warm water, or my favourite method is to massage the oil into the skin then place a warm flannel or muslin over the face to allow the oil to draw any impurities out of the skin, before wiping away the oil. This is a great way of starting off a DIY facial at home! There are four varieties of Oil Cleansing Method, I’ve been using the one for Oily Skin but it’s also available in Normal, Combination and Dry too. The ingredients include ‘drawing oils’ that help to lift dirt and germs off the skin so they can be washed away, plus the Oily one contains Juniper Oil which helps to prevent bacteria on the skin, great for helping keep spots at bay.

Are these two questions inquiring about the same information?","completion":"To determine the sexiest language and accent, I will follow these steps: Step 1: Define what makes a language or accent \\"sexy\\" \\"Sexy\\" can be subjective and may depend on personal preferences and cultural factors. In this context, let's consider \\"sexy\\" as anything that is attractive, alluring, or sensual to listeners. Step 2: Research various languages and accents I will gather information about different languages and accents worldwide by examining online resources, articles, rankings, and surveys. Step 3: Identify common factors and preferences from the research This step is crucial to determine the patterns and preferences found in the information gathered during step 2. Based on the research and popular opinions, French is often considered the sexiest language due to its smooth, flowing sound and association with romance, love, elegance, and sophistication. Additionally, Italian closely follows as it is also linked with passion, romance, and a beautiful melody in its rhythmic speech pattern. As for accents, the answer can differ depending on personal preferences. However, a few commonly mentioned sexiest accents include French, British (particularly the Received Pronunciation accent), and Australian. These accents are considered sexy because they sound distinctive, refined, and charming to many listeners. The two questions are related but inquire about slightly different aspects of linguistic appeal. While the first question asks about the sexiest language, focusing on the spoken language itself, the second question asks about the sexiest accent, which revolves around how a particular language is spoken and pronounced by a specific group or culture. Despite these differences, both questions are related to what listeners perceive as attractive, sensual, or alluring linguistic features."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I know that the answer to the question \\"What is the reason why the smog mentioned in the passage stuck around for so long?\\" is in \\"A dense wave of smog began in the Central and Eastern part of China on 2 December 2013 across a distance of around 1,200 kilometres (750 mi), including Tianjin, Hebei, Shandong, Jiangsu, Anhui, Shanghai and Zhejiang.

The heavy smog heavily polluted central and southern Jiangsu Province, especially in and around Nanjing, with its AQI pollution Index at \\"severely polluted\\" for five straight days and \\"heavily polluted\\" for nine. On 3 December 2013, levels of PM2.5 particulate matter average over 943 micrograms per cubic metre, falling to over 338 micrograms per cubic metre on 4 December 2013.

Children's Hospital outpatient services increased by 33 percent; general incidence of bronchitis, pneumonia, upper respiratory tract infections significantly increased.

After busting a human trafficking ring led by Sheriff Wood, Jack Reacher returns to his old military headquarters to meet Major Susan Turner, whom he has been working with during his travels and has become his closest friend – only to learn from Colonel Sam Morgan that Turner has been accused of espionage and detained. Turner's attorney, Colonel Bob Moorcroft, reveals that there is evidence that Turner is involved in the murders of two soldiers in Afghanistan, but Reacher believes she is being framed. Moorcroft also reveals an old acquaintance of Reacher, Candice Dutton, has filed a paternity suit against him, claiming he is the biological father of her 15-year-old daughter, Samantha Dutton. Reacher tries to reach out to Samantha, but she rebuffs him, believing he is after her biological mother due to her past as a prostitute. Moorcroft is later killed by an unknown assassin known as the Hunter. Reacher is framed for Moorcroft's murder and arrested and transported to the prison where Turner is being detained. Two hitmen arrive to kill her, but Reacher neutralizes them, rescues her and they escape to Morgan's house, having deduced he is involved in the conspiracy, to extract information. After they leave, the Hunter, revealed to be working with Morgan, kills Morgan and frames Reacher which he learns about from a friend, Sergeant Leach, when he asks her to investigate a military contractor. Reacher and Turner uncover surveillance pictures of Samantha and surmise she is in danger, arriving at her home to find her foster parents dead and Samantha hiding in the kitchen. Reacher and Turner decide to escort Samantha to Turner's old private school for protection, but discover that she has her mobile phone with her and that the enemy probably knows exactly where they are.

'As a coach, it happened to me several times,' said the former Sunderland and Swindon manager. 'I would ask for a lower tempo to respond to certain technical and tactical details, but I couldn’t do anything, they all continue the same. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the moment Paolo Di Canio appears at the EMA awards. Ranting and raving: Paolo Di Canio is backing Italy to beat England in the World Cup. Exhausted? Di Canio is a fan of Wayne Rooney but says he will be tired by the World Cup. Stretch to it: Ross Barkley is one of the few England players that Di Canio is a fan off. 'Historically, a weak point is that the English concede absurd goals, incredible. I have looked over some of the examples of their goalkeepers, and they have made some incredible mistakes.' Italy, England’s first opponents in Brazil, have not won since September but Di Canio, who did not win an international cap, believes they are better equipped than Roy Hodgson’s team to cope with the heat and humidity of Manaus, in the Amazon rainforest. 'I’ve noticed some difficulties for Italy but the Italian players have the value of flexibility, they can change position,' he said. 'They may lack a true identity, but at a physical level our work from the past two weeks will be better than that of the English, who are exhausted. No goo enough: Di Canio believes England will not be able to adapt to the heat in Brazil. Getting down to it: England stars Wayne Rooney, Steven Gerrard and Glen Johnson training on Friday. 'England are missing parts, the reserves are not up to scratch. The players are tired - I really like Wayne Rooney but he arrives in these competitions cooked, because he plays a lot of games in the season. 'He gives all of himself in every game and the Brazilian temperatures will be very hard for him. In England they do not have a winter break and it is great to play at Christmas, but they then pay for this in June. In this period, fatigue can be devastating. 'England have freshness, youth, but it will be difficult for them to go through. They are unable to manage themselves. They always put in the maximum and always have to give 200 per cent.' Di Canio picked out Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Ross Barkley as 'interesting talents' in the England squad and hailed teenager Luke Shaw was 'one of the best full-backs in Europe'. But he added: 'The English have a problem. They play little together. They do not attack the space and must have a better understanding.' Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"Paolo Di Canio, a famous Italian soccer person, said that English football players have trouble adjusting their game when it is hot, like at the World Cup. He thinks that Italian players are more flexible and better at handling hot weather. He likes some English players like Wayne Rooney, Raheem Sterling, and Daniel Sturridge, but he thinks they get very tired because they play lots of games without breaks. Di Canio believes that Italy is more likely to win and that England needs to improve their teamwork and understanding of the game."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

A). yes; B). no;","completion":"A). Yes; The statement \\"The dry lands of Namibia were inhabited since early times by San, Damara, and Namaqua, and since about the 14th century AD by immigrating Bantu who came with the Bantu expansion.\\" is correct. The Bantu migration or Bantu expansion is a significant historical movement that is believed to have occurred from around the 1st to the 2nd millennium AD. The Bantu people, originating from the region around modern-day Cameroon and Nigeria in West Africa, started migrating and spreading their Bantu languages across the African continent. This migration covered a vast area of sub-Saharan Africa, including present-day Namibia. The Bantu-speaking people arrived in Namibia around the 14th century AD, bringing their cultural practices, technology, and agricultural skills with them. The area was already inhabited by communities such as the San, Damara, and Namaqua, who had their own languages and cultures. The Bantu migration was a gradual process, driven by various factors such as population growth, the search for new farmlands, and interactions with other communities. Over time, the Bantu people introduced agriculture, ironworking, and pottery-making to the regions they settled in, which had a significant impact on the local populations and landscapes. In Namibia, the Bantu migration played a vital role in the historical development of the region, shaping the linguistic, cultural, and ethnic composition of the country. The Bantu-speaking communities established their presence and influence in various parts of Namibia, contributing to the rich tapestry of diverse cultures and traditions that make up the country's heritage. In summary, the statement you provided is accurate as it highlights the migration of Bantu people to Namibia and their coexistence with the San, Damara, and Namaqua communities. This migration, which occurred around the 14th century AD, contributed to the diversity of ethnic and cultural groups in the country and played an important role in the region's historical development."},{"prompt":"Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: It is Sunday afternoon.

A key component common to all CPUs is the program counter, a special memory cell (a register) that keeps track of which location in memory the next instruction is to be read from. Answer this question, if possible (if impossible, reply \\"unanswerable\\"): A special memory cell of a CPU is called what?","completion":"A special memory cell of a CPU is typically called a \\"register.\\" Registers are high-speed storage components that hold data for immediate processing or hold information about the current state of the processor. One such special register is the \\"program counter\\" (PC), which keeps track of the memory address from which the next instruction is to be fetched and executed. The program counter is essential for maintaining the flow of instructions in the CPU. Registers can be divided into several categories according to their functions or designated roles in a processor. Some common types of registers include: 1. General-purpose registers: These registers are used to store temporary data during the execution of a program. They may hold operands, intermediate results, or addresses for memory access. 2. Instruction registers: It holds the instruction that is currently being executed. The contents of this register are fetched from the memory location pointed to by the program counter. 3. Status registers: These registers store information about the current state of the processor, such as flags for arithmetic operations (overflow, carry, zero, negative), interrupt masks, or privilege levels for access control. 4. Stack registers: A stack is a data structure maintained by the CPU to keep track of subroutine call sequences or temporarily store values. There are usually two registers associated with the stack: stack pointer (SP) and frame pointer (FP). The stack pointer points to the top of the stack, whereas the frame pointer points to a fixed location within the stack frame. 5. Index registers: Also referred to as address registers or base registers, these registers are used for generating effective addresses in indirect addressing modes. They store the base address and can be coupled with an offset to calculate the final memory address. In summary, a special memory cell of a CPU is called a \\"register.\\" Registers are integral components of a CPU's architecture, allowing it to efficiently process, manipulate, and store data as required during program execution. The program counter is a specific type of register that keeps track of the memory address containing the next instruction to be executed."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

The liner in the jacket is unappealing, but not the liner in the sports coat, because the liner in the","completion":"sports coat is designed with functionality and style in mind. The liner in the jacket is often unattractive due to its primary purpose being to provide insulation and protection from the elements. In contrast, the liner in a sports coat offers not only comfort and insulation, but also adds aesthetic value to the garment. Sports coats, also known as blazers, are a key component of a smart casual wardrobe. They are intended to be versatile, comfortable, and stylish, making them the perfect choice for both formal events and casual outings. While jackets serve a similar purpose in terms of providing a layer of warmth and protection, the differentiation lies in the additional style and design elements incorporated into the sports coat. The liner in a sports coat comes in various materials such as silk, polyester, or a blend of the two. These materials are known for their lightweight, smooth, and moisture-wicking properties, making them ideal for a variety of situations. The liner can also be in a complementary or contrasting color to the outer fabric of the sports coat, adding an element of elegance and sophistication to the overall design. This allows the wearer to make a subtle yet striking fashion statement while maintaining a sense of class and style. In addition, many sports coat liners boast certain functional features. For instance, some liners in sports coats come with a breathable mesh lining that enhances ventilation, keeping the wearer cool during hot weather or high-intensity activities. Others may have strategically placed pockets to provide convenient storage solutions without compromising the seamless design of the coat. A select few even feature anti-odor technology to keep the garment fresh and clean despite repeated use. The attention given to the quality of the liner in a sports coat is in stark contrast to the liner we see in jackets. In the case of jackets, the focus is primarily on providing warmth and protection from harsh weather conditions. Consequently, the materials used in these liners - often synthetic fibers or poly-blends - may not be the most visually appealing, instead prioritizing durability and insulation. The aesthetic discrepancy between the liners in sports coats and jackets can also be attributed to the occasions or activities each garment is meant for. Jackets, primarily being outerwear, are designed to protect from the elements, and the liner plays a crucial role in this. Therefore, the design and appearance of the jacket liner generally receive less emphasis. Sports coats, on the other hand, can be considered a more decorative piece that focuses on both style and comfort. In conclusion, the liner in a sports coat is more appealing than that in a jacket due to the utilization of superior materials and design elements that prioritize both function and style. The liner in a sports coat manages to blend seamlessly with the rest of the garment, enhancing its overall look and allowing the wearer to showcase their sophisticated tastes. Meanwhile, the liner in a jacket, while fulfilling its purpose of providing extra insulation and protection, rarely receives the same level of attention given to its counterpart in a sports coat."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

In traditional opera, singers do two types of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style and arias, a more melodic style. Opera incorporates many of the elements of spoken theatre, such as acting, scenery, and costumes and sometimes includes dance. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble, which since the early 19th century has been led by a conductor. - San Francisco Ballet is a ballet company, founded in 1933 as the San Francisco Opera Ballet under the leadership of ballet master Adolph Bolm.

Although publishing itself has declined in importance, one legacy of the industry is the number of bookstores selling second-hand, antiquarian, and new books. Does it follow that \\"People use the internet so publishing is not a big deal anymore.\\"?","completion":"The statement \\"People use the internet so publishing is not a big deal anymore\\" oversimplifies the situation, but it does reflect some aspects of the current state of the publishing industry. With the rise of the internet, the way people consume information has significantly changed. This has had a tremendous impact on traditional print media such as newspapers, magazines, and books. In recent years, there has been a decline in importance for traditional publishing as more content creators and consumers have shifted their focus to digital media. However, it is crucial to explore various aspects before concluding that publishing is not a big deal anymore. To begin with, digital publishing has become increasingly popular due to the ease of access, cost-effectiveness, and vast reach it provides to authors and readers globally. Many people now consume news online, read e-books, or listen to audiobooks. This shift has led to the decline of physical book sales in some areas, but in other parts of the world, print books are still thriving. In this context, the term \\"publishing\\" has not become irrelevant. On the contrary, it has evolved and adapted to technological advances, giving birth to the flexible and dynamic world of digital publishing. In the same vein, self-publishing has emerged as a significant player in the publishing industry, providing more opportunities for authors to get their work published and promoted without depending on established publishers. This trend has democratized the publishing industry, allowing for diverse voices and ideas to reach audiences worldwide. Thus, while traditional publishing may have diminished importance, self-publishing platforms create more access for authors and content creators. Regarding the legacy of the publishing industry, such as the numerous bookstores selling second-hand, antiquarian, and new books, it is essential to highlight that physical books still hold an enduring appeal for many people. Even with the internet and various digital reading platforms, some readers continue to prefer print books, and bookstores fulfill that demand. Additionally, bookstores facilitate the local literary culture, create community spaces, and provide an outlet for independent authors and local publications to reach their target audience. Moreover, publishing does not solely revolve around books. The publishing industry encompasses various formats, including newspapers, magazines, academic journals, and online content. The range of mediums has expanded with the rise of the internet, which necessitates adapting to the changing landscape. While traditional print media may face challenges, the overall concept of publishing - be it in print or digital form - continues to play a vital role in disseminating ideas, entertainment, news, and research. In summary, attributing the decline in the importance of traditional publishing solely to people using the internet is an oversimplification. While the internet has brought a paradigm shift that affects publishing, the industry is far from losing its significance. Publishing has transformed and diversified, adapting to the changing needs of authors and readers alike. It is essential not to downplay the importance of digital publishing or underestimate the ongoing appeal of physical books and their cultural significance in society. The publishing industry may have been reshaped by new technologies, but it remains an influential force in the dissemination of content, knowledge, and creativity."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: In collaboration with raptor training company Guard From Above, Dutch police taught an eagle to recognize a DJI drone. Once in sight, the bird flies toward its mechanical prey, snatches it with its enormous talons and then takes it to safe place. The eagle is one of the two \\"physical\\" methods the force are trialling -- the other being a safety net -- but a trained bird of prey gives officers more control over where the offending drone is brought down to earth. What makes eagles effective drone hunters? Their feet have four powerful toes that are strong enough to grip and carry heavy objects, whether it's a wild animal or a heavy UAV. But even though they have toughened talons, drone rotors could still damage the bird. A spokesperson says the force will look at ways to better protect their flying counterparts while they conduct trials over the next few months. ||||| The interactive transcript could not be loaded. Rating is available when the video has been rented. This feature is not available right now. Please try again later. ||||| The anti-drone arms race just got serious. As tech firms and law enforcement experiment with radio jammers and net-wielding interceptor drones to take down rogue quadcopters, police in the Netherlands are trialling a simpler solution: eagles. The country's law enforcement has teamed up with a raptor training company named Guard From Above to see if birds of prey can be used to safely intercept quadcopters. In the video demonstration above, an eagle is seen easily plucking what looks like a DJI Phantom out of the air. However, it's not clear how dangerous this is for the bird. Raptors' talons are incredibly sharp and their grip is strong enough to crush bone, but that doesn't meant they're indestructible and carbon fiber props spinning at full speed can easily cut human flesh. In the video, one of the handlers says that the scales on the eagle's legs and feet keeps them safe, but also mentions the possibility of creating some sort of extra protection for them. Still, given the amount of animals who seem to instinctively want to take down drones (the list includes kangaroos, gorillas, geese, and dogs), perhaps the eagles will get some animal backup soon.

Context: Sondra Crench kicked a roach out of her way as she walked into her tiny apartment and sat down at her old laptop. It was after midnight. So, she figured her new friend, Jason, was already dead. And so were her hopes of landing a secretarial job in time to keep her apartment. Rent was due on Tuesday, and she had just enough money to pay it. But then she'd have no money for food or gas or anything else. Maybe it was time to go home for a while. Surely she could put up with her mother for a few weeks while looking for work. She opened her Favorites list and clicked on the link for The Orange Leader. Sondra had not been back to her home town in a long time, but she liked to keep up with what was going on there. Occasionally, she'd see one of her old classmates in a wedding announcement. Those people led real lives, and held real jobs. As a working musician, she lived in a completely different world. She had more in common with actresses than a secretaries. She checked the Classifieds. Nurses wanted. Nope. Part-time receptionist. Not enough pay. Then she saw a full-page ad announcing the upcoming Grand Opening of Billy-Eye's Arcade and Dance Barn. Open Friday, Saturday, and Sunday nights, 6:00 PM to Midnight. For ages 12-20. Free soft drinks and popcorn. Live band. Five bucks to get in. Only twenty-five cents for arcade games. Sounded pretty cool for kids. She wished there had been such a place when she was growing up there. But what really caught her eye was the note about auditions for a house band. It would play two hours a night, and earn 2,000 per week. Divided by four band members... Sondra could actually live on that! Not very well--but she could get by.

She occasionally sees her old classmates in wedding announcements, which may suggest that she is at an age where her peers are settling down and starting families. 5. The context reveals that Sondra is considering working at a venue that caters to ages 12-20, which might be too young for Sondra since she wishes such a place existed when she \\"was growing up.\\" 6. Sondra is thinking of moving back with her mother for a while, implying that she is not yet at an age where moving back with a parent is a completely unviable option.

Claire Blehr, 76, of Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of Florida and Georgia, were two of the four arrested. John Celmer, 58, lived in Cumming, north of Atlanta. Cumming police, the Forsyth County coroner and the man's relatives all had suspicions that his death was an assisted suicide, and the Georgia Bureau of Investigation launched an investigation, the agency said in a news release. The GBI on Wednesday set up a sting operation at a residence in adjoining Dawson County, using an undercover agent who had posed as a terminally ill man seeking assistance with his suicide, the statement said. Claire Blehr, 76, of Atlanta, Georgia, and Thomas E. Goodwin, 63, of both Punta Gorda, Florida, and Kennesaw, Georgia, were arrested, the GBI said. Meanwhile, authorities in Baltimore, Maryland, arrested Dr. Lawrence D. Egbert, 81, of Baltimore in connection with the investigation. A second person, Nicholas Alec Sheridan, 60, also of Baltimore, was arrested Wednesday night, GBI spokesman John Bankhead said Thursday. All four face charges of assisted suicide, tampering with evidence and violation of the Georgia's Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, the GBI said. The Final Exit Network, based in the north Atlanta suburb of Marietta, identifies itself on its Web site as \\"an all-volunteer organization dedicated to serving people who are suffering from an intolerable condition.

We will never encourage you to hasten your death.\\" Celmer suffered from \\"very, very severe mouth and throat cancer,\\" his 85-year-old mother, Betty Celmer, said from her home in the Buffalo, New York, suburb of East Amherst. \\"They were rebuilding the whole mouth,\\" she said. \\"He was suffering terribly, that I know.\\" She said her son had undergone numerous surgeries and \\"sounded depressed.\\" When he died, she said she had no idea his death might have been a suicide. In a statement released by the GBI, Celmer's widow, Susan, said that she and her family \\"are gratified that the GBI and other law enforcement agencies have pursued this matter vigorously and that their investigation has led to the arrests reported today.\\" She said she will not comment further and requested privacy, referring future questions to her attorneys. An e-mail to Jerry Dincin, a man listed as Final Exit Network's vice president and treasurer on its Web site, was not answered Thursday. A call to Final Exit was answered by a recording. The method used in the suicide was helium inhalation, according to the GBI statement. People pay 50 to join the Final Exit Network, according to the GBI, and complete an application process. They are then visited by an \\"exit guide\\" assigned to the case. \\"During the visitations, the member is instructed to purchase two helium tanks of a specific size and brand and a specific type of hood known as an 'exit bag,' \\" according to the GBI statement. \\"On the day of the event, the member is visited by the 'exit guide' and a 'senior exit guide.' The senior exit guide instructs the member through the process.\\" Goodwin and Blehr were told the GBI agent suffered from pancreatic cancer, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. At the Dawson County residence on Wednesday, Goodwin allegedly walked the undercover agent through the steps and demonstrated how he would hold the agent's hands to stop him from removing the exit bag, Bankhead said. The GBI said that after the death occurs, \\"all evidence is removed from the scene by the 'guides' and discarded, as evidence indicated happened in the Cumming case.\\" Goodwin's former neighbors in Kennesaw told CNN he moved to Florida a few years ago but still owns his large home there and returns to check on it occasionally. Kay Makarenko, 69, who lives behind Goodwin's home, said she was shocked to hear of his arrest. \\"I said, 'It can't be the same Ted Goodwin.' \\" After the arrests Wednesday, authorities in Georgia, Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Ohio, Missouri, Colorado and Montana began executing search warrants and conducting interviews as part of the probe into the Final Exit Network, the GBI said, adding that GBI agents were in each state except Colorado to assist. In Phoenix, Arizona, police have linked the 2007 death of a 58-year-old woman to the Final Exit Network, Maricopa County Attorney Andrew Thomas said Wednesday, according to CNN affiliate KPHO-TV in Phoenix. Thomas said the woman, Jana Van Voorhis, was not terminally ill but suffered from mental illness and depression. He said a police investigation turned up records of visits from Final Exit guides to Voorhis, according to KPHO. No arrests have been made, but Thomas said he expects his office to wrap up its investigation and decide if charges are warranted within 60 days. CNN affiliate WDIV-TV in Detroit, Michigan, reported that search warrants were executed regarding two Michigan residents who sit on Final Exit's board of directors. The Final Exit Network Web site features a \\"Wall of Fame\\" with photos of Dr. Jack Kevorkian, among others. Kevorkian was released on parole in June 2007 after serving more than eight years of a 10- to 25-year sentence in the 1998 death of a man suffering from amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease. \\"We believe the needs of those who are suffering are paramount,\\" the organization says. \\"We applaud the work of organizations that seek legislative action to strengthen our right to die a peaceful and painless death at the time and place of our choosing. However, we feel that legislative change will not come soon enough for the many people who need help now and in the interim.\\" Betty Celmer, meanwhile, declined to share her thoughts on assisted suicide or the Final Exit Network's alleged involvement in her son's death, saying she lacks specifics. \\"He's in a far better place,\\" she said. \\"That's the only comment I'm going to make.\\" CNN's Ashley Broughton and Jim Kavanagh contributed to this report.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: Information: - In mathematics and computer science, an algorithm is a self-contained sequence of actions to be performed. Algorithms perform calculation, data processing, and/or automated reasoning tasks. - A country is a region that is identified as a distinct national entity in political geography. A country may be an independent sovereign state or one that is occupied by another state, as a non-sovereign or formerly sovereign political division, or a geographic region associated with sets of previously independent or differently associated people with distinct political characteristics. Regardless of the physical geography, in the modern internationally accepted legal definition as defined by the League of Nations in 1937 and reaffirmed by the United Nations in 1945, a resident of a country is subject to the independent exercise of legal jurisdiction. - Holland is a region and former province on the western coast of the Netherlands. The name \\"Holland\\" is also frequently used to informally refer to the whole of the country of the Netherlands. This usage is commonly accepted in other countries, and not entirely uncommon among the Dutch themselves, though some in the Netherlands and particularly in other regions of the country may find it undesirable, misleading or insulting. - Adriaan van Wijngaarden ( 2 November 1916 -- 7 February 1987 ) was a Dutch mathematician and computer scientist , who is considered by many to have been the founding father of informatica ( computer science ) in the Netherlands . Even though he was trained as an engineer , van Wijngaarden would emphasize and promote the mathematical aspects of computing , first in numerical analysis , then in programming languages and finally in design principles of programming languages . - The Hague (or \\"<nowiki>'</nowiki>s-Gravenhage\\" ) is a city located in the western coast of the Netherlands, and the capital city of the province of South Holland. - The North Sea is a marginal sea of the Atlantic Ocean located between Great Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, and France. An epeiric (or \\"shelf\\") sea on the European continental shelf, it connects to the ocean through the English Channel in the south and the Norwegian Sea in the north. It is more than long and wide, with an area of around . - A mathematician is someone who uses an extensive knowledge of mathematics in his/her work, typically to solve mathematical problems. - Utrecht is the capital and most populous city in the Dutch province of Utrecht. It is located in the eastern corner of the Randstad conurbation and is the fourth largest city in the Netherlands with a population of in . - Rotterdam is a city in the Netherlands, located in South Holland, within the RhineMeuseScheldt river delta at the North Sea. Its history goes back to 1270 when a dam was constructed in the Rotte river by people settled around it for safety. In 1340 Rotterdam was granted city rights by the Count of Holland and slowly grew into a major logistic and economic centre. Nowadays it is home to Europe's largest port and has a population of 633,471 (city proper), ranking second in the Netherlands. The Greater Rijnmond area is home to approximately 1.4 million people and the Rotterdam The Hague Metropolitan Area makes for the 168th most populous urban area in the world. Rotterdam is part of the yet larger Randstad conurbation with a total population of 7,100,000. - The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, commonly known as the United Kingdom (UK) or Britain, is a sovereign country in western Europe. Lying off the north-western coast of the European mainland, it includes the island of Great Britain (the name of which is also loosely applied to the whole country), the north-eastern part of the island of Ireland, and many smaller islands. Northern Ireland is the only part of the UK that shares a land border with another sovereign statethe Republic of Ireland. Apart from this land border, the UK is surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to its east, the English Channel to its south and the Celtic Sea to its south-south-west, giving it the 12th-longest coastline in the world. The Irish Sea lies between Great Britain and Ireland. With an area of , the UK is the 78th-largest sovereign state in the world and the 11th-largest in Europe. It is also the 21st-most populous country, with an estimated 65.1 million inhabitants. Together, this makes it the fourth most densely populated country in the European Union. - In modern politics and history, a parliament is a legislative, elected body of government. Generally a modern parliament has three functions: representing the electorate, making laws, and overseeing the government (\\"i.e.\\", hearings, inquiries). - Information is that which informs. In other words, it is the answer to a question of some kind. It is thus related to data and knowledge, as data represents values attributed to parameters, and knowledge signifies understanding of real things or abstract concepts. As it regards data, the information's existence is not necessarily coupled to an observer (it exists beyond an event horizon, for example), while in the case of knowledge, the information requires a cognitive observer. - Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition, representation, processing, storage, communication of, and access to information. An alternate, more succinct definition of computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of computation and the design of computational systems. - Amsterdam is the capital and most populous municipality of the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Its status as the capital is mandated by the Constitution of the Netherlands, although it is not the seat of the government, which is The Hague. Amsterdam has a population of 847,176 within the city proper, 1,343,647 in the urban area, and 2,431,000 in the Amsterdam metropolitan area.

There is a range of views among mathematicians and philosophers as to the exact scope and definition of mathematics. - A mathematical problem is a problem that is amenable to being represented, analyzed, and possibly solved, with the methods of mathematics. This can be a real-world problem, such as computing the orbits of the planets in the solar system, or a problem of a more abstract nature, such as Hilbert's problems.<br> It can also be a problem referring to the nature of mathematics itself, such as Russell's Paradox. - A computer is a device that can be instructed to carry out an arbitrary set of arithmetic or logical operations automatically. The ability of computers to follow a sequence of operations, called a \\"program\\", make computers very flexible and useful. Such computers are used as control systems for a very wide variety of industrial and consumer devices. This includes simple special purpose devices like microwave ovens and remote controls, factory devices such as industrial robots and computer assisted design, but also in general purpose devices like personal computers and mobile devices such as smartphones. The Internet is run on computers and it connects millions of other computers. - Computation is any type of calculation that follows a well-defined model understood and expressed as, for example, an algorithm. - Germany, officially the Federal Republic of Germany, is a federal parliamentary republic in central-western Europe.

On September 19, having buried their non-essential possessions in a mound marked by a tent pole, they set out in search of settlements. Progress was hampered by the poor physical condition of the men, in particular Eriksen, who was badly affected by frostbite. On September 21 they halted at two empty huts, probably part of a hunting camp, where Alexey raised spirits by shooting a deer to replenish their dwindling food stocks. De Long allowed his exhausted party several days' rest before resuming the march.On September 28 the party found a large hut, with signs of recent occupation–edible food in the store, and moccasin tracks in the snow. When searches in the locality brought no sign of people, De Long decided to move on. By October 4, Eriksen could not continue; the party halted at another abandoned hut where, on October 6, Eriksen died. On October 9, with the condition of several men worsening, De Long decided to send two of the fittest in the group, Nindemann and Noros, to seek help.

Not only did the British quintet pioneer the digital-rush-release strategy that’s been adopted by artists from Beyoncé to Kanye West, their ever-starker view of the world around them—which started off in a pretty dark place to begin with, as evidenced by their initial breakout single “Creep”—is matched by music that trembles with anxiety and fear beneath even its most beautiful facades. A Moon-Shaped Pool, Radiohead’s ninth record, doesn’t just speak to these tensions; it serenades them. On the surface, the album—which came out on Sunday, capping a whirlwind promotional cycle that began with the erasure of the band’s social media profiles—is a beautiful work, with textures that can cascade over a listener like water. The band balances the demands of art-rock—unbridled grandiosity, big and possibly unanswerable questions, lengthy songs—with precision approaches to their craft, as Thom Yorke’s unparalleled wail steers the ship. Guitarist Jonny Greenwood, who has written scores for epics like The Master and Inherent Vice, worked with the new-music ensemble the London Contemporary Orchestra on rounding out the record’s sound, giving the band’s offerings an even more potent wallop. The central questions that have lurked underneath Radiohead’s music over the past two-plus decades—which essentially boil down to, “How can you be a feeling and thinking human in a fairly (and seemingly increasingly) uncaring world?”—are on full display here, with lyrics that concisely, and sometimes bluntly, depict precarity and the possibility of anything good being an illusion. The music matches. Sounds dip in and out of the mix, compelling this listener to rewind and make sure that she’d heard correctly, echoing the menacingly surrealistic portraits of nature offered up by the gently glowering “Tinker Tailor Soldier Sailor Rich Man Poor Man Beggar Man Thief.” (While the album sounds glorious turned up on a stereo, headphone listeners haven’t been forgotten.) “This is a low flying panic attack,” frontman Thom Yorke moans on the album opener “Burn the Witch”; that he’s doing so over lush strings only adds to the tension, underscoring the song’s message about inchoate anger boiling over into more sinister campaigns. The swooping background vocals that float around the gently picked guitars of “Present Tense” sound descended from heaven, contrasting sharply with Yorke’s singing about feeling unmoored by love (“As my world comes crashing down/ I’m dancing/ Freaking out, deaf, dumb and blind”) and only adding to the pervasive gloom. A Moon-Shaped Pool comes into sharpest relief when it’s at its most lush; “Ful Stop” opens with Yorke intoning, over and over, “You really messed up everything,” then somehow grows more harrowing from there, with careening strings and Yorke’s haunted moan besieging the insistently thrumming guitars that propel the song. The orchestrations on the brooding “Daydreaming” lurk in the background, only coming to the fore when Yorke’s backmasked vocal—a groaned, repeated “Half of my life” that sounds lifted from the subconscious—is brought into the mix. “True Love Waits,” a song that’s been kicking around the band’s catalog for the better part of two decades, closes the album. Pianos twinkle around Yorke’s voice, which sounds haunted as he enumerates fanciful manifestations of love (“true love lives on lollipops and crisps”); when he sighs, “Just don’t leave,” it feels like a hopeless plea, one drawn in stark contrast to the celestial atmosphere brought forth by the music. It’s jarring enough to call into question the title’s central conceit—what is “true love,” in a world where falsehoods lurk around every corner?—and the way its form follows its central message is a sterling example of why Radiohead has captured the imagination of so many listeners. A Moon-Shaped Pool isn’t much of a departure for Radiohead, ultimately. They’re casting about in their gloom, exploring the anxieties that come not just with the rupturing of personal connections, but the slow sinking of the structures that serve as those links’ support. But the way in which the band widened its sonic scope to fit the cinematic vista implied by Greenwood’s orchestrations makes it one of those surprise releases that will continue to sink in long after its trending-topic status has faded into the background. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"\\"A Moon-Shaped Pool\\" is a music album by the band Radiohead. It has beautiful music with different sounds and instruments that will make you feel different emotions. The singers and musicians in the band are very good at using their voices and instruments to tell stories through their songs.

Add 66*v to both sides of the equation: (-65*v + 66*v) + 5 = -66*v + 66*v This simplifies to: 1*v + 5 = 0 Step 2: Now isolate v by moving the constant to the other side of the equation. Subtract 5 from both sides of the equation: 1*v = -5 Step 3: Lastly, divide by the coefficient of v to find the value of v. v = -5 / 1 v = -5 So the solution to the given equation, -65*v + 5 = -66*v, is v = -5."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

With the background music building up, the scene will transition into a montage of young Ravi practicing relentlessly at a local ground, guided by his father, who supports and nurtures his passion. The montage would signify the beginning of Ravi Shastri's journey as one of India's iconic cricketers, who would eventually go on to become a successful coach and commentator. If a Bollywood movie were made on the life and career of Lalita Shastri: The opening scene could begin in the early 1930s in a rural setting in Prayagraj, India. A young Lalita is shown sitting under the shade of a tree, carving her name on banana leaves with a wooden stick, as she dreams of receiving an education despite being a girl surrounded by numerous challenges and societal restrictions. The camera could pan out to reveal her being scolded by an elder for wasting time and neglecting her household responsibilities. As a determined Lalita invites criticism for daring to be ambitious, the scene could contrastingly showcase her internal strength and resilience. As the opening sequence unfolds, a montage of key moments in Lalita Shastri's life would begin: the challenges of marrying at the age of 12, her struggles to fight superstitions, the difficulties she faces as the wife of Lal Bahadur Shastri, the 2nd Prime Minister of India, and her determination in pursuing her education. No, these questions are not the same. The first question is about creating an opening scene for a movie based on the life and career of Ravishankar Jayadritha Shastri, a former Indian cricketer, and commentator. The second question focuses on creating an opening scene for a movie based on the life and career of Lalita Shastri, the wife of Lal Bahadur Shastri, and an advocate for women's education and empowerment. The subject matter, personalities, and contexts of these two questions are distinct from each other, making them different."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Your goal is to complete the task as faithfully as you can. While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. What is a one-sentence summary of the following article? Due to the multiple varieties of Sweet William and the different methods of growing them, you may hear conflicting information on when your flowers will grow and how long they will last. Biennial varieties bloom in their second year, and then die. Perennial varieties are supposed to regrow flowers year after year, but Sweet William perennials usually take two years to bloom and often die before they bloom a second time. Correct care of Sweet William perennials increases the chance of reseeding, as described in the section on caring for Sweet William. If you want your Sweet William to flower reliably within a year, acquire seedlings or adult plants in fall or spring. Confirm with the previous owner that the plant will bloom this year before you take it home, since some seedlings may not flower until their second year. Seeds that claim to be annuals (flowering and dying within one year) may or may not live up to the promise, depending on the variety and how it reacts to your local climate. Sweet William seeds are tough enough to survive most winters, and can be planted in fall or late spring to bloom 12 to 18 months later. If the plants have already started growing, or if you are concerned about a harsh winter, you may keep the plants in indoor pots, then transplant them outdoors in early spring. Once the seedlings are six to eight weeks old, they will transplant easily, with low risk of causing damage. Sweet Williams grow fastest in full sun, but are best suited for cool climates. Ideally, they should receive four to five hours of direct sunlight a day, but planting them in light shade is a wise option if you live in a hot climate (USDA zone 8 and above). Sweet William prefers loose, rich soil that is well draining. Water should drain quickly through the soil, and never pool on top of compact, hard soil. Optionally, you may churn up the existing soil and supplement it with potting soil to provide more nutrients. While you do not need to test the pH of your soil to successfully grow Sweet William, you may adjust the pH to slightly alkaline (approximately 6.75) if you already have a pH garden kit. Garden soil pH kits are available at garden supply stores or online. Again, this is not a mandatory tool for growing Sweet William, which are fairly adaptable when it comes to soil pH. Plant Sweet William in winter (hot climates only), spring, or summer (cool climates only). Place them on the surface and lightly cover them with 1/8 inch (0.6 cm) of soil, or dig a trench to this depth and refill after planting the seeds. Space the seeds 6 inches (15 cm) apart in ideal circumstances to reduce the chance of rot and disease transmission. If you do not have room to give them this much space, you may bunch them closer together, but take special care not to overwater in this case. If you are transplanting seedlings, simply transfer the soil around the roots into a hole twice as wide as the soil ball, then refill. Take care not to bury any part of the seedling's stem; the plant should be buried to the same level it was before. Sweet William seeds and seedlings benefit from an immediate watering after transplanting, but take care not to soak them with more water than can drain from the soil. Transplanted seedlings should be kept in moist but not soggy soil for a few days. Once they are established and recover from any withering that may occur, care for them as described in the care section.","completion":"This article discusses the various factors that affect Sweet William growth, including biennial and perennial varieties, proper care for increased reseeding, ideal planting conditions, and transplanting tips to ensure healthy blooms."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. It's daybreak on Sara Creek, a sleepy backwater that sits near Yorktown, Virginia, and empties into the Chesapeake. The early morning fog slowly lifts to reveal the ripples of water, the boats swaying, and a picturesque harbor. Tommy Leggett works to reduce polluted waters in Chesapeake Bay by growing oysters. Local watermen have been fishing around this area for generations. It's beginning to rain, and Tommy Leggett, a very proud and reserved waterman, combs over his white beard with his rough hands and prepares his boat, \\"Chesapeake Gold,\\" for what looks like a day of fishing out in the bay. \\"I've been a waterman for over 20 years,\\" he says. The difference now is Leggett doesn't fish anymore. He's an eco-conscious farmer and advocate who works on his sustainable oyster farm in the James River. He uses the term \\"aquaculture\\" to describe what he's doing here. \\"It refers to the husbandry, or farming, of aquatic species.\\" Leggett sells the oysters he harvests to local restaurants, growing about 100,000 a year as a part-time business. He makes sure he always has a product to replace the ones that he sells. He shares his expertise with other watermen, educating them about oyster aquaculture and the importance of sustainability. Watch Leggett's efforts to save the bay ». Leggett also sells his fresh products to the area market. \\"Customers want to know if the oysters they are buying are local, which means they're fresher and taste better.\\" Waterman: Many foods rely on oysters. The Chesapeake Bay, which is the United States' largest estuary, covering more than 64,000 square miles and spanning across several states, has seen its fish, crab and oyster stocks dwindle, in part, because of pollution over the past several decades. \\"It was once said that the oyster stock in the Chesapeake Bay could have filtered the entire volume of the bay, in a single day,\\" says Leggett, who has been farming shellfish in the watershed since 1995. \\"Most people don't think of oysters having come from farms, and historically they haven't. They've been harvested from the wild fishery, which is supplied by Mother Nature.\\" That wild fishery, which still exists today, has seen its share of setbacks. From disease to overharvesting, Leggett knows what's at stake, and he's trying to get the message out. \\"Oysters filter the water, and they provide habitat for other species. There are so many food webs that depend and rely on oysters.\\" Not only does Leggett farm, he also works for the Chesapeake Bay Foundation (CBF) as the Virginia oyster and fishery scientist. He is trying to do his part to reverse the trends of depleting oyster stocks. \\"If we don't restore oysters, we're not going to restore the Bay,\\" he says. He wants to make sure people understand what just one single oyster can do. \\"One oyster out here in one of our bags can filter as much as 50 gallons of water a day.\\" By filtering the water, this important shellfish can take away deadly pollutants that eventually could deplete the crab and fish stocks, which in turn can leave fishermen without work. Millions of oyster 'moms and dads' The CBF helps to grow millions of oysters that will eventually make their way to sanctuary reefs and will not be harvested. The oysters will reproduce, and make a home for thousands of sea critters that will eventually become food for larger animals. \\"Its all a giant food chain,\\" Leggett explains. Leggett works alongside Jackie Harmon as the CBF's sole employees at a worksite near the Institute of Marine Science in Hayes, Virginia. iReport.com: Show us the environment near you. \\"Our goal is to replenish oyster stocks,\\" Harmon says, \\"and by doing so, the oysters cannot only help filter water, but also help with shoreline erosion.\\" \\"It's a sustainable way for watermen of the Chesapeake to continue their livelihood as fishermen, in a more eco-friendly way.\\" Harmon also maintains an oyster farm on the weekend and hopes to one day sell her oysters at local farmers' markets. Leggett puts it this way: \\"All we're doing here is making moms and dads to help jump-start reefs throughout the Chesapeake.\\" Leggett and Harmon are optimistic. They believe current federal and state administrations are doing great things for the environment. They believe the CBF's message is being heard. However, a lot more needs to be done, Harmon says. \\"People are becoming more aware and want to take care of their environment, and they want to make it a better place for future generations,\\" she says. So as the land-based movement makes it apparent that buying local is the healthy way to live, seafood should be known in that same light. Leggett believes the Chesapeake Bay can produce the amount of seafood needed for the entire region and he thinks with careful oversight, the watersheds can be an abundant source for that local seafood industry again, just like it was decades ago.

All types of plate boundaries have earthquakes. Convection within the Earth causes the plates to move. As the plates move, stresses build. When the stresses build too much, the rocks break. The break releases the energy that was stored in the rocks. The sudden release of energy creates an earthquake. During an earthquake the rocks usually move several centimeters or rarely as much as a few meters. Elastic rebound theory describes how earthquakes occur ( Figure below ).

To further evaluate the given premise, we need more context and details regarding the situation at hand. If additional information reveals that a stunt is indeed taking place while the bride walks down the aisle, and all other aspects of the premise align, then we could conclude the premise is true. Conversely, should the additional information conflict with the premise in any way, the premise would not hold true. For instance, if the context described that as the bride approaches the groom, the groom's friends entertain him with a friendly prank which the bride finds amusing as she walks down the aisle, then the premise would be indeed true. However, if the bride is simply walking down the aisle, and no pranks or blindfolds are in the scene, then the premise would be false.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. The riser is the small pipe that connects the sprinkler to the water line. The sprinkler head sits on the riser, which helps to regulate its up-and-down movement, rather than directly on the water line itself. To remove the sprinkler head, twist it to the left, or counterclockwise. If the riser comes off with the sprinkler head, simply unscrew the two pieces and reattach the riser to the water line, being careful not to damage the threading of either piece in the process. Be careful not to let too much dirt or debris fall into the open water line. It may help to cover it with a small cloth or plastic bag while you're working. To ensure that you're getting the type of head you need, take the old part to the store with you and purchase the same brand and model. If for some reason that's not an option, confirm that the new head has the same overall length and diameter as the old one. Sprinkler heads come in several different sizes and lengths. If you get one that's too long, it will stick up high out of the grass after you install it. If it's too short, it may not reach the surface of your lawn from its seat on the water line. Consider shopping around for a head that features a removable flush cap rather than a traditional nozzle. Flush caps make it easy to clear dirt from the head following installation or use. Wind the tape neatly around the riser threads so that it forms a thin, uniform layer. Applying thread seal tape (also known as “Teflon tape”) will fill excess space between the riser and the body of the sprinkler head, creating a snug connection and decreasing the chances of future leaks. You can find thread seal tape in the plumbing aisle of any hardware store or home improvement center. It's not necessary to use thread seal tape on polyethylene risers, as the soft plastic will typically bend and expand enough to form a secure seal on its own. Position the female end of the sprinkler head over the male end of the riser and twist it to the right (clockwise) to install it. Continue tightening the head by hand until it's nice and secure. Jiggle your new sprinkler head a few times to make sure it isn't loose. Any extra movement could be a sign of a poor connection. Rotate the sprinkler head until it's pointing toward your lawn, shrubs, of flower beds. The last thing you want is for your newly-installed sprinkler to water your car instead of your plants! There should be no need to adjust a radial sprinkler head. These send out water in a full 360-degree radius, ensuring even distribution over the area they're situated in.

The film was shot at RKO Radio Pictures Studio in Culver City, California, and the 89 acre RKO movie ranch in Encino, where \`\`Bedford Falls'' consisted of Art Director Max Ree's Oscar-winning sets originally designed for the 1931 epic film Cimarron that covered 4 acres (1.6 ha), assembled from three separate parts, with a main street stretching 300 yards (three city blocks), with 75 stores and buildings, and a residential neighborhood. For 'IAWL' Capra built a working bank set, added a tree-lined center parkway, and planted 20 full grown oak trees to existing sets. Pigeons, cats, and dogs were allowed to roam the mammoth set in order to give the \`\`town'' a lived-in feel. Due to the requirement to film in an \`\`alternate universe'' setting as well as during different seasons, the set was extremely adaptable. RKO created \`\`chemical snow'' for the film in order to avoid the need for dubbed dialogue when actors walked across the earlier type of movie snow, made up of crushed cornflakes.

However, creating and maintaining a budget doesn't have to be a painful process. \\"If you ... start thinking about [budgeting] as a way to concisely create a better environment for yourself using your resources, it will get that much easier,\\" says Leslie Beck, a certified financial planner at Compass Wealth Management in Maplewood, N.J. Aside from maintaining a positive mindset, here are eight guidelines to help you successfully build and manage a budget: . While a budget can be a great tool for managing finances, it can quickly become overwhelming if it's overly detailed or idealistic. \\"There are things that you will likely sacrifice when budgeting, but it's very important to be realistic and understand your own habits,\\" says Kristin Wong, a contributor to the financial blog Get Rich Slowly. \\"If I have a problem area within my budget, like eating out or shopping, instead of trying to focus on everything and being too hard on myself, I pick that one area. The hardest part of a budget is sticking to it, so the easier you can make it, the better.\\" . Establish your budget for a time period that's long enough for you to see results. Stephen Lovell, a certified financial planner with Lovell Wealth Legacy in Walnut Creek, Calif., suggests budgeting for one year at a time. Budgeting month-to-month can accommodate everyday living expenses and bills, but a yearly budget can help you also plan for larger and more infrequent expenses, like income taxes or holiday presents. \\"You don't want things to slip away,\\" Lovell says. \\"It's better to be approximately right than precisely wrong.\\" . An emergency fund should be an essential component of every budget. It can help you finance unexpected expenses like medical bills so you don't have to pull income from other areas. \\"For example, allocate just as much to your savings as your emergency fund,\\" Wong says. \\"Once you have that, it's a lot easier to maintain the budget if a big expense springs up.\\" . Just as there are many ways to create a budget, there are also many ways to keep track of it. Whether it's through an online budgeting program like Mint or Quicken or on paper, stick to whatever works best for you. \\"Make sure you approach it in a manner that you are comfortable with,\\" Beck says. . Whether your budget affects your spouse, partner or roommate, communication about the established financial plan is crucial. \\"If you have two people who have really disjointed approaches to money, that's really going to be a problem in the long run,\\" Lovell says. %VIRTUAL-article-sponsoredlinks%\\"You need to be aware of the other person's attitudes about money and realize that your own aren't universal. Everyone needs to be on the same page and after the same goals for the budget to be successful.\\" Being open with those around you about your budget can also help you create a support system while you work to get your finances on track. \\"Talking to friends really helped me,\\" Wong says. \\"For example, even talking about it helped me when I was shopping with my mom. If I hadn't told her that I was on a strict budget, I probably would have spent more. She was there to hold me accountable.\\" . If over time, your budget results don't match your expectations or financial needs, you may assume the plan is wrong. However, it's likely that you simply uncovered unknown problem areas. \\"The things that pop up will actually let you know what the real norm is, so pay attention to what it is telling you,\\" Lovell says. \\"If you think, for instance, that you spend 12 percent of the family income on discretionary items, and you find after tracking for two months it's more like 28 percent, then something is off there.\\" . Following a budget typically means making cuts in less essential areas or eliminating some costs completely. However, if reducing the amount of money going out isn't doing enough, look for ways to increase the money coming in. \\"Take a part-time job or sell something that is just sitting in your closet taking up space,\\" Beck says. \\"People tend to think about just the one side of the equation when working to keep their budget on track, but there's another side that you can influence too, whether it's for a temporary or permanent basis.\\" . Making sacrifices is part of managing expenses, but if you set restrictions too high and too soon, you will be less likely to follow your budget over the long term. \\"If you enjoy a latte every day, don't go from 0 to 60 in terms of cutting back. Do it gradually,\\" Wong says. \\"Nobody wants to stick to a budget that cuts out everything fun in their life. If you keep failing at your budget, you are going to be discouraged and you're not going to want to do it anymore.\\" 8 Steps to Creating a Personal Budget Mobile-network companies do everything they can to pull you in the door, with smartphone offerings that often come with no upfront cost. Even the most popular models are available at big discounts, with most providers offering large subsidies in order to lock you into two-year contracts. Once you're locked in, though, costs for monthly data, text and voice plans can run well over 100 a month. That's fine if you actually use everything you're paying for, but many people don't. One Illinois consumer advocacy group found that state residents wasted as much as 1.4 billion by signing up for more-inclusive plans than they actually needed. Threats of overage fees lure subscribers into paying for more than they use. But look at your actual usage and then see if a cheaper plan would serve you just as well. Speaking of phone service ... Cellphone use has become nearly universal in the U.S., with a Pew Internet study finding that 91 percent of American adults have a cell phone. With plans that include unlimited or large amounts of minutes for use either locally or for long-distance calls, cellphones increasingly serve all the telephone needs people have. In that light, paying for a landline is of limited use. The main advantage is that landline phone service often continues to work during power outages when cellphone use fails, but an average landline bill of around 30 a month is a fairly hefty price to pay for that security. Like cellphone providers, cable companies have pushed customers into larger packages than many people want. Without a-la-carte options to pick and choose channels, many customers have to buy expensive tiered packages to get the channels they actually want. With the rise of streaming alternatives like Netflix ( ) and Hulu, some former cable customers have successfully cut the cord, replacing monthly cable bills of 100 or more with much lower subscription payments. Also, look into cheaper package options that cable operators must provide. They're often not advertised, but they can be much less expensive than typical standard cable packages. As summer heats up, cooling costs are on the rise, but one solution that covers both heating bills in winter and air-conditioning in summer is a programmable thermostat. By letting you tailor your energy use to times when you're actually at home, you can cut your total bills by 10 percent a year or more, according to figures from the U.S. Department of Energy. One downside of programmable thermostats in the past was that they didn't handle unexpected changes in plans very well. But advances in technology make it even easier to use programmable thermostats, with some devices linked to the Internet and controllable using a smartphone. That way, if you're going to be home an hour early, you can reset your thermostat remotely in advance. Mortgage rates have been on the rise recently, but some homeowners might still benefit from refinancing their home loans. Even with 30-year mortgages having gone up by more than a full percentage point in just a couple of months, rates of around 4.5 percent are still well below historical average levels. Refinancing comes with upfront costs, so it's important not just to look at monthly savings but also at how long you plan to live in your home and whether you can avoid or reduce costs associated with refinancing. Given how big a part of your overall budget your mortgage payment is, though, even small percentage savings can add up to a nice boost for your finances. Monthly bills can put a big weight on your shoulders. But by taking these simple steps and looking at other ways to trim your budget, you can go a long way toward escaping the bonds of paycheck-to-paycheck living and declaring your own financial independence from your bills. Write a one or two sentence summary.","completion":"Creating a personal budget involves establishing realistic goals, setting a suitable time frame, maintaining an emergency fund, using a tracking method, communicating with those involved, identifying problem areas, looking for ways to increase income, and making gradual sacrifices.

Multi-choice problem: Based on the sentence \\"The child leaps across to land on the frog statue.\\", is the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" a true sentence? Options: [i] yes [ii] it is not possible to tell [iii] no","completion":"[iii] no The sentence \\"The child leaps across to land on the frog statue\\" provides information about the child's actions at that moment. It clearly states that the child is engaged in some form of physical activity, specifically leaping, in order to land on a frog statue. This demonstrates that the child is not only awake but also actively participating in a playful or adventurous activity. In contrast, the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" implies that the child is in a state of rest and not engaged in any activity. Sleeping is a passive state and is the complete opposite of leaping or engaging in any kind of physical action. Therefore, it can be concluded that the sentence \\"a child is sleeping\\" is not true based on the information given in the original sentence. It is important to note that the context provided in the original sentence is limited, and we are only able to assess the child's activity in that particular moment. We do not have information about what the child was doing before, after, or at any other time not specified in the sentence. However, based on the data provided, the answer to the multi-choice problem is option [iii] no, as the child's actions in the given sentence contradict the idea of the child sleeping."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

The government wanted to appoint him General Secretary of the Composers' Union, but in order to hold that position he was required to attain Party membership. It was understood that Nikita Khrushchev, the First Secretary of the Communist Party from 1953 to 1964, was looking for support from the leading ranks of the intelligentsia in an effort to create a better relationship with the Soviet Union's artists. This event has been interpreted variously as a show of commitment, a mark of cowardice, the result of political pressure, or his free decision. On the one hand, the apparat was undoubtedly less repressive than it had been before Stalin's death. On the other, his son recalled that the event reduced Shostakovich to tears, and he later told his wife Irina that he had been blackmailed. Lev Lebedinsky has said that the composer was suicidal. From 1962, he served as a delegate in the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. Once he joined the Party, several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music were published in Pravda under his name. In joining the party, Shostakovich was also committing himself to finally writing the homage to Lenin that he had promised before. His Twelfth Symphony, which portrays the Bolshevik Revolution and was completed in 1961, was dedicated to Vladimir Lenin and called \\"The Year 1917.\\" Around this time, his health began to deteriorate. Shostakovich's musical response to these personal crises was the Eighth String Quartet, composed in only three days. He subtitled the piece \\"To the victims of fascism and war\\", ostensibly in memory of the Dresden fire bombing that took place in 1945. Yet, like the Tenth Symphony, this quartet incorporates quotations from several of his past works and his musical monogram. Shostakovich confessed to his friend Isaak Glikman, \\"I started thinking that if some day I die, nobody is likely to write a work in memory of me, so I had better write one myself.\\"... contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person who joined the Party, which promoted several articles he did not write denouncing individualism in music that were published in Pravda under his name?, what is it ?

This article: A middle Saxon pendant dating from 601–700 AD was discovered in a field in Little Thetford in 1952. This 3-centimetre (1.18 in) diameter by 1-centimetre (0.39 in) thick pendant, made from rock-crystal, gold, garnet, and amethyst coloured-glass, has been worked in a lathe. The workmanship is not of a high standard. Æthelberht of Kent was said to have built a church at Cratendune around 600 AD, about a mile from what is now Ely Cathedral. In 673 AD, Æthelthryth considered restoring this church, thought to have been destroyed by Penda of Mercia, but instead made what is now Ely Cathedral the site of her monastery. An early Anglo-Saxon cemetery, used at some point between 410–1065 AD, was uncovered around 1945 near Little Thetford (52.376N, 0.2375E), and was thought to be this lost village of Cratendune. A deserted Saxon settlement, 410–1065 AD, examined in 1999 in Ely, may also be a candidate for this lost site of worship. Little Thetford means little public or people's ford—Old English lȳtel Thiutforda (c. 972) and Liteltedford [sic] (1086)—compare with Thetford, Norfolk—Old English Thēodford (late 9th century) and Tedfort (1086). The online Domesday Book records the settlement under the name Liteltetford [sic]. The first written evidence that Ely Abbey had inherited the Little Thetford lands was in the 12th-century chronicle, Liber Eliensis. The will of Ælfwaru (d. 1007), an Anglo-Saxon noblewoman, granted estates in Cambridgeshire and Norfolk to the Abbey, which included \\"... that land at Thetford and fisheries around those marshes\\". In 1110, Hervey le Breton, Bishop of Ely, granted the manor to William Brito, his Archdeacon and also his nephew. Chapel Hill in the village, near the river, commemorates the site of Harrimere Chapel, used since 1381. Some of the stone from this chapel, dismantled in 1571, was used in the building of St George's Church. By 1539, the Little Thetford manor and its estates contained arable land, pasture, gardens, and orchards.

Solve this instance: Passage: The white-naped xenopsaris (Xenopsaris albinucha), also known as the reed becard and white-naped becard, is a species of suboscine bird in the family Tityridae, the only member of the genus Xenopsaris. It is found in South America, in humid subtropical and tropical savanna climates in most of the countries east of the Andes: Venezuela, Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Argentina. Living in open woodland and other open forest habitats, it is mostly sedentary, though some populations may be migratory. The species, which is closely related to becards and tityras, was thought to be either a tyrant-flycatcher or cotinga, before it was placed in Tityridae. The bird is 12.5 to 13 cm (4.9–5.1 in) in length, with whitish undersides, a black crown, and grey-brown upperparts. The sexes are similar in appearance, though the females have duller upperparts. It feeds on insects in the foliage of trees and bushes, and sometimes on the ground. Nesting occurs in a simple cup nest placed in the fork of a tree.

Each block represents an \\"n.\\" Now, let's put the green and red blocks together. Since both the green and red blocks represent \\"n,\\" we can add them together.

Summarize: In general, you’ll need a space that’s about 14–15 m (46–49 ft) for your horse. This will give it enough room to trot, but not so much room that it will feel like it’s out at the open, which might make the horse try to escape. If you don’t have a ring, try using bales of hay to make a circle instead. When you're handling the lunge rein, take the time to fold it neatly in accordion-style pleats. Folding the reins will help keep any excess from getting tangled, and it will make it easier to hold. Never fold the coil the line around your hand. If the horse bolts, the line could pull tight around your hand, causing you serious injury.","completion":"To summarize, when setting up a suitable space for lunging a horse, it's important to provide an area that is approximately 14-15 meters (46-49 feet) in size. This allows the horse enough room to trot comfortably while also preventing feelings of being out in the open, which may lead to attempts at escaping. If a specific ring is unavailable, creating a circle using bales of hay is a viable alternative. Furthermore, proper handling of the lunge rein is essential for both safety and practicality. To achieve this, take your time folding the rein in accordion-style pleats, which assists in preventing tangles and facilitates an easier grip. However, it's crucial to avoid wrapping the line around your hand as this could result in serious injury if the horse bolts and the rein pulls tightly. In conclusion, providing a suitable space and correctly handling the lunge rein are key factors in lunging a horse safely and effectively. The ideal space should be approximately 14-15 meters wide, and using bales of hay can be an alternative to a traditional ring. Proper handling of the lunge rein, by neatly folding it in accordion-style pleats, ensures safety and efficiency during the lunging process."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Please answer the following question: The following article contains an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose two brothers died in 1823? , can you please find it? George Frederic Watts was born in 1817, the son of a London musical instrument manufacturer. His two brothers died in 1823, and his mother in 1826, giving Watts an obsession with death throughout his life. Watts was apprenticed as a sculptor at the age of 10, and by his mid-teens was proficient enough as an artist to be earning a living as a portrait painter. At the age of 18 he gained admission to the Royal Academy schools, although he disliked their methods and his attendance was intermittent. From 1837, Watts was successful enough to devote himself full-time to painting.In 1843 Watts travelled to Italy where he remained for four years. On his return to London he suffered from melancholia, and painted many notably gloomy works. His skills were widely celebrated, and in 1856 he decided to devote himself to portrait painting. His portraits were extremely highly regarded, and in 1867 he was elected to the Royal Academy, at the time the highest honour available to an artist, although he rapidly became disillusioned with its culture. From 1870 onwards he became widely renowned as a painter of allegorical and mythical subjects; by this time, he was one of the most highly regarded artists in the world. In 1881 he added a glass-roofed gallery to his home at Little Holland House, which was open to the public at weekends, further increasing his fame.

Question: If I wanted to get some oxygen, what will I get it from? Choices: - the sky - air - earth - space shuttle - water The rationale to choose \\"air\\" as the answer is that: Answer:","completion":"You should choose \\"air\\" as the answer because the air in the Earth's atmosphere is the most accessible and abundant source of oxygen to sustain life. Here is the rationale explained in further detail: 1. Air: The Earth's atmosphere comprises roughly 21% oxygen, making it the best choice for obtaining oxygen. It is an essential component for humans and many other organisms to breathe and survive. Air is readily available on the surface of the Earth, and it is the primary source of oxygen for combustion, respiration, and other essential processes. 2. The Sky: Although the sky is technically the visual representation of the atmosphere above us, it does not refer to a specific source of oxygen. Choosing the sky would be too vague and not directly designate the source. 3. Earth: The term \\"Earth\\" in this context refers to the planet as a whole, including its physical and chemical composition. It doesn't specify a source of oxygen; instead, it merely indicates the world we live on. 4. Space Shuttle: A space shuttle is a vehicle used for space exploration and travel. While the shuttle has an oxygen supply for astronauts inside, it is not a primary or accessible source of oxygen for people on Earth. The space shuttle's oxygen supply comes from Earth and serves a limited quantity for specific purposes. 5. Water: Water is a chemical compound consisting of hydrogen and oxygen (H2O). Though it contains oxygen, it is not an accessible source for humans to breathe directly. Instead, oxygen from the air dissolves into water, and aquatic creatures such as fish utilize this dissolved oxygen. To separate the oxygen from water, you would need to apply a process such as electrolysis, which isn't feasible for daily oxygen consumption. In summary, the best choice for obtaining oxygen is from the air due to its accessibility, abundance, and the fact that it directly provides the oxygen required by living organisms for respiration and other vital processes."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

The unfancied Central Americans booked their place in the last 16 and condemned Roy Hodgson’s side to an early exit following their 1-0 victory over Italy. England had been beaten 2-1 by the Italians in their Group C opener having allowed midfield playmaker Pirlo to dictate the contest. Circle of life: Costa Rica celebrate their 1-0 victory over Italy which sends them through to the last 16. Joy: Costa Rica have booked their place in the knockout rounds with a game to spare. Grounded: Andrea Pirlo did not inspire Italy as he had done against England. But Costa Rica subdued the Juventus man as Bryan Ruiz’s first-half header gave them an unlikely but deserved win. Henry also believes Costa Rica were good value for their success and drew comparisons with England’s failure to deal with Pirlo. ‘Costa Rica went forward and were pressing Pirlo. He never had one chance to turn and pick a pass. If you let Pirlo play he will expose you,’ said the BBC pundit. ‘They did not show Pirlo any respect during the game.’ Out: England will be heading home after the group stage.

But if you have a good team, sometimes you don’t need names. ‘Costa Rica showed us that without the quality that England, Italy and Uruguay have, if you are well organised and have an idea of what you need to do then you can win.’ Fellow pundit Clarence Seedorf echoed Henry’s sentiment. ‘I think Costa Rica are better tactically (than England) because the (Italy) midfield was completely blocked,’ said the former Holland midfielder. ‘I agree with Thierry, it’s about having a team.’ Rio Ferdinand, meanwhile, says that England did not deserve to remain in the competition on the evidence of their defeats to Italy and Uruguay. ‘You have to earn the right to stay in a tournament and England have not done that,’ he said. ‘They have been a bit naïve in situations. When they got back into it against Uruguay at 1-1 we had a chance to get a point and say “right, we’re ready for the last game” and they didn’t.’ And ITV pundit Patrick Vieira said: ‘You can't say that England have played badly over the 2 games.

Dequina is already awake. Holding a flashlight and a bucket, he is walking in the pre-dawn darkness along the shore of Old Poblacion Beach in the town of Maitum, Sarangani, in the far south of the Philippines. A few minutes later, he spots a patch of sand that appears to have been disturbed by a turtle. Dequina studies the area carefully, figuring out where the eggs have been buried, and then starts digging slowly. After clearing away several centimeters of sand, he uncovers a large group of eggs, roughly the size of ping-pong balls. He picks them up and puts them in the bucket. Dequina carries the eggs to his hatchery , some 50 meters away from the seashore. The hatchery is really just a sandy patch of land under the coconut trees enclosed by a black fence. It is here that he buries the turtle eggs he has collected. Today, Dequina scoops a hole, puts the eggs in it, and covers them with sand. After 45 to 70 days, the eggs will hatch. Dequina will then carry the hatchlings to the shore, and release them into the sea. He admits to feeling sorrow as he sets the hatchlings free -- most are hunted down by natural predators, and just one percent survive to adulthood. According to the Philippine Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR), eight species of sea turtles face extinction, including four that come to the shores of Sarangani to lay their eggs -- the Hawksbill, Olive Ridley, Loggerhead and Green Turtles. After learning about their plight , Dequina attended a DENR training session on turtle conservation and decided to take action. He helped the local government to set up the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary next to his house in 2003. The hatchery drew the attention of the locals. \\"They started to change their attitudes towards sea turtles,\\" 52-year-old Dequina says. \\"If they see turtle eggs, they will either bring them to me or inform me of the nesting places.\\" Over the past ten years, more than 3,000 hatchlings have been released to the ocean. A:","completion":"What motivated Danilo C. Dequina to establish the Pawikan Nesting Sanctuary in Maitum, Sarangani? A) He was required to set up the sanctuary by the local government.

Spar with an opponent and focus on defense rather than attack. Article:","completion":"Title: Becoming a Better Boxer with Dumbbells, Jump Rope, and Defensive Sparring Have you ever wondered how to become a better boxer? Well, there are three super fun and helpful things you can do to improve your boxing skills: holding dumbbells, jumping rope, and sparring with a defensive focus. Let's learn about each of these activities so you can start practicing and become an amazing boxer! First, let's talk about using dumbbells. Dumbbells are like small weights you can hold in each hand. You might be thinking, \\"How can holding weights help me become a better boxer?\\" Well, when you hold dumbbells while you practice your punches and other boxing moves, it actually helps you build stronger muscles. This is very important because stronger muscles allow you to punch harder and faster, just like your favorite superheroes! Second, we have jumping rope. You might have seen people jumping rope at a park or even played with a jump rope during your playtime. Jumping rope is not only a fun game but also a great way to get better at boxing. When you jump rope, it helps you improve your footwork, which is how you move your feet while boxing. Good footwork is important so you can be quick on your feet and move smoothly around the boxing ring like a dancing butterfly! Lastly, we'll talk about sparring with a defensive focus. Sparring is like practicing boxing with a friend or a partner. It's important to remember that you're not trying to hurt each other in sparring, but just learning and having fun together. Now, there are two main parts of boxing – attacking your opponent (throwing punches) and defending yourself (protecting your face and body from punches). When you spar, it's good to focus on your defense so you can learn how to protect yourself better and not get hurt by your opponent's punches. So, there you have it! To become a fantastic boxer, remember to hold dumbbells while you practice your moves, jump rope every day, and spar with a focus on defense rather than attack. By doing these three fun and helpful activities, you'll see your boxing skills improve in no time. Good luck, and have a great time becoming the amazing boxer you've always wanted to be!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. The more long term the exposure to stress is, the more impact it may have. However, short term exposure to stress also causes impairment in memory by interfering with the function of the hippocampus. Research shows that subjects placed in a stressful situation for a short amount of time still have blood glucocorticoid levels that have increased drastically when measured after the exposure is completed. When subjects are asked to complete a learning task after short term exposure they have often difficulties. Prenatal stress also hinders the ability to learn and memorize by disrupting the development of the hippocampus and can lead to unestablished long term potentiation in the offspring of severely stressed parents. Although the stress is applied prenatally, the offspring show increased levels of glucocorticoids when they are subjected to stress later on in life. Does it matter how long someone is exposed to stress to have an impact on their memory? (If the question is unanswerable, say \\"unanswerable\\")","completion":"Yes, the duration of exposure to stress plays a significant role in determining the impact on memory. Research has established that both short-term and long-term exposure to stress can affect memory function in different ways. It is important to understand the different ways in which stress duration affects memory, as well as the underlying mechanisms involved. Short-term exposure to stress can result in impairment of memory functions due to the immediate effect on the hippocampus, a critical brain region associated with learning and memory. During a stressful event, the body releases cortisol, also known as the \\"stress hormone.\\" When cortisol levels increase, it interferes with the normal functioning of the hippocampus, disrupting processes such as memory consolidation and retrieval. This may lead to difficulties in retaining or recalling information, even if the exposure to stress was brief. Long-term exposure to stress has a more pronounced effect on memory. Prolonged stress exposure can lead to lasting changes in the brain, such as reduced volume and impaired functioning of the hippocampus. In addition, long-term exposure to high levels of cortisol may cause damage to neurons in the hippocampus, which may contribute to memory deficits. Chronic stress can also disrupt neuroplasticity, which is essential for the formation of new memories and adaptation to new environments. Moreover, the prolonged impact of stress hormones and other factors such as inflammation can contribute to the development of cognitive decline and increase the risk for neurodegenerative disorders like Alzheimer's disease. Prenatal stress is another factor that can affect memory and learning capabilities. Prenatal stress may hinder the development of the hippocampus and impair the establishment of long-term potentiation, a process that strengthens the connections between neurons and is crucial for learning and memory formation. Exposure to prenatal stress may cause offspring to show increased levels of glucocorticoids when confronted with stress later in life, predisposing them to memory problems and cognitive deficits. In summary, both short-term and long-term exposure to stress can have deleterious effects on an individual's memory. The impact of stress on memory is determined by various factors, including the duration of stress exposure, the type of stressor, and its timing in an individual's life. It is crucial to manage stress effectively and develop coping strategies to minimize its impact on cognitive functions, such as memory and learning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer the following question: One day after a mass shooting killed 49 people at a gay nightclub in Orlando, Florida, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump reiterated his support for a plan to temporarily ban Muslims from entering the United States. At a campaign rally in New Hampshire Monday, Trump promised his supporters that, if elected, he would use the executive powers to \\"suspend immigration from areas of the world where there is a proven history of terrorism against the United States, Europe or our allies, until we fully understand how to end these threats.\\" Although the suspected Orlando shooter, Omar Mateen, was an American citizen, Trump suggested immigrants from the Middle East can come to the U.S. and radicalize people who are already here, or work to convince them online. \\"The media talks about homegrown terrorism,\\" Trump said. \\"But Islamic radicalism ... and the networks that nurture it are imports from overseas whether you like it or don't like it.\\" Refugees and immigrants from conflict ridden Middle Eastern countries like Syria, Iraq and Libya could \\"be a better, bigger more horrible version than the legendary Trojan horse ever was,\\" Trump said. But a recent Brookings Institution survey found Americans are far more welcoming of refugees than the billionaire candidate. Of those surveyed, 59 percent support accepting refugees, while 41 percent oppose it. Those views are split right down party lines, with just 38 percent of Republicans supporting taking in refugees from Syria and the Middle East, compared to 77 percent of Democrats. But among Trump supporters, an overwhelming 77 percent said they oppose taking in refugees. The Obama administration has set a goal of admitting as many as 10,000 Syrian refugees to the United States by the fall.Respondents of the surveys also were sharply divided on whether they would be willing to accept refugees from Syria in particular, with 61 percent of Republicans saying the U.S. should not accept Syrian refugees, compared to 27 percent of Democrats.

You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer this question: what method of cookery is used to cook cakes and scones?","completion":"The method of cookery used to cook cakes and scones is called baking. Baking is a dry-heat cooking method that uses an oven to transform dough or batter into baked goods, such as cakes, scones, bread, cookies, and pastries. The baking process relies on the oven's heat to cook the food evenly from all sides and produce a pleasant crust on the outside while ensuring a soft and moist interior. Specific temperatures and cooking times are required to achieve the desired final product. Here's a detailed explanation of the baking process used for cakes and scones: 1. Preparation: Before starting the baking process, it's vital to gather all the ingredients and equipment needed, like measuring cups, spoons, mixing bowls, a whisk or mixer, baking pans or trays, and a working oven. The ingredients typically include flour, sugar, butter or other fats, eggs, milk, baking powder or soda, and flavorings or other additives. Ensure all ingredients are at room temperature for optimal mixing and results. Each recipe may need unique preparation steps such as sifting flour, greasing and flouring the baking pan, and preheating the oven to a specific temperature. 2. Mixing: For both cakes and scones, mixing the ingredients properly is essential for the ideal texture and volume. Cakes usually follow either the creaming method or the all-in-one method. The creaming method involves beating the sugar and butter together until light and fluffy, then adding the eggs one by one, followed by the dry ingredients alternately with any wet ingredients. On the other hand, the all-in-one method requires all ingredients to be added to the bowl and mixed simultaneously. Scones follow the rubbing-in or biscuit method, which starts by mixing the dry ingredients and then rubbing the butter into the flour mixture with fingertips or a pastry cutter until it resembles coarse crumbs. The liquid ingredients are then added to form a slightly sticky dough. 3. Portioning and shaping: Once the batter or dough is mixed, cakes and scones require portioning and shaping before baking. For cakes, the batter is poured into the prepared pans, smooth the top, and tap the pan lightly against the countertop to remove air bubbles. Scones are typically shaped by lightly kneading the dough on a floured surface, then patting it flat and cutting round or triangular shapes using a knife or a cookie cutter. The scones can be placed on a baking sheet lined with parchment paper or a silicone mat, spaced evenly apart to allow for expansion during baking. 4. Baking: The oven should be preheated to the correct temperature, typically between 325°F to 425°F (160°C to 220°C) depending on the specific recipe. Place the cake pan or scone-laden baking sheet into the oven and bake as per the recipe's instructions. Cakes generally take longer to bake than scones, usually between 20 minutes to an hour, while scones take around 12 to 25 minutes. The baked goods should be golden brown and well-risen when done. You can use a skewer or a toothpick to test for doneness. If it comes out clean or with a few crumbs, the cake or scone is ready. If it's wet or sticky, continue baking and test again after a few minutes. 5. Cooling and finishing: Remove the cakes or scones from the oven and let them cool for a few minutes in the pan or on the baking sheet. Then transfer them to a wire rack to cool completely. Once cooled, cakes can be frosted or decorated as desired, while scones can be served with clotted cream, butter, and jam. In conclusion, baking is the method of cookery used to cook cakes and scones, transforming their dough or batter into deliciously soft and moist baked goods. By following the appropriate preparation, mixing, portioning, baking, and cooling steps, you can achieve perfectly cooked cakes and scones every time."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Summarize the following: Once you start communicating with an attorney, you should do this secretly. Even if you're not living with your husband when you seek legal council, documents can accidentally get sent to the wrong address. Your husband may also gain access to sensitive information through your email or social media accounts. Set up a P.O Box and request any legal documents be sent to this address alone. You should set up a private e-mail account and channel all e-mail communications with your attorney through this account. Use a public computer to access this account as a controlling husband may set up SpyWare or other software on laptops and computers to gain access to your information. Establish a safe place to keep copies of all important paperwork. This can be a trusted friend's house, a bank vault, or a secure hiding place in your own home. Change all passwords to your social media sites. You do not want your husband accessing your social media as he might try to use things like Facebook to get damaging information or even modify your account in ways to harm you legally in a divorce. You should hire an attorney as soon as possible in any divorce but especially one where abuse is involved. Seek out an experienced attorney who has experience with these sorts of situations. You can check credentials online by reading reviews and contacting past clients. Look for an attorney who has experience in divorce cases involving domestic abuse. This way, you'll be working with someone who understands the gravity of the situation and can help protect you. If money is an issue, some attorneys might offer you a discounted rate if you explain the situation. You can also seek out loans from family members and friends. Custody arrangements can be a brutal part of any divorce. If abuse is involved, it's important you seek full custody of any children. How to file a petition for full custody varies state by state. Talk to your attorney about the best options for your situation. In many states, regardless of whether abuse is an issue, an ex-spouse is entitled to visitation rights if he pays child support. This can be very frustrating for people trying to leave an abusive situation. Document all abuse that happened, especially abuse that occurs in front of the children. This can help your case in a custody battle. Try to find people who've witnesses the abuse who would be willing to testify in trial. Document everything you do for the kids to prove you're the primary caregiver. Photographs of you taking the kids to school, extracurriculars, and testimony from teachers, family members, and friends can help. You'll need a top notch legal team in order to fight an abuse case. The system is still skewed and abusers often get away with money and legal rights regarding children. In addition to your primary lawyer, you may hire attorneys to specifically work on things like custody, money issues, housing issue, and granting personal protection or restraining orders.","completion":"When talking to a lawyer, do it secretly. Keep your letters and emails private by using a P.O. Box and a new email account. Be careful when using computers, as your husband might be watching you. Keep important papers safe, maybe at a friend's house. Change your social media passwords so your husband can't use them against you. Find a good lawyer who knows about situations like yours. They might give you a discount if money is a problem. If you have kids and there is abuse, try to get full custody. Each state has different rules, so talk to your lawyer. Keep track of bad things that happened and the good things you do for your kids. This can help in court. You might need more than one lawyer to help with different parts of the divorce."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:","completion":"Title: Primary School Transforms Disused Private Jet into Innovative Classroom Space Introduction: In an increasingly competitive and resource-limited educational environment, a primary school once challenged by their lack of teaching space has developed an exceptional solution. Through the innovative integration of a decommissioned private jet, the school administration was able to create additional classroom space. This fascinating and functional transformation has garnered attention and praise from the local community and the broader educational sphere. Step 1 - Identifying the Problem and Possible Solutions: The primary school, facing an urgent need for expanded teaching facilities, first set about identifying the issue before exploring and brainstorming potential alternatives. After ruling out conventional solutions, such as constructing additional rooms or renting off-site space, the school administration sought out more creative options to accommodate their growing student population. Step 2 - Discovering the Disused Jet and Assessing Potential: During their research into unique classroom spaces, the school came across a previously decommissioned private jet, grounded due to its age and subsequent ineligibility for continued operation in the air. Assessing the feasibility of the aircraft's interior spatial configuration, they found it to be a viable option for unconventional classroom conversion. Step 3 - Securing Permissions and Financing: To actualize their vision, the school officials liaised with local authorities to secure necessary permits and approvals for repurposing the retired aircraft. Once they had obtained legal clearance, the officials pursued funding avenues, successfully garnering support for this extraordinary endeavor. Step 4 - Presenting the Concept to Teachers and Parents: To ensure stakeholder buy-in, the school administration proposed the innovative classroom space idea to teachers and parents through meetings and presentations. A robust dialogue took place, allowing concerns and questions to be addressed, ultimately leading to positive support for the project. Step 5 - Refurbishing the Retired Aircraft: After securing the necessary resources and permissions, the school community collaborated with skilled professionals experienced in renovating retired aircraft. The aircraft was carefully refitted with familiar classroom elements, such as desks, chairs, and educational resources, to create a functional and inspiring learning environment. Step 6 - Integrating the New Classroom into the School Curriculum: Upon completing the jet-turned-classroom's renovation, the school incorporated the new-found space into their daily operations thoughtfully. Teachers and students embraced the unique learning environment, and the school was able to provide a quality education without compromising the individual attention required for each student. Conclusion: The transformation of a disused private jet into a classroom space typifies the potential for inventive solutions and resourceful thinking in education. The primary school's successful accomplishment demonstrates that a combination of ingenuity, creativity, and collaboration can help overcome spatial and resource limitations within the educational context. Additionally, it serves as an inspiring case study for other institutions facing similar challenges, showcasing the immense power of unconventional thinking and determination."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Please answer the following question: Given the following context: Anthony Field and Jeff Fatt were members of The Cockroaches, a Sydney pop band known for their \\"good-time R&B material\\" and several singles recorded by independent labels during the 1980s. In 1988, Field's infant niece, who was the daughter of Cockroaches founder and band member Paul Field, died of SIDS, and the group disbanded. Anthony Field enrolled at Macquarie University in Sydney to complete his degree in early childhood education, and later stated that his niece's death \\"ultimately led to the formation of [The] Wiggles\\". Murray Cook, also \\"a mature-aged student\\", was the guitarist in the pub rock band Bang Shang a Lang before enrolling at Macquarie. Greg Page, who had been a roadie for and sang with The Cockroaches during their final years, had enrolled in Macquarie to study early childhood education on Field's recommendation. Field, Cook, and Page were among approximately 10 men in a program with 200 students.In 1991, while still a student, Field became motivated to use concepts in the field of early childhood education to record an album of music for children. The album was dedicated to Field's niece. A song he wrote for The Cockroaches, \\"Get Ready to Wiggle\\", inspired the band's name because they thought that wiggling described the way children dance. Like a university assignment, they produced a folder of essays that explained the educational value of each song on the album. They needed a keyboardist \\"to bolster the rock'n'roll feel of the project\\", so Field asked his old bandmate Fatt for his assistance in what they thought would be a temporary project.The group received songwriting help from John Field, Anthony's brother and former bandmate, and from Phillip Wilcher, who was working with the early childhood music program at Macquarie. After contributing to their first album, hosting the group's first recording sessions in his Sydney home, and appearing in a couple of the group's first videos, Wilcher left the group and went into classical music.

Plot title: Invictus Movie plot: On 11 February 1990, Nelson Mandela is released from Victor Verster Prison after having spent 27 years in jail. Four years later, Mandela is elected the first black President of South Africa. His presidency faces enormous challenges in the post-Apartheid era, including rampant poverty and crime, and Mandela is particularly concerned about racial divisions between black and white South Africans, which could lead to violence. The ill will which both groups hold towards each other is seen even in his own security detail where relations between the established white officers, who had guarded Mandela's predecessors, and the black ANC additions to the security detail, are frosty and marked by mutual distrust. While attending a game between the Springboks, the country's rugby union team, and England, Mandela recognises that the blacks in the stadium are cheering for England, as the mostly-white Springboks represent prejudice and apartheid in their minds; he remarks that he did the same while imprisoned on Robben Island. Knowing that South Africa is set to host the 1995 Rugby World Cup in one year's time, Mandela persuades a meeting of the newly black-dominated South African Sports Committee to support the Springboks. He then meets with the captain of the Springboks rugby team, FranÃ§ois Pienaar, and implies that a Springboks victory in the World Cup will unite and inspire the nation. Mandela also shares with FranÃ§ois a British poem, \\"Invictus\\", that had inspired him during his time in prison. FranÃ§ois and his teammates train. Many South Africans, both black and white, doubt that rugby will unite a nation torn apart by nearly 50 years of racial tensions, as for many blacks, especially the radicals, the Springboks symbolise white supremacy. Both Mandela and Pienaar, however, stand firmly behind their theory that the game can successfully unite the South African country. Things begin to change as the players interact with the fans and begin a friendship with them. During the opening games, support for the Springboks...

Does the word \\"air\\" mean the same thing in \\"The house had a neglected air.\\" and \\"As he waited he could feel the air on his neck.\\"?","completion":"No, the word \\"air\\" does not mean the same thing in the sentences \\"The house had a neglected air.\\" and \\"As he waited, he could feel the air on his neck.\\" In these contexts, \\"air\\" has two different meanings, which can be understood by examining the sentences and identifying the role that \\"air\\" plays in each. In the first sentence, \\"The house had a neglected air,\\" the word \\"air\\" is used as a noun, but it refers to the overall quality, character, or atmosphere of the house. In this sense, \\"air\\" connotes the general feeling, mood, or impression that the house gives off, which in this case is one of neglect. When you say that a place or object has a certain \\"air\\" about it, you are describing how it appears or is perceived by others based on its overall appearance, characteristics, or state. In the second sentence, \\"As he waited, he could feel the air on his neck,\\" the word \\"air\\" is also used as a noun but serves a different purpose than in the first sentence. Here, \\"air\\" refers to the natural, physical mixture of gases that compose the Earth's atmosphere, including oxygen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and other trace gases. In this context, \\"air\\" is something that can be felt and has physical properties, such as temperature, humidity, and movement (like a breeze or wind). This meaning of \\"air\\" is more literal and concrete, and relates to the sensation that the person experiences while waiting. In summary, the word \\"air\\" has a dual meaning in the English language and can refer to either the intangible atmosphere or mood of a place or object, or the tangible mixture of gases that make up the Earth's atmosphere. In the sentences provided, \\"air\\" is used in two different ways, highlighting its versatility and the importance of context in determining the intended meaning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

This shows empathy or concern by the speaker, implying that the speaker believes that a significant number of people get hurt and finds it regrettable. Step 3: Compare the Sentences Now, let's compare the two sentences. Sentence 1 focuses on finding it funny how more people don't get hurt, whereas Sentence 2 focuses on the sadness caused by many people getting hurt. Step 4: Determine if the Second Sentence is Entailed by the First Sentence To entail a sentence, it means that one sentence logically implies the other sentence. In this case, the first sentence does not logically imply the second sentence. The first sentence expresses amusement about the fact that not more people get hurt while the second sentence expresses sadness about many people getting hurt. The emotional response and focus on the sentences are different, illustrating the lack of logical entailment.

Summarize this article in one sentence. Among under-18s, the conception rate has halved in eight years, to 21 per 1,000 women in 2015, data from the Office for National Statistics shows. This may be due to young women staying in education for longer, improved access to contraceptives and the stigma of being a teenage mother. The biggest rise in conceptions was in women aged over 40, the ONS said. Since 1990, their rate has more than doubled to 15.1 per 1,000 women. The number of women deciding to have a baby in their late 30s has increased by similarly high levels, but the most popular age to become pregnant is still between the ages of 25 and 29 in England and Wales. However, the 30 to 34 age group is now close to catching them up with a continuous rise in conception rates since 1990. In 2015, there were 125 conceptions per 1,000 women in their early 30s compared to 127 among women in their late 20s. The ONS says more women are conceiving after the age of 30 because of an increasing desire to focus on a career and the rising costs of housing and bringing up children. It said uncertainty over job opportunities in the future could also be having an impact. More than half of all conceptions and births occurred outside marriage or civil partnerships in England and Wales in 2015. The areas with the highest conception rates among under-18s were Blackpool and Burnley. Overall, teenage conception rates in 2015 in England and Wales were the lowest recorded since statistics were first produced in 1969.","completion":"The conception rate among under-18s has halved in eight years, while women aged over 40, in their late 30s, and early 30s have seen significant increases in conception rates, potentially due to factors such as career focus, housing costs, and access to contraceptives."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Juliette Murray was, like me, a kid at school who got 5 “A”s, which in the West of Scotland put a certain degree of pressure on one’s shoulders to study either medicine or law. I studied European Law, and became a teacher - that's what a European Law degree does to you. She studied medicine and is today a practicing doctor, but the education bug is firmly rooted in what she chose to do next. Murray noticed that, particularly in her local area, fewer students were applying to study medicine than the population number would suggest should. Not only that, nationally the number of medical students dropping out after beginning their course of study is increasing. She wondered if we might we persuade a more representative cross section of the community to become doctors. She set about improving the opportunities for local youngsters, aged 14/5, at the time of their work experience choices. Existing work experience for those who want to gain an insight into the world of medical doctors is a sanitised course in an educational skills centre, where bored teenagers endlessly take each other’s blood pressure. They have more chance of a realistic insight by breaking their arm and turning up to Accident and Emergency. As any dad-to-be donning surgical greens knows, getting into an operating theatre is where a passion for surgery will be born or, in my case, definitely put to one side as a career option. So, the question became: how might we offer a more realistic experience of what being a doctor, surgeon or other medical profession feels like? Starting with her local hospital, Wishaw General in NHS Lanarkshire, she set about overcoming what she describes as a “culture of obstacles”.

That means he was chosen to help people understand that they should not use drugs because they're bad for them. Sadly, in August, Jaycee Chan was found using a not-so-nice thing called marijuana.

Because Jaycee Chan did something wrong, he had to go to a place called jail. Jail is where people are sent when they do something bad, like breaking the law. It's not a fun place, and people who go to jail have to learn from their mistakes so that they don't do those things again.

Write an article based on this summary: Bring your forms and proof of identification with you to the DMV. Pay the registration and title fees. Check your state’s regulations to see if you need insurance after registering. Renew your registration before it expires.","completion":"Title: A Step-by-Step Guide to DMV Vehicle Registration and Titling Introduction A visit to the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) for vehicle registration can be a daunting task, especially for first-time car owners. However, by following a step-by-step process and understanding what to expect, the experience can become less stressful and more efficient. This article offers a comprehensive guide to the process, including what you need to bring, fees to expect, insurance regulations, and registration renewal. Step 1: Bring the Necessary Forms and Proof of Identification Before you head to the DMV, ensure that you gather all the necessary documents and forms required for vehicle registration and titling. Below is a list of common documents needed: 1. Proof of identification (driver's license, state ID, or passport) 2. Vehicle title or Manufacturer's Certificate of Origin (MCO), if the vehicle is new and never titled 3. Vehicle registration application 4. Bill of sale and odometer disclosure statement, if required in your state 5. Emissions inspection certificate, if applicable 6. Proof of residency, if required Visit your state's DMV website to find specific requirements and to download any necessary forms. It's crucial to have all the correct documentation with you when visiting the DMV to avoid delays in your registration process. Step 2: Pay the Registration and Title Fees Once you have all your documents ready, visit your local DMV office to submit your application and pay the required fees. The fees typically depend on factors like the vehicle type, its weight, and the license plate type. Check your state's DMV website for the specific fee structure. Keep in mind that various accepted payment methods can include cash, check, or credit/debit card, depending on the DMV location. Be prepared to cover the fees using an accepted payment method to avoid potential inconvenience. Step 3: Verify Insurance Requirements Insurance requirements vary by state, so it's essential to check your state's regulations before concluding your registration process. Many states require drivers to provide proof of insurance in order to register their car. This ensures that vehicles on the road are insured, minimizing the financial burden in case of an accident for all parties involved. To verify if you need insurance after registering, visit your state's DMV or insurance department website and review the specific requirements. If necessary, contact an insurance agent to secure coverage before completing your registration process. Step 4: Renew Your Registration Before It Expires Vehicle registration typically expires within one to two years, depending on your state regulations. Ensure that you renew your registration before it expires to avoid fines, penalties, or other inconveniences. Most states send renewal notices to drivers before expiration, but it's a good practice to keep track of your registration's expiry date and mark it on your calendar. Many DMVs now offer online services, which allow you to renew your registration quickly and conveniently. Conclusion While registering a vehicle at the DMV may initially appear complex, following a step-by-step approach can simplify the process. Be prepared with the required documentation, verify your state's insurance regulations, and stay on top of your registration renewal to ensure a smooth and efficient experience at the DMV."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please write a short summary for the following article: 10 Super Mario fan theories that will make your mustache curl One rule about pop culture: If it exists, there's probably a fan theory about it. Super Mario Bros. is celebrating its 30th anniversary on Sept. 13, and not only have gamers been celebrating for the last three decades with serious gameplay, they've also been having some serious conversations about their favorite mustachioed plumber. While some of these ideas might be a little off the wall, others are just so weird, they make absolute sense. Here are just a few of the intense conspiracy theories on the Internet that fans have been tossing around their heads. Prepare to have your minds blown, Mario fans. 1. Mario and his friends are merely actors in a stage play.One of the most enduring fan theories online is that this entire video game world is a stage and Mario, Luigi and all their pals (and enemies) are merely players. Here are some pieces of evidence to support it: Recently, Super Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto confirmed that this theory actually has some truth to it — so theory has become fact. 2. Princess Peach is Bowser Jr.'s mother.Little Bowser Jr.'s maternity seems to be a mystery among the online gamer forums — at least among those who don't immediate point to Princess Peach, who seems to be the most likely candidate. According to the Super Mario wiki, Junior is told by his father that Peach is his mother, but she is then kidnapped by \\"evil\\" Mario during Super Mario Sunshine. 3. Luigi is always with Mario because Mario keeps his strength in check.Poor Luigi. He's often brushed off as the weak, loser brother of the popular and strong Mario — but what if the guy in green was actually a a killing machine ready to rage at any moment? One fan theory on Reddit explains that Luigi may be stronger than we think, and staying close to Mario keeps him from Hulking out. The user explains: Luigi's only fear is that he may go too far one day and hurt people on accident due to his powers running rampant. A common trait we see is his extreme fear of ghosts. The reason behind that is because ghosts have been known to have the ability to possess living beings...By staying close to his brother, he doesn't have to worry about hurting people because he knows that Mario is the most skilled fighter in existence and the only person who can stop him. Mario is the polar opposite of Luigi: a mortal man without any notable powers. Despite that, Mario is capable of fighting against villains capable of destroying dimensions, and even defeating Luigi himself several times (Super Paper Mario) using nothing but his sheer battle skill. By staying next to his brother, Luigi can make sure that if one of his many odd powers goes out of control, or he turns evil, Mario will be close enough to stop him and limit the damage. More on this particular fan theory can be found here. 4. The whole series is just Princess Peach's propaganda.Mario and his friends are just puppets and Princess Peach is the puppet master. According to one Reddit user: However, have you ever asked yourself why we're being shown a Princess Peach Point of View of our favorite game? We always believed that Peach was telling the truth, and that she was the victim and Bowser was the villain...What if Princess Peach is really just using the Mario Games (which are plays) as [propaganda] to lead you to believe that Bowser is the villain, when in reality Peach is an evil dictator who wants to oppress the people of the Mushroom Kingdom. The post explains that gamers are never shown Bowser's point of view in the games and therefore are never given a complete picture of the politics of the Mushroom Kingdom. For all we know, Princess Peach could be manipulating Mario into thinking she is kidnapped to feed into her master plan. Pretty dark. 5. Super Mario Bros. is the only time Bowser truly kidnapped Princess Peach.Working under the assumption that Super Mario Bros. is real and not a play, the original game is the only actual time Bowser kidnapped Peach \\"in real life.\\" A user on Reddit explains that Super Mario Bros. 2 is actually a dream sequence, and therefore has \\"no bearing in the 'real' world.\\" And Super Mario Bros. 3 was a \\"play retelling (with embellishments) the events of Super Mario Bros. 1.\\" The user also goes into other games in the franchise: 6. Mario only went to the Mushroom Kingdom once — the rest is just him reliving his glory.Similar to the theory that Bowser only kidnapped Princess Peach once (in Super Mario Bros.), the same goes for Mario's trip to the Mushroom Kingdom. Since the original game was the only one to exist in \\"reality,\\" all of Mario's other adventures to to rescue the Princess from Bowser are simply the fevered dreams of a poor plumber reliving his glory days. The theorist on Reddit goes so far as to say Mario creates reality TV spin offs and grander marketing schemes on his whirlwind adventure, spinning greater tales and milking his fame for all it's worth. More of the user's theory can be found here. 7. Donkey Kong killed Mario and Luigi's father.One fan theory is so full of tragedy and family intrigue it would make Shakespeare blush. The Reddit user who poses this theory goes into extreme detail, but it boils down to the identity of the character, Jumpman, who looks suspiciously like Mario, in the Donkey Kong games. Here's how it works: Mario loves Princess Peach (at least at first) and lives in the Mushroom Kingdom, while Jumpman loves his wife Pauline and lives in New York City. While some have assumed Mario and Jumpman to be the same person, Mario would have had to have a major mid-life crisis to go from a New York City plumber to the savior of a magical kingdom — but what is to explain their resemblance? Jumpman is Mario and Luigi's dad. Honestly, they had to come from somewhere. Unfortunately, at the end of Donkey Kong Junior, Jumpman is the antagonist of Donkey Kong and dies at the end, killed by Donkey. In all these decades of gameplay, Mario has yet to seek revenge. The Reddit user goes into more depth on this theory here. 8. Dr. Mario is the third Mario brother.Mario has had plenty of odd jobs over the years, but something seems a little bit off about Doctor Mario from the Super Smash Bros. game. The Reddit user who introduced this theory wrote, \\"He has a similar moveset to Mario and Luigi, and while Luigi is a lighter and floatier comparison to Mario, DM is a heavier, harder hitting alternative. Doctor Mario's hair is also lighter than Mario's, taking an almost blonder or more auburn tint to the plumber's dark brown hair. Mario also seems to be more athletic than DM as he is faster and can wall jump, whereas the doctor can not.\\" It seems easy to believe that perhaps there are several Mario brothers, in several sizes, floating out there. More on this theory can be found on Reddit. 9. The coins are souls.Get ready for the most existential gameplay you've ever experienced. It turns out, every time you hit, smash, burn or generally destroy and object or enemy and you get a coin in return, what you're actually getting is that thing's soul. A user on Reddit wrote: The instruction manual for [Super Mario Bros. 1] states the the inhabitants of [Mushroom Kingdom] were turned into bricks (yes, the exact same ones that [Mario] smashed on his journey). If the bricks are [Mushroom Kingdom] residents, then how are there coins inside them. What if Mario was actually harvesting the souls of innocent toads? The theory goes into great detail on the many different and twisted ways Mario can harvest the souls of the dead for his profit. 10. Wario is a crazed Mario fan.Wario isn't such a bad guy. He just doesn't know how to process all these feelings of respect and admiration. Some evidence of Wario's devotion to Mario include: Wario's outfit is the a superfan equivalent of Mario's: overalls, white gloves, mustache and a cap with an upside down \\"M\\" (or \\"W,\\" however you want to spin it). In Super Mario Land 2, Wario lives in a castle with a statue of Mario in front. Of course, it's revealed that this place used to be Mario's own castle, but still, Wario doesn't seem to mind keeping it in tact. If that isn't love, we don't know what is. More details about Wario's deep obsession with Mario can be found here. So what's real and what's just a toad's fantasy? You decide.

Which of the following solutions is more sound in terms of naive physics reasoning?","completion":"You didn't mention any specific solutions, but let me explain to you in a simple way. Imagine you have your favorite toy. To find out if your toy is working perfectly, you need to play with it many times, right? So, to find out if a 6 sided die is fair or not, we have to roll it many, many times. If it's a fair die, you should see all the numbers, from 1 to 6, show up about the same number of times when you roll it a lot of times, like 600 times. Like, if you see number 1 about 100 times, number 2 also about 100 times and so on, then you can say 'yes, this die is fair.' But remember, it doesn't always have to be exactly the same number of times for each number - just close enough, because even with fair dice, sometimes you may get more of one number just by chance. So, it's like each number should get its chance to show up on the top when you roll the die, if the die is fair. That's one of the simple solutions that is sound in terms of naive physics reasoning to find out if a 6 sided die is fair.

I have a new situation: In his chemistry lab David is experimenting with how NaOH and HCl gas reacts with each other. He conducted two experiments, experiment A and experiment B. In experiment A he used solid pellets of NaOH, but in experiment B he used ground NaOH. He was surprised to see the difference it made in his experiment. But I can use this background: For example, if a solid pellet of NaOH is placed into a chamber of HCl gas, a relatively slow acid-base reaction will occur between gaseous HCl molecules and hydroxide ions on the surface of the pellet. If we were to grind the pellet into smaller pieces, it would greatly increase the total surface area, and therefore the overall reaction rate. Once ground up, many hydroxide ions that were on the interior of the pellet, where they were not exposed to any HCl molecules, will now be on the surface, where the necessary collisions can occur. What is an answer for this question: In which experiment the interior hydorxide ion would be exposed? The answer to this question is:","completion":"In experiment B, the interior hydroxide ions would be exposed. When David used ground NaOH instead of solid pellets in experiment B, he significantly increased the surface area available for the reaction between NaOH and HCl gas. By grinding the solid NaOH pellet into smaller pieces, the interior hydroxide ions that were initially not exposed to the HCl gas molecules due to being inside the solid pellet structure were now available on the surface. In experiment A, where solid NaOH pellets were used, the reaction was relatively slow because only the surface hydroxide ions were exposed to the HCl gas, causing limited acid-base interactions with the gaseous HCl molecules. The interior hydroxide ions in the solid pellet remained inaccessible to the HCl gas and could not contribute to the reaction. However, in experiment B, the ground NaOH had a much larger surface area, allowing a greater number of hydroxide ions, including those from the interior of the original solid pellet, to react with the HCl gas molecules. This increased exposure led to a higher overall reaction rate and demonstrated the importance of surface area in driving the reaction between NaOH and HCl gas. In conclusion, it was experiment B where the interior hydroxide ions were exposed, which significantly affected the reaction rate between NaOH and HCl gas as David observed in his chemistry lab experiments."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: In Germany, English expressions are used in conversations and increasingly in written form. Advertisements are often expressed completely in English. When I go to the gym, there are \\"aerobic-classes \\". We \\"warm up\\". We go \\"jogging.\\" In business, we attend a \\"meeting\\" and we have \\"good connections.\\" Other nations, like France, have taken action to protect their language from the influence of \\"Americanization\\". In Germany, however, there is concern that those rules could be connected with Hitler's Third Reich , when the language had to be pure. If the government curbed the use of English words now, this could be considered by some as a return to that terrible past. Some German citizens are now trying to stop the use of English vocabulary in German. However, I think generally it is not a big deal to use some common English expressions as they often describe things more directly. But we should know that it is important to use English correctly. All too often, bad English is spoken or even written instead of good German. The proper use of the German language would be the better choice. However, there are some fields that require the use of English words, for example, in the high-tech communication and the Internet fields, there is no alternative to English. Also, I think sometimes I have to speak English when I introduce some scenic places to tourists. I think you have to find a balance and decide when it is better to use good German in place of bad English or when the use of correct English words is more suitable. Languages have always changed naturally, and I disagree with a restriction by law. Some nice expressions borrowed from other languages can make a conversation more vivid.

Q:I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the last name of the person whose work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase? ? Nigel Reuben Rook Williams (15 July 1944 – 21 April 1992) was an English conservator and expert on the restoration of ceramics and glass. From 1961 until his death he worked at the British Museum, where he became the Chief Conservator of Ceramics and Glass in 1983. There his work included the successful restorations of the Sutton Hoo helmet and the Portland Vase. Joining as an assistant at age 16, Williams spent his entire career, and most of his life, at the British Museum. He was one of the first people to study conservation, not yet recognised as a profession, and from an early age was given responsibility over high-profile objects. In the 1960s he assisted with the re-excavation of the Sutton Hoo ship-burial, and in his early- to mid-twenties he conserved many of the objects found therein: most notably the Sutton Hoo helmet, which occupied a year of his time. He likewise reconstructed other objects from the find, including the shield, drinking horns, and maplewood bottles. The \\"abiding passion of his life\\" was ceramics, and the 1970s and 1980s gave Williams ample opportunities in that field. After nearly 31,000 fragments of shattered Greek vases were found in 1974 amidst the wreck of HMS Colossus, Williams set to work piecing them together. The process was televised, and turned him into a television personality. A decade later, in 1988 and 1989, Williams's crowning achievement came when he took to pieces the Portland Vase, one of the most famous glass objects in the world, and put it back together. The reconstruction was again televised for a BBC programme, and as with the Sutton Hoo helmet, took nearly a year to complete. Williams died at age 47 of a heart attack while in Aqaba, Jordan, where he was working on a British Museum excavation. The Ceramics & Glass group of the Institute of Conservation awards a biennial prize in his honour, recognising his significant contributions in the field of conservation.

Given the question: Write a multi-choice question for the following article, with the given choices and answer: Article: A man and his girlfriend were married. It was a large celebration. All of their friends and family came to see the lovely ceremony. Everyone could tell that the love they had for each other was true. A few months later, the wife came to the husband with a piece of advice, \\"I read in a magazine, a while ago, about how we can strengthen our marriage,\\" she offered. \\"Each of us will write a list of the things that we find a bit annoying with the other person. Then, we can talk about how we can fix them together and make our lives happier together.\\" The husband agreed. So each of them tried to think of the things that annoyed them about the other and wrote down what they came up with. The next morning, at the breakfast table, they decided that they would go over their lists. \\"I'll start,\\" offered the wife. She took out her list. It had many items on it, enough to fill three pages. In fact, as she started reading the list of the little annoyances, she noticed that tears were starting to appear in her husband's eyes because he never thought that he had so many shortcomings. The wife continued to read until she had read all three pages to her husband. \\"Now, you read your list and then we'll talk about the things on both of our lists,\\" she said happily. Quietly the husband stated, \\"I don't have anything on my list. I think that you are perfect. I don't want you to change anything for me. You are lovely and wonderful and I wouldn't want to try and change anything about you.\\" The wife, touched by his honesty and the depth of his love for her and his acceptance of her, turned her head and wept. In life, there are enough times when we are disappointed, depressed and annoyed. We don't really have to go looking for them. We have a wonderful world that is full of beauty, light and promise. Why waste time in this world looking for the bad, disappointing or annoying when we can look around us and see the wonderful things before us? Options: A Because he had no courage to face his shortcomings. B Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes. C Because he was sorry that he didn't find any annoyance about his wife. D Because he didn't think he deserved to have such a perfect wife. Answer: B Because he never thought he had so many annoyances in his wife's eyes. Question: The answer is:","completion":"\\"Why did the husband start to tear up as his wife read out her list of little annoyances about him in their attempt to strengthen their marriage?\\" Choices: A - Because he had no courage to face his shortcomings.

Answer the following question: Process: - The saliva breaks down the chemicals in the food a bit, which helps make the food mushy and easy to swallow - Your tongue helps out, pushing the food around while you chew with your teeth - The esophagus moves food from the back of your throat to your stomach - Strong muscles in the walls of the stomach and gastric juices break down food in your stomach - Your stomach moves the food into the intestines to complete digestion - suppose during Thanksgiving happens, how will it affect less amino acid absorption. Which of the following is the supposed perturbation? - directly impacting a step of the process - indirectly impacting a step of the process - not impacting any step of the process Answer:","completion":"During Thanksgiving, people tend to consume large quantities of food, often including high-protein dishes such as turkey, ham, and various side dishes. The question asks how this might affect the absorption of amino acids in the body and which of the following perturbations might be supposed: directly impacting a step of the process, indirectly impacting a step of the process, or not impacting any step of the process. First, let's consider the process of digestion and absorption of amino acids: 1. Protein digestion begins in the stomach, where the enzyme pepsin breaks down proteins into smaller peptides. Hydrochloric acid in the stomach further helps to denature proteins and make them more accessible for digestion. 2. In the small intestine, the peptides are broken down into even smaller peptides and individual amino acids by various enzymes such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. 3. The amino acids are absorbed into the bloodstream by specialized transport proteins found on the surface of the small intestine cells. 4. Once in the bloodstream, the amino acids are distributed throughout the body for various functions, including protein synthesis, energy production, and other metabolic processes. Now, let's examine how the increased consumption of food during Thanksgiving might affect this process. - Directly impacting a step of the process: When a large amount of food is consumed, the stomach and intestines must work harder to process and break down the food. This increased workload could potentially slow down the digestion of proteins, leading to a temporary decrease in the rate at which amino acids are absorbed. However, the digestive system is generally efficient in handling varying amounts of dietary intake, and this direct impact may be minimal. - Indirectly impacting a step of the process: Overeating during Thanksgiving could lead to various indirect effects on amino acid absorption. For example, consuming large amounts of high-fat foods can delay gastric emptying, which in turn slows down the transit of food into the small intestine where amino acid absorption occurs. Additionally, the large consumption of carbohydrates and fats could lead to a competition for nutrients in the small intestine, which could affect the absorption of amino acids. - Not impacting any step of the process: Despite the increased intake of food during Thanksgiving, the digestive system is generally well-equipped to handle fluctuations in the consumption of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. The body can efficiently break down and absorb amino acids in varying quantities, and any temporary decreases in absorption rate due to overeating are likely to be minimal and short-lived. In conclusion, overeating during Thanksgiving could potentially have both direct and indirect impacts on amino acid absorption. However, these impacts might not be significant, as the digestive system can effectively handle changes in dietary intake. It is important to keep in mind that overeating is not healthy and moderation in food consumption is always recommended."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

From its inception, this genre of music has been celebrated not just for its sound, but also its style. Fashion, in particular, has played a pivotal role in the rock scene, and it goes way beyond ripped jeans and leather jackets. Today, we're going to dive into the details of crafting the perfect rock 'n' roll ensemble, taking cues from classic and contemporary rock styles. So, without further ado, let's get ready to unleash your inner rockstar. 1. The Classic Band T-Shirt: When it comes to dressing like a rockstar, it all begins with the essential t-shirt. Showcasing your musical taste is a no-brainer, and donning your favorite band's emblem on a stylish tee is a perfect way to spark conversation with fellow fans. As you assemble your collection, opt for tees with memorable album art, typography, or legendary concert posters. It's not just about the music; it's about embracing the art and culture surrounding it. 2. Tight Jeans – The Edgy Essential: Rock 'n' roll has no room for baggy pants, so make sure you invest in a few pairs of form-fitting jeans. This will give you the classic rockstar silhouette – long, lean, and ready to rock. Think black or dark indigo washes with frayed hems for that extra edge. Don't shy away from ripped jeans, either – they add a touch of rebelliousness and attitude that fits perfectly with the rock 'n' roll aesthetic. Bonus: tight jeans provide maximum freedom of movement for dancing, head banging, and those iconic high-kicks. 3. Appropriate Footwear – The Backbone of your Rockstar Look: While stiletto heels and flip-flops have their place, nothing echoes rock 'n' roll quite like the right pair of shoes. Chunky boots, be it combat or motorcycle styles, are classic staples of the rockstar wardrobe. Doc Martens, Converse, or Vans easily complement any outfit while providing comfort and structure for those long nights of waiting for an encore. 4. Jackets and Hoodies – A Touch of Effortless Cool: When the high-octane energy of a rock show dies down and you need to bundle up, invest in iconic pieces that scream rock 'n' roll. Army jackets and black band hoodies not only pay homage to the military-inspired looks of bands like The Clash and The Ramones, but they also allow you to show off your favorite band's logo in a functional and purposeful piece of clothing. Military jackets with patches are also a great addition, as they lend an air of personalized edge and nostalgia. 5. Accessorize with Attitude: Topping off your rockstar look is all about the details. Accessorize with a bevy of leather bracelets, studded belts, and layered necklaces to accentuate your style. Add a touch of personality by pinning badges and patches to your jackets and bags, representing your favorite bands. Finally, don't forget to let your hair speak volumes – a little bedhead, tousled curls, or colored streaks go a long way in completing your rock 'n' roll ensemble. Conclusion: Style is an integral part of the rock 'n' roll experience, and as a fan or aspiring musician, your fashion choices should reflect your passion for the sounds and culture of this beloved genre. Embrace the classics, but don't be afraid to put your personal touch on your wardrobe. Remember, rock 'n' roll is about self-expression, and that goes for clothing just as much as it does for the music. Always wear your band t-shirts, invest in tight jeans, stock up on appropriate footwear, and layer your army jackets and black band hoodies. Now, go out there, and carry on the legacy of your favorite rock heroes."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer.

Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing?","completion":"Question 1: Why does a salt solution conduct electricity? Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the properties of a salt solution and why it has the ability to conduct electricity. Step 2: Research the topic. To answer this question, we need knowledge about salt solutions and their properties, particularly regarding the conduction of electricity. Step 3: Formulate a coherent and accurate answer. A salt solution, such as a sodium chloride (table salt) solution, conducts electricity because it is an electrolyte. When salt dissolves in water, it dissociates into its positively charged sodium ions (Na+) and negatively charged chloride ions (Cl-). These ions can move freely in the solution, allowing them to carry and transfer electrical charges. Question 2: How much salt is in a bag of saline solution? Step 1: Understand the question. The question is asking about the quantity of salt present in a bag of saline solution. Step 2: Gather information about common saline solution concentrations. A typical saline solution used in medical settings has a concentration of 0.9% sodium chloride, which means it contains 0.9 grams of salt per 100 milliliters of water. Step 3: Find the volume of the saline solution bag. The volume of the saline solution bag is not provided in the question. Common sizes for saline solution bags in medical settings are 250 mL, 500 mL, and 1000 mL. Step 4: Calculate the amount of salt. If we assume a 0.9% sodium chloride solution, then we can calculate the amount of salt in the bag as follows: For a 250 mL bag: - 0.9 g of salt per 100 mL of solution - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 250 mL = 2.25 grams of salt For a 500 mL bag: - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 500 mL = 4.5 grams of salt For a 1000 mL (1 L) bag: - (0.9 g/100 mL) * 1000 mL = 9 grams of salt Are questions 1 and 2 asking the same thing? No, questions 1 and 2 are not asking the same thing. Question 1 is asking about the reason why a salt solution conducts electricity, while Question 2 is asking about the amount of salt contained in a bag of saline solution. They are related and both concern salt solutions, but they are asking for different pieces of information."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Here is a premise: In the end--although you'll hear plenty of people tell you that this is an old-fashioned idea--a stock's price is a mechanism for discounting the future. Here is a hypothesis: They wanted it to grow not decrease in value. Is it possible to conclude that if the premise is true, then so is the hypothesis?","completion":"To determine if the premise supports the hypothesis, it is important to analyze both statements in detail and understand the underlying concepts. Premise: \\"In the end--although you'll hear plenty of people tell you that this is an old-fashioned idea--a stock's price is a mechanism for discounting the future.\\" This statement suggests that the price of a stock reflects the present value of all future cash flows generated by the company. It indicates that the stock's price considers the earnings potential and other relevant factors that affect a company's performance and growth in the long-term. However, it also introduces a notion that this idea may be considered \\"old-fashioned,\\" which implies that there could be alternative ways of determining a stock's price or that some people might not agree with this approach. Hypothesis: \\"They wanted it to grow not decrease in value.\\" This hypothesis suggests that investors desire their stock value to appreciate rather than depreciate. In the context of investments, this makes sense as appreciation in the stock value allows investors to profit from their initial investment. The hypothesis does not specifically discuss the premise's \\"old-fashioned idea,\\" but it can be assumed that investors generally expect their stocks to grow in value based on the company's future potential and earnings. Now, to consider whether the premise, if true, implies the truth of the hypothesis, let's break it down: 1. If the stock's price is indeed a mechanism for discounting the future (the premise), it means that the stock's current value is based on an estimation of all its future cash flows. 2. Investors want the stock value to grow, not decrease (the hypothesis); this suggests that they are expecting the company to generate positive cash flows in the future, leading to an increase in the stock's value. Given these two points, if we accept the premise as true, then it does provide support for the hypothesis. Stocks are priced based on future cash flows, and investors want their investments to increase in value. Assuming the premise is accurate, and stocks indeed discount the future, investors look for companies with strong growth potential and earnings in the future, which consequently results in stock value growth, as desired. However, it is important to note that the premise may not be universally true, as stated in its acknowledgment of being perceived as \\"old-fashioned.\\" Variations in investor sentiment, market movements, and external factors can significantly influence the stock's price, casting doubt on the premise's applicability in every situation. Therefore, while the premise does provide support for the hypothesis, it may be insufficient to guarantee the hypothesis's truth in all contexts and situations."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

What is the best way to: To cool off an item faster when using ice,","completion":"The best way to cool off an item faster when using ice involves maximizing the contact between the item and the ice, as well as utilizing other techniques to speed up the heat transfer process. Below are several methods and tips for cooling off an item faster using ice: 1. Crushed ice: Using crushed ice instead of ice cubes can be more effective when you need to cool off an item quickly. The smaller pieces of ice have a greater surface area, which allows for more contact between the ice and the item. This larger contact area results in a faster heat exchange, causing the item to cool down more rapidly. 2. Ice bath: Fill a container with ice, then add water to create an ice bath. Water will fill in the gaps between the ice pieces, creating more contact points for the heat transfer. When you immerse the item in this mixture, it will cool down at a faster rate compared to just placing it onto the ice. 3. Salted ice bath: Adding salt to an ice bath can further accelerate the cooling process. Salt lowers the freezing point of water, which causes the ice to melt at a faster rate. This melting process absorbs heat, thus speeding up the heat transfer from the item to the ice mixture. 4. Stirring or agitating the item: If possible, continuously stir or agitate the item while it is in contact with the ice. This action will ensure that the warmer parts of the item make contact with the ice, boosting the overall cooling efficiency. 5. Pre-chilled container: Place the ice and the item inside a pre-chilled container. By pre-chilling the container, you eliminate the need for the ice to spend energy cooling down the container, allowing it to focus its cooling effect on the item. 6. Insulation: Insulate the outer surface of the container holding the ice and the item. Insulation will help maintain the cold temperature inside the container and prevent external heat from entering, enabling a more effective cooling process. 7. Increase surface area: If possible, increase the surface area of the item that will be in contact with the ice. More surface area means more space for heat exchange, resulting in a faster cooling process. 8. Use multiple cooling containers: If the item to be cooled is large, consider using multiple cooling containers filled with ice. Place the item at different angles in each container to ensure that the cold is evenly distributed throughout the item. 9. Optimal ice-to-item ratio: Ensure that there is enough ice to cool down the item effectively. As a general rule, a 1:1 ratio between ice and the item should suffice. If the item you are cooling is larger or has a high heat capacity, you may need to use more ice. 10. Temperature check: Periodically check the temperature of the item to track the cooling progress. This will help you determine whether additional ice or adjustments to the method are needed. By implementing these tips and methods, you can maximize the efficiency of using ice to cool an item down more quickly. Remember that the key is to enhance contact between the ice and the item, utilize the salted ice bath if needed, and use proper insulation to maintain the cold temperature inside the cooling container."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A large tumor had formed on the bottom of one lung, they found 4 tumors in her brain, another large one in her stomach and several more throughout her intestinal track. She rarely complained about physical problems and I knew something was wrong when she said she needed to go to the hospital ER. She died exactly 30 days later. I spent virtually every minute of that time with her. I went with her to radiation appointments. I stayed in the hospital with her because it seemed like every week I would have to take her in for something that required a 3 or 4 day stay. And the final trip to the ER was May 1st. An MRI showed that one of the tumors in her intestines had torn a hole in her bowel. The ER surgeon told us straight up that she was beyond any medical care that could help her and to use the next 24 hours to say goodbye to family and friends.

Answer by taking a quote from the following article: Oldman was born in New Cross, London, the son of Leonard Bertram Oldman (1921-1985), a former sailor who also worked as a welder, and Kathleen (nee Cheriton; born 1919). He has stated that Leonard was an alcoholic who left the family when Oldman was seven years old. Oldman attended West Greenwich School in Deptford, leaving school at the age of 16 to work in a sports shop. He was a pianist as a child, and later a singer, but gave up his musical aspirations to pursue an acting career after seeing Malcolm McDowell's performance in the 1971 film The Raging Moon. Oldman was charged with drunk driving in 1991 after a night out in Los Angeles with actor Kiefer Sutherland. A deputy city attorney stated that Oldman's blood alcohol content was found to be more than twice California's limit for legal intoxication. Some media outlets reported that Oldman was unhappy with The Contender (2000) because DreamWorks had edited the film to reflect pro-Democratic leanings, stirring controversy. The claims were declared \\"sloppy sensationalism\\" by Oldman's manager, Urbanski, who said that Oldman was \\"the least political person he knew\\", that \\"neither he nor Oldman had made the statements attributed to them,\\" that they had \\"produced the film every last cut and frame,\\" and that \\"DreamWorks did not influence the final cut or have anything to do with it.\\" It has been suggested that Oldman was blacklisted in Hollywood for several years as a result. In an interview in the July/August 2014 issue of Playboy magazine while promoting Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Oldman criticized what he saw as excessive political correctness in American media and the entertainment industry's own discriminating hypocrisy, and argued in support of former controversial celebrities Mel Gibson and Alec Baldwin. He stressed that he did not relate with most of their viewpoints, but regarding the former, agreed, \\"Gibson is in a town that's run by Jews\\" (referring to Hollywood). After criticism from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Oldman apologised to them in an open letter. ADL director Abraham Foxman acknowledged that Oldman was remorseful, but felt his letter was insufficient and asked for \\"a little more introspection, a little more understanding and a little more education\\". Oldman then made a public apology on the 25 June edition of late-night talk show Jimmy Kimmel Live!, where he stressed that he was \\"profoundly sorry\\" for his \\"insensitive, pernicious and ill-informed\\" remarks. What about relationship or career problems that may have caused controversies?","completion":"Gary Oldman had some troubles in his life. He was charged with drunk driving in 1991 and it caused a problem. Also, some people thought he was unhappy with a movie called The Contender, but his manager said that wasn't true. Later, he talked about some controversial celebrities and it upset some people, so he had to say sorry for what he said. These things caused some controversies in his relationships and career."},{"prompt":"Question: Information: - Clergy are some of the main and important formal leaders within certain religions. The roles and functions of clergy vary in different religious traditions but these usually involve presiding over specific rituals and teaching their religion's doctrines and practices. Some of the terms used for individual clergy are \\"cleric\\", \\"clergyman\\", \\"clergywoman\\", \\"clergyperson\\" and \\"churchman\\". - A Scottish clan (from Gaelic \\"\\", \\"children\\") is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared identity and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing. - An earl is a member of the nobility. The title is Anglo-Saxon in origin, akin to the Scandinavian form jarl, and meant \\"chieftain\\", particularly a chieftain set to rule a territory in a king's stead. In Scandinavia, it became obsolete in the Middle Ages and was replaced by duke (\\"hertig\\"/\\"hertug\\"/\\"hertog\\"). In later medieval Britain, it became the equivalent of the continental count (in England in the earlier period, it was more akin to a duke; in Scotland it assimilated the concept of mormaer). However, earlier in Scandinavia, \\"jarl\\" could also mean a sovereign prince. For example, the rulers of several of the petty kingdoms of Norway had the title of \\"jarl\\" and in many cases they had no less power than their neighbours who had the title of king. Alternative names for the \\"Earl/Count\\" rank in the nobility structure are used in other countries, such as Hakushaku during the Japanese Imperial era. - The Inner Hebrides (Scottish Gaelic: \\"Na h-Eileanan a-staigh\\", \\"the inner isles\\") is an archipelago off the west coast of mainland Scotland, to the south east of the Outer Hebrides. Together these two island chains form the Hebrides, which experience a mild oceanic climate. The Inner Hebrides comprise 35 inhabited islands as well as 44 uninhabited islands with an area greater than . The main commercial activities are tourism, crofting, fishing and whisky distilling. In modern times the Inner Hebrides have formed part of two separate local government jurisdictions, one to the north and the other to the south. Together, the islands have an area of about , and had a population of 18,948 in 2011. The population density is therefore about 4.6 per km (12 per square mile). - James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose (1612 21 May 1650) was a Scottish nobleman, poet and soldier, who initially joined the Covenanters in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, but subsequently supported King Charles I as the English Civil War developed. From 1644 to 1646, and again in 1650, he fought a civil war in Scotland on behalf of the King and is generally referred to in Scotland as simply \\"the Great Montrose\\". - The Battle of Kilsyth was an engagement of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms which took place on 15 August 1645 at Kilsyth. Despite a numerical disadvantage, the battle was another victory for the Royalist general Montrose over the Covenanters, and marked the end of William Baillie's pursuit of the Royalist forces. - Scottish Gaelic or Scots Gaelic, sometimes also referred to as Gaelic (\\" ), is a Celtic language native to Scotland. A member of the Goidelic branch of the Celtic languages, Scottish Gaelic, like Modern Irish and Manx, developed out of Middle Irish. - The Wars of the Three Kingdoms, sometimes known as the British Civil Wars, formed an intertwined series of conflicts that took place in England, Ireland and Scotland between 1639 and 1651. The English Civil War proper has become the best-known of these conflicts and included the execution of the kingdoms' monarch, Charles I, by the English parliament in 1649. - Sir Lachlan Maclean , 1st Baronet of Morvern , ( circa 1600 - 1649 ) the 17th Clan Chief of Clan Maclean . Lachlan was granted his Baronet title by Charles I and he became the Clan Chief on the death of his brother in 1626 . He fought as a Royalist under James Graham , 1st Marquess of Montrose during the Wars of the Three Kingdoms at the Battle of Inverlochy , Battle of Auldearn and Battle of Kilsyth . From 1628 to 1633 he sat in the Parliament of Scotland as shire commissioner for Tarbert . From his rule onward , all Maclean clan chiefs are successive Baronets of Movern . - The Parliament of Scotland, officially the Estates of Parliament, was the legislature of the Kingdom of Scotland. The parliament, like other such institutions, evolved during the Middle Ages from the king's council of bishops and earls. It is first identifiable as a parliament in 1235, during the reign of Alexander II, when it was described as a \\"colloquium\\" and already possessed a political and judicial role. By the early fourteenth century, the attendance of knights and freeholders had become important, and from 1326 commissioners from the burghs attended. Consisting of the \\"three estates\\" of clergy, nobility and the burghs sitting in a single chamber, the parliament gave consent for the raising of taxation and played an important role in the administration of justice, foreign policy, war, and all manner of other legislation. Parliamentary business was also carried out by \\"sister\\" institutions, such as General Councils or Convention of Estates. These could carry out much business also dealt with by parliament taxation, legislation and policy-making but lacked the ultimate authority of a full parliament. - A knight is a person granted an honorary title of \\"knighthood\\" by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity. Historically, in Europe, knighthood was conferred upon mounted warriors. During the High Middle Ages, knighthood was considered a class of lower nobility. By the Late Middle Ages, the rank had become associated with the ideals of chivalry, a code of conduct for the perfect courtly Christian warrior. Often, a knight was a vassal who served as a fighter for a lord, with payment in the form of land holdings. The lords trusted the knights, who were skilled in battle on horseback. Since the early modern period, the title of knight is purely honorific, usually bestowed by a monarch, as in the British honours system, often for non-military service to the country. The modern female equivalent in the United Kingdom is Dame. - Clan MacLean (Scottish Gaelic: \\"\\" ) is a Highland Scottish clan. They are one of the oldest clans in the Highlands and owned large tracts of land in Argyll as well as the Inner Hebrides. Many early MacLeans became famous for their honour, strength and courage in battle. They were involved in clan skirmishes with the Mackinnons, Camerons, MacDonalds and Campbells, as well as all of the Jacobite risings. - A burgh was an autonomous corporate entity in Scotland and Northern England, usually a town, or toun in Scots. This type of administrative division existed from the 12th century, when King David I created the first royal burghs. Burgh status was broadly analogous to borough status, found in the rest of the United Kingdom. Following local government reorganization in 1975 the title of \\"royal burgh\\" remains in use in many towns, but now has little more than ceremonial value. - The English Civil War (16421651) was a series of armed conflicts and political machinations between Parliamentarians (\\"Roundheads\\") and Royalists (\\"Cavaliers\\") over, principally, the manner of England's government. The first (164246) and second (164849) wars pitted the supporters of King Charles I against the supporters of the Long Parliament, while the third (164951) saw fighting between supporters of King Charles II and supporters of the Rump Parliament. The war ended with the Parliamentarian victory at the Battle of Worcester on 3 September 1651. - The Kingdom of Scotland was a state in northwest Europe traditionally said to have been founded in 843, which joined with the Kingdom of England to form a unified Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707. Its territories expanded and shrank, but it came to occupy the northern third of the island of Great Britain, sharing a land border to the south with the Kingdom of England. It suffered many invasions by the English, but under Robert I it fought a successful war of independence and remained a distinct state in the late Middle Ages. In 1603, James VI of Scotland became King of England, joining Scotland with England in a personal union. In 1707, the two kingdoms were united to form the Kingdom of Great Britain under the terms of the Acts of Union. From the final capture of the Royal Burgh of Berwick by the Kingdom of England in 1482 (following the annexation of the Northern Isles from the Kingdom of Norway in 1472) the territory of the Kingdom of Scotland corresponded to that of modern-day Scotland, bounded by the North Sea to the east, the Atlantic Ocean to the north and west, and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the southwest. - A legislature is a deliberative assembly with the authority to make laws for a political entity such as a country or city. Legislatures form important parts of most governments; in the separation of powers model, they are often contrasted with the executive and judicial branches of government. - The Battle of Auldearn was an engagement of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms. It took place on 9 May 1645, in and around the village of Auldearn in Nairnshire. It resulted in a victory for the royalists led by Montrose and Alasdair MacColla over a Covenanter army under the command of Sir John Urry (or Hurry).

Captain Frank Towns (Dennis Quaid) pilots a C-119 cargo plane full of oil workers who are returning home after shutting down an oil field in Mongolia's Gobi Desert. The plane is overloaded on take off, and soon they hit a violent sandstorm that causes them to crash. They are now stranded over 200 miles off-course and in the harsh desert terrain. Frank must maintain order and ration the little food and water among the survivors and wait for someone to rescue them. As time goes by, they realize their chance of being rescued is zero.

We have: -44 * w + 4 * w = 9 * w First, we want to put all the \\"w\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, we can look at the two items on the left side: -44 * w and 4 * w -44 * w means we have \\"-44 w's\\". And 4 * w means we have \\"4 w's\\". If we add them together, it's like having -44 apples and then adding 4 apples, so we get: -44 * w + 4 * w = -40 * w, which is the same as -40w. So the left side of the equation now becomes -40w. Now our equation looks like this: -40 * w = 9 * w Next, we want to get all the \\"w\\" terms on one side of the equation. To do that, let's move the 9 * w (which is the same as 9w) from the right side to the left side. We can do this by subtracting 9 * w from both sides of the equation: -40 * w - 9 * w = 9 * w - 9 * w This simplifies to: -49 * w = 0, which is the same as -49w = 0. Now, to find the value of \\"w\\", we want to get \\"w\\" all by itself by dividing both sides of the equation by -49: -49w / -49 = 0 / -49 This simplifies to: w = 0 So, the answer is w = 0. This means that in the equation -44 * w + 4 * w = 9 * w, when w is 0, the equation is true!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Are they unluckier than cats of other colors? Many people in Western countries think so. Scientists at the University of California, Berkeley (UC Berkeley), did a study on cat colours and people's understandings of cat personalities. The study found that people do judge cat personalities by color. Scientists did a survey on the Internet. There were 49 statements matching five cat colorings with 10 personalities. People think orange and bi-coloured cats are friendly, tri-coloured cats are not generous, and white cats are calm, lazy and shy. As for black cats, people think they don't have special personalities. But why do so many people dislike keeping black cats as pets? People think black cats have less special personalities, which might be because of their bad reputation . They think black cats may bring bad luck, especially at Halloween. Movies and television shows also make people believe that. Although people have these ideas, UC Berkeley scientists give another reason: people don't think black cats are pretty enough. After all, nothing can show black cats are unluckier than other cats. \\"You can't judge a cat by its colour, because it's the personality of the cat, not the colour, that will let you know if the cat is right for you,\\" Cathy Marden, a scientist said.

Answer the following question: This article: If the pigeon became alert, it would often stretch out its head and neck in line with its body and tail, then nod its head in a circular pattern. When aggravated by another pigeon, it raised its wings threateningly, but passenger pigeons almost never actually fought. The pigeon bathed in shallow water, and afterwards lay on each side in turn and raised the opposite wing to dry it.The passenger pigeon drank at least once a day, typically at dawn, by fully inserting its bill into lakes, small ponds, and streams. Pigeons were seen perching on top of each other to access water, and if necessary, the species could alight on open water to drink. One of the primary causes of natural mortality was the weather, and every spring many individuals froze to death after migrating north too early. In captivity, a passenger pigeon was capable of living at least 15 years; Martha, the last known living passenger pigeon, was at least 17 and possibly as old as 29 when she died. It is undocumented how long a wild pigeon lived.The bird is believed to have played a significant ecological role in the composition of pre-Columbian forests of eastern North America. For instance, while the passenger pigeon was extant, forests were dominated by white oaks. This species germinated in the fall, therefore making its seeds almost useless as a food source during the spring breeding season, while red oaks produced acorns during the spring, which were devoured by the pigeons. The absence of the passenger pigeon's seed consumption may have contributed to the modern dominance of red oaks. Due to the immense amount of dung present at roosting sites, few plants grew for years after the pigeons left. Also, the accumulation of flammable debris (such as limbs broken from trees and foliage killed by excrement) at these sites may have increased both the frequency and intensity of forest fires, which would have favored fire-tolerant species, such as bur oaks, black oaks, and white oaks over less fire-tolerant species, such as red oaks, thus helping to... contains an answer for the question: What was the youngest Martha could have been when she died?, what is it ?

Offering a slight twist, however, the offer is this time made to a retiring Sheriff Buford T. Justice (Jackie Gleason), betting 250,000 against his badge on his ability to transport a large stuffed fish from an eatery in Florida to Texas.Unlike the two earlier films, Big and Little Enos this time seem to be quite active in their desire to see Buford fail in his goal. After Buford dodges their many traps (especially after he destroyed their milk truck, which drenched them and disabled their engine), they then go so far as to actually attempt to hire the Bandit (as a distraction) to stop him. Deciding that the Bandit is too egotistical and hard to manage, they hire Cledus \\"Snowman\\" Snow (Jerry Reed) as his replacement. Accepting the offer, Cledus parks his Peterbilt 359 and climbs behind the wheel of a black and gold 1983 Pontiac Trans Am.He later picks up Dusty (Colleen Camp), who quits her job as a \\"bookkeeper\\" for a used car dealership, but not before attempting to wreck her boss' business (a seedy used car dealership) by badmouthing him in the middle of broadcasting a live TV commercial.The scene of Cledus picking up Dusty in the middle of the road is almost an exact repeat of how Bo picked up Frog in the 1977 film. Cledus manages to catch up with Buford on an interstate, where he then lassoes Buford's fish off of the Justices' police cruiser; Buford needs the fish to retrieve his 250,000. Buford then begins a hot pursuit of Cledus, with another local officer who attempts to take charge of the situation. Not long after the local officer is disabled, Buford becomes disabled as well when sand is dumped on his squad car.The pursuit quickly resumes as Buford catches up to the duo after Cledus and Dusty stop at a redneck bar to pick up... The answer is:","completion":"\\"The Great Fish Heist: Smokey and the Bandit's Last Chase\\" This movie title captures the essence of the plot, highlighting the key elements of the storyline - the large stuffed fish and the iconic characters, Smokey and the Bandit, embarking on their final adventure. The title also implies excitement and action, with the words \\"heist\\" and \\"last chase\\" evoking a sense of urgency and thrill throughout the journey. Additionally, the title pays homage to the two preceding films by including the names Smokey and the Bandit, signaling a continuation of the series while indicating that this installment offers a new twist on the classic formula."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: Two sculptures of life-size lions, each weighing about 5 tons in ancient times, have been discovered in what is now Turkey. The discovery of the massive lions, along with other pieces such as a large stone basin about 7 feet in diameter, left the archaeologists with a mystery ----what were they intended for? A search of the surrounding area revealed no evidence of a Hittite settlement dating back to the time of the statues. Also, the steep size of the sculptures meant that the sculptors likely did not intend to move them very far. Summers assumes that, rather than being meant for a palace or a great city, the lions were being created for a monument to mark something else- water \\"I think it's highly likely that that monument was going to be associated with one of the very abundant springs that are quite close,\\" he said in the interview, \\"There are good parallels for association of Hittite sculptural traditions with water sources\\" Indeed one well-known monument site, known as Eflatun Pnar, holds a sacred pool that \\"is fed by a spring beneath the pool itself,\\" write Yiit Erbil and Alice Mouton in an article that was published in the most recent edition of the Journal of Near Eastern Studies.

Rand Paul (R-Ky.) announced Wednesday that he is suspending his presidential campaign, bringing an end to a bid that began with aspirations of expanding the libertarian base that his father, Ron Paul, built into a powerful national coalition. \\"It's been an incredible honor to run a principled campaign for the White House,\\" Paul said in a statement. \\"Today, I will end where I began, ready and willing to fight for the cause of Liberty.\\" The low-key senator, as apt to quote a philosopher as to quote Pink Floyd, struggled in a year dominated by hard-line outsiders such as Sen. Ted Cruz (Tex.) and businessman Donald Trump. In a call with reporters, his campaign strategists bemoaned that the mogul had sucked the \\"oxygen\\" out of the race, and admitted hat his non-interventionist views on foreign policy were not embraced by Republicans as terrorism and unrest raged abroad. Paul, a first-time candidate for national office, also found it difficult to persuade the supporters of his father — a former congressman from Texas who sought the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012 — to back him with enthusiasm. Although popular among libertarians, purists in that wing of the conservative movement questioned whether Paul was too mainstream. “His decision to move to the middle and support a number of moderate Republicans in the 2014 elections, that sent us a real signal about the application of his ideology,” said Drew Ivers, Ron Paul’s 2012 Iowa chairman, who did not endorse Rand Paul. “He muddled on his message, tried to get the left, and I told him it would backfire… I just saw someone trying to do too much and be too many things to too many people. His name is Paul, I told him. You can’t defy gravity.\\" [Rand Paul's ideological heritage is his greatest asset — and his biggest challenge] Paul, a 53-year-old ophthalmologist, was elected to the Senate in 2010 as part of the GOP's tea party wave. He will return to his work in the chamber and to his Senate reelection campaign, where he remains a top target of Democrats as they try to retake the majority this year. According to Paul's campaign aides, the candidate decided to drop out after a disappointing finish in Monday's Iowa caucuses, where his father had placed a strong third in 2012. Thanks again to the people of Iowa. It was great getting to meet you & I am especially grateful for the enthusiasm of students! Fight on! — Dr. Rand Paul (@RandPaul) February 2, 2016 Over the past day, Paul began to inform his key aides and donors that he would leave the race, then returned to Washington, D.C. to resume his work in the Senate. In his statement, Paul expressed confidence that his campaign, while unsuccessful, offered Republicans an alternative by focusing on issues he thinks are crucial to attracting minorities and young people to the party. \\"Across the country thousands upon thousands of young people flocked to our message of limited government, privacy, criminal justice reform and a reasonable foreign policy,\\" he said. \\"Brushfires of Liberty were ignited, and those will carry on, as will I. Although, today I will suspend my campaign for President, the fight is far from over, I will continue to carry the torch for Liberty in the United States Senate and I look forward to earning the privilege to represent the people of Kentucky for another term.\\" Longtime associates of Ron Paul framed Rand Paul’s departure from the race as a stumble rather than a crippling defeat in the younger Paul’s career — and for their movement. Paul ally Trygve Olson said that libertarians and other conservatives probably would consider Paul in a future presidential cycle that was less crowded and driven by a celebrity front-runner. “Rand Paul remains the best advocate those conservative have in the United States Senate,” Olson said. “Even if he didn’t have the kind of success he wanted, he’s an important voice on a whole set of issues. Assuming he’s reelected, he will continue to be that voice and be the person putting them at the center of the radar.” Olson said Ron Paul’s star turn in the 2008 race was driven as much by the national political environment as it was by the candidate’s performance. “When Ron ran then, he was able to tap into the angst that was out there about the war and foreign policy,” he said. Paul's method of campaigning echoed his father's. He favored small gatherings where he could make lengthy speeches and preferred orations that cited Montesquieu. While he was accessible to the media, he did not relish banter with reporters or the glad-handing demands of the campaign. Some candidates used every spare minute to meet potential voters; reporters who ran into Paul at an airport usually caught him reading a book. But his ambitions were grand. Two years ago, he became the first Republican to assemble a network in all 50 states as a precursor to a presidential run — a sign that he was looking to build a coalition that wasn't as ad hoc as his father's. Magazine covers proclaimed Paul to be one of the party’s brightest and most interesting voices — a hemp-wearing, curly-haired maverick, who could, in his words, spread the Republican message to \\"voters with tattoos and without tattoos.\\" He began courting Wall Street titans and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs who had donated to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney, attending elite conclaves in Utah and elsewhere. His pitch combined his antagonism toward the National Security Agency’s surveillance programs with what he called “crunchy conservatism,” a prioritization of drug-sentencing reform, the environment and civil liberties. In 2013, as the Republican Party was casting about for new leadership, Paul filibustered the nomination of the new FBI director and only quit the floor ten and a half hours later, after the White House put out a letter clarifying whether American citizens could be targeted by drone attacks. He got mixed reviews for a speech to black students at Howard University, but then, hunkering down, he reached out to black political leaders in Kentucky and began talking more about criminal justice reform. Republican Party chapters tapped Paul to open offices in poverty-stricken parts of Louisville, Chicago, and Detroit. “I’ve been to Ferguson, and I've been to the south side of Chicago,” he told a largely white audience of Republicans in Baltimore, after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody sparked two days of rioting. \\"Until we've walked in someone else's shoes, we shouldn't say we can't understand the anger of people.\\" Few Republicans talked like that. In early 2014, Paul was consistently leading — or close to leading — national polls. A CNN/ORC International survey in March of that year found that 16 percent of Republicans and independents who lean Republican were likely to support the senator, putting him at the front of the Republican field, and giving him unusually strong support from black voters. At home in Kentucky, Paul loaned strategist-turned-nephew-in-law Jesse Benton to the re-election campaign of now-Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, signaling that he had bridged a gap between the \\"liberty movement\\" and the Republican elite. Some pundits, like The Atlantic's Peter Beinart, suggested that Paul was really the frontrunner to win a changing party's nomination and challenge presumed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on traditionally liberal turf. “Right now I'm the only one that beats Hillary Clinton in certain purple states,” Paul told Fox News host Megyn Kelly shortly before his launch. “I'm the only one that also scores above all the other Republicans in whether or not I can beat her.” Paul’s May 2015 announcement tour started in Lousiville, and swept into the first four primary states, finding sizable crowds. His campaign, led by Republican strategist Chip Englander, had a plan to finish at least second or third in all of the early states, then take advantage of the long-stirring Paul organizations in the Midwest and Mountain West to collect delegates. That never happened. Donald Trump, who entered the primary one month after Paul, charged ahead in polls and captured the “outsider” energy Paul had claimed for years. Weak poll numbers scared off possible megadonors who had donated to Ron Paul, like the venture capitalist Peter Thiel. In August, right before the first Republican presidential debate, Benton was indicted over a 2012 scheme to flip an Iowa state senator's endorsement to Ron Paul. (Benton was later acquitted.) Another, more strategic challenge came from a man Paul had endorsed in his bid for a Senate seat in Texas: Ted Cruz. Talking openly about winning the “liberty lane” of the Republican primary, Cruz lobbied supporters of Ron Paul to switch over and back a better-funded campaign. As he struggled, Paul barely concealed his resentment for Cruz's wrangling. Paul secured a standalone vote on defunding Planned Parenthood; Cruz vacuumed up the attention by calling to cut funds in the must-pass spending bill. Paul won a New Hampshire straw poll of libertarian-leaning Republicans; Cruz claimed victory with his own vote count. Paul told audiences that Cruz had been “nowhere to be found” on a vote to audit the Federal Reserve; voters did not seem to care. This past Sunday, when the elder Paul joined his son for a “revolution”-themed rally on the University of Iowa campus, most of the press seats were empty; only C-Span bothered to film a teleprompter-delivered closing message. Paul's early exit calmed Republicans who worried that his race for the White House was risking control of his Senate seat, which is on the 2016 ballot. Paul had worked hard to protect his day job, paying 250,000 from his campaign account to fund a March presidential caucus, which he now will not contest. At the “revolution” rally, early Paul endorser Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) said he was likely to pay for a poll of the state, expecting it to show that Paul could campaign through the next primaries without any risk to his Senate seat. In a Wednesday radio interview, Cruz praised Paul and reminded listeners that he had always been an ally of the liberty movement. Speaking to reporters in New Hampshire, Sen. Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), a staunch critic of Paul’s foreign policy positions, commended his Senate colleague for running “a good race” and wished him luck in his reelection bid. “Rand is someone I disagree with on a lot of issues, but as I said the other night at the debate ... he believes strongly in what he stands for, and I respect that,” said Rubio. “He’s a true believer on issues of limited government and the liberty issues and I respect it for him for it.\\" Asked if he planned to ask Paul for his endorsement, Rubio replied: “Sure. I mean, I’d love to have Rand’s support.” In a conference call with reporters Wednesday morning, Paul strategist Doug Stafford reiterated that the senator would make no endorsements -- not even of Cruz. It did not matter especially that Paul had endorsed the Texan in his upstart 2012 Senate primary. \\"Rand endorsed many people for Senate,\\" he said. Sean Sullivan contributed to this post, which has been updated.

Answer the following question: Generate a question about the following movie plot: Ethan Hunt is alerted by the IMF that someone has used his identity to assist bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich to enter the United States, only to kill him in a subsequent plane crash. Nekhorvich, an old friend of Ethan, had forewarned the IMF of his arrival, planning to deliver to them a new bioweapon, Chimera, and its cure, Bellerophon. He was forced to develop these by Biocyte Pharmaceuticals. IMF determines that rogue IMF agent Sean Ambrose is responsible. IMF assigns Ethan to recover the virus and its cure. It also insists that he recruits Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in Seville, Spain. Later, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend. After recruiting Nyah, Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in Sydney, Australia, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah gets close to Ambrose and begins to learn about the Chimera virus. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues. He then blackmails McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals video footage and transfers it to Ethan. Ethan's team learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's red blood cells. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. The IMF team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, they learn that the only samples of Bellerophon were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus (which Nekhorvich injected himself with). As a result, Ambrose forced McCloy to exchange a sample of the virus for a sample of Bellerophon.

Write an article based on these highlights.","completion":"Title: Rebuilding England's Cricket Team: A New Era Under Alastair Cook Alastair Cook is set to embark on an era-defining journey as he looks to rebuild his own team instead of leading the side initially assembled by Andrew Strauss. Despite a recent Ashes loss being Cook's maiden Test series defeat in six as captain, it is evident that the English cricket team needs a fresh perspective and rejuvenation. Team director Andy Flower's backing and support for Cook as the leader of the squad demonstrates the faith the management has placed in his abilities to take the team forward into a new era of success. The Ashes series, the pinnacle contest between England and Australia, has always been a significant event for any England captain. Cook's first Test series defeat as a captain came as a shock to many, yet it opened a window of opportunity for building a competitive and formidable team molded in his own image. The importance of having a captain, who is not only an exceptional tactician but also a leader who instills confidence and trust in his players, cannot be understated. Cook's strengths have been well-documented throughout his career. An astute tactical mind, an unwavering commitment to his team, and an ability to remain calm under pressure all contribute to his laudable captaincy style. The support he has received from team director Andy Flower, in addition to the selection committee's backing, signals that there is a collective belief in Cook's potential to steer the team towards a bright and successful future. Flower's insistence that Cook is the right man to lead England forward is a testament to this viewpoint. As the cricketing world adapts to different formats and evolves, it is essential that England takes the necessary steps to keep up with the ever-growing competitiveness of the sport. In this context, the consideration of Stuart Broad as a possible successor in the Twenty20 format can be seen as an intelligent move. Broad's impressive leadership qualities, coupled with his experience and expertise in the shorter formats of the game, makes him an ideal candidate to take over the reins from Cook if necessary. The transition from Strauss's team to Cook's is vital for the continuous growth of the English cricket team. With the backing of Flower and Broad waiting in the wings as a potential successor, it is crucial that Cook now takes full advantage of the opportunity to leave his own mark as captain. The expectations are undoubtedly high, and it remains to be seen how effectively Cook can remodel the team in his own image, thus ushering in a new era of success for England. By entrusting Cook with this responsibility, the team's management has demonstrated their belief in his skills as a leader and a potential harbinger of change. Under Cook's guidance, a rejuvenated and competitive English team could emerge, one that not only honors its past successes but forges a new path towards triumph. It is time for Cook to take the helm, to build and nurture his side, and ultimately, to make his own indelible mark on the cricketing world."},{"prompt":"Explain how you used the definition to come up with the answer.

Could you please translate this to English?","completion":"Firstly, it is important to know how to choose the right wine. This statement in Russian emphasizes the significance of selecting the appropriate wine for a particular occasion, meal, or personal preference. Possessing the ability to choose the right wine can enhance the overall experience and impression of both the wine itself and the event it is accompanying. To choose the right wine, one should consider various factors, such as taste preference, food pairing, wine origin, and budget. Start by determining your preferred taste, such as sweet, dry, fruity, or bold. If you are uncertain about your preferences, consider trying a wine tasting or asking for recommendations from friends or wine experts. Next, take into account the food you will be serving or consuming alongside the wine. Pairings can significantly impact the enjoyment of both the wine and the meal. As a general rule, lighter wines, such as white or rosé wines, complement lighter dishes, while fuller-bodied red wines go well with heartier, meat-based meals. However, this is not a strict rule, and individual preferences play a significant role. Investigate the wine’s origin, as the geographical location where it is grown and produced can impact the flavor profile and quality of the wine. Unique soil types, climates, and grape varieties contribute to regional differences in taste and texture. You may find that certain regions or countries produce wines that you particularly enjoy. Lastly, establish a budget to guide your wine selection. It is possible to find great-tasting wines at various price points, so don't assume that spending more is always necessary. However, investing in higher-quality wines for special occasions or for pairing with a gourmet meal can heighten the experience. Conduct research, ask for recommendations, and be open to trying new wines to build your knowledge and ensure you make the right choice for every situation."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Needing money, he reluctantly takes the job of adapting a trashy novel for the screen. Knowing that this is obviously below him, instead of reading the thing he instead asks a naive, celebrity-obsessed girl (who has read the book) he meets at a restaurant to give him a synopsis, which she does enthusiastically. He sends her home with cab money and is abruptly woken up at 5:00 the next morning by a police officer; the girl was found murdered, and Dix was the last person to see her alive. Given his violent past and what appears to be apathy towards her death, he is the most logical suspect until his beautiful neighbor Laurel Gray (Gloria Grahame) gives him an alibi (though the audience is never quite sure if she is telling the truth or lies because of her attraction to Dix). There is an undeniable connection between Laurel and Dix, and despite her guarded demeanor and his deep internal demons, the two fall madly in love and for a while they enjoy the happiest time of their lives. Meanwhile, the murder investigation continues and Dix is still the most likely suspect. This puts immense strain on their relationship. The pressure on him is mounting, and as he begins to become increasingly impatient and irritable, this makes her back away from him. Sensing this, he is so frightened he'll lose Laurel, he clings ever more tightly to her, which appears controlling and frightens her. After hearing she didn't tell him about going down to the police station to answer more questions, he storms off and almost kills an innocent bystander, and is only stopped by Laurel's plea. After that incident, Laurel begins to truly doubt Dix's innocence. Dix senses this and from the strain of the accusation, the novel and his fears of losing Laurel, his violence has started up again.
