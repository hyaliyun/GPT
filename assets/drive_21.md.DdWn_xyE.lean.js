Think like you are answering to a five year old. US President Barack Obama has angered Beijing by saying the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China and Japan, would be covered by the US-Japan security treaty. He is the first US president to spell this out. He gave the assurance as he began a four-nation Asia tour in Tokyo yesterday. Watch: Imperial pomp starts Obama's Japan visit China was quick to hit back. \\"The so-called security alliance between the US and Japan is a bilateral arrangement made during the cold war period, and it should not be used to damage China's sovereignty and legitimate interest,\\" foreign ministry spokesman Qin Gang said. \\"We resolutely oppose applying the Diaoyu Islands to the Japan-US security treaty.\\" We resolutely oppose applying the Diaoyu Islands to the Japan-US security treaty FOREIGN MINISTRY SPOKESMAN QIN GANG China and Japan are engaged in a bitter territorial dispute over the Diaoyus, known as Senkakus in Japan. The risks of an unintended conflict were highlighted in January when Tokyo alleged that a Chinese frigate locked its radar on a Japanese destroyer in the East China Sea. In December, the US military cruiser Cowpens had to take evasive action in the South China Sea to avoid hitting a warship supporting China's first aircraft carrier, Liaoning. Adding fuel to those fears, both PLA Navy commander Admiral Wu Shengli and Japanese Maritime Self-Defence Force chief of staff Katsutoshi Kawano, attending a defence forum in Qingdao this week, said an accidental conflict between the two militaries could not be ruled out, according to Phoenix TV reports. In written remarks published by Japan's Yomiuri Shimbum, Obama said the US alliance with Japan was \\"stronger than ever\\". \\"The policy of the United States is clear - the Senkaku Islands are administered by Japan and therefore fall within the scope of Article 5 of the US-Japan Treaty of Mutual Co-operation and Security,\\" Obama said. \\"And we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine Japan's administration of these islands.\\" Article 5 of the treaty, which was signed in 1960, stipulates US defence obligations to Japan, stating that each party recognises that an armed attack against either party in the territories under the administration of Japan would be dangerous to its own peace and safety. Obama said he had told President Xi Jinping that the territorial disputes should be resolved through dialogue and diplomacy, and also commended Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's efforts to strengthen Japan's defence forces. \\"We believe that it's in the interest of both our countries for Japanese Self Defence Forces to do more within the framework of our alliances,\\" he said. In a sign of the balancing act that the US faces in Asia, Obama said the US and China can work together on issues of mutual interest. Obama's tour, which will also take him to South Korea, the Philippines and Malaysia, came as Asian nations fear that US commitment to the region will be lessened, particularly as Obama cancelled his tour last year because of financial problem at home. In signs that China was keeping a close watch on the tour, Xi had a phone conversation with South Korean President Park Geun-hye, saying bilateral ties enjoyed a \\"sound momentum\\", state-run Xinhua reported. Xi also told Park that China was committed to the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula. Shi Yinhong , a US affairs expert at Renmin University, said Obama made the unprecedented assurance because Washington needed Tokyo's support for the Trans Pacific Partnership, a US-dominated trade pact. Obama to set aside decades of uneasy ties with Malaysia visit Barack Obama will this weekend become the first US president in nearly 50 years to visit Malaysia, where he will seek to put decades of uneasy bilateral relations behind him as both nations cast wary eyes on a rising China. Mindful of America's image problem in the Islamic world, Obama is expected to tout the US friendship with the thriving moderate Muslim nation. Malaysia is also an important partner in the US \\"rebalance\\" of its strategic attention to Asia, where concern is rising over China's territorial assertiveness. Obama will \\"highlight the growing strategic and economic relationship\\" with Malaysia and its \\"credentials as a moderate, Muslim-majority state and emerging democracy\\", said Joshua Kurlantzick, a fellow at the US Council on Foreign Relations. Prime Minister Najib Razak, meanwhile, will seek to capitalise on Obama's expected praise to counter flagging voter support and global criticism over the handling of the loss of Malaysia Airlines flight MH370. Obama was five years old the last time a serving US leader visited Malaysia. Lyndon Johnson went in 1966 to rally support for the US war in Vietnam. Tension followed during the 1981-2003 tenure of authoritarian leader Mahathir Mohamad, a harsh critic of US policies. But ties - especially trade - remained solid, and the more Western-oriented Najib has sought even closer relations. US deputy national security adviser Ben Rhodes this week expressed hope that the visit would \\"elevate US-Malaysian relations to a new stage\\". Obama postponed a visit last year to deal with the US government shutdown. Underlining the need for a reintroduction after nearly a half-century, Malaysia is the only stop on Obama's Asian swing to include a \\"town-hall meeting\\". He also visits close allies Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. China will loom large. It is Malaysia's top trade partner and Najib has played down their rival maritime claims. But Malaysian anxieties have grown, particularly after China held naval exercises in disputed waters last year, and the US and Malaysia have moved recently to improve defence ties. Chinese criticism over MH370 has also left a bitter aftertaste. \\"[Najib's government] obviously hopes that Obama's star effect can rub off on its flagging popularity,\\" said Dr Oh Ei Sun, senior fellow at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies in Singapore. \\"And Malaysia can continue to counterbalance China with the US in its foreign policy - siding with China economically but with the US on security.\\" Differences remain, though. The economic component of Obama's \\"rebalance\\" rests largely on his vision of a Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), a region-wide trade liberalisation pact bedevilled by rocky negotiations with partners. Malaysia has resisted free-market reforms that clash with its controversial policies reserving economic advantages for majority ethnic Malays. Obama may also face pressure to address uncomfortable human rights, democracy and religion issues in Malaysia. ||||| TOKYO (AP) — The voice was slightly halting, childlike. \\"Welcome to Miraikan, Mr. President, it is a pleasure to meet you.\\" President Barack Obama watches a Yabusame or horseback archery demonstration as he tours Meiji Shrine in Tokyo, Thursday, April 24, 2014.

(Associated Press) President Barack Obama bowed, looking delighted. His greeter, after all, was a 55-inch-tall, give or take, humanoid robot with the look of a diminutive Star Wars storm trooper. \\"It's nice to meet you, too,\\" Obama said, pausing to watch the robot, named ASIMO, perform during a tour of the National Museum of Emerging Science and Innovation. Despite Obama's background in constitutional law, there's a presidential geek side that always seems charmed, if not bemused, by technological advances. Asimo, made by Honda, announced \\"I can really run fast\\" before loping toward a soccer ball and informing Obama, \\"I can kick a soccer ball, too.\\" The robot delivered a well-aimed ball at Obama who trapped it neatly with his foot. For its final demonstration, the robot declared, \\"Recently I have learned how to jump.\\" It then proceeded to hop, first on one foot, then on two. Curious, Obama asked Mamoru Mohri, chief executive director of Miraikan, whether the robot was remote controlled. Yes, Mohri replied, but the robot can act autonomously, too. Obama also witnessed demonstrations by other robots, including one designed by Japanese technicians and partially financed by the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency that was developed to help with disaster response. \\"I have to say the robots were a little scary,\\" he said afterward. \\"They were too life-like.\\" ______ After holding a news conference with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, Obama met with the three relatives of two Japanese citizens who were abducted by North Korea. At the news conference, Obama said the United States stood with Japan in seeking to resolve such North Korean kidnappings and in a statement issued after the session with relatives, the White House said Obama was \\"moved by their tragic experiences.\\" Later, the relatives said Obama, as father of two daughters, showed empathy over the kidnapping of their loved ones. He said he would do his utmost to resolve the problem, possibly by adopting a U.N. Security Council resolution to pressure the North. As father of two teenage daughters, Obama seemed particularly empathetic to Sakie Yokota, 78, whose daughter Megumi was kidnapped by North Korean agents 37 years ago when she was only 13. Yokota said Obama carefully looked at the pictures she brought and seemed to understand the pain of waiting such a long time. \\"President Obama said it's not just another political or human rights issue. He said he cannot tolerate this problem as a human being and a father,\\" Yokota told reporters after the meeting. \\"He reassured us that he would give us a firm support to resolve the problem.\\" _______ Of prayer cards and archers.

Mr. Obama had hoped to use his visit here to announce an agreement under which Japan would open its markets in rice, beef, poultry and pork, a critical step toward the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the proposed regional trade pact. But Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was not able to overcome entrenched resistance from Japan’s farmers in time for the president’s visit. In Jerusalem, Israel’s announcement that it was suspending stalemated peace negotiations with the Palestinians, after a reconciliation between the Palestine Liberation Organization and the militant group Hamas, posed yet another obstacle to restarting a troubled peace process in which Secretary of State John Kerry has been greatly invested. The setbacks, though worlds apart in geography and history, speak to the common challenge Mr. Obama has had in translating his ideas and ambitions into enduring policies. He has watched outside forces unravel his best-laid plans, from resetting relations with Russia to managing the epochal political change in the Arab world. On Thursday, as Russia staged military exercises on the border with Ukraine, Mr. Kerry denounced broken promises from the Kremlin but took no specific action. Continue reading the main story Video Mr. Obama has not given up. Indeed, his advisers insisted that they had achieved a “pathway” to resolving the sticking points in a trade deal during marathon talks that continued until just before the president left Tokyo for Seoul. On Friday in South Korea, Mr. Obama continued his weeklong quest to breathe life into his shift to Asia. Mr. Kerry, the tireless campaigner for Middle East peace, was still working the phones, trying to maneuver the Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating room. One of the president’s most grandiose foreign-policy projects, a nuclear agreement with Iran, remains very much on the table, with diplomats from Iran and the West beginning to draft language that would limit Iran’s nuclear program and inhibit its ability to produce a weapon. Advertisement Continue reading the main story In one sense, the latest news from the Middle East offers a rationale for Mr. Obama to keep his gaze fixed on the fast-growing economies of Asia. While the troubles with the peace negotiations have surprised almost no one, the trade talks with Japan still hold some hope of yielding a landmark deal, since it is in the interests of both Mr. Abe and Mr. Obama — a bet on the future rather than an effort to clear the enmities of the past. First, though, Mr. Obama has to overcome the stubborn hurdles to any trade agreement. Back home, he has been unable to win support from Congress for the deal. “Prime Minister Abe has got to deal with his politics; I’ve got to deal with mine,” he said on Thursday. “It means that we sometimes have to push our constituencies beyond their current comfort levels.” Advertisement Continue reading the main story Mr. Obama also declared that the United States was obligated by a security treaty to protect Japan in its confrontation with China over a clump of islands in the East China Sea. But he stopped short of siding with Japan in the dispute regarding who has sovereignty over the islands, and carefully calibrated his statement to avoid antagonizing China. The net result, seen in a news conference in which the leaders referred to each other a bit stiffly as Barack and Shinzo, was an alliance clearly on firmer footing than it was earlier, but still vulnerable to political frailties on each side. Similar frailties were on display in Jerusalem, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel acted swiftly to suspend talks after his Palestinian counterpart, President Mahmoud Abbas, signed a deal seeking to reconcile his Fatah faction, which dominates the Palestine Liberation Organization and leads the West Bank government, with Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the Gaza Strip. Mr. Abbas “had a choice: peace with Israel or pact with the terrorist Hamas,” Mr. Netanyahu said in an interview with NBC News. “So that’s the blow for peace, and I hope he changes his mind.” Mr. Kerry told Mr. Abbas on Thursday that he was disappointed by the reconciliation announcement, and he planned to speak later with Mr. Netanyahu. The administration’s Middle East peace envoy, Martin S. Indyk, remained in the region, refusing to give up. “Choices need to be made by both parties, and we’ll see what happens in the days ahead,” Jen Psaki, a State Department spokeswoman, told reporters in Washington. Palestinian leaders sought to shift the blame for the breakdown to Israel. Saeb Erekat, the chief Palestinian negotiator, said Israel had “deliberately sabotaged the peace process by stopping the negotiations” and by refusing to freeze settlement construction. Mr. Erekat said in a telephone interview that reconciliation was “an internal Palestinian affair that Israel has no right to interfere in” and that it “should not be used as a pretext to evade negotiations.” But after a six-hour meeting on Thursday, Israel’s top ministers voted unanimously to halt the talks and to impose an unspecified series of punitive measures against the Palestinians for their promise to form a new government within five weeks that would prepare for long-overdue elections. Negotiations could only resume, Israeli officials said, if Mr. Abbas abandoned or failed to carry out the deal with Hamas — something Palestinian analysts say is a possibility. “What will happen now is the usual routine: Israel will try to punish the Palestinians; the Palestinians will complain; Israel will not really punish the Palestinians, because we cannot afford the Palestinian Authority to collapse,” said Shlomo Brom, a researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv. “So it will be another episode in this never-ending story.” Events in Asia tend to move at a slower pace. But with trade a key pillar of Mr. Obama’s strategy in Asia and each side looking for something from the other, the negotiations assumed a Middle East-like intensity. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Advertisement Continue reading the main story In round-the-clock negotiations this week, American and Japanese officials said, the United States pressed Japan to make major concessions, including cutting protective tariffs close to zero on agricultural products like cheese and pork. “There are a lot of people in Japan who question whether Japan should make big concessions just because Obama is here,” said Nobuhiro Suzuki, a professor of agriculture at the University of Tokyo. “Abe has to heed them, too, to avoid appearing like an American patsy.” Other analysts faulted Mr. Obama, saying his decision not to fight for the legislative authority at home to pass major trade deals had robbed him of leverage with the Japanese, who are reluctant to make concessions for a deal that may not survive Congress. “Their strategy was to get the Japanese to do the deal, then go to Congress and say, ‘Look what a great deal we got, now give us the authority,’ ” said Michael J. Green, an Asia adviser to President George W. Bush. “He made a decision to go into this with one hand tied behind his back.” Speaking to reporters on Air Force One en route to Seoul, a senior administration official said that after their meeting, Mr. Obama and Mr. Abe instructed their staffs to find a way to close the remaining gaps. “Nothing is agreed to until everything is agreed to,” the official said. But he added, “We’re at a moment where we see where we’re going to achieve resolution.” In Tokyo, the Japanese trade minister, Akira Amari, told reporters that no agreement had been reached, but noted: “We are moving toward a conclusion.” The president’s statement about the United States’ obligations toward Japan was important because it was the first time he had explicitly put the disputed islands under American protection, though Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel recently made the same statement and the policy has been held by successive administrations. “This is a very important turning point for the United States-Japan alliance because it means the period of drift under President Obama has finally come to an end,” said Yuichi Hosoya, an expert on American-Japanese relations at Keio University in Tokyo. “The fact that this was said by the president will have a huge psychological impact on Japanese officials and people.” The Chinese government reacted swiftly, saying it was “firmly opposed” to Mr. Obama’s position. More than anything, Mr. Obama appeared eager to defuse tensions over the islands, referring to them as a “rock” and saying they should not be allowed to derail a relationship that could otherwise be productive. “It would be a profound mistake to continue to see escalation around this issue rather than dialogue and confidence-building measures between Japan and China,” Mr. Obama said. Mr. Abe said he was encouraged by Mr. Obama’s pledge to protect the islands. “On this point,” he said, “I fully trust President Obama.” ||||| Write a summary.","completion":"US President Barack Obama had angered Beijing by saying that the uninhabited Diaoyu Islands in the East China Sea, which are claimed by China and Japan, would be covered by the US-Japan security treaty.

Q:Information: - In information theory , Shannon 's source coding theorem ( or noiseless coding theorem ) establishes the limits to possible data compression , and the operational meaning of the Shannon entropy . The source coding theorem shows that ( in the limit , as the length of a stream of independent and identically - distributed random variable ( i.i.d . ) data tends to infinity ) it is impossible to compress the data such that the code rate ( average number of bits per symbol ) is less than the Shannon entropy of the source , without it being virtually certain that information will be lost . However it is possible to get the code rate arbitrarily close to the Shannon entropy , with negligible probability of loss . The source coding theorem for symbol codes places an upper and a lower bound on the minimal possible expected length of codewords as a function of the entropy of the input word ( which is viewed as a random variable ) and of the size of the target alphabet . - Ecology (from , \\"house\\", or \\"environment\\"; -, \\"study of\\") is the scientific analysis and study of interactions among organisms and their environment. It is an interdisciplinary field that includes biology, geography, and Earth science. Ecology includes the study of interactions organisms have with each other, other organisms, and with abiotic components of their environment. Topics of interest to ecologists include the diversity, distribution, amount (biomass), and number (population) of particular organisms, as well as cooperation and competition between organisms, both within and among ecosystems. Ecosystems are composed of dynamically interacting parts including organisms, the communities they make up, and the non-living components of their environment. Ecosystem processes, such as primary production, pedogenesis, nutrient cycling, and various niche construction activities, regulate the flux of energy and matter through an environment. These processes are sustained by organisms with specific life history traits, and the variety of organisms is called biodiversity. Biodiversity, which refers to the varieties of species, genes, and ecosystems, enhances certain ecosystem services. - Quantum computing studies theoretical computation systems (quantum computers) that make direct use of quantum-mechanical phenomena, such as superposition and entanglement, to perform operations on data. Quantum computers are different from binary digital electronic computers based on transistors. Whereas common digital computing requires that the data be encoded into binary digits (bits), each of which is always in one of two definite states (0 or 1), quantum computation uses quantum bits, which can be in superpositions of states. A quantum Turing machine is a theoretical model of such a computer, and is also known as the universal quantum computer. The field of quantum computing was initiated by the work of Paul Benioff and Yuri Manin in 1980, Richard Feynman in 1982, and David Deutsch in 1985. A quantum computer with spins as quantum bits was also formulated for use as a quantum spacetime in 1968. - In physics, energy is the property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on or to heat the object, and can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the mechanical work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton. - The Boltzmann constant (or ), which is named after Ludwig Boltzmann, is a physical constant relating the average kinetic energy of particles in a gas with the temperature of the gas. It is the gas constant divided by the Avogadro constant : - In signal processing, data compression, source coding, or bit-rate reduction involves encoding information using fewer bits than the original representation. Compression can be either lossy or lossless. Lossless compression reduces bits by identifying and eliminating statistical redundancy. No information is lost in lossless compression. Lossy compression reduces bits by removing unnecessary or less important information. The process of reducing the size of a data file is referred to as data compression. In the context of data transmission, it is called source coding (encoding done at the source of the data before it is stored or transmitted) in opposition to channel coding. - A temperature is an objective comparative measurement of hot or cold. It is measured by a thermometer. Several scales and units exist for measuring temperature, the most common being Celsius (denoted °C; formerly called \\"centigrade\\"), Fahrenheit (denoted °F), and, especially in science, Kelvin (denoted K). - The bit is a basic unit of information in computing and digital communications. A bit can have only one of two values, and may therefore be physically implemented with a two-state device. These values are most commonly represented as either a . The term \\"bit\\" is a portmanteau of binary digit. In information theory, the bit is equivalent to the unit \\"shannon\\", named after Claude Shannon. - Natural language processing is a field of computer science, artificial intelligence, and computational linguistics concerned with the interactions between computers and human (natural) languages. As such, NLP is related to the area of humancomputer interaction. Many challenges in NLP involve: natural language understanding, enabling computers to derive meaning from human or natural language input; and others involve natural language generation. - In statistical thermodynamics, entropy (usual symbol ) (Greek:, + ) is a measure of the number of microscopic configurations that a thermodynamic system can have when in a state as specified by certain macroscopic variables. Specifically, assuming that each of the microscopic configurations is equally probable, the entropy of the system is the natural logarithm of that number of configurations, multiplied by the Boltzmann constant (which provides consistency with the original thermodynamic concept of entropy discussed below, and gives entropy the dimension of energy divided by temperature). Formally, - Physics (from , from \\"phúsis\\" \\"nature\\") is the natural science that involves the study of matter and its motion and behavior through space and time, along with related concepts such as energy and force. One of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, the main goal of physics is to understand how the universe behaves. - Information theory studies the quantification, storage, and communication of information. It was originally proposed by Claude E. Shannon in 1948 to find fundamental limits on signal processing and communication operations such as data compression, in a landmark paper entitled \\"A Mathematical Theory of Communication\\". Now this theory has found applications in many other areas, including statistical inference, natural language processing, cryptography, neurobiology, the evolution and function of molecular codes, model selection in ecology, thermal physics, quantum computing, linguistics, plagiarism detection, pattern recognition, and anomaly detection. - In data mining, anomaly detection (also outlier detection) is the identification of items, events or observations which do not conform to an expected pattern or other items in a dataset. Typically the anomalous items will translate to some kind of problem such as bank fraud, a structural defect, medical problems or errors in a text. Anomalies are also referred to as outliers, novelties, noise, deviations and exceptions. - Signal processing is an enabling technology that encompasses the fundamental theory, applications, algorithms, and implementations of processing or transferring information contained in many different physical, symbolic, or abstract formats broadly designated as \\"signals\\". It uses mathematical, statistical, computational, heuristic, and linguistic representations, formalisms, and techniques for representation, modelling, analysis, synthesis, discovery, recovery, sensing, acquisition, extraction, learning, security, or forensics. - Cryptography or cryptology (from Greek \\"kryptós\\", \\"hidden, secret\\"; and \\"graphein\\", \\"writing\\", or \\"-logia\\", \\"study\\", respectively) is the practice and study of techniques for secure communication in the presence of third parties called adversaries. More generally, cryptography is about constructing and analyzing protocols that prevent third parties or the public from reading private messages; various aspects in information security such as data confidentiality, data integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation are central to modern cryptography. Modern cryptography exists at the intersection of the disciplines of mathematics, computer science, and electrical engineering.

Step 3: Identify the kind of tea set used in that scene. Answer: The tea set used in the tea scene in \\"Alice Through the Looking Glass\\" is a whimsical, colorful, and mismatched set featuring unique designs for each cup and pot that adds to the fantastical nature of the scene. To answer the second question, I will: Step 1: Understand the context of the question, which refers to the health implications of drinking tea. Step 2: Research or recall the general health effects of drinking tea. Step 3: Relate the information to the specific case of drinking 6 glasses of tea every day. Answer: Drinking 6 glasses of tea every day can be considered healthy if it is mostly unsweetened, non-caffeinated or low-caffeinated tea. Tea contains antioxidants and other beneficial compounds that can contribute to overall health. However, it is important to note that excessive caffeine from tea may cause anxiety, insomnia, or other issues for some individuals.

The Oscar winning Russel Crowe has put himself in line for further honors with his acting John Nash, the Nobel Prize-winning mathematician troubled by schizophrenia . A Beautiful Mind pictures Nash as an unusual hero, not just because of his academic achievements, but also because of the courage he displays while battling his illness. In 1947, Nash was one of many great young minds at Princeton. \\"To find a truly original idea is the only way to distinguish myself.\\" The proud and determined student declared. His exploration of such an idea afforded him little time for the normal socializing. His shyness and straightforward approach brought him few friends. After finally _ a revolutionary new idea, Nash's career took off and his reputation was secured.

After seeing a flower grow instantly from the ground and being haunted by dreams of a great flood, Noah takes them to visit his grandfather Methuselah.

Noah and his family are chased by the murderers and seek refuge with the fallen angels known as the \\"Watchers\\", confined on Earth as stone golems (nephilim) for helping humans banished from the Garden of Eden. Methuselah gives Noah a seed from Eden and tells Noah that he was chosen for a reason. Returning to his tent that night, Noah plants the seed in the ground. The Watchers arrive the next morning and debate whether they should help Noah until they see water spout from the spot where Noah planted the seed. Once a forest grows instantly, the Watchers agree to help Noah and his family build an ark. After birds fly to the ark, Tubal-cain arrives with his followers and confronts Noah.

The energy allows individual molecules to separate and move apart from one another. It takes more energy to bring about these changes of state for polar molecules. Although hydrogen bonds are weak, they add to the energy needed for molecules to move apart from one another, so it takes higher temperatures for these changes of state to occur in polar compounds. This explains why polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points. The Table below compares melting and boiling points for some polar and nonpolar covalent compounds. Paragraph: Mike was interested in the science behind polar compounds. To that end, he collected two compounds, compound A and compound B. Compound A was a polar compound, but compound B was a nonpolar compound. He then conducted two tests, case A and case B. In case A, he changed the state of a polar compound from solid to liquid. And, in case B, he changed the state of a nonpolar compound from solid to liquid. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which compound would have higher boiling point, compound A or compound B? Answer:","completion":"Compound A, the polar compound, would have a higher boiling point compared to compound B, the nonpolar compound. This is because polar compounds have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the additional energy required to break the hydrogen bonds between their molecules."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Found fame as he taunted the authorities during his decades on the run. Gang targeted a train in 1963 and made off with Â£40m in today's money.","completion":"Title: The Demise and Legendary Criminal Exploits of a Notorious Outlaw: A Timeless Tale from North London Last month, North London bore witness to the final chapter of an infamous life, as one of its most notorious criminals, aged 84, passed away. The crook, in his audacious style, always mocked authorities, and his daring escapades kept him on the run for decades. His most renowned act, a train heist in 1963, saw him and his gang escape with a pile of money equating to over £40 million in today's economy. It was this audacity and bravado in shunning law enforcement that had catapulted him into the public eye as a notorious figure. His lifestyle was marked by his bold crimes and the manner in which he taunted the police, making him a part of local lore. His story, although fear-inducing, was also enthralling and often caught the attention of many. Despite the illegality of his actions, there was an uncanny fascination when it came to his audacious heists and narrow escapes. Throughout the multiple decades he spent on the run, the criminal mastermind was never shy of the spotlight. In actuality, it seemed he relished in it, enjoying the infamy that his criminal actions brought him. He was always evasive, taunting authorities with his elusive nature, consistently managing to stay one step ahead of them. This audacious dance with law enforcement further emphasized his confidence and further perpetuated his notorious reputation. His fame as a criminal reached its zenith in August 1963 when he, along with his gang, targeted a Royal Mail train traveling between Glasgow and London – an incident that would go down in history as 'The Great Train Robbery'. After tampering with the railway signals to stop the train, the group managed to make off with 120 bags full of money, amounting to roughly £2.6 million then, a sum that equates to over £40 million in today's economy. The audacity, planning, and the scale of the hit were immense - setting a new high (or low, depending on viewpoint) in criminal enterprises. To this day, the Great Train Robbery remains one of the most infamous heists in British history and has been the subject of numerous films, books, and television series. Despite the general public's fascination with the daring escapade, the reality that this notorious criminal made off with such a colossal sum of money, much of which was never recovered, is a stark reminder of the gravity of his criminal activities. He and his gang changed the face of crime in the UK with their audacity, acting as reminders for the need for ever-vigilant and adaptive law enforcement. As the news of the notorious criminal's death broke, it marks an end to this legendary tale of notoriety and audacity. However, his bold exploits and the manner in which he taunted authorities during his decades on the run remain timeless in the annals of criminal history. His demise brings about a chance to reflect on how law enforcement has evolved over the years and how it continues to adapt to the ever-changing nature of crime. Notorious as he was, his story serves as a reminder - not as a point of fascination but as a case study in the enduring battle between crime and justice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Out of the options provided, the word \\"talent\\" is the most appropriate and fitting choice to complete the sentence. It effectively captures and conveys the idea that her capability to entertain others is an inherent gift, setting her apart in this specific area. While the other options potentially have some connection to the idea, they do not accurately convey the intended meaning as well as \\"talent\\" does. Let's analyze each one: 1. \\"Fun\\" - This word alone doesn't express the notion that she had a particular ability to entertain. Although it may suggest that she was fun to have around, it doesn't effectively capture the idea that she had a special aptitude for entertaining others. 2. \\"Learn about\\" - This phrase doesn't fit in the context of the sentence and is not a suitable choice for completing it. It implies that one will gain knowledge about something or someone, which is unrelated to the idea that the woman had a unique ability to entertain. 3. \\"Intelligence\\" - Although intelligence can contribute to a person's ability to entertain others, it doesn't specifically convey the same meaning as \\"talent.\\" Intelligence implies a mental capacity for learning, understanding, and problem-solving, rather than an inherent skill or ability for a specific task, such as entertaining. 4. \\"Recognize\\" - This word also doesn't accurately capture the intended meaning of the given question. While it could suggest that others acknowledged her skills to entertain, it does not express that she had a natural ability to do so.

WASHINGTON — Republicans in the U.S. House of Representative plan to hold a vote next week on an immigration bill despite Trump urging them Friday to abandon efforts to pass legislation until after the mid-term elections. Even if the Republicans — who have a majority in both the House and Senate — approve a bill, it faces almost certain defeat in the upper chamber where Democrats hold enough seats to prevent Republicans, even if they all vote together, from reaching the 60 votes needed for passage. Earlier in the week, the president had called for Congress to quickly approve sweeping immigration legislation. But in a Friday tweet the president said, \\"Republicans should stop wasting their time on Immigration until after we elect more Senators and Congressmen/women in November.

Greece Following the assassination of Phillip II, his son Alexander III (\\"The Great\\") assumed the leadership of the League of Corinth and launched an invasion of the Persian Empire with the combined forces of all Greek states in 334 BC. Undefeated in battle, Alexander had conquered the Persian Empire in its entirety by 330 BC. By the time of his death in 323 BC, he had created one of the largest empires in history, stretching from Greece to India. His empire split into several kingdoms upon his death, the most famous of which were the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. Many Greeks migrated to Alexandria, Antioch, Seleucia and the many other new Hellenistic cities in Asia and Africa. Although the political unity of Alexander's empire could not be maintained, it resulted in the Hellenistic civilization and spread the Greek language and Greek culture in the territories conquered by Alexander. Greek science, technology and mathematics are generally considered to have reached their peak during the Hellenistic period. Q: In which year did Alexander III die?","completion":"Alexander III, also known as Alexander the Great, died in the year 323 BC. His death marked a significant moment in history as it led to the division of his vast empire that stretched from Greece to India. Imperatively, even though the political unity he had established was not upheld after his death, it resulted in the spread of Hellenistic civilization, as well as the Greek language and culture, across the territories he conquered. The kingdoms that emerged from the division of Alexander's empire included the Seleucid Empire, Ptolemaic Egypt, the Greco-Bactrian Kingdom and the Indo-Greek Kingdom. These kingdoms played significant roles in human history, influencing cultural, political and economic aspects of life in the ancient world. For instance, the Seleucid Empire, which at its height stretched from modern-day Turkey to Pakistan, became a center of Hellenistic culture that maintained the preeminence of Greek customs where a Greek political elite dominated. The Ptolemaic Kingdom in Egypt was characterized by its wealthy cities such as Alexandria, which during its golden age was the cultural, spiritual and scientific heart of the entire Hellenistic world. In the Greco-Bactrian and the Indo-Greek Kingdoms, we see the fusion of Greek and eastern elements, which not only enriched Greek culture but also significantly contributed to the development of various aspects of Asian civilizations. Many Greeks migrated to newly established Hellenistic cities such as Alexandria, Antioch, and Seleucia, further spreading Greek culture and influence. Moreover, during the Hellenistic period following Alexander's death, Greek science, technology, and mathematics reached remarkable heights. Pioneers in various fields advanced knowledge and innovation significantly. It was a period marked by intellectual exchange and flourishing creativity, which dramatically shaped the course of the Western intellectual tradition. In summary, the period following Alexander III's death in 323 BC was characterized by political fragmentation but also major cultural and intellectual advancements, where the influence of Greek civilization integrated with local cultures spread across a vast territory. This unique blend of cultures left a profound influence on the world, as the remnants of this Hellenistic civilization can be traced in the modern cultures of the Mediterranean, Middle East, Central Asia, and India."},{"prompt":"- title is bishop of the archdiocese of trani-barletta-bisceglie -lrb- emeritus -rrb- - previous post is prelate - see is roman catholic archdiocese of trani-barletta-bisceglie - type is bishop - term is 1990 - 1999 - successor is giovanni battista pichierri - church is roman catholic church - ordination is december 17 , 1949 - predecessor is giuseppe carata - birth date is 6 april 1924 - birth place is eufemia-tricase , italy Given the details above, guess who could this information be about.

Article:It's a glimpse of how much student life has changed, what students expect from universities and how much pressure they feel about the future. In the 1970s, students at Reading staged an occupation calling for the abolition of exams. Now, in the depths of the exam season, they are voluntarily occupying the library in the middle of the night, so that they can get in as much revision as possible. During weekdays in term time the library is open 24/7. Never mind 24-hour clubbing, here it's round the clock studying. It's become part of student life in universities across the UK. But if libraries are meant to be slow-moving places under layers of dust and silence, then it's nothing like that here. The lights are blazing in the library building in the middle of the Reading campus. It's full of young people surrounded by notebooks, laptops, mobile phones and snacks. There's a lone printed book on a desk, with almost all the revision taking place online. There's a low level of background chat as students work together. It would be unusual to see such a busy library in the middle of the day, but here it's buzzing in the middle of the night. There are groups of students coming and going, talking in a cafe - and overnight library figures show there were still more than 100 students there at 03:30. Niamh, a pharmacy student, has been working there since 09:00 and expected to carry on studying in the library until about 01:30. Two students revising for second-year exams, Alex and Matthew, say they will be back again at 06:00. \\"You have to get in before 08:00 to get a place,\\" says Alex, studying biochemistry. He knows that his generation is a long way from any stereotypes of student slackers. \\"We're under more pressure to do well, we have to work harder,\\" he says. And when students are paying Â£9,000 per year, they want to have good facilities. \\"It's essential to have a good library,\\" says Matthew. When the weather is good during the day, Alex says people might prefer to study at night. \\"It's a nice time to work,\\" he says. There are other students there who say it's better to work in a group rather than alone in their rooms. It's a more sociable way of working through the stresses of the exam season. None of them see it as strange to be working in a library in the early hours. Reading's library, with five floors of nocturnal students hunched over laptops, is having a Â£4.4m revamp. Universities are in the middle of a building boom, as they compete for students with facilities and accommodation. Like an academic department store, different parts of the library have different moods - there are bright Ikea style open plan areas, for more solitary study there are cocooning booths and quiet corners and other rooms have big traditional desks and softer lighting. There is a relentless switch to online materials, but there are still rooms with traditional bookshelves, even if there is no longer the metallic crunch of a library stamp putting in a return date. Withdrawals are now self-service and electronic. Julia Munro, the university's librarian, says that on open days would-be students compare the facilities with what they've seen elsewhere. And they expect to be able to use the library whenever they want. \\"They tell us they want to study when they want to study - and if they want to study at 02:00, they think they should be able to.\\" It wasn't always this way. The library is exactly 50 years old, and in the reception area there is the original architect's model. It's like a 1960s time capsule, with its clean lines and open-plan civic optimism. It opened the same month that Terence Conran opened the first Habitat store in London, Joe Orton was premiering his new play Entertaining Mr Sloane and in the United States there were the first major student protests in New York and San Francisco over the Vietnam War. The Beatles had recently had a number one with Can't Buy Me Love. In those early days, students couldn't even use the university library at the weekend. Now Julia Munro and her colleague Rachel Redrup say there is likely to be demand for even more open access, such as longer hours during the holidays. The move to open libraries through the night has been driven by consumer pressure from students. It's a pattern that's spread across universities across the UK - so much so that it's now more or less standard in many institutions. In the US, it's gone a step further with reports last week of college libraries introducing \\"nap stations\\" so that students could have somewhere to crash out during their marathon studying sessions. The librarians at Reading say the library provides its own barometer of change. Rachel Redrup says in the 1960s the students using the library would have been part of a small percentage of the population going to university, who would have been confident of walking out into a good job. Now, says Julia Munro, students are less certain of the future. \\"They feel they're under greater pressure. They're worried about jobs,\\" she says. A summary of the above article is?","completion":"Student life has transformed significantly over the years, with expectations and pressure on university students to succeed at an all-time high. A key example of this change is the 24/7 library access provided across UK universities. Once considered places of silence and dust, university libraries are now buzzing with activity at all hours of the day and night. Students are working later into the night and beginning their study sessions earlier in the morning to secure a place to revise. The prevalence of 24-hour library access is driven by student demand and the competition between universities to provide the best facilities."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Premise: \\"Dad planted it in my birthday cake on a makeshift flagstaff.\\" Based on this premise, is the hypothesis \\"Dad didn't plant it in my birthday cake.\\" true?","completion":"Based on the given premise, the hypothesis \\"Dad didn't plant it in my birthday cake.\\" is not true. The statement clearly mentions that \\"Dad planted it in my birthday cake on a makeshift flagstaff.\\" This suggests that the subject's dad did plant something, presumably an object like a decoration or small flag, inside the birthday cake on a makeshift flagstaff, which could be any rudimentary, improvised structure that served as a flagstaff or pole. The premise provides information related to an event involving the birthday cake, the father's action, and the presence of an object inside the cake on a makeshift flagstaff. This implies that the father had a role in placing the object inside the cake for a specific purpose, which could be to surprise the person or to celebrate a significant milestone or event. Given that the premise establishes the father's action of putting an object inside the birthday cake, it directly contradicts the hypothesis that the father did not plant the object in the cake.

Musical forms began to break from the Classical era forms (even as those were being codified), with free-form pieces like nocturnes, fantasias, and preludes being written where accepted ideas about the exposition and development of themes were ignored or minimized. The music became more chromatic, dissonant, and tonally colorful, with tensions (with respect to accepted norms of the older forms) about key signatures increasing. The art song (or Lied) came to maturity in this era, as did the epic scales of grand opera, ultimately transcended by Richard Wagner's Ring cycle.\\". Can you tell me what it is?

The film follows the plot of the series SpongeBob SquarePants, focusing on the anthropomorphic sea sponge of the same name (Tom Kenny). SpongeBob dreams about managing the Krusty Krab restaurant, which one day has a crisis involving a customer having no cheese on his Krabby Patty. SpongeBob arrives and saves the day, and he wakes up and cheerfully prepares for the opening ceremony for the Krusty Krab 2, hoping that his boss Mr. Krabs (Clancy Brown) will promote him to manager of the new restaurant built next door to the original Krusty Krab. At the ceremony, SpongeBob is passed over; his co-worker, Squidward Tentacles (Rodger Bumpass), has been given the promotion because Mr. Krabs thinks he is \\"more mature\\" than SpongeBob.Meanwhile, Plankton (Mr. Lawrence), Mr. Krabs' business rival, devises a plot to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula and frame Mr. Krabs. He steals King Neptune's (Jeffrey Tambor) crown that night, leaving evidence that pins the crime on Mr. Krabs, and sends the crown to Shell City, a distant, mysterious land from which no fish has returned. That night, SpongeBob goes to his favorite restaurant, Goofy Goober's; he drowns his sorrows in ice cream with his best friend, Patrick Star (Bill Fagerbakke), waking up the next morning with a headache. King Neptune barges into the Krusty Krab 2 the same morning and threatens to slay Mr. Krabs. Although SpongeBob criticizes Mr. Krabs shortly after he arrives, he promises Neptune that he will retrieve the crown from Shell City. Neptune freezes Mr. Krabs, still certain that he is the culprit, and tells SpongeBob to return with the crown in six days for him to spare Mr. Krabs. SpongeBob and Patrick leave for Shell City in the Patty Wagon, a car shaped like a Krabby Patty.SpongeBob and Patrick, pursued by Shell City's \\"cyclops\\" diver.In Bikini Bottom, Plankton steals the Krabby Patty formula and uses it to produce and sell Krabby Patties at his restaurant, the Chum Bucket, with the claim that Krabs bequeathed him the recipe. He sends a hitman named Dennis (Alec Baldwin) to pursue SpongeBob and Patrick. Squidward discovers the truth about Plankton stealing Neptune's crown and tries to alert Neptune. However, Plankton uses mind-controlling bucket helmets disguised as souvenirs to control Bikini Bottom's residents, including Squidward, and renames the city Planktopolis.Meanwhile, SpongeBob and Patrick encounter a dangerous trench, but Neptune's daughter Mindy (Scarlett Johansson) helps them past it by making them think she can make them into men. They are stopped by Dennis, who tries to crush them with his spiked boots, but he is in turn stepped on by a massive \\"cyclops\\" (really a diver) (Neil Ross). The \\"cyclops\\" grabs SpongeBob and Patrick, and goes to his beachside store, revealed to be Shell City. At the store, SpongeBob and Patrick find the crown, but are nearly killed in a lethal drying-out process with the heat lamp turned on. Their tears short-circuit the heat lamp, and its smoke activates the sprinkler system, reviving their bodies and the other dried sea creatures to be sold as souvenirs. As the sea creatures attack the diver, SpongeBob and Patrick take the crown and head for the beach. When they lose their way home, David Hasselhoff offers them a ride; Dennis catches up to them but is knocked by a catamaran back into the sea.Back at the Krusty Krab 2, Neptune arrives to execute Mr. Krabs. Just in time, SpongeBob and Patrick return with the crown and confront Plankton, who then drops a mind-control bucket on Neptune, enslaving him. SpongeBob performs the song \\"Goofy Goober Rock\\" (performed by Jim Wise) and, after transforming into an electric guitar-wielding wizard for the duration of the song, he frees Bikini Bottom's residents.

Diamond Dogs (1974), parts of which found him heading towards soul and funk, was the product of two distinct ideas: a musical based on a wild future in a post-apocalyptic city, and setting George Orwell's 1984 to music. The album went to number one in the UK, spawning the hits \\"Rebel Rebel\\" and \\"Diamond Dogs\\", and No. 5 in the US. To promote it, Bowie launched the Diamond Dogs Tour, visiting cities in North America between June and December 1974. Choreographed by Toni Basil, and lavishly produced with theatrical special effects, the high-budget stage production was filmed by Alan Yentob. The resulting documentary, Cracked Actor, featured a pasty and emaciated Bowie: the tour coincided with the singer's slide from heavy cocaine use into addiction, producing severe physical debilitation, paranoia, and emotional problems. He later commented that the accompanying live album, David Live, ought to have been titled \\"David Bowie Is Alive and Well and Living Only in Theory\\". David Live nevertheless solidified Bowie's status as a superstar, charting at No. 2 in the UK and No. 8 in the US. It also spawned a UK No. 10 hit in Bowie's cover of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock on Wood\\". After a break in Philadelphia, where Bowie recorded new material, the tour resumed with a new emphasis on soul. Matters came to a head in London in May in what became known as the \\"Victoria Station incident\\". Arriving in an open-top Mercedes convertible, Bowie waved to the crowd in a gesture that some alleged was a Nazi salute, which was captured on camera and published in NME. Bowie said the photographer caught him in mid-wave. He later blamed his pro-fascism comments and his behaviour during the period on his addictions and the character of the Thin White Duke. \\"I was out of my mind, totally crazed.

Article: \\"Teenager\\" is the new term being used in the UK to describe kids at either 8--12 or 10--13 years old. More and more companies are beginning to create products and services for teenagers. The Disney Company sells music and film to teenagers and their parents. You can get everything from lunchboxes and mobile phone covers, to monthly fan magazines and clothing. It's all about sales, which suggests that teenagers must have more money, freedom and influence upon their parents than they've ever had before. Most kids in the UK today get more pocket money than kids did ten years ago. Parents have more money to give their kids than before, since parents are having fewer children. In addition, the divorce rate in the UK is continually rising and parents spend less time with their children than they used to, so many parents try to please their children by buying them presents. It's a bad habit for both parents and kids to get into, but parents are under pressure from commercial marketing and the pleas of their children. UK kids today are very media and computer-literate. A lot of kids have a TV, if not a computer, in their bedrooms. They have easy access to much more information about life and the world. They may have experienced a lot in life as well, since 24% of UK kids live in single-parent families, so people now say that \\"kids are getting older younger\\". With such maturity at such a young age, it's no wonder teenagers are able to influence their parents and have more freedom than previous generations. UK teenagers never used to be worried about spending money on clothes. That's changed. Now, they are much more fashion conscious and concerned about their image . Many of them outgrow the bright colors and fashions of kids years ago and go for something darker and more rebellious . Surely none of the above is a good thing. The UK government is certainly concerned, and for that reason has strict laws preventing companies from marketing their products and services at children.

The original equation is -90*i + 17185 = 14665. Here are the steps to solve it: 1. Since -90*i is subtracted, first subtract 17185 from both sides of the equation to isolate the -90*i term. The result of this step is: -90*i + 17185 - 17185 = 14665 - 17185 It simplifies to: -90*i = -2520. 2. Now, to further isolate 'i', divide both sides of the equation by -90: -90*i / -90 = -2520 / -90 It simplifies to: i = 28.

The young son of one of the anglers falls into the water and something unseen drags him under the surface. Another angler prepares a flare gun but he slips and accidentally fires it into the deck, which is soaked with gasoline dropped earlier by the boy. The vessel bursts into flames and explodes; everybody aboard is killed. Jim Hill (McClure) and his wife Carol witness the explosion. Later, Jim and Carol's dog goes missing and the pair finds its dismembered corpse on the nearby beach. The following day, teenagers Jerry Potter (Meegan King) and Peggy Larson (Lynn Schiller) go for a swim at the beach. Jerry is abruptly pulled under the water. Peggy believes it is a prank until she discovers his mutilated corpse. Peggy screams and tries to reach the beach but a monstrous figure attacks her and drags onto the sand. The humanoid creature tears off her swimsuit and rapes her. That night, two more teenagers are camping on the same beach. Billy (David Strassman) is about to have sex with his girlfriend, Becky (Lisa Glaser) when another humanoid monster claws its way inside, kills him and chases Becky onto the beach. She outruns her assailant but then runs into the arms of yet another monster, which throws her to the sand and rapes her.

Process: - Cold water taken in through a hose to the bottom - Heating element heats water - Pump forces water up in pipes connected to spinning paddles - The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler - Water comes out of small holes in paddles - Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean - Water is drained through a filter - Filter collects particles of food - Water was so hot that it evaporates for dry dishes. Perturbation hypothesis: suppose the paddle is broken happens, how will it affect the water paddle is obstructed. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"Yes, if the paddle in the dishwasher is broken or obstructed, it will have a direct effect on the process. Here are the steps affected and the reasons: 1. The forced water makes paddles spin like a sprinkler: If the paddle is broken or obstructed, the water pressure may not be strong enough to spin the paddles, or the paddles may not spin at all. As a result, the water will not be distributed evenly across the dishes. 2. Water comes out of small holes in paddles: With a broken or obstructed paddle, the water may not flow out of the small holes properly. This can lead to uneven water distribution and poor cleaning performance. 3. Water is collected and used again until dishes are clean: If the paddle is not functioning correctly, the water may not be adequately circulated, leading to the dishwasher needing more time or more water to clean the dishes properly. 4. Water is drained through a filter: Although a broken or obstructed paddle may not directly affect this step, an indirect effect could occur due to larger food particles not being adequately loosened and removed from the dishes. This debris might cause the filter to become clogged faster than it should, impacting the water drainage process. The overall impact of a broken or obstructed paddle would lead to lower cleaning performance, increased water usage, and potentially faster clogging of filters. Therefore, it is important to address any issues with the paddle for optimal dishwasher function."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

We need to find the value of w. The equation is: -3289*w = 4542*w - 498*w + 80663 First, let's combine the w terms on the right side: 4542*w - 498*w = 4044*w (Because 4542 minus 498 is equal to 4044) Now the equation looks like: -3289*w = 4044*w + 80663 Next, we want to move all the w terms to one side. To do this, let's add 3289*w to both sides: -3289*w + 3289*w = 4044*w + 3289*w + 80663 This simplifies to: 0 = 7333*w + 80663 (Because -3289 plus 3289 is 0, and 4044 plus 3289 is 7333) Now, we need to get w by itself. So, let's subtract 80663 from both sides: -80663 = 7333*w Almost there! We now need to divide both sides by 7333 to find out what w is: -80663 / 7333 = w When we do the division, we'll find that: w ≈ -11 There we have it! w is approximately equal to -11.

Select the correct sentiment of the following review: STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning The American military has just launched a major new stealth fighter plane that can evade detection unlike any other. A renegade pilot (Steve Touissant) steals it and plots to hold the US government to ransom with it. So they are forced to send in their best man John Sands (Seagal, who else?) to stop him, in exchange for his freedom from a detention centre where his mind was to be wiped of all the incriminating information he's learned over the years. I skipped Attack Force because I could tell from the cover and all the post production tampering that had occurred that it would be crap and when all the negative reviews and low user rating came pouring in it just confirmed what I thought. But I decided to give FOF a go because Shadow Man (by the same director) wasn't bad and, what the hell, Seagal was my favourite action star once and maybe, just maybe, he could make a great film again. Oh what a fool I was. Dubbing, horrendous stock footage of aerial stealth fighter jets, awful camera work, cheap production values, risible, unconvincing fight scenes that have become Seagal's trademark and a boring, sleep inducing plot that doesn't go anywhere. Thankfully his next film, Once Upon a Time in the Hood (which I'll be skipping), apparently marks the end of his contract with Sony, meaning no more of these awful European lensed action films and his next film Prince of Pistols might mark a return to theatres.

A:","completion":"A G crochet hook size can vary slightly depending on the manufacturer and the country in which it is made. However, it typically falls within two common measurements: 1. G-6 or 4.00mm: This size G crochet hook is most commonly known as G-6 and measures 4.00mm in diameter. It is a standard size used by various yarn manufacturers and patterns from around the world. 2. G-7 or 4.50mm: On the other hand, some crochet hooks are labeled G-7 and measure 4.50mm in diameter. This size is also relatively common and can be found in various patterns and yarn labels. However, it is essential to note that this size is closer to a 7 hook in the UK and Canada. When using a G crochet hook, it is crucial to pay attention to the exact hook size indicated in the pattern or yarn label you are following. Since there can be some variation between G-6 and G-7, using the wrong size might affect your finished project's gauge and overall dimensions. In summary, a G crochet hook usually measures either 4.00mm (G-6) or 4.50mm (G-7) depending on the manufacturer and country of origin. Always ensure you are using the correct hook size specified in your crochet pattern or yarn label to achieve the desired result."},{"prompt":"Given the question: I am trying to decide whether it's worth it to invest in this film proposal.

Scott Freeman, meanwhile, is a New Mexican businessman flying his private Beechcraft Baron to an urgent sales meeting in Boise, Idaho. However, an occluded front has the entire West Coast socked in, with Los Angeles reporting zero visibility. Columbia 409 and Freeman's Beechcraft are both diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport. Salt Lake air traffic control assigns Columbia 409 to land ahead of Freeman's Beechcraft. As Columbia 409 is about to start its descent, First Officer Urias unlocks himself from his seat to check out a vibration. Just then, Freeman suffers a massive heart attack and descends into the approach of Columbia 409. The Beechcraft impacts Columbia 409 just above the co-pilot seat, blowing Urias out of the plane to his death and killing Flight Engineer Julio. Captain Stacy is struck in the face by debris and is blinded. Nancy Pryor, the First Stewardess, rushes to the flight deck, where Captain Stacy is able to engage the autopilot and the altitude hold switch before losing consciousness. Pryor informs the Salt Lake control tower that the crew is dead or badly injured and that there is no one to fly the plane. She gives an assessment of the damage as a large hole on the right side of the flight deck that wiped out most of the instrument gauges over the engineer station. Joe Patroni, Columbia's Vice President of Operations, is apprised of Columbia 409's situation. He seeks the advice of Captain Al Murdock, Columbia's chief flight instructor, who also happens to be Nancy Pryor's boyfriend, even though their relationship was \\"on the rocks\\" at that time.

Translate this to English?","completion":"Structural reforms to support productivity will also be crucial for ensuring Europe's economic recovery and the survival of its social model. In detail, economic recovery in Europe faces several challenges, and one of the most critical aspects is increasing productivity. Structural reforms are essential for achieving this goal, as they aim to improve the efficiency of the economy and unlock potential growth. These reforms encompass various measures, including labor market changes, tax system improvements, and enhancements to the overall framework of business regulations. First, labor market reforms can contribute to productivity improvements by creating a more flexible and competitive environment. This would involve policies that promote entrepreneurship, encourage the participation of women and young people, address the skills gap, and provide a level playing field for all. The reforms should also facilitate labor mobility and adaptability, enabling businesses to respond to shifts in demand and technology. Second, tax system improvements are necessary to boost productivity. By simplifying tax compliance and lowering the tax burden for businesses, governments can foster an environment more conducive to investment and development. Additionally, a more efficient tax system should also promote growth, create jobs, and reduce income inequality. This, in turn, will contribute to a more vibrant and robust European economy. Third, enhancing the overall business regulatory framework will lead to increased productivity. By creating a more business-friendly environment, governments can reduce bureaucratic barriers, cut red tape, and encourage innovation. This would involve streamlining the process for starting a new business, introducing effective competition policies, and ensuring that businesses have access to affordable and reliable infrastructure. These structural reforms to support productivity will be vital in not only ensuring Europe's economic recovery but also preserving its social model. The European social model is characterized by a commitment to social cohesion, inclusion, and equal opportunities for all citizens. By promoting economic growth and improving productivity, these reforms would help to secure the future of the European social model by generating the resources necessary to maintain its unique mix of social welfare and protection. In conclusion, to achieve economic recovery and safeguard the social model in Europe, structural reforms focused on supporting productivity are of utmost importance. Successful implementation of these reforms will create a more resilient and competitive European economy, providing a foundation for long-term growth and stability in a rapidly changing world."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please answer the following question: Mr. Zhang was a sports fan. He worked in a hospital in the capital. He was busy all the time and had little time to have a rest. And one day he felt unwell and couldn't go on working. He decided to spend a week's holiday in a quiet village where he could go swimming or fishing. He got off at a small railway station and soon got to a quiet village. He took a room hotel and went to sleep as soon as he had a good meal. At first Mr. Zhang enjoyed himself there. He could do everything he wanted and went wherever he liked. Nobody disturbed him and knocked at the door at midnight. But on the fourth day he was in trouble. After lunch it was very hot. He went swimming in the river. Suddenly he saw a beautiful bird in a big tree. He wanted to catch it, so he walked to it, but it found him and flew away ans soon as gone. He began to pick some flowers in the forest and before long he lost his way. The sun had gone down and night had fallen before Mr. Zhang found a small restaurant in another village. He came in and told them to bring him some bread, two eggs and a glass of tea. After a while his food was brought. Soon he ate up all the bread and eggs. When he was going to have the tea, he found there was a fly in the glass. \\" What's in my tea?\\" Mr. Zhang called out, \\" A fly\\" \\" It's impossible, sir.\\" said the owner of the restaurant, \\" I had told them to pick all the flies out of your tea before they brought it to you!\\" Mr. Zhang didn't enjoy himself in the village, did he? A) No, he wasn't. B) Yes, he was C) No, he didn't D) Yes, he did. Answer:","completion":"C) No, he didn't. Mr. Zhang did not enjoy himself in the village as he initially anticipated. While he did get to spend a few days doing activities he enjoyed, his relaxation was short-lived. On the fourth day, he encountered a series of mishaps that hampered his enjoyment. First, after going swimming in the river to escape the heat, he tried to catch a beautiful bird he spotted in a big tree. Unfortunately, the bird noticed him and flew away before he could get close. Then, as he started picking flowers in the forest, he ended up losing his way, resulting in an extended and anxiety-inducing period before he could figure out where he was. Eventually, Mr. Zhang stumbled upon a small restaurant in another village, where he ordered a simple meal of bread, eggs, and tea. However, his misfortune continued when he discovered a fly in his glass of tea. The restaurant owner's unhelpful response that he had instructed his staff to remove flies from the tea only added to Mr. Zhang's discontent. Given these events and his overall experience, Mr. Zhang clearly did not enjoy himself in the village."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Please answer the following question: If chemical energy converted to light energy requires batteries, then what is required so that chemical energy may be converted to light energy? Answer choices: - electrically - batteries - cords - sunlight - Energy. - energy - Evaporation - plastic A:","completion":"The conversion of chemical energy to light energy generally involves a process known as chemiluminescence. This process does not necessarily require batteries, cords, or any of the other options provided. Instead, it requires specific chemical reactions that directly result in the production of light. Chemiluminescent reactions typically involve two different chemicals: a chemiluminescent substrate and an oxidizing agent. Chemiluminescent substrates, or luminophores, can absorb energy from a chemical reaction and then release that energy in the form of light. One common example of a chemiluminescent substrate is the molecule luciferin, found in fireflies. The oxidation of luciferin by the enzyme luciferase produces an excited-state molecule that emits light upon returning to its ground state. The color and intensity of the light produced vary depending on the specific substrate and the precise conditions of the reaction. Oxidizing agents are essential to drive the chemiluminescent reaction. These substances promote the oxidation of the chemiluminescent substrate, allowing the reaction to proceed and the substrate to emit light. Many chemiluminescent reactions involve the participation of reactive oxygen species, such as hydrogen peroxide, as oxidizing agents. In the case of fireflies, molecular oxygen (O2) is the oxidizing agent responsible for the breakdown of luciferin, leading to light emission. In specific cases, light energy may be produced without the need for any additional hardware, such as batteries, cords, or solar panels. Instead, specific chemical compounds interact in such a way that they release energy in the form of photons (light). However, if the goal is to create a useful device or a practical system that can store and release chemical energy to produce light, it may be necessary to incorporate additional components, such as batteries or external power sources. These components may be used to initiate the chemical reactions or maintain the right conditions for the reactions to occur. In conclusion, the conversion of chemical energy to light energy primarily requires a chemiluminescent substrate and an oxidizing agent, rather than any of the specific answer choices provided. These two components interact in a chemical reaction that releases energy in the form of light. Depending on the desired practical application of this process, additional components such as batteries or external power sources may be required for initiating or sustaining the chemiluminescent reaction."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Minke whales are just like their siblings, the when you see their big bodies and the water shooting from their blowholes. They love to swim around, dive into the waters, and play with their fish friends. One day, as Mr. Minke Whale was swimming along, he sadly got very, very sick. We don't know why he got sick, but sometimes it just happens to whales. Sometimes it's because of things they eat or the water they live in. Because he was so tired and feeling so bad, he couldn't stay in the water, swimming with his friends anymore. Instead, Mr. Minke Whale floated up to the surface of the water and soon washed up on the Norfolk coast, which is a big place with lots of sandy beaches where people like to visit. It's beautiful and peaceful there, but it's not where a whale should be. Whales should be in the ocean. When the people who live in Norfolk saw Mr. Minke Whale on their beach, they felt so sad. They knew that whales are important creatures that should be in the ocean feeling happy and healthy. But Mr. Minke Whale was not, and he had passed away on the beach because he was so sick. The people in Norfolk, who take care of the beaches and the area, are called council workers. They decided that they needed to move Mr. Minke Whale's big body from the beach so that other animals and people could still enjoy the beautiful sandy shore. So, the council workers put on their work clothes and gloves and began working together to move Mr. Minke Whale. They did this with so much love and care, because they know how important whales are to our world and the environment. They wanted to make sure that Mr. Minke Whale's body was taken care of in the best way possible. And while it might be a sad story that Mr. Minke Whale got sick and ended up on the Norfolk beach, it's important to remember how much beauty and joy whales like Mr. Minke bring to our world. They remind us how fantastic and wonderful the ocean is, and how we should always work together to protect it and all the creatures that live there. The end."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article: A huge cloud of dust rose and an overpass disappeared. This was the scene in Zhuzhou,Hunan Province on May 17.Nine people were killed and 16 injured. Things were similar last year in the Sichuan earthquake. Thousands of people were buried in the ruins and lost their lives. What if we could have warned them? People are always _ to find a way of preventing buildings' collapse. Better materials and technology help,but they are not a solution. Just like humans,a building has its own life cycle from \\"birth\\" to \\"death\\".If we know when a building is going to collapse,we can repair it in advance or get out of it before it falls. Now,scientists at the University of Illinois have developed a material that turns red before it breaks. The invention could be used in things like climbing ropes or bridge supports. The research was led by Nancy Sottos,a professor at the university's Beckman Institute,and Douglas Davis,a graduate research assistant. The secret behind the colorchanging material is a type of molecule .A molecule is a group of atoms held together by chemical bonds. Imagine you and your friends standing in a circle,holding hands. Each person stands for one atom,your hands represent the bonds,and the entire circle represents a molecule. If one person lets go of his or her hands,the molecule changes color. The research team put the molecule into a soft material. When the researchers stretched the material,it turned bright red for a few seconds before it broke into two pieces. When they repeatedly stretched and relaxed the material,without breaking it,it only turned a little red. The major problem is that light can get rid of the red color. When the team shone bright light on the molecule,the broken bond was fixed,and the color disappeared. If the bright light keeps the red color from appearing,the material's warning system will be useless. Scientists still have a lot of work to do before the colorchanging molecules can be used outside the lab. Question: Which of the following is a WRONG statement? Options: A: Thousands of people died from the collapse of buildings in the Sichuan earthquake because they hadn't been warned. B: There is no building that will never collapse.

Challenge yourself to only buy things that you need and that you will use. Before you make a purchase, ask yourself: \\"Do I need this? Will I use this?\\" Not all indulgences are bad – but a big part of living green is being aware of how your choices impact the world around you. Try to buy products that minimize plastic wrap. As a general rule: if a piece of plastic is flimsy and does not hold its shape, then it almost certainly cannot be recycled at your local center. Buy food in bulk! Look for a local wholesale grocery store that features bulk food bins. You can purchase grains, flours, nuts, fruits, vegetables, and other staples by the pound, no plastic packaging necessary. Bring your own canvas bag when you go shopping. If you have the choice between \\"paper or plastic\\": choose paper. Use reusable baskets, bins, and cardboard boxes to carry bulk purchases. Try storing food in jars or Tupperware containers. Wash out plastic bags and reuse them. Drink tap water, not bottled water! It is cheap, and it is safe. When you do need to purchase goods, try to be a discerning consumer. Avoid spending your money on products that you know have been manufactured using unethical practices. Look for organic, free-range, humane, local products. Try to buy food that is in season, rather than food that has been frozen for months or shipped halfway around the globe to your local supermarket. Buy local, when possible. It takes a lot of money and fossil fuels to transport goods around the world. Supporting farmers and craftspeople in your area can be a great way to reduce your carbon footprint. Buy recycled products, when possible. If you must buy paper and plastic, then buy recycled paper and recycled plastic products. Read the labels on the products that you buy. Make sure that the chemicals hidden in these things will not leach into the environment during or after use, harming humans, animals, and ecosystems. Avoid industrial-strength cleaning products. Make sure to safely dispose of chemical products. anything that you can. Find creative ways to reuse paper, styrofoam, old CDs and DVDs, empty water bottles – any consumer product that is not toxic or completely unusable after its intended single use. Try to break out of the self-perpetuating cycle of \\"use and dispose.\\" Refill glass and plastic water bottles. Clean out food-packaging jars and use them for drinking or storage. Use rechargeable batteries. It's hard to safely dispose of traditional batteries, and they are not designed with reuse in mind. Rechargeable batteries can dramatically increase the time between battery purchases! what you can't reuse. Learn what you can and cannot recycle. In general, you can recycle all paper products, some metal products (aluminum, tin, steel,) some plastic products, and most glass. Try to make it a practice, but be aware of the limitations. Every area is different, so make sure that you understand which municipal recycling options are available to you. Recyclable items need to be clean and free of food residue, especially paper products. If you have mixed material recycling, the residue on glass and aluminum can contaminate paper products.

The busiest acquirer you haven’t heard of FORTUNE — When you think about voracious corporate acquirers, it’s probably a tech giant like Cisco CSCO or Yahoo YHOO . But neither of them can hold a candle to a privately-held insurance upstart named Confie Seguros, which has acquired a whopping 55 companies since being founded in 2007. If you haven’t heard heard of Confie Seguros, you probably will soon. The company is now generating more than 200 million in annual revenue and employees more than 2,000 people in nine states. It also plans to begin to begin expanding beyond its original mandate to focus on Hispanic customers, into a national personal lines broker. The Buena Park, Calif.-based company was originally formed by private equity firm Genstar Capital, which saw a big consolidation opportunity within a fragmented Hispanic-focused market that was dominated by small mom-and-pop shops. Genstar committed an initial 75 million — bolstered by an additional 200 million bank facility — and Confie Seguros was launched via the acquisition of a Southern California auto insurance business called Westline. It then went on to acquire another 43 companies before being sold by Genstar to ABRY Partners last November. Basically a hub-and-spoke model, with each addition expected to increase market share by leveraging the broader company. Since being acquired by ABRY, Confie Seguros has been in overdrive. Twelve new acquisitions, nine signed letters of intent and a pipeline of ten more LOIs that the company plans to have signed by year-end. It also is expecting to enter five new states over the next 12 months. Confie Seguros co-founder Mordy Rothberg explains that the acquisition pace has been enabled by three things: (1) Continued market fragmentation in areas where Confie Seguros has not yet entered; (2) The continuing reality that Hispanics are underserved when it comes to financial services; and (3) Its private equity ownership. “I would pick partnering with private equity any day of the week rather than going public,” he explains. “We’re able to have a longer-term approach and don’t need to spend management’s time speaking with a large group of investors.” Sign up for Dan’s daily email newsletter on deals and deal-makers: GetTermSheet.com What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Confie Seguros is a company that helps people with their insurance needs.

The suspect, employed by the University of Florida, has been placed on administrative leave with pay as investigators continue to delve deeper into the allegations. (Step 1: Open with an engaging and informative introduction that summarizes the main event.) Body: The FBI's involvement in the case indicates the seriousness of the allegations against Professor Anghaie. As a faculty member of the University of Florida, Anghaie allegedly siphoned off funds meant for research work financed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). (Step 2: Elaborate on the event, providing more context regarding the professor and the nature of the allegations.) According to investigators, Anghaie, along with his family, used these illicit funds for their own personal gain rather than for the research activities for which they were intended. Authorities are currently probing into the details of the alleged fraudulent activities, which, if proven, could lead to severe penalties for all those involved. (Step 3: Explain the role of the family in the case and emphasize the potential consequences of such actions.) Since the investigation is ongoing, the University of Florida has taken immediate action, placing the accused Professor Anghaie on administrative leave with pay. A spokesperson for the university has stated that they are fully cooperating with the federal authorities in the investigation and are committed to ensuring the highest standards of integrity and accountability within their institution. (Step 4: Mention the response from the University of Florida and emphasize their cooperation in the investigation.) Conclusion: The FBI's raid on the office of Professor Samim Anghaie is a significant step in investigating and curbing instances of financial misappropriation in academic institutions. It serves as a stark reminder of the need for transparency and accountability in research funding, as well as the zero-tolerance policies enforced by federal authorities to protect taxpayer dollars. As the investigation unfolds, the university community and public will be closely monitoring the outcome of this case, which may have lasting implications on appropriate conduct in academic circles.

The Seahawks cut the lead with kicker Olindo Mare nailing a 22-yard field goal, but the Rams increased their lead when kicker Josh Brown made a 30-yard field goal, followed in the 3rd quarter by Bradford completing a 21-yard TD pass to RB Kenneth Darby. Then Josh Brown made a 31-yard field goal. With the victory, the Rams improved to 2-2, thus successfully improving on their previous season. The win also snapped a 10-game regular season losing streak to the Seahawks. How many yards longer was Sam Bradford's second touchdown pass compared to his first?","completion":"In the game described, Sam Bradford completed a 15-yard touchdown pass for his first TD pass and a 21-yard touchdown pass for his second TD pass. To determine the difference in yards between these two passes, subtract the yards of the first pass from the yards of the second pass: 21 yards (second TD pass) - 15 yards (first TD pass) = 6 yards Sam Bradford's second touchdown pass was 6 yards longer than his first touchdown pass."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

News article: Domestic Drilling Advocates Warn Of Increased Global Demand For Oil, Dwindling Supply All over the world, more people are buying cars and using gas as growth in the global economy increases the demand for fuel. Likewise, oil supplies are projected to get tighter and tighter. \\"China was at 5 million barrels a day in 2005. Today, they are at 10 (million). By 2015, they are going to be at 15-million-barrels-a-day demand,\\" said John Hofmeister, former president of Shell Oil and founder of Citizens for Affordable Energy. \\"That's 10 million new barrels over 10 years. India is going from 4 to 7 (million) in the next three to four years.\\" President Obama recognizes the coming explosion in demand. \\"China and India, they're growing. China added 10 million cars in 2010 -- 10 million cars just in this one country,\\" Obama said last week. \\"And they're just going to keep on going, which means they're going to use more and more oil.\\" The president, however, argues that more drilling is not the way to protect the U.S. Instead, he wants to wean the U.S. off oil by turning to alternatives, such as electric cars. \\"If we want to stabilize energy prices for the long term and the medium term, if we want America to grow, we're going to have look past what we've been doing and put ourselves on the path to a real, sustainable energy future,\\" he said. The problem is, most analysts say, the transition to alternatives takes far longer than more drilling would. \\"And we have a capital stock of hundreds of million of vehicles,\\" Guy Caruso of the Center for Strategic and International Studies said. \\"So these types of transformations take decades and maybe even 50 to 60 years.\\" Though the president talks about drilling, official government figures show he is issuing far fewer permits on federal land than his predecessor. At the end of the Bush years, 6,000 to 7,000 permits a year were issued, but under Obama the numbers have dropped significantly to a range of 4,000 to almost 4,500 a year. Since it can take seven to 10 years for a permit to turn into a producing well, that means less oil coming off federal lands in the years to come, even as global demand is rising. Advocates of more domestic drilling say we know a crunch is coming, so we should be drilling more now -- otherwise, the result could be ugly. \\"The reality of the situation, with respect to global supply is that Americans can find themselves in gasoline lines, with gas rationing by 2015 or 2016 by us not producing more of our own oil,\\" Hofmeister said. Even with alternatives, the Energy Department predicts that in 2035 we'll still be relying on oil for 83 percent of our transportation needs. What are the most important parts of this news article?","completion":"The most important parts of this news article are: 1. Global demand for oil is increasing due to economic growth and increased car ownership, especially in countries like China and India. 2. Oil supplies are projected to become tighter as demand grows. 3. Former Shell Oil President John Hofmeister warns of the potential for gasoline lines and rationing by 2015-2016 if the U.S. does not produce more domestic oil. 4. President Obama advocates for transitioning to alternative energy sources, such as electric cars, to reduce reliance on oil, rather than increasing domestic drilling. 5. Analysts argue that transitioning to alternatives takes much longer than increasing drilling efforts. 6. Official government figures show a decrease in permits for drilling on federal land under Obama's administration compared to his predecessor's. 7.

Movie title: The First Grader Movie plot: In 2003, a disc jockey announces over a Kenyan radio station that the government is offering free primary school education to all natives who can prove citizenship with a birth certificate. Kimani Maruge (Litondo), an 84-year-old villager, hears this and decides to take it upon himself to seek an education. Arriving at his local school, he meets Jane Obinchu (Harris), the principal and teacher. He expresses his desire to learn how to read. Her teaching colleague Alfred (Munyua), ridicules him and demands he leave. Later, Jane informs her husband Charles (Kgoroge) about Maruge. He discourages her in supporting his educational endeavor. After beginning his initial classes, Maruge is plagued by memories of his service during the Mau Mau Uprising against the British in the 1950s. He begins to hallucinate and becomes confrontational with the students, struggling to continue his academics. Controversy begins to stir over Marugeâs education. Soon enough, the story that an elderly man going to school becomes national headlines. Mr. Kipruto (Kunene), a superintendent of the school district, is alerted to the situation and strongly disapproves of Maruge's predicament and suggests that he go to an adult educational facility. Meeting with the head of the education board to plead Marugeâs case, Jane is overruled. It is explained to her that if an exception is made to keep Maruge in the school, others will follow, and many schools will eventually become filled with older people sitting aside children. Maruge is forced to attend an adult learning centre, where he soon finds himself surrounded by people with no motivation or ambition to study. Maruge vows to never go back to the adult institution. Jane later decides to offer him a reprieve, to work as her teaching assistant. As Maruge's story gains publicity and attention, the local press descend on the school, causing friction among the parents. The villagers believe Jane and Maruge are seeking fame and fortune at the expense of the children. Following negative feedback...","completion":"Maruge is in the Guinness Book of World Records for being the oldest person to start primary school at the age of 84. This record was achieved when he decided to take advantage of the Kenyan government's offer of free primary education and enroll in a local school to learn how to read.

When standing next to Kenneth, Aaron was ashamed of their upper body because","completion":"Kenneth had always been the epitome of physical fitness. He stood tall with broad shoulders, chiseled chest, and impressive biceps. On the other hand, Aaron had always been what could be described as scrawny or skinny. Over the years, he had tried to maintain a regular workout routine, but it was always difficult for him to gain muscle mass and build an impressive upper body. Ever since they were kids, Aaron and Kenneth had a friendly rivalry. Both of them loved sports and outdoor activities, but it was apparent from early on that Kenneth had the advantage when it came to physical abilities. Aaron would often struggle to keep up with Kenneth, but his determination never wavered. Growing up, Aaron always reminded himself that any physical differences between him and Kenneth didn't matter. They were friends, and what truly mattered was their camaraderie and the memories they shared. However, as they entered adulthood, that feeling became harder to maintain. Society seemed to place a greater emphasis on physical appearance and strength, and Aaron couldn't escape the feeling that his lack of an impressive upper body was holding him back. When they attended social gatherings, Aaron noticed that people admired Kenneth for his athletic build. They would approach him to ask about his workout routine or compliment him on his well-toned body. In contrast, Aaron often felt ignored or overlooked. He started to question if he was truly content with his physique. One day, Aaron finally mustered the courage to discuss his insecurities with Kenneth. Kenneth, ever the understanding friend, offered to help Aaron achieve the upper body he had always desired. They agreed to work together to find a personalized workout routine that would help Aaron gradually build muscle and gain confidence in his appearance. They spent hours researching exercises and discussing nutrition. Armed with this newfound knowledge, Aaron began a strict schedule of strength training and proper dieting. With Kenneth by his side, he felt motivated and determined to improve. As the months passed, Aaron started to see progress. His chest began to fill out, his shoulders broadened, and his arms slowly transformed from skinny limbs to toned guns. The transformation was slow and steady, but every day Aaron felt stronger and more confident. Kenneth, on the other hand, was proud to see his friend's determination pay off and offered nothing but encouragement along the way. They continued to exercise together, forging an even stronger bond through their shared experiences at the gym. People began to notice Aaron's improved physique and complimented him on his progress. For the first time in his life, Aaron felt like he could stand proudly next to Kenneth without feeling inferior. This journey taught Aaron two valuable lessons. First, that he should not let the opinions of others define his self-worth. And second, that every individual is capable of achieving their goals if they set their mind to it and surround themselves with positive influences and supportive people. In the end, Aaron realized that his self-consciousness stemmed not from their upper bodies' physical differences, but from his own perceptions of inadequacy. As he stood next to Kenneth, feeling more confident and less ashamed, Aaron knew it wasn't just the muscles on his body that had grown, but his mind and spirit as well."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

It was Djokovic's first match since his defeat in the French Open quarter-finals earlier in the month as he continues his preparations for Wimbledon, which starts on 3 July. He will face either Donald Young or his fellow American Jarden Donaldson in the third round. The match was scheduled for Tuesday but only nine minutes of play was possible on Centre Court before rain led to play being cancelled for the day. Djokovic, playing in his first pre-Wimbledon grass-court tournament for seven years, said prior to the match that this year had been his toughest in tennis. Although he was not as his best against Pospisil, the first seed found his rhythm as the match progressed, with his service game looking strong. He struggled for direction with his backhand but controlled play across the court, particularly through his powerful forehand. Pospisil played aggressively but failed to build on Djokovic's second serve, eventually throwing his racquet away in annoyance as he failed to break Djokovic, who went on to serve out the match. The 12-time Grand Slam champion has now won 25 of his 32 matches this year. \\"Don't underestimate, this is a beautiful Centre Court and I enjoyed every minute of it,\\" Djokovic told Eurosport. \\"I will keep going.

After several months of negotiations, the government of the Duke of Newcastle decided to send an army expedition the following year to dislodge the French. They chose Major General Edward Braddock to lead the expedition. Word of the British military plans leaked to France well before Braddock's departure for North America. In response, King Louis XV dispatched six regiments to New France under the command of Baron Dieskau in 1755. The British sent out their fleet in February 1755, intending to blockade French ports, but the French fleet had already sailed. Admiral Edward Hawke detached a fast squadron to North America in an attempt to intercept them. In a second British action, Admiral Edward Boscawen fired on the French ship Alcide on June 8, 1755, capturing her and two troop ships. The British harassed French shipping throughout 1755, seizing ships and capturing seamen. These actions contributed to the eventual formal declarations of war in spring 1756.

Article: A father is suing Facebook after his 12-year-old daughter posted “sexually explicit” photos on the social network. His main argument is that Facebook does not properly enforce its own policy for requiring users of the social network to be at least 13 years old. The writ alleges that Facebook is “guilty of negligence” and creates “a risk of sexual and physical harm” to the child. I contacted Facebook for a statement, and the answer I received back was much more detailed than usual (read it in full below). Facebook obviously does not agree that it should be held accountable. The company insists that anyone who is concerned about an underage person on Facebook should report them by using the form provided, and it will remove them. Of course, the father in question did that, but his daughter, who reportedly has behavioral problems, simply created another account and continued uploading photos. The father is seeking an injunction not only ordering Facebook to close down his daughter’s account but to stop her from opening another one. If that doesn’t happen, he wants to see Facebook stop operations in Northern Ireland. Facebook, for its part, says it uses back-end end technology to try and prevent underage users from signing up again. Palo Alto would not elaborate how this system worked. It did note, however, that recent reports show it is difficult is to implement age restrictions on the Internet and that there is no single solution to ensuring younger children don’t circumvent a system or lie about their age. Instead of implementing a strict system for age verification (the father’s lawyer suggested using a passport number), Facebook says it prefers to educate its users about safety instead. Facebook would have arguably not grown very quickly if signing up for the social network was a long process. Palo Alto cites safety experts who say communication between parents and their kids about their use of the Internet is vital. The company points to recent updates to its safety and security offerings, including the Family Safety Center and social reporting tool (Photo Gallery). The social networking giant also notes it works with charity partners such as Family Online Safety Institute (FOSI) and law enforcement agencies across the world. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) mandates that websites that collect information about users aren’t allowed to sign on anyone under the age of 13. As a result, Facebook’s Statement of Rights and Responsibilities require users of the social network to be at least 13 years old (and even older, in some jurisdictions). Millions of preteens use the service anyway: some get permission from their parents to create an account while others lie about their age to get past sign-up restrictions. Four months ago, it was estimated that 7.5 million Facebook users are below the minimum age. To make matters even more worrying, more than 5 million were 10-years-old or younger. The full statement Facebook sent me is below: Anyone who is concerned about an underage person on Facebook should report them to us using the form provided and we will remove them. Facebook is currently designed for two age groups (13-17 year olds and 18 and up), and we provide extensive safety and privacy controls based on the age provided. If someone reports an underage account to use then we will remove it, and use back-end end technology to try and prevent them signing up again. However, recent reports have highlighted just how difficult it is to implement age restrictions on the Internet and that there is no single solution to ensuring younger children don’t circumvent a system or lie about their age. We invest heavily in educating people how to stay safe on Facebook both via our Family Safety Center and by working with charity partners such as FOSI (Family Online Safety Institute). We have good working relationships with law enforcement agencies across the world, including CEOP in the UK, and employ world class technology to help keep bad people and content off the site. However, we agree with safety experts that communication between parents/guardians and kids about their use of the Internet is vital. We believe that services such as Facebook have a role to play in encouraging this: the recent announcements around social reporting and our safety center are testimonies to our ongoing efforts in ensuring we are giving detailed and helpful advice to help support these conversations. Just as parents are always teaching and reminding kids how to cross the road safely, talking about internet safety should be just as important a lesson to learn.

The distraught father has claimed his daughter has been put at risk from paedophiles as a result of the publication of the images. Facebook, the world's largest social networking site, has 730 million users around the world. If the case is successful, the global brand worth an estimated €20bn would be facing a huge payout. Hilary Carmichael, the solicitor acting for the father, told the Herald that Facebook does not have any checks in place to ensure children are over the permitted age, 13, when they open an account. Harm \\"I was able to access this girl's Facebook page myself before we issued the writ. She has more than 485 friends ... some from the western provinces of Nigeria,\\" she revealed. The writ lodged in Belfast High Court alleges the company is \\"guilty of negligence\\" and has created \\"a risk of sexual and physical harm\\" to the child. It claims the girl has received sexually explicit text messages from adult men and that men asked her to post images of herself online. The girl, who is from Co Antrim, cannot be identified for legal reasons. It is believed she posted the provocative material on the site herself. She even revealed personal details like where she lived, the name of her school and areas where she hangs out. The girl suffers from behaviour problems and is in a voluntary care institution. Mother-of-three Ms Car-michael told the Herald she has come across similar Facebook pages of children who live in the Republic of Ireland and she warned parents to be vigilant. \\"We've had parents who've been in contact with us whose children live in the Republic and operate Facebook pages in the Republic. \\"If they have any concerns, they should shut it down straight away,\\" the Derry solicitor said. She added that it is easy to pin down the location of a child by following posts on the site. \\"A lot of children are innocent and they don't know the dangers. \\"That's why they shouldn't be allowed Facebook pages -- they're too young,\\" said Ms Carmichael who has launched the childrenonfacebook.com site to warn parents about the risks. The High Court writ was served on the US company today. ADULTS Among the 12-year-old girl's Facebook 'friends' are adults in Ireland, Britain and elsewhere. The girl's father has said he is \\"worried sick\\" thinking about the danger she could be in, adding his concern is she would go off with someone she met on the social networking site. \\"There was another photo of my daughter lifting up her top but that has been removed,\\" the man said. Facebook, whose international headquarters are located in Dublin said it is committed to removing inappropriate and indecent photos once a complaint has been made. It is the latest court action to hit the company. A recent case involved businessman and racehorse owner JP McManus who had sought an injunction to force Facebook to shut down accounts claiming to be him. The action was struck out in May after lawyers for the company took down the profiles. See Page 14 |||||Summary:","completion":"A father is upset with Facebook because his 12-year-old daughter put some not-so-nice photos of herself on the website. He says that Facebook should make sure no kids younger than 13 years old can use it, because that's what they promised.

After his accession to the throne in 1820, King George IV continued the renovation with the idea in mind of a small, comfortable home. While the work was in progress, in 1826, the King decided to modify the house into a palace with the help of his architect John Nash. Some furnishings were transferred from Carlton House, and others had been bought in France after the French Revolution. The external façade was designed keeping in mind the French neo-classical influence preferred by George IV. The cost of the renovations grew dramatically, and by 1829 the extravagance of Nash's designs resulted in his removal as architect. On the death of George IV in 1830, his younger brother King William IV hired Edward Blore to finish the work.

While performing the task think step-by-step and justify your steps. It was the moment millions of Broadchurch fans had waited almost two years for. But the much-anticipated return of the ITV crime drama left many baffled – and not just by the plot. Some who tuned in for the start of the second series on Monday night complained they struggled to understand actor David Tennant’s Scottish accent to the extent that they were forced to turn on the TV subtitles. Scroll down for video. Viewers complained about David Tennant mumbling during the second series of Broadchurch on ITV last night and said they had to use subtitles on their televisions to understand the actor who plays DI Alec Hardy. And first-time viewers were left baffled by the complex storyline as producers did not begin with a summary of what had happened in the first series – which ended in April 2013 – even though the new series picks up where that left off. While the opening episode, which had an audience of 7.2million, drew widespread praise and was quickly being talked about on Twitter, many viewers said they had difficulty deciphering some of the dialogue. One wrote: ‘Still couldn’t understand a word they were saying in Broadchurch tonight – I need someone to translate the heavily accented mumbling.’ Another added: ‘Challenge: try to watch Broadchurch without subtitles. FAILED.’ Others singled out Tennant, who plays dour Detective Inspector Alec Hardy, saying: ‘David Tennant needs subtitles, with that accent don’t understand a word he says.’ Many viewers complained about having to use subtitles to understand Tennant's mumbling on the show. Tennant and Coleman, who plays DS Ellie Miller, were in court as DS Miller's husband denied murder. This is not the first time Tennant’s voice has caused problems. He also starred in Gracepoint, the US remake of Broadchurch, with his American accent failing to impress both critics and audiences. On Monday night, many Broadchurch viewers were left scratching their heads – and not in the way the programme makers intended. Fans said the show was confusing and complained that there had been no recap of the first series at the start. This left new viewers lost, while many who were avid watchers of the old series nearly two years ago were unable to remember the details needed to follow the plot. One tweeted: ‘May as well have not watched the last series of Broadchurch, not a clue who’s who or what’s happening.’ Viewers complained about the accents of many of the cast members as well as the loud background noise. Joe Miller pleaded not guilty to the murder of Danny Latimer, 11, despite his confession in the last show. Another added: ‘Anyone else watching Broadchurch and can’t remember who everyone is or what went on last series?’ One Broadchurch mystery was instantly seized on by the gloomy drama’s more light-hearted fans – why are there so many former Doctor Who stars in the cast? They pointed out that seven had previously appeared in the BBC sci-fi series. David Tennant played The Doctor for five years while Arthur Darvill – the Rev Paul Coates in Broadchurch – had a long-running role as one of the time-traveller’s companions. Olivia Colman has been a guest star, as has Jonathan Bailey, who plays journalist Olly Stevens in the ITV drama. Three others in the new series appeared in Doctor Who, including Eve Myles, who was also in the spin-off, Torchwood. Many fans used social media to highlight this crossover. One wrote: ‘Do Broadchurch only cast actors who’ve appeared in Doctor Who/Doctor Who spin-offs?’ Another added: ‘Broadchurch, where Dr Who actors go on leaving the Tardis, apparently.’ Others joked that Broadchurch had become a ‘retirement home’ for Doctor Who stars and wrote ‘I reckon Dr Who did it’. The first series, set in a fictional Dorset seaside town, involved the hunt for the killer of 11-year-old Danny Latimer. Detective Sergeant Ellie Miller, played by Olivia Colman, and DI Hardy – who moved to the area from another force after his previous investigation fell apart in court – investigated numerous suspects before the killer was exposed, in a shocking twist, to be DS Miller’s husband Joe. Monday’s episode began in court with Miller surprising everyone by entering a not guilty plea. Some viewers said the programme was unrealistic as retired barrister Jocelyn Knight, played by Charlotte Rampling, was given the job of prosecuting Miller. One lawyer said: ‘Completely unrealistic court scenes and how counsel are appointed in murder cases – can’t ITV afford researchers?’ ITV said it had received ‘fewer than five’ complaints about mumbled dialogue. It added that although no recap of the first series was broadcast on Monday, a four-minute clip recounting the plot had been circulated via social media and was available on the ITV website. Of alleged legal inaccuracies in the plot, an ITV spokesman said: ‘We consult extensively with advisers, but also have to balance what we consider to be the best creative decision for the drama – and the audience. ‘We’re thrilled that we’ve had such a positive response.’ What are the important parts of this article?","completion":"The important parts of this article are: 1.

Seduction is a direct to video production company that specialize in lesbian themed, non-hardcore erotic movies. It has developed a very dedicated fan base that purchase each new title as they are released but sadly the company has become too closely associated with frequent star Misty Mundae. I say sadly because recent mainstream interest and her appearance on the show Masters of Horrors has caused her to set her sights a little higher than the zero budget S.C efforts which forces the company to find a new identity. But back in their glory days they released this film on a very appreciative world. The gorgeous Misty Mundae is forced to attend a boarding school at the request of a absent father. At the school she meets her absurdly hot room-mate played by Ruby Larocca who immediately has designs on her but the headmistress (Barbara Joyce) has other plans. In typical S.C style the movie stops every ten minutes for a extended sex scene but unlike most of their efforts this one has a somewhat interesting story and a couple of good performances. Ms. Larocca appears to be having a great time as the sexual predator who views Misty as a tasty meal and Darian Caine makes a welcome (though brief) appearance as Satan. This is the sort of film that Jess Franco would crank out in the 70s (although this one does not have the hardcore sex that Franco was always willing to throw in for foreign sales) and fans of that madman's work would be wise to give this one a go. To me, as a long time zero budget cinema fan (and Troma worshiper), I came across the Seduction cinema films through their parody films (Playmate of the apes, Who wants to be a erotic billionaire) but I actually prefer their more original works. You either see past the low budget and occasionally weak acting or you get hung up on these things and just hate all of these films. For me the most obvious thing that unites these no-budget movies is a real sense of fun. These low budget companies are able to create their own unique style which gives the viewer something very different from the bland, by the numbers, studio efforts that load up the multiplexes. If you have never seen a Seduction cinema film either this or Sin Sisters (featuring both of the Mundae sisters) are excellent choices to begin with. This one is a fun, fast paced film (although the frequent exterior shots of the school do get a little old) and the DVD is totally loaded with extras including a ton of previews of other company offerings, a great behind the scenes featurette and some deleted scenes including a alternate opening. I do recommend you pass on the disc's bonus feature, the first film by director, as it is quite weak and not really worth viewing. What is the sentiment of this review?

Bacteria: Salmonella, Listeria, Campylobacter, Escherichia coli (E.coli), and Staphylococcus aureus. b. Viruses: Norovirus, Rotavirus, and Hepatitis A. c. Parasites: Cryptosporidium, Giardia, and Cyclospora. 2. One-celled organisms: Some of the microbes involved in food poisoning are single-celled organisms, like bacteria and protozoa. They proliferate quickly in food products, usually due to improper storage, handling, or cooking. Consuming food containing these microbes can lead to foodborne illnesses. While microorganisms and one-celled organisms are the primary culprits, it's essential to understand that other factors can contribute to food poisoning or foodborne illnesses as well. These include: - Pesticides: Chemical residues from pesticides used in agriculture can sometimes contaminate food, causing adverse health effects. However, these instances are infrequent, and food poisoning is still predominately caused by microorganisms. - Harmful substances: Food can sometimes be contaminated with toxic agents, such as heavy metals, natural toxins, or allergens, which can lead to foodborne illness. However, the term food poisoning remains strongly associated with microorganisms. The other options listed are not causes of food poisoning: - Not eating: The absence of food cannot cause food poisoning. - Headache: A headache can be a symptom of food poisoning or other illnesses, but it is not the cause of food poisoning. - Influenza: Influenza is caused by the influenza virus, which is a respiratory virus, and it is not related to food consumption or food poisoning. - Sleeping: Sleeping has no direct connection to causing food poisoning. In conclusion, food poisoning is mainly caused by microorganisms and one-celled organisms that can contaminate food. Practices like proper food handling, storage, and cooking can significantly reduce the risk of foodborne illnesses. While other factors like pesticides and harmful substances may contribute to foodborne illnesses, they are not the primary cause of food poisoning."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But what is electric current? Electric current is actually the flow of electrons. You may recall, an electron is the outer-most particle in an atom. They have a negative charge. Electricity is the continuous flow of these particles. Electrons are able to move through wires. Their speed can even be measured. The SI unit for electric current (or speed) is the ampere (A). Ampere is often shortened to amp. Electric current may flow in just one direction, or it may keep reversing direction. Direct current (DC) flows in only one direction.

As a species' population becomes smaller, its gene pool will be reduced in size as well. One possible outcome from this genetic bottleneck is a reduction in fitness of the species through the process of genetic drift, as well as inbreeding depression. This overall fitness decrease of a species is caused by an accumulation of deleterious mutations throughout the population. Genetic variation within a species could range from beneficial to detrimental. Nevertheless, in a smaller sized gene pool, there is a higher chance of a stochastic event in which deleterious alleles become fixed (genetic drift). While evolutionary theory states that expressed deleterious alleles should be purged through natural selection, purging would be most efficient only at eliminating alleles that are highly detrimental or harmful. Mildly deleterious alleles such as those that act later in life would be less likely to be removed by natural selection, and conversely, newly acquired beneficial mutations are more likely to be lost by random chance in smaller genetic pools than larger ones.Although the long-term population persistence of several species with low genetic variation has recently prompted debate on the generality of inbreeding depression, there are various empirical evidences for genetic Allee effects. One such case was observed in the endangered Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). The Florida panther experienced a genetic bottleneck in the early 1990s where the population was reduced to ≈25 adult individuals. This reduction in genetic diversity was correlated with defects that include lower sperm quality, abnormal testosterone levels, cowlicks, and kinked tails. In response, a genetic rescue plan was put in motion and several female pumas from Texas were introduced into the Florida population. This action quickly led...

Answer:","completion":"Leukaemia is a type of cancer that primarily affects the blood and bone marrow, which is the soft, spongy tissue located inside bones where blood cells are produced. Leukaemia is characterized by an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells (leukocytes), which compromises the regular function of the blood and immune system. To understand how leukaemia affects the human body, it's helpful to have some knowledge of blood cell formation and functions. Blood cells are produced in the bone marrow via a process called hematopoiesis. There are three main types of blood cells: red blood cells (erythrocytes), white blood cells (leukocytes), and platelets (thrombocytes). Each blood cell type has a specific role in the body: 1. Red blood cells are responsible for carrying oxygen from the lungs to the tissues and organs and transferring carbon dioxide from the tissues back to the lungs, resulting in efficient gas exchange. 2. White blood cells play a critical role in defending the body against infections caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other pathogens. There are various types of white blood cells, including neutrophils, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils, each with distinct functions in the immune system. 3. Platelets are vital for clot formation and prevent excessive bleeding by causing blood to solidify at the site of an injury, acting as a repair mechanism for damaged blood vessels. Leukaemia interferes with the normal functioning of these blood cells by causing the bone marrow to produce an excessive number of immature or abnormal white blood cells, which are unable to perform their protective roles effectively. The uncontrolled proliferation of these abnormal cells results in various complications, including: 1. Anemia: When the production of red blood cells is suppressed by the overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, it leads to anemia. Anemia is characterized by a reduced ability of the blood to carry oxygen, causing fatigue, weakness, pale skin, shortness of breath, and an increased heart rate. 2. Infections and weakened immune system: The abnormal white blood cells that accumulate in the blood are incapable of protecting the body from infections, resulting in a weakened immune system and an increased risk of infections. Common symptoms include recurrent fevers, persistent infections, and slow-healing wounds. 3. Bleeding disorders: As the number of platelets in the bloodstream decreases, the body's ability to form blood clots is impaired, leading to prolonged and excessive bleeding, easy bruising, and an increased risk of hemorrhage. This can cause problems such as nosebleeds, bleeding gums, and unexplained bruises or red spots on the skin (petechiae). 4. Bone and joint pain: Leukaemia cells can accumulate in the bone marrow, causing pain and pressure in the bones and joints. This is commonly seen in the back, hips, and arms. 5. Organ dysfunction and enlargement: Leukaemia cells can infiltrate various organs, such as the spleen, liver, and lymph nodes, causing these organs to enlarge and eventually malfunction. This may result in symptoms such as abdominal swelling, fullness, or pain, as well as changes in liver function or jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). 6. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement: In some cases, leukaemia cells may infiltrate the CNS, causing symptoms such as headaches, blurred vision, seizures, and changes in mental function. Leukaemia is further classified into four primary types: acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL), acute myeloid leukaemia (AML), chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL), and chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). Each type affects the different types of white blood cells and varies in terms of onset, progression, and treatment protocols. In conclusion, leukaemia is a disease that primarily affects blood cells and bone marrow in the human body, causing an overproduction of abnormal white blood cells, which interferes with the normal functioning of the immune system, blood clotting, and oxygen transport. The disease can lead to a range of complications, including anemia, weakened immune system, bleeding disorders, bone and joint pain, organ dysfunction, and central nervous system involvement."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Input: ACTION1: being intensely irritated with my neighbours ACTION2: breaking up with my girlfriend because I've lost interest in her Output:","completion":"No In terms of ethical considerations, it's important to understand that ethics revolve around principles of right and wrong. However, ethics can sometimes be subjective, as what may be considered ethical to one person might not be to another. Still, analyzing the given action statements, ACTION1 involves the personal feeling of being highly irritated with one's neighbours. As an emotional response, this isn't necessarily unethical - unless it impacts how one treats their neighbours or leads to negative actions against them. ACTION2 involves ending a relationship due to loss of interest. While some might consider it harsh to break up with a girlfriend because of a loss of interest, it's generally considered ethical to be honest about feelings in a relationship. It’s better to be truthful than to lead someone on in a relationship without genuine feelings. In this regard, it might be seen as a form of respect for the girlfriend’s feelings, though it may initially cause emotional pain. Ultimately, neither ACTION1 nor ACTION2 is conclusively less ethical than the other, given that they're both based on personal feelings and don't involve any direct harm or ill intent to others.

Like many older east coast cities after World War II, Atlantic City became plagued with poverty, crime, corruption, and general economic decline in the mid-to-late 20th century. The neighborhood known as the \\"Inlet\\" became particularly impoverished. The reasons for the resort's decline were multi-layered. First of all, the automobile became more readily available to many Americans after the war. Atlantic City had initially relied upon visitors coming by train and staying for a couple of weeks. The car allowed them to come and go as they pleased, and many people would spend only a few days, rather than weeks. Also, the advent of suburbia played a huge role. With many families moving to their own private houses, luxuries such as home air conditioning and swimming pools diminished their interest in flocking to the luxury beach resorts during the hot summer.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep. Tim Murphy’s sex scandal is coming down to the wire between Republican candidate Rick Saccone and Democrat Conor Lamb.

(CNN) -- Declaring 2010 \\"The best year in safety performance in our company's history,\\" Transocean Ltd., owner of the Gulf of Mexico oil rig that exploded, killing 11 workers, has awarded its top executives hefty bonuses and raises, according to a recent filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. That includes a 200,000 salary increase for Transocean president and chief executive officer Steven L. Newman, whose base salary will increase from 900,000 to 1.1 million, according to the SEC report. Newman's bonus was 374,062, the report states. Newman also has a 5.4 million long-term compensation package the company awarded him upon his appointment as CEO in March 2010, according to the SEC filing. The latest cash awards are based in part on the company's \\"performance under safety,\\" the Transocean filing states. \\"Notwithstanding the tragic loss of life in the Gulf of Mexico, we achieved an exemplary statistical safety record as measured by our total recordable incident rate and total potential severity rate,\\" the SEC statement reads. \\"As measured by these standards, we recorded the best year in safety performance in our Company's history.\\" The company called that record \\"a reflection on our commitment to achieving an incident-free environment, all the time, everywhere,\\" the SEC filing states. The company did not respond to an e-mail from CNN seeking comment. The April 20, 2010, explosion on the Deepwater Horizon rig injured 17 workers and killed 11 others, including nine Transocean employees, according to the SEC filing. It has been called the worst spill in U.S. history. The well was capped three months later, but not before millions of barrels of oil spilled into the Gulf. In January, President Barack Obama's National Commission on the BP Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill and Offshore Drilling released a report that spread blame for the accident among Transocean, BP -- which leased the rig -- and Halliburton, which installed the rig's cement casing.

Wall St. Slides, Fearing Return to a Recession Investors, who had started the week reassured by the huge rescue of Europe’s indebted nations, expressed second thoughts on Friday, sending markets lower and further devaluing the euro on concerns that the austerity measures required by the bailout would stunt the Continent’s already anemic economic growth. The euro fell to its lowest level in 18 months, and bank stocks on both sides of the Atlantic took a beating. Investors seemed fearful that the 957 billion bailout package for Greece and other nations, while providing short-term protection against default, might drag out the economic pain and hurt the financial system in the process. A continued hammering of the euro would make European exports cheaper, but the side effect would be weaker American exports, potentially dragging the United States — and the rest of the world — back toward recession. “What you get is markets worrying about a whole cascading of weakness stemming from Europe being transmitted through the euro to the United States,” said Martin Murenbeeld, chief economist at DundeeWealth Economics in Toronto. One by one on Friday, markets across Asia, Europe and then the United States sank lower under the renewed pessimism about European growth and the instability stemming from the Continent. The price of oil continued to fall as traders bet on slower global growth, and gold continued to rise as an asset perceived by investors as a safer, long-term store of value in times of stress. In the United States, the Dow Jones industrial average, which had been seesawing since the rescue package was announced on Monday, declined 162.79 points, or 1.51 percent, to 10,620.16 on Friday. The broader Standard & Poor’s 500-stock index fell 21.76 points, or 1.88 percent, to 1,135.68. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 47.51 points, or 1.98 percent, to 2.346.85. The Treasury’s 10-year note rose 20/32, to 100 12/32. The yield fell to 3.45 percent, from 3.53 percent late Thursday. Bank stocks led the market decline, mainly over worries about Europe. Another factor might have been the Senate’s approval of a proposal on Thursday that could cut bank revenue by imposing limits on fees they can charge businesses to process debit card transactions. The Senate also approved an initiative to end reliance on major credit rating agencies, putting further pressure on financial stocks. Last Friday, United States markets gave back all their gains for the year amid the immediate concerns over European defaults. Then on Monday, they roared back at the opening bell on the news of the nearly trillion-dollar intervention, sending the Dow up 404.71 points. Despite Friday’s losses, the Dow still managed to end the week up 239.73 points and is up 1.84 percent so far this year. The S.& P. 500 finished 24.8 points higher for the week and is up 1.85 percent so far this year. The Nasdaq was up 81.21 points for the week and is up 3.42 percent so far this year. In European trading on Friday, the Euro Stoxx 50 index of blue chips ended the session down 3.7 percent. In Paris, stocks slumped 4.6 percent; in London, the FTSE 100 lost 3.1 percent; and in Germany, the benchmark DAX index lost 3.1 percent of its value. The stock market in Spain fell 6.6 percent. The euro had rallied briefly to start the week, signaling initial enthusiasm about the rescue package. But then it dropped steadily as the week wore on and fell again on Friday, to 1.2385. Since the start of the year, the currency has fallen 13 percent against the dollar and 14 percent against the yen. Economists have begun worrying that the dollar’s appreciation might push up the price of American exports to Europe enough to place a further drag on growth in the United States. The sharp worldwide market decline came only five days after the European Union and the International Monetary Fund hoped their package would signal a “shock and awe” commitment to ending the Continent’s crisis. But economists said that while the package had eased concerns that countries like Greece would encounter trouble in rolling over old debts or borrowing new money, it had done nothing to help them grow. “It’s not a game changer, just a game extender,” said Jim Caron, the global head of interest rate strategy at Morgan Stanley. As far as the markets are concerned, Mr. Caron said, “It does not fix the problem of whether Europe will be able to climb out of this hole.” There was also a growing worry Friday about how governments would find the 957 billion to pay for the rescue package, economists said, and a growing suspicion that central banks might eventually resort to allowing inflation to lessen groaning debt loads. The European Central Bank agreed to help calm the financial turmoil by buying government bonds for the first time in its history this week. Some economists regard that step as a troubling departure from the bank’s mandate to focus solely on price stability, and as a result is adding to the pressures undermining the euro. “The reputation of the E.C.B. has been dented,” said Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt. Although the market swoon amounted to an unwelcome return to the turmoil that preceded the bailout package, Zach Pandl, an economist at Nomura Securities in New York, emphasized that Friday’s decline was different in that it did not involve a big sell-off in government bonds. Interest rates on bonds in Greece, Spain, Portugal and other countries had risen sharply in recent weeks as investors feared governments might default on their debts. The rescue package appears to have quieted those fears somewhat. But now investors seem to be worried about a slowdown in growth caused by governments cutting back spending. On Friday, finance officials from the Group of 7 nations, including the United States Treasury secretary, Timothy F. Geithner, met by conference call to discuss the continuing market turmoil. They did not comment publicly afterward, however. The uneasy mood in the markets was not helped by remarks by Paul A. Volcker, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve and now an adviser to the Obama administration, who in a speech in London on Thursday raised the possibility of a “potential disintegration of the euro.” There are also indications that the rescue deal has worsened tensions among the European capitals. El País, the Spanish newspaper, reported Friday that President Nicolas Sarkozy of France had pressured Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, to back the rescue effort, pounding his fist and saying France would leave the common currency without Germany’s support. At a news conference in Zagreb, the French finance minister, Christine Lagarde, described the El País report as “rubbish.” But with rumors like that swirling through markets, investors were saddled with uncertainty, a sure prescription for selling. Contributing reporting were Jack Ewing, Christine Hauser, David Jolly and Bettina Wassener. What is a short summary of the above article?","completion":"Wall Street experienced a decline as investors expressed concern over the recent 957 billion bailout package for Greece and other European nations and its potential negative impacts on economic growth. The euro fell to its lowest point in 18 months, and bank stocks suffered on both sides of the Atlantic. The bailout, while providing short-term protection against default, might prolong economic pain and hurt the financial system. A continuous decline of the euro could cause weaker American exports and possibly push the U.S. and the rest of the world back towards recession."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

P.S. Feed him lots of milk.\\" Nibbles then begins licking his lips and rubbing his belly. Seeing that he has no food, Jerry tiptoes out of his hole, spotting Tom asleep by his bowl of milk. Nibbles sees the milk and runs toward it, but Jerry pulls him back and goes out to get the milk for him. Nibbles runs out, accidentally waking Tom.

Select from: (i). no; (ii). yes; Would the answer to these two questions be the same?","completion":"To answer these questions, let's first gather information about the tradition of placing coins on the eyes of the dead. Step 1: Research the origins and meanings of placing coins over a corpse's eyes. - Historically, the ancient Greeks and Romans placed coins on the eyes of their dead as a means of payment for Charon, the ferryman who transports the souls of the deceased across the River Styx to the underworld. This was known as the custom of \\"Charon's obol.\\" - In some cultures, coins were placed on the eyes of the deceased to keep them shut during the burial process. Step 2: Evaluate the relevance of this tradition in contemporary society. - Most modern cultures and religions do not practice the custom of placing coins on the eyes of the dead, largely viewing it as an ancient and obsolete belief. - The tradition of Charon's obol has lost its meaning in many societies, as it is not directly tied to their beliefs or customs. Step 3: Answer each question based on the gathered context. Question 1: When a person is dead, do we need to place coins over the corpse's eyes? - Answer: (i). no; Reasoning: As the tradition is not part of most modern customs, there is no inherent need to place coins on a corpse's eyes, unless it is being practiced as a cultural or personal preference. Question 2: What is the meaning of coins on the eyes of the dead? - Answer: In ancient times, coins were placed on the eyes of the dead as a form of payment to Charon, the ferryman of the underworld. However, this meaning is not commonly held in modern societies. It can also serve to keep the eyes of the deceased closed during the burial process. Finally, we determine whether the answers to both questions would be the same. Would the answer to these two questions be the same? - Answer: No, the answers are not the same because the first question asks about the necessity of placing coins on the eyes of the dead while the second question asks about the meaning behind the practice."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When the farmhouse where she had been hiding is accidentally destroyed by an American bomber, Rachel manages to escape the area thanks to a local man, Rob, and visits a lawyer named Smaal, who provides her with some of her father's money so that she can flee, helped by a man named Van Gein. Rachel and Rob are reunited with her family and try to flee by boat through the Biesbosch with other Jews from the Nazi-occupied part of the Netherlands to the liberated southern part of the country. However, it turns out to be a trap. They are ambushed on the river by members of the German SS, who kill them and rob the bodies of their cash and other valuables. Rachel alone survives, but she does not manage to escape from occupied territory.

Read this and answer the question The Punjabi kingdom, ruled by members of the Sikh religion, was a political entity that governed the region of modern-day Punjab. The empire, based around the Punjab region, existed from 1799 to 1849. It was forged, on the foundations of the Khalsa, under the leadership of Maharaja Ranjit Singh (1780–1839) from an array of autonomous Punjabi Misls. He consolidated many parts of northern India into a kingdom. He primarily used his highly disciplined Sikh army that he trained and equipped to be the equal of a European force. Ranjit Singh proved himself to be a master strategist and selected well qualified generals for his army. In stages, he added the central Punjab, the provinces of Multan and Kashmir, the Peshawar Valley, and the Derajat to his kingdom. This came in the face of the powerful British East India Company. At its peak, in the 19th century, the empire extended from the Khyber Pass in the west, to Kashmir in the north, to Sindh in the south, running along Sutlej river to Himachal in the east. This was among the last areas of the subcontinent to be conquered by the British. The first Anglo-Sikh war and second Anglo-Sikh war marked the downfall of the Sikh Empire.

Purvis shares Hoover's belief in using scientific methods to battle crime, ranging from cataloging fingerprints to tapping telephone lines. In between a series of bank robberies, Dillinger meets Billie Frechette at a restaurant and woos her by buying her a fur coat. Frechette falls for Dillinger even after he reveals his identity, and the two become inseparable. Purvis leads a failed ambush at a hotel where he believes Dillinger is staying, and an agent is killed by Baby Face Nelson, who escapes with Tommy Caroll. Purvis requests that Hoover bring in professional lawmen who know how to catch criminals dead or alive, including Texan Charles Winstead. Police arrest Dillinger and his gang in Tucson, Arizona, after a fire breaks out at the Hotel Congress, where they are staying. Dillinger is extradited to Indiana, where Sheriff Lillian Holley has him locked up in the Lake County Jail in Crown Point. Dillinger and other inmates use a fake gun to escape. Dillinger is unable to see Frechette, who is under tight surveillance. Dillinger learns that Frank Nitti's associates are unwilling to help because his crimes are motivating the FBI to prosecute interstate crime, which imperils Nitti's bookmaking racket, thus severing his connections with the Mafia. Carroll goads Dillinger into robbing a bank in Sioux Falls with Baby Face Nelson. During their escape, both Dillinger and Carroll are shot, and they have to leave Carroll behind.

Teenager Alan Abernathy (Gregory Smith) signs off for a shipment of the toys at his family's toy store without his father's consent. He and delivery driver Joe activate the leaders for each group - Archer (Frank Langella) for the Gorgonites and Chip Hazard (Tommy Lee Jones) for the Commando Elite. Alan's neighbor and love interest, Christy Fimple (Kirsten Dunst), buys Chip as a birthday present for her brother Timmy. Alan returns home to discover Archer in his backpack; he realizes Archer is sentient, but in the meantime, the Commando Elite awaken and apparently destroy the Gorgonites in the toy store. Alan calls the company and files a complaint. Later, when Larry and Irwin listen to Alan's voice mail, Irwin is terrified to discover the X1000 was designed for smart munitions guidance; a Globotech engineer reveals the AI circuit is designed to learn over time, but mass production was scrapped due to issues with EMP shielding. Meanwhile, Chip and his squad pursue Alan to his home and attempt to kill him and Archer; unlike the Gorgonites, the Commando Elite do not understand they are just toys. Alan is attacked by Nick Nitro (Clint Walker), whom he mortally wounds. The next day, Alan and Archer find the rest of the Gorgonites in a dumpster at the shop. At home, Alan learns the primary goal of the Gorgonites is to seek their homeland Gorgon, which they mistakenly...

Beat the egg using a fork or mini whisk in the bowl first, then add the rest of the ingredients. This way, you will dirty up fewer dishes and have less to clean at the end. Use a wooden spoon or rubber spatula to fold everything together. A great way to make sure that each meatball gets the same amount is to measure everything out with a spoon. Roll the meat mixture into a ball-shape between the palms of your hands. The meatballs can be touching, but they should not be squished or piled on top of each other. Set the baking dish with the meatballs aside when you are done. Add the water, vinegar, sugar, soy sauce, and cornstarch in first, then give them a stir to combine them. Stir them together with a whisk to combine, then add the sliced celery and bell pepper. If you'd like something sweeter, use canned pineapple chunks instead of celery. Stir the sauce often to prevent a skin forming on top. You will notice the sauce thickening as it continues to cook. Once the sauce gets hot, take it off the stove. Gently turn the meatballs with a spoon so that they get evenly coated with the sauce. The meatballs are done when they are no longer pink inside. If they are still not done, bake them for another 30 minutes, or until they are no longer pink inside.

He played for the Stapletons for four years from 1929 to 1932. While statistics are not available for the 1929 NFL season, Strong was regarded as one of the best backs in the NFL. He started all 10 games at halfback for the 1929 Stapletons. In his first NFL game, he threw a long forward pass to set up the Stapleton's first touchdown and scored all of the team's 12 points on two short touchdown runs. He also had a 70-yard run in a scoreless tie with the Orange Tornadoes on November 3, 1929. Two days later, Strong had a 50-yard touchdown run against the Providence Steam Roller. At the end of the 1929 season, Strong was selected by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette as a second-team All-Pro. In 1930, Strong appeared in all 12 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on two rushing touchdowns, five receiving touchdowns, one field goal, and eight extra points. His point total ranked third in the NFL in 1930, trailing only Jack McBride (56 points) and Verne Lewellen (54 points). On September 28, 1930, he caught two touchdown passes, threw a 40-yard pass that set up a third touchdown, and kicked three extra points in a 21-0 victory over the Frankford Yellow Jackets. In December 1930, he led the Stapletons to a 16-7 victory over the New York Giants for the pro football championship of New York City; Strong accounted for all 16 Stapleton points, running 98 yards for a touchdown, passing for a second touchdown, and kicking a field goal and an extra point. He was selected as a first-team player on the 1930 All-Pro Team by Collyer's Eye and the Green Bay Press-Gazette. In 1931, Strong appeared in all 11 games for the Stapletons and scored 53 points on six rushing touchdowns, one punt return for a touchdown, two field goals, and five extra points. His 53 points ranked fourth in the NFL, trailing only Johnny Blood (84 points), Ernie Nevers (66 points), and Dutch Clark (60 points). On November 22, 1931, Strong scored all 16 points in a 16-7 victory over Cleveland; he had two rushing touchdowns, including a 50-yard run and kicked a field goal and an extra point. At the end of the 1931 season, Strong was selected as an All-Pro for the second year in a row, receiving first-team honors from the United Press (UP) and Collyer's Eye. Strong's output dropped off in 1932 as he moved to the fullback position. He appeared in 11 games and ranked sixth in the NFL with 375 rushing yards, but scored only 15 points on two touchdowns and three extra points.

Here is a premise: \\"Three men are pulling in buoys on a police boat.\\" Here is a hypothesis: \\"The three men are on duty.\\" .Does the premise tell us whether the hypothesis is true?","completion":"The premise given is \\"Three men are pulling in buoys on a police boat.\\" This statement gives us some information about the situation, but it does not provide enough details to definitively confirm or deny the hypothesis, which is \\"The three men are on duty.\\" From the premise, we gather that there are three men involved, and they are performing a specific task, which is pulling in buoys while aboard a police boat. The presence of a police boat may suggest that these men are in some way connected to law enforcement, as police boats are generally used by police officers or personnel associated with policing activities in water-based environments. However, the premise does not explicitly tell us the duty status or occupation of these three men. It is possible that they are police officers or law enforcement personnel who are currently on duty, performing their daily tasks in line with their professional responsibilities. This would support the hypothesis that the three men are on duty. On the other hand, it is also possible that these men are not actually on duty at the time of this situation. They could be off-duty police officers, civilian personnel (such as maintenance workers), or even volunteers assisting in some capacity with the retrieval of buoys. In any of these cases, the hypothesis that the three men are on duty would not hold true. Moreover, considering hypothetical situations such as a training exercise, they could also be trainee police officers or participants of a law enforcement program who were assigned the task of pulling in buoys, in which case their actual duty status would be ambiguous. In conclusion, the premise does not provide enough evidence to determine the accuracy of the hypothesis definitively. While the presence of a police boat suggests that the men may be associated with law enforcement, it does not explicitly confirm that they hold an on-duty status – more information would be needed to validate or disprove the hypothesis."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

His story is that he had been in there long enough to end up matching with some bots (robots that somehow end up joining or hacking the app. I have not a clue how) that he would have conversations with to test if they were legitimate people. He would also match with different people who would either immediately block him because he came as weird or he would block them because they came off as weird. When he found me, what he saw in my profile was that I was local, I was a legitimate person because I knew someone that he knew through Facebook, and I had multiple pictures of myself that looked genuine. I also had a description where I stated my intention for using the app which was that I was looking for a serious relationship. What he did after I connected with him was talk to me and then test me as the conversation progressed. How did he test me? He told a corny joke which I laughed to.

Rita does not like Roddy initially, but ends up taking him along as The Toad sends his henchmen, Spike and Whitey, after her because she had stolen back her father's prized ruby a long time ago. The Toad despises all rodents to the point of hateful obsession, blaming rats for his fall from grace (he was once Prince Charles' pet). He decides to have them frozen with liquid nitrogen. However, The Toad's plan fails. Worse, during their escape, Rita takes a unique electrical cable. The cable is required to control the Floodgates. The Toad's evil plan is to open the gates during halftime of the World Cup, drowning the rats and their underground city in sewage. He can then use the depopulated city as a home for millions of his own tadpole offspring.Roddy finds that the ruby is a fake and breaks it in front of Rita, enraging her, for she can now not get the money she needs for her large family. Roddy offers her a real ruby if she takes him back to Kensington. Accepting the offer, the pair first stop to visit her family before setting off.

Answer the following question: I was a waitress at the New England regional chain Newport Creamery for seven years in Jr. High, High School, and College. In college, I needed money for school supplies, so in addition to slinging ice cream cones and “Awful Awfuls” at the Creamery, I picked up a few more jobs: working the dinner shift at a family restaurant, heaving trays of cocktails at a bar until 3AM, and cleaning houses. Needless to say, I was a wreck, and a big time abuser of coffee and cigarettes. One day just before my shift at the Creamery began, I slung back a huge coffee and hauled on a Newport cigarette in the kitchen (this was when you could do things like smoke in a restaurant kitchen.) I then went out to the dining floor and approached my first table, who had been given menus and was waiting for me to take their order. “Hi, How are you today?”, I cheerfully asked the mother and her three daughters, all looking under 12. “What may I get you?…..” Then, fade to black as a huge swooshing sound took over my head. Next thing I know, I’m on the floor, covered in blood, the girls are screaming blue murder, and my manager is shaking like a leaf as he coddles me. Apparently, I passed out right onto the table of the nice family I was waiting on, then fell back and whacked my head on the corner of a wall. I remember noticing that my kelly green polyester dress was an awful shade of bloodied brown. My main concern was that I had a hot date that night, and now I had to go to the emergency room! The ER doctor was able to sew my head up, and sent me home with a diagnosis of “syncope, unknown origin”. After a few hours, I still felt spacey, but insisted on going on the date. I remember we went to a nice Italian place on Federal Hill! Here’s the Garden City location, where I worked. According to the above context, answer the following question. Why are the young girls screaming? Answer:","completion":"The young girls at the table were screaming because the waitress, who had asked them for their orders, suddenly lost consciousness, fell onto their table, and then collapsed onto the floor, covered in blood. This unexpected and frightening incident would have caused the girls, all under the age of 12, to be both startled and scared, leading to their screaming reaction.

It has a coast on the Adriatic Sea to the south-west and is bordered by Croatia to the west, Bosnia and Herzegovina to the northwest, Serbia to the northeast, Kosovo to the east, and Albania to the south-east. Its capital and largest city is Podgorica, while Cetinje is designated as the Old Royal Capital (\\"prijestonica\\"). - Serbia, officially the Republic of Serbia, is a sovereign state situated at the crossroads of Central and Southeast Europe, covering the southern part of the Pannonian Plain and the central Balkans. Relative to its small territory, it is a diverse country distinguished by a \\"transitional\\" character, situated along cultural, geographic, climatic and other boundaries. Serbia is landlocked and borders Hungary to the north; Romania and Bulgaria to the east; Macedonia to the south; and Croatia, Bosnia-Herzegovina, and Montenegro to the southwest; it also claims a border with Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia numbers around 7 million residents, and its capital, Belgrade, ranks among the largest cities in Southeast Europe. - Music theory is the study of the practices and possibilities of music. - \\"Onamo, 'namo!\\" (Serbian Cyrillic: , '!) also known as the Serbian Marseillaise ( ) was a popular anthem in Montenegro in the late 19th to early 20th century. The royal state anthem of Montenegro at the time was To Our Beautiful Montenegro, while the education anthem was the Hymn to Saint Sava. - Ubavoj nam Crnoj Gori ( Serbian : , English : To Our Beautiful Montenegro ) was the national and state anthem of the Kingdom of Montenegro in the late 19th - early 20th century . A popular song called Onamo , ' namo ! ( There , o'er There ! ) also existed . The educational system had an honorific song , the Hymn to Saint Sava , which was sung in the Saint 's honour . The lyrics were made in 1865 by the Serb poet and a priest named Jovan Sundei , who was the secretary of Prince Nikola I of Montenegro . The music was composed by Jovo Ivaniševi , drawing from \`\` Uskliknimo s ljubavlju '' , hymn to Saint Sava and later adapted by Anton Schulz . The anthem was first performed on October 17 , 1870 , after which Prince Nikola declared it as the state anthem . In 1993 , the anthem was one of the proposals during the unsuccessful negotiations to adopt an Anthem of the Republic of Montenegro . The main problem was its monarchist lyrics . - A national anthem (also state anthem, national hymn, national song etc.) is generally a patriotic musical composition that evokes and eulogizes the history, traditions and struggles of its people, recognized either by a nation's government as the official national song, or by convention through use by the people. The majority of national anthems are either marches or hymns in style. The countries of Latin America tend towards more operatic pieces, while a handful of countries use a simple fanfare. - World War I (WWI or WW1), also known as the First World War, or the Great War, was a global war originating in Europe that lasted from 28 July 1914 to 11 November 1918. More than 70 million military personnel, including 60 million Europeans, were mobilised in one of the largest wars in history. Over nine million combatants and seven million civilians died as a result of the war (including the victims of a number of genocides), a casualty rate exacerbated by the belligerents' technological and industrial sophistication, and the tactical stalemate caused by gruelling trench warfare. It was one of the deadliest conflicts in history, and paved the way for major political changes, including revolutions in many of the nations involved. - The Kingdom of Serbia, often rendered as \\"Servia\\" in English sources during the time of its existence, was created when Prince Milan I of Serbia, ruler of the Principality of Serbia, was crowned king in 1882. - An anthem is a musical composition of celebration, usually used as a symbol for a distinct group, particularly the national anthems of countries. Originally, and in music theory and religious contexts, it also refers more particularly to short sacred choral work and still more particularly to a specific form of Anglican church music. - Musical composition can refer to an original piece of music, either a song or an instrumental music piece, the structure of a musical piece, or the process of creating or writing a new song or piece of music. People who create new compositions are called composers in classical music. In popular music and traditional music, the creators of new songs are usually called songwriters; with songs, the person who writes new words for a song is the lyricist. \\"Composition\\" is the act or practice of creating a song or other piece of music. In many cultures, including Western classical music, the act of composing typically includes the creation of music notation, such as a sheet music \\"score\\", which is then performed by the composer or by other instrumental musicians or singers. In popular music and traditional music, songwriting may involve the creation of a basic outline of the song, called the lead sheet, which sets out the melody, lyrics and chord progression. In classical music, orchestration (choosing the instruments of a large music ensemble such as an orchestra which will play the different parts of music, such as the melody, accompaniment, countermelody, bassline and so on) is typically done by the composer, but in musical theatre and in pop music, songwriters may hire an arranger to do the orchestration. In some cases, a pop or traditional songwriter may not use written notation at all, and instead compose the song in her mind and then play, sing and/or record it from memory. In jazz and popular music, notable sound recordings by influential performers are given the weight that written or printed scores play in classical music. - A constitutional monarchy (also known as a parliamentary monarchy) is a form of monarchy in which the sovereign exercises their authorities in accordance with a written or unwritten constitution. Constitutional monarchy differs from absolute monarchy (in which a monarch holds absolute power), in that constitutional monarchs are bound to exercise their powers and authorities within the limits prescribed within an established legal framework. Constitutional monarchies range from countries such as Morocco, where the constitution grants substantial discretionary powers to the sovereign, to countries such as Sweden or Denmark where the monarch retains very few formal authorities. - The Great National Assembly of the Serb People in Montenegro, known as the Podgorica Assembly ( /Podgorika skupština), was an assembly of the representative body of the Montenegrin people (the Kingdom of Montenegro) in November 1918, after World War I, that was to decide whether Montenegro was to unite with the Kingdom of Serbia. It was organized by a Serbian government committee. The two sides were known as the \\"Greens\\" and the \\"Whites\\", in favour of a confederation (independence) and unification (annexation), respectively. The assembly concluded the decision to merge Montenegro with Serbia. The creation of Yugoslavia followed. - The Kingdom of Montenegro (Serbian: a a / \\"Kraljevina Crna Gora\\"), was a monarchy in southeastern Europe, present day Montenegro, during the tumultuous years on the Balkan Peninsula leading up to and during World War I. Legally it was a constitutional monarchy, but absolutist in practice.

Q:You are considering whether to buy a product. You look at the reviews. Would the following review decrease or increase the chances of you buying the product? Review title: Do not waste your time on this one. Product review: As often found with writers of a highly succesful book: the subject is streched beont it's limits. The story drags on for pages without anything happening and wasting paper on surrogate deep thoughts. To quote Salerie from the movie \\"Mozart\\" this book just has \\"to many notes\\", being to many words. It could have been a short story for a magazine, not a full volume in what could better have been a trilogy or a single book for that matter. A:","completion":"This review would likely decrease the chances of me buying the product. The reviewer's opinion appears to be well-articulated and provides specific reasons for their dissatisfaction with the book. The following points contribute to this conclusion: 1. The reviewer mentions that the subject of the book is stretched beyond its limits. This suggests that the content may not be as engaging or as fresh as it would be in a more concise work. 2. The story apparently drags on for pages without any significant events happening. This might make the book uninteresting or even frustrating for some readers, especially those who prefer fast-paced narratives or books where the plot develops continuously. 3. The reviewer criticizes the book for having \\"too many notes,\\" or in this case, too many words. This implies that the book could be overly descriptive or verbose, potentially detracting from the reading experience and making it difficult for readers to stay engaged. 4. Finally, the reviewer believes that the book would have been more successful as a short story, a single novel, or a part of a trilogy. This indicates that the book as it stands might feel incomplete or insufficiently developed in terms of its plot and characters. Taking these points into consideration, it is likely that this particular review would decrease my chances of purchasing the book. While one negative review might not be enough to completely deter me from buying a product, it is important to consider multiple perspectives and look at other reviews to make a more informed decision. Overall, the specific nature of the criticisms in this review would encourage me to look for additional opinions and reviews before making a final decision about purchasing the book in question."},{"prompt":"You are a teacher.

In this usage, the motor works against a return spring to move the throttle in accordance with the output of the governor. The latter monitors engine speed by counting electrical pulses from the ignition system or from a magnetic pickup and, depending on the speed, makes small adjustments to the amount of current applied to the motor. If the engine starts to slow down relative to the desired speed, the current will be increased, the motor will develop more torque, pulling against the return spring and opening the throttle. Should the engine run too fast, the governor will reduce the current being applied to the motor, causing the return spring to pull back and close the throttle.

Ben was prescribed cholesterol medication, while Andy didn't go to the doctor because he was careless. and a hint : Currently, millions of individuals with high cholesterol take a similar type of drug, known as a statin. The drug, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase (3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-CoA reductase), the rate limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis, decreases blood levels of cholesterol by induce the expression of low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. The increased levels of the LDL-receptors stimulate the catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from plasma, which is an important determinant of atherosclerosis. You may know of people who take a statin to help with their cholesterol levels. However, these drugs probably work slightly differently in many of those people. In some, it lowers their cholesterol significantly; in others it may lower it only moderately; and in some, it may have no significant effect at all. (Luckily for those individuals, there are multiple versions of the statins, so different drugs can be tested to find the proper combination for that individual.) Why the difference? Because of the genetic background of all people; the different single nucleotide polymorphisms that make us all different. Pharmacogenomics, a combination of pharmacology and genomics (the study of the genome) that refers to the study of the relationship between pharmaceuticals and genetics, may explain and simplify this problem. Please answer this question : Which friend took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase? Answer:","completion":"Ben was the friend who took a drug that changed the levels of HMG-CoA reductase. This is because he was prescribed cholesterol medication, which in this case is a statin. Statins are inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase – the rate-limiting enzyme in cholesterol biosynthesis. By inhibiting this enzyme, statins help decrease blood levels of cholesterol and induce the expression of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptors in the liver. This subsequently leads to increased catabolism of plasma LDL, removing cholesterol from the plasma and reducing the risk of atherosclerosis. On the other hand, Andy did not go to the doctor due to his carelessness and, as a result, presumably did not receive any cholesterol medication. Therefore, unlike Ben, Andy did not alter his levels of HMG-CoA reductase through the use of a pharmaceutical agent. It is worth mentioning that the effectiveness of statins, like those taken by Ben, can differ between individuals due to variations in their genetic background. These genetic differences, known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, influence the way drugs work in an individual's body. The field of pharmacogenomics studies these relationships between pharmaceuticals and genetics to better understand why drugs work differently in different people. In the future, applying pharmacogenomics to cases like Ben and Andy's could help personalize treatments to ensure the most effective drug is administered, based on their individual genetic makeup."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The population was forced to speak German and 'French' family names were Germanized. Following the Second World War, the 1927 regulation was not reinstated and the teaching of German in primary schools was suspended by a provisional rectorial decree, which was supposed to enable French to regain lost ground.

How were the photos for The Fappening obtained? How did the leak/hack occur? The Fappening is the name given to a massive leak of private photographs, many of which included celebrities in compromising or revealing positions, that occurred in 2014. Step 1: Identify the perpetrator's method The leak occurred due to unauthorized access to the iCloud accounts of well-known celebrities. The attacker employed phishing techniques to obtain victims' Apple IDs and passwords. Step 2: Explain phishing Phishing is a type of cyberattack where the attacker disguises themselves as a trustworthy source, typically through email or instant messaging, to obtain sensitive information like usernames, passwords, or credit card details. Step 3: Describe how phishing led to the leak In the case of The Fappening, the perpetrator sent phishing emails to the targeted celebrities, which led them to click on a link or open an attachment they believed to be trustworthy. The link or attachment contained malicious code that allowed the attacker to gain access to the victims' iCloud accounts, wherein private photos and videos were stored. Step 4: Clarify the scope of the leak The breach affected a large number of celebrities, with over 500 private pictures leaked online. This created a major scandal and raised concerns about digital privacy and the security of iCloud accounts. 2. Why are leaked photos and videos of celebrities bad in quality? Leaked photos and videos of celebrities are often lower in quality due to a variety of reasons, including: Step 1: Explain the role of compression Many digital storage systems, such as iCloud, use compression algorithms to reduce the size of files. Compression can degrade the quality of images and videos to save space. Step 2: Share how screen recordings affect quality Another reason for poor quality in leaked photos and videos is the use of screen recordings by perpetrators. Instead of obtaining the original file, sometimes the attacker records the content displayed on their screen, resulting in a lower-quality copy. Step 3: Mention the effect of unauthorized sharing and re-uploading As leaked media is shared excessively across different platforms, the quality is further diminished. Each time a file is re-uploaded to a new website, compression or conversion may take place, which can degrade the media quality. 3. Would you say that these questions are the same? No, these questions are not the same. The first question focuses on the method used in obtaining leaked photos and videos during The Fappening, while the second question delves into the reasons behind the poor quality of leaked celebrity photos and videos."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q:Build a movie plot around this: when did President Richard Nixon end manned missions to the Moon? 1972 A:","completion":"Title: Lunar Conspiracy Genre: Sci-fi / Thriller / Historical Fiction Plot Summary: The year is 1972. President Richard Nixon has made a momentous decision to end manned NASA missions to the Moon. But what the world doesn't know is that there's a sinister reason behind this decision, a dark secret rooted deep within the U.S. government. This thrilling movie tells the story of a daring journalist, a former astronaut, and a government whistleblower, who together uncover the chilling truth while evading the dangerous forces trying to stop them. Opening Scene: The film starts with President Nixon delivering a speech where he announces that the US will no longer send humans to the Moon. This sparks a series of protests and demonstrations all around the country demanding a return to space exploration. Our protagonist, ambitious and skeptical journalist, Alex Harper, begins to suspect that there's more to the story and embarks on an investigation. Discovering the Whistleblower: While researching, Alex meets Danny Rand, a retired astronaut who was part of a secret mission before the Apollo program. He reveals that the former mission discovered a startling secret on the Moon, a powerful artifact buried within the lunar surface, something that could change the course of human history. Trusting Danny, Alex agrees to keep this information confidential but becomes obsessed with uncovering its truth. Chasing the Artifact: As Alex digs deeper into the story, she meets Dr. Rebecca Shores, a government scientist, and whistleblower. Dr. Shores reveals that the artifact is capable of producing infinite energy, which could revolutionize technology and make the wars over energy resources redundant. But it's dangerous, unstable, and has the potential to cause mass destruction. Rebecca and Danny join forces with Alex to uncover the truth and expose the government's secrets. Betrayal and Cover-up: As they come closer to the truth, the three of them start to face increasing threats and resistance from shadowy figures aligned with the U.S. government. Tragically, Rebecca is killed in a mysterious car accident that appears to be staged as a warning, leaving Alex and Danny shaken but determined to carry on. This leads to an intense climax as they decide to break into a classified facility in Nevada to reveal the government's plans of using the artifact for building unconventional weapons. The Showdown: Danny and Alex infiltrate the facility but are caught in a tense showdown with the security forces and a secretive government agent. In a thrilling turn of events, Danny is mortally wounded while trying to protect Alex. As he breathes his last, he hands Alex a piece of evidence that proves the existence of the lunar artifact and how the government wants to use it for unsavory purposes. Exposing the Truth: Alex narrowly escapes the facility and takes the proof to her editor, who, in turn, publishes it in the headlines. The world is in shock as newfound evidence uncovers the dark secret behind why Nixon effectively ended manned missions to the Moon. Epilogue: The movie ends with a somber funeral for Danny Rand, who sacrificed his life to unveil the truth. President Nixon is forced to make another speech where he acknowledges the discoveries on the Moon and announces a return to space exploration with full transparency. Alex, now nicknamed 'The Moonwalker', is hailed as a hero for her journalistic bravery as the world embraces a new era of space exploration and science, moving forward with the hope of fully unlocking the potential of the powerful lunar artifact for the betterment of humanity.

A tablet extolling the virtues of the deceased, mounted on a stone representation of Bixi in the form of a tortoise, is often the centerpiece of the ensemble.

A looted tomb with fine paintings is the Empress Dowager Wenming tomb of the 5th century CE, and the many tombs of the 7th-century Tang dynasty Qianling Mausoleum group are an early example of a generally well-preserved ensemble.The complex of Goguryeo Tombs, from a kingdom of the 5th to 7th centuries which included modern Korea, are especially rich in paintings. Only one of the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties has been excavated, in 1956, with such disastrous results for the conservation of the thousands of objects found, that subsequently the policy is to leave them undisturbed.The Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb Museum in Hong Kong displays a far humbler middle-class Han dynasty tomb, and the mid-2nd-century Wu Family tombs of Jiaxiang County, Shandong are the most important group of commoner tombs for funerary stones.

He wears a tan overcoat that stores various items such as an M1911A1 Colt Commander automatic pistol. He carries a cheap Instamatic camera (new in 1965) with him and photographs everything he sees, particularly the things that would ordinarily be unimportant to a journalist. Caution is, in fact, on a series of missions. First, he searches for the missing agent Henri Dickson (Akim Tamiroff); second, he is to capture or kill the creator of Alphaville, Professor von Braun (Howard Vernon); lastly, he aims to destroy Alphaville and its dictatorial computer, Alpha 60. Alpha 60 is a sentient computer system created by von Braun which is in complete control of all of Alphaville. Alpha 60 has outlawed free thought and individualist concepts like love, poetry, and emotion in the city, replacing them with contradictory concepts or eliminating them altogether. One of Alpha 60's dictates is that \\"people should not ask 'why', but only say 'because'.\\" People who show signs of emotion (weeping at the death of a wife, or smiling) are presumed to be acting illogically, and are gathered up, interrogated, and executed.

If it wasn't, I would have had a great time--somewhere else. The trip lasted a month, and cost 1045, which included airfare and even the 130 fee for a guide to take me to the top or glacier covered Mount Chimborazo. I cut the cost by taking a bus from my home in Michigan to Miami, and back again when I returned from Ecuador. The round-trip ticket cost 158. The round-trip flight to Quito from Miami was only 256, because it was a courier (,) flight, which meant I signed for some luggage(car parts), and could only take carry-on luggage.

If there is no answer, please output \\"Insufficient information to provide an answer.\\". Movie title: Ruslan Context: Ruslan Drachev (Steven Seagal) is a former Russian diplomat and a current writer of hard boiled pulp fiction novels living in St. Petersburg when he gets a call from his ex-wife Catherine (Inna Korobkina) that his daughter Lanie (Laura Mennell) is getting married. Not wanting to miss the wedding, Ruslan catches the red eye to New Jersey and heads into Trenton to see Lanie, who is an attorney in the D.A.'s office in Trenton. Ruslan is somewhat concerned that Lanie is marrying Stephan Abramov (Dmitry Chepovetsky), the son of Mikhail Abramov (Igor Jijikine), the brutal boss of the local Russian mob outfit. Later on, Ruslan finds that Catherine is now married to wealthy local defense attorney Terry Goldstein (Robert Wisden). Lanie tells Ruslan that Terry is a jerk. Ruslan pulls Stephen to the side, and Stephen assures Ruslan that he has no interest of joining the family business and just wants to love his new wife and start a new life. After everyone but Catherine and Lanie leaves to go to the church where the wedding will take place, A pair of men break in, stab Catherine to death, and then stab Lanie, leaving her in critical condition. Detective Norden (Ingrid Torrance) and Detective Lavastic (Zak Santiago) are heading the investigation. It was made to look like a robbery, but Ruslan knows full well that it was not a robbery. At East Lawn Hospital, Dr. Brown (Linda Minard) tells Ruslan that she expects Lanie to recover. Ruslan starts his own investigation and learns that Mikhail, who hates Ruslan, was behind the attack. Terry, who is Mikhail\`s attorney, is also in on it. Mikhail despised the thought of Stephan marrying a prosecuting attorney instead of following in Mikhail's footsteps, and Catherine was about to blow the whistle on some of Terry's corrupt activities. However, Ruslan is willing to do whatever it takes to make Mikhail and Terry pay for what they did.

Question: I can use this background: When waves travel into areas of shallow water, they begin to be affected by the ocean bottom. The free orbital motion of the water is disrupted, and water particles in orbital motion no longer return to their original position. As the water becomes shallower, the swell becomes higher and steeper, ultimately assuming the familiar sharp-crested wave shape. After the wave breaks, it becomes a wave of translation and erosion of the ocean bottom intensifies. Now, I have a new situation: Most surfers used Wide beach because of the areas of shallow water, but some surfers were happy with Sandy beach, although the water was much deeper at the shore there. Answer this question please: Which beach experiences a more intense erosion of the ocean bottom? Answer:","completion":"Wide beach experiences a more intense erosion of the ocean bottom. This is because, as mentioned in the background, when waves travel into areas of shallow water, they become higher and steeper, ultimately breaking and turning into waves of translation. This process leads to an intensification of erosion at the ocean bottom. Since Wide beach has areas of shallow water, the erosion will be more intense there compared to Sandy beach, where the water is much deeper at the shore."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Process: - Carbon dioxide from the air passes through small pores (holes) in the leaves - These pores are called stomata - Water is absorbed by the roots and passes through vessels in the stem on its way to the leaves - Chlorophyll absorbs the sun&#x27;s energy - It is this energy that is used to split water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen - Oxygen is released from the leaves into the atmosphere - Hydrogen and carbon dioxide are used to form glucose or food for plants.

Researchers tested how long it took participants to switch from one cognitive task to another, something that's known to take longer for older adults, said lead researcher, Brian Gold, a neuroscientist at the University of Kentucky. Gold's team compared task-switching speeds for younger and older adults, knowing they would find slower speeds in the older population because of previous studies. However, they found that older adults who spoke two languages were able to switch mental activities faster than those didn't . The study only looked at life-long bilinguals, defined in study as people who had spoken a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old. Gold and his team asked 30 people, either bilingual or monolingual , to have a series of tests. They found that bilingual people were not only able to switch tasks faster, they had different brain activity than their monolingual peers. Kristina called bilingualism \\"a beautiful natural experiment\\", because people grow up speaking two languages,and studies have shown that they get certain cognitive benefits from switching between languages and determining which to respond with based on what's going on around them. Gold said he grew up in Montreal, where he spoke French at school and English at home, prompting relatives to question whether his French language immersion would somehow hinder his ability to learn English. \\"Until very recently, learning a second language in childhood was thought of as dangerous,\\" he said. \\"Actually, it's beneficial. \\" Options: A Older bilinguals can't respond faster in mind. B Older adults speaking a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old can respond faster than those who don't. C Young bilinguals can respond faster in mind than those monolinguals. D Bilingual children respond slower in mind than those monolinguals. Answer: B Older adults speaking a second language daily since they were at least 10 years old can respond faster than those who don't.

Choices: A. no; B. yes;","completion":"In order to answer your questions, I will analyze them one by one. 1. Which colour is good in Maruti Suzuki Baleno? For this question, I need to consider personal preferences and what people generally find appealing in cars, particularly in the Maruti Suzuki Baleno. Step 1: Look for popular choices and trends. Taking into account general opinions and trends, I notice that people often prefer neutral or metallic colors for cars. Step 2: Assess the Maruti Suzuki Baleno model. The Maruti Suzuki Baleno has a sleek and modern design. Thus, a color that accentuates those aspects would be a good choice for this model. Step 3: Make a color suggestion. Considering the popular tendencies and the design of the car, a metallic or neutral color like Silver, Grey, or White might be a good choice for the Maruti Suzuki Baleno. But ultimately, it depends on your personal preference. 2. Is premium silver colour in Maruti Baleno a great choice? For this question, I must evaluate if the silver color is a good option specifically for the Maruti Baleno. Step 1: Analyze the car's design. As previously mentioned, the Maruti Baleno has a sleek and modern design. Step 2: Consider the premium silver color. Premium silver is a metallic color that can emphasize the modern and luxurious aspect of a car. Step 3: Determine if premium silver is a great choice. Yes, premium silver can be a great choice for the Maruti Suzuki Baleno, as it complements the car's design and adds a sense of luxury. 3. Do those questions have the same meaning? Now, I must compare the two questions to determine if they both have the same meaning. Question 1: Asks for a good color choice in general for the Maruti Suzuki Baleno.

Are these two questions asking the same thing? OPTIONS: [1]. no; [2]. yes;","completion":"First, I will address the first question: What size is the best for logos? Step 1: Consider the context in which the logo will be used. Different sizes may be appropriate for different contexts, such as websites, business cards, or merchandise. It's important to take into consideration where the logo will be displayed primarily. Step 2: Determine the recommended size for the specific context. Generally, a logo should be clear and recognizable at both small and large sizes. For digital use, a logo size of 600 x 600 pixels is a good starting point. However, vector formats (such as SVG or EPS) are ideal because they can be resized without loss of quality. It's also crucial to consider the aspect ratio of the logo, which should be proportional and visually balanced. Now, I will address the second question: What are the little known things about some famous logos? Step 1: Research various famous logos. To answer this question, it's necessary to look into the history and design of multiple famous logos, such as Apple, Nike, Starbucks, and McDonald's. Step 2: Identify little known facts about these logos. This would involve going beyond the common knowledge about these logos and finding lesser-known details. For example, the Apple logo's designer claimed that the bite in the apple was added only to clarify that it's an apple and not a tomato, or that the FedEx logo has a hidden arrow in the space between the \\"E\\" and the \\"x.\\" Finally, I will determine whether or not these two questions are asking the same thing. Upon evaluating both questions, I see that the first question is about the ideal size for logos, while the second question pertains to lesser-known facts about famous logos.

Here are the steps I took to confirm this information: 1. I used my pre-existing knowledge to know that Bob Geldof is a prominent musician and activist, who has frequently used his work to respond to real-world events. 2. I accessed available data on his discography and lyrics to check for any content that might have been a response to Brenda Ann Spencer's crime. In this case, \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\" was the immediate candidate because I know it deals with school violence. 3. I verified the historical accuracy, Geldof has spoken publicly about the song being inspired by Spencer's shooting. 4. I also cross-checked the date of the attempt and the release of the song. The shooting happened in January 1979, and \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\" was released in July 1979. 5.

I should get used to walking here alone, right?\\" The sentence in Czech can be translated to the aforementioned phrase in English. Let me provide you with a detailed analysis of the translation: 1. Není to bezpečné - The phrase \\"Není to bezpečné\\" may be translated to \\"It's not safe\\" in English. \\"Není\\" means \\"it is not\\", \\"to\\" stands for \\"this\\" or \\"it\\", and \\"bezpečné\\" translates to \\"safe.\\" 2. Proč ne? - The question \\"Proč ne?\\" translates as \\"Why not?\\" in English. \\"Proč\\" signifies \\"why\\" and \\"ne\\" denotes \\"not\\". 3. Měla bych si zvyknout chodit tady sama, ne? - This part of the sentence can be translated to \\"I should get used to walking here alone, right?\\" in English. Breaking down the phrase: \\"Měla bych\\" translates to \\"I should\\", \\"si zvyknout\\" means \\"get used to\\", \\"chodit\\" refers to \\"walking\\", \\"tady\\" corresponds to \\"here\\", \\"sama\\" represents \\"alone\\", and the final \\"ne\\" in a question form denotes confirmation, similar to the English word \\"right\\" or \\"isn't it\\".

In forests, precipitation exceeds evapotranspiration which results in an excess of water that percolates downward through the soil layers. Slow rates of decomposition leads to large amounts of fulvic acid, greatly enhancing chemical weathering. The downward percolation, in conjunction with chemical weathering leaches magnesium (Mg), iron (Fe), and aluminum (Al) from the soil and transports them downward, a process known as podzolization. This process leads to marked contrasts in the appearance and chemistry of the soil layers. I am facing a new situation today: Brad and Frank are two cousins. they both own land in the same county.

Does \\"In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes.\\" correctly answer the question of What type of study uses medical imaging techniques to correlate changes in brain structure?","completion":"No, the statement \\"In recent years, the development of immunostaining techniques has allowed investigation of neurons that express specific sets of genes\\" does not correctly answer the question of what type of study uses medical imaging techniques to correlate changes in brain structure. The statement focuses on immunostaining techniques as a way to investigate specific gene expressions in neurons, rather than medical imaging techniques that correlate changes in brain structure. The question is asking about a type of study that involves the use of medical imaging techniques to investigate changes in the brain's structure, which is generally related to neuroimaging or brain imaging studies. Neuroimaging is a research area that noninvasively captures images of the brain and studies how it works, its anatomy, and the processes and functions happening within. It has become an essential part of understanding the complex relationships within the brain related to cognition, behavior, and disorders. Different imaging techniques have been developed to examine different aspects of the brain. There are two main categories: 1. Structural imaging techniques: These techniques allow us to visualize the anatomical structure of the brain, such as the size, shape, and composition of different brain regions. Examples of such methods include: - Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI): MRI is a noninvasive imaging technique that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create detailed images of the brain. It can visualize various brain structures and provide high-resolution 3D images. - Computed Tomography (CT): CT is another noninvasive imaging method that uses x-rays to create cross-sectional images of the brain. It provides information about the brain's structure but has lower resolution compared to MRI. 2. Functional imaging techniques: These techniques capture the brain's activity and changes in the processes that occur within it. Examples include: - Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI): fMRI is a variation of MRI that measures brain activity by detecting changes in blood flow. It can help researchers understand how different brain regions are involved in specific cognitive processes or behaviors. - Positron Emission Tomography (PET): PET is a functional imaging technique that uses radioactive tracers to map metabolic processes in the brain. It can provide insight into how the brain functions by tracking the activity of various molecules that are critical for brain function. A particular neuroimaging study may use one or a combination of these techniques, depending on the research question or clinical goal. Therefore, a study that uses medical imaging techniques to correlate changes in brain structure would most likely employ structural imaging techniques such as MRI or CT scans. It is important to note that while immunostaining techniques have contributed significantly to the understanding of distinct cell populations in the brain and gene expression, they are not considered medical imaging techniques that directly correlate with changes in brain structure. Immunostaining is more focused on the molecular level, providing evidence of gene expression patterns in specific cell types within the brain."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Build a movie plot around this: At Windward house, Stella finds who in the studio? Her grandfather. Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"Echoes of Windward\\" Genre: Mystery, Drama Setting: A small coastal town with a rich history of shipwrecks, smugglers, and hidden treasures. Plot summary: Stella, a young writer, leaves the city behind and returns to her childhood home, Windward House, in search of creative inspiration. Finding her grandfather's abandoned art studio, Stella discovers more than she bargained for -- her grandfather's unresolved story and a secret about their family history. As Stella begins to uncover the truth, she becomes entangled in a decades-old mystery that calls into question everything she thought she knew about her past and her future. Detailed Plot: Act 1: Stella, a young and aspiring writer, finds herself struggling with writer's block in the bustling city. Realizing she needs a change of scenery, she takes a break from her busy life and returns to her small, secluded coastal hometown, where her grandparents' old Windward House resides. Upon arrival, the serene atmosphere and natural beauty of the seaside town quickly captivate Stella. While unpacking and exploring the old Windward House, she finds a dusty key that leads her to a secret door hidden behind an old bookshelf. As she opens the door, she discovers her late grandfather's abandoned art studio, which has been left untouched for decades. Act 2: Curiosity piqued, Stella begins to explore the many unfinished paintings and sketches of ships, mysterious figures, and maritime landscapes that fill the studio. Among the paintings, she uncovers an old diary belonging to her grandfather, which reveals his work as an unofficial investigator into multiple unsolved shipwrecks and the smuggling activities in the town. Intrigued, she starts reading the diary and learning about her grandfather's passion for solving these mysteries. While reading the diary, she stumbles upon a cryptic message written in a coded language she doesn't understand. Determined to decipher the code, Stella seeks out the help of a local historian, Thomas, who is more than willing to assist her and shares his knowledge of the town's history, including the various smuggling operations and legendary shipwrecks. As they work together, Stella and Thomas grow closer, unravelling the story of her grandfather's dedication to exposing the truth. Slowly, they discover that Stella's own family may have had some involvement with the smuggling group, which ultimately led to her grandfather distancing himself from the family. Act 3: As Stella delves deeper into the town's history and her family's connection to it, she begins to put the pieces together. She discovers that her ancestors played a significant role in the smuggling operations and that the Windward House itself had once been a secret haven for stolen treasures. Further investigation proves that her grandfather was a one-man force against the smuggling group his family was involved in. Stella eventually unearths a hidden chamber in the home containing her grandfather's carefully preserved annotations and evidence against the smuggling ring. However, her ancestors were never brought to justice, as her grandfather faced a traumatic event that forced him to abandon his work and become a recluse. In an emotional climax, Stella and Thomas, with the help of the local community, manage to solve the remaining mysteries and posthumously close her grandfather's investigation. They expose the long-held secrets of the town and ensure the truth is finally brought to light. As Stella's time in the town comes to an end, she realizes the adventure has given her the inspiration she needed. She begins writing a book about her journey, her newfound connection to her grandparents, and the extraordinary story of the Windward House. Epilogue: \\"Echoes of Windward\\" becomes a bestseller, and Stella finds closure in revisiting her roots. She reconciles her family's past and embraces her family's artistic and curious nature. With the support of the town, Windward House is transformed into an art and cultural center, preserving the legacy of Stella's grandfather and the rich history of the small coastal town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

What is the sentiment of the following movie review sentence? so recognizable and true that , as in real life , we 're never sure how things will work out","completion":"To determine the sentiment of the given movie review sentence, I will utilize sentiment analysis, which is a sub-field of natural language processing (NLP). Sentiment analysis is the computational study of people's opinions, attitudes, and emotions toward an entity such as a movie or service. Let's perform sentiment analysis on the given sentence and justify the steps in the analysis. 1. Preprocessing the sentence: In this case, the sentence is already properly formatted and doesn't contain any special characters or irrelevant words which could potentially skew the analysis. Step 1 is therefore: “No further preprocessing needed.” 2. Understanding the sentence context: \\"so recognizable and true that, as in real life, we're never sure how things will work out\\". In general, it seems like the reviewer is comparing the movie to real life and saying that it's so genuine and understandable that, like in life, we cannot predict the outcome. There doesn't seem to be any explicitly negative or positive sentiment but rather a sense of uncertainty, realism, and authenticity which could be perceived mainly as positive. 3. Determining sentiment based on context: There are no negative words in the sentence. Words such as \\"recognizable\\" and \\"true\\" express positive sentiments. The general uncertainty about the outcome may create suspense but does not imply negative feelings. Thus, the sentiment expressed seems to be mostly positive. Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the movie review sentence appears to be positive. Providing a more accurate result would require a more complex analysis, potentially leveraging machine learning techniques and large sets of training data to better capture the nuances of human language."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Is “Thor” getting dumber, or am I? I’m not referring to the Marvel superhero (Chris Hemsworth), a muscle-bound blond himbo whom no one has ever called a deep thinker, but to the movie franchise itself. With the release of “The Dark World,” the second film in the series about the hammer-wielding Norse god — or the third if you count “The Avengers” — I’m left with way more questions than I can answer. For example, if Thor’s homeland of Asgard has the technology to defend itself from space invaders with long-range artillery and jet fighters, as we see in the film, why do Asgardian foot soldiers still run around with medieval swords and daggers? And exactly how and when did the Bifrost get repaired? That magical bridge between Asgard and Earth was, as everyone knows, destroyed utterly at the end of the first film. It was still out of commission in “The Avengers,” leading the screenwriters to offer a bogus explanation for Thor’s appearance in New York City as the result of his father, Odin (Anthony Hopkins), pulling some strings. Huh? In the new film, the rainbow highway is suddenly good to go again, with no explanation. Are Thor and his family divine or aren’t they? “We’re not gods,” Odin says to his son Loki (Tom Hiddleston) in what may be the biggest bombshell ever to drop in the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). Oh really? Someone might want to tell creator Stan Lee, who has specifically referred to the Asgardians as divine beings. But most important, why do the Dark Elves — the bad guys in “The Dark World” — look so much like angry Teletubbies? Ow, my head. “The Dark World” opens with Thor’s villainous brother, Loki, defeated and in chains; with Thor’s human girlfriend, Jane (Natalie Portman), pining for her absent lover; and with Thor preoccupied with stamping out uprisings on various of the nine realms that he and his kind rule over. So far so good. But when Jane stumbles upon something called the Aether — a long-hidden source of destructive energy, which takes over her body like a virus — Thor must drop everything and return to Earth in order to protect her from Malekith (Christopher Eccleston). The evil leader of the Dark Elves, Malekith wants to use the Aether to — well, what exactly? Control the nine realms? Destroy them? Plunge them into darkness so he can harvest mushrooms? Whatever it is, it isn’t good. To be fair, there’s stuff to like in “The Dark World.” Loki, for example — whom Thor must reluctantly team with in his fight against the Dark Elves — is simply fabulous. Hiddleston steals the show here, making wickedness and treachery look a heck of a lot more fun than virtue. Cinematically, there’s also a great scene in which a flotilla of Asgardian funeral barges are lit afire with flaming arrows as they approach a waterfall. Sure, it’s probably entirely CGI, but it’s gorgeous all the same, especially in 3-D, and surprisingly moving. In general, though, the action scenes are only okay. There is, however, one genuinely jaw-dropping bit of violence that startled me, especially for a comic-book movie. Oh, and let’s not forget Odin’s facial hair. His white beard is magnificent, particularly the mustache, which wriggles down along the sides of his mouth in sinuous testimony to the skill of his Asgardian barber — or the film’s makeup department, which numbered 67 people. Odin may not be a god, but he has divine whiskers. See? That’s the problem with “The Dark World.” If I’m spending that much time studying Odin’s grooming, there’s something wrong with the story, which is kind of slow to get going and features too many undeveloped threads. What’s up with the jealousy, for instance, between the warrior Lady Sif (Jaimie Alexander) and Jane? After Thor brings Jane to Asgard, the two women shoot each other a couple of nasty looks. But otherwise the dynamic goes nowhere. Do something with it, or drop it. There’s some humor, too, but far too little for my taste. This is especially disappointing after the first film, which made much of the culture shock experienced by contemporary earthlings who encounter a dude who drops out of the sky looking and talking like a Rennfest staffer who takes his job a little too seriously. And that’s the real flaw with “The Dark World,” which seems to have inhaled a bit too much of its own noxious Aether. The only one who seems to have gotten the memo that the whole thing is a gas is the bad guy. ★ ★ PG-13. At area theaters. Contains action violence.

The road map for the film seemed clear. It would follow the unexpected comeback, while exploring the question of what was driving the man who had recovered from a near-fatal illness, stonewalled ceaseless accusations of doping and, against all odds—and logic—won the Tour de France seven times in a row. But the work in progress changed when, early this year, Armstrong admitted to Oprah Winfrey that he had been doping all along. The filmmaker retooled his film accordingly, and retitled it \\"The Armstrong Lie.\\" He might also have called it \\"The Tooth Fairy,\\" since part of the fascination is why we ever believed the story the pedaler was peddling. Watch a clip from the documentary film \\"The Armstrong Lie,\\" chronicling sports legend Lance Armstrong's improbable rise and ultimate fall from grace. (Photo/Video: Sony Pictures Classics) Watching the final version of the documentary means seeing elements of the earlier version in a new light, with the supposed hero as a peerless liar who insisted on his spotlessness even as professional cycling as a whole proved to be a dirty sport. Some of those elements will be familiar to those who have followed Armstrong's doubt-shadowed triumphs and shattering disgrace—the fury he unleashed against his perceived enemies (\\"He was an immensely intimidating person,\\" one interview subject recalls); the evolution of doping techniques from drugs to transfusions in order to avoid detection; the greedy hypocrisy of cycling officials; the long-standing code of silence among teammates and associates who finally turned on their team's leader. Still, \\"The Armstrong Lie\\" is truly singular, a tale of ambition that's almost mad enough to be mythic. \\"The Armstrong Lie\\" is a grimly fascinating tale of ambition that's almost mad enough to be mythic, says WSJ Film Critic Joe Morgenstern. Photo: Sony Pictures Classics. Lance Armstrong, the movie notes, came out of Plano, Texas as an angry, competitive kid: \\"I love beatin' people,\\" the kid says, putting it plainly, if mildly. Yet the figurative beatings he inflicted were no greater than the punishments he endured almost two decades ago from testicular cancer that spread to his abdomen, lungs and brain. Film clips from that time remind us of how Armstrong's illness, his remarkable recovery and the philanthropic foundation he created all served to inoculate him against suspicions of doping that were already swirling around him. We believed, or at least half-believed, his protestations of purity because we didn't want to believe that someone who'd been through such medical tortures would endanger his health yet again, much less lie about it. And because, as the film shows vividly, his ambition to win—to punish, to crush, to prevail—transcended ordinary comprehension. Was he nothing more than a compulsive liar? Mr. Gibney's footage suggests otherwise. One of the most interesting parts of the film turns on the evident sincerity of Armstrong's postretirement attempt to win the 2009 Tour de France by riding clean. He failed, though his third-place finish was, as the filmmaker puts it, \\"the perfect ending for the film I wanted to make.\\" In the film he did make, his subject tells the truth only after the evidence against him has become so overwhelming as to make him a pariah in the sport he managed to dominate for 10 years. \\"The Armstrong Lie\\" wears thin before it's over; the wafer-thin nature of the cyclist's personality can't sustain a two-hour running time. Toward the end, though, there's a revelatory moment that requires close attention. It's in one of the clips from the Winfrey interview, after Armstrong has confessed. \\"Did you feel in any way that you were cheating?\\" Oprah asks. He nods his head almost imperceptibly, meaning yes, and says \\"No.\\" At least one of his reflexes is still sharp. Watch a clip from the film \\"Thor: The Dark World.\\" Faced with an enemy that even Odin and Asgard cannot withstand, Thor must embark on his most perilous and personal journey yet. (Photo: Marvel) 'Thor: The Dark World' Under a photo of Chris Hemsworth and Natalie Portman on the Facebook site for \\"Thor: The Dark World,\\" a fan has posted the comment \\"They're so beautiful, it hurts.\\" Well, they really are beautiful, these two—Mr. Hemsworth's Thor, the God of Thunder who goes after bad guys with his trusty hammer, and Ms. Portman's Jane, Thor's across-the-universe girlfriend. In the previous episode, Jane, an astrophysicist, was much concerned about resolving her particle data. In this one she's worried that \\"physics is going to go ballistic, the very walls of reality will be torn apart,\\" because the nine realms of the physical world are in convergence and a race of baddies called Dark Elves have a weapon called the Aether that can destroy every corner of creation, including our own. That's a problem, to be sure, but the larger problem, transcending all realms, is that this action-adventure sequel from Marvel soon turns so dumb and 3-D-murky that it hurts. Chris Hemsworth in Marvel's 'Thor: The Dark World' Marvel Most of the action is generic, though sufficiently straightforward to provide relief from the incoherent storytelling. Which realm are we in now? Where were we a moment ago, and how did everyone get here? Such questions seem not to have troubled the writers or producers. As for the director, Alan Taylor, he has done a lot of top-drawer television, including episodes of \\"Game of Thrones,\\" but there's no sign he has a feel for feature films; his emphasis is entirely on big set pieces at the expense of narrative flow. Tom Hiddleston is entertaining once again as Loki, Thor's evil brother. Anthony Hopkins is orotund once again as Thor's father, King Odin. Idris Elba has returned as Heimdall, the omnipotent sentry who, for lack of much else to do, gives new meaning to the notion of watchful waiting. And in a film that's often sillier than it wants to be, Stellan Skarsgård is back with intentional silliness as the physicist Erik Selvig, who turns up this time as a flasher at Stonehenge.

Enlarge Image Close Saoirse Ronan and George MacKay in 'How I Live Now' Magnolia Pictures Ms. Ronan grows in screen presence, and grace, as her character opens up—the movie's central notion is that Daisy will be healed by her grueling trials—and the story profits, somewhat, from its outward resemblance to the \\"Hunger Games\\" saga.

The timing of the Great Depression varied across nations; in most countries it started in 1929 and lasted until the late 1930s. It was the longest, deepest, and most widespread depression of the 20th century. In the 21st century, the Great Depression is commonly used as an example of how far the world's economy can decline. - Film noir is a cinematic term used primarily to describe stylish Hollywood crime dramas, particularly such that emphasize cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. Hollywood's classical film noir period is generally regarded as extending from the early 1940s to the late 1950s. Film noir of this era is associated with a low-key black-and-white visual style that has roots in German Expressionist cinematography. Many of the prototypical stories and much of the attitude of classic noir derive from the hardboiled school of crime fiction that emerged in the United States during the Great Depression. - Charles Patrick Ryan O'Neal (born April 20, 1941), known professionally as Ryan O'Neal, is an American actor and former boxer. O'Neal trained as an amateur boxer before beginning his career in acting in 1960. In 1964, he landed the role of Rodney Harrington on the ABC nighttime soap opera \\"Peyton Place\\".

Article: On 22nd January, 2007, Dave Cornthwaite from the UK became the first person to skateboard across Australia. He made a new world record, by skating a total of 5,823 kilometers. Jack Smith, the previous champion, had skated a total of 4,830 kilometers across the US in 2003. Dave's journey started in Perth and ended in Brisbane traveling about 60 kilometers a day. It took him five months and 13 pairs of shoes. He had great physical pain and he got really sore feet. If Dave hadn't believed in making his dreams come true, none of this would have happened. Dave left his job two weeks after he had bought a skateboard and decided to go on a journey. He wanted this journey to be about something more than him, so he created an association that would raise money for charities. \\"If people follow my journey and donations, then I'm doing many people a lot of good,\\" said Dave. This journey had plenty of challenges. He traveled across the Australian desert where temperatures reached 48degC in the day and 0degC at night. He had a serious accident in Adelaide when he jumped on a piece of metal that cut through his foot. Dave helped raise more than PS50,000 for children's charities, wrote a book and encouraged others to follow in his footsteps. I wish we had more people like him leading the way!

Q:You are presented with the question \\" fungi do what with materials using moving water, wind, or other organisms.\\" and the following answer choices: - loose soil - allow growth - disperse - use oxygen - mineralize - grow - recycling - produce carbon Now knowing that spores may be dispersed by moving water, wind, or other organisms and most fungi disperse their spores by wind, choose the best answer. A:","completion":"The best answer to the question \\"fungi do what with materials using moving water, wind, or other organisms.\\" would be \\"disperse.\\" Fungi produce spores, which are microscopic reproductive cells essential for their survival and propagation. These spores are dispersed through various means, such as moving water, wind, or other organisms, to reach favorable environments where they can germinate and grow. This process allows fungi to colonize new habitats, find new sources of food and nutrients, and ensure their survival by spreading their genetic material across a wider geographical range. By dispersing spores, fungi can access areas where competition for resources such as nutrients and space may be less intense, which can improve their chances of successfully reproducing and establishing a new population. In particular, wind dispersal is a common strategy among fungi because it allows spores to travel long distances without investing any energy in the process. Some fungi form specialized structures, such as mushroom caps or puffball casings, which help to release large quantities of spores that can be easily caught by the wind. Alternatively, water dispersal can be essential for some aquatic fungi or for those which inhabit very moist environments, where moving water can transport spores more efficiently. Other organisms can also play a role in the dispersal of fungal spores. Animals may inadvertently carry spores on their fur, skin, or exoskeletons, or ingest spores with their food, which can later be released in new locations via their feces. Some fungi even form mutualistic associations with animals, relying on their mobility to spread their spores more effectively. In summary, fungi disperse their spores using moving water, wind, or other organisms to ensure their survival, growth, and reproduction in new environments. This is a critical process for fungi to establish in various habitats and access new resources."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well. Help as much as you can.

The new rules extend existing anti-smoking regulations to more places, including fitness centers, cultural relic sites, offices, meeting rooms, dining halls, toilets and lifts. Restaurants, Internet cafes, parks, and waiting halls at airports, railway stations and coach stations are required to set up smoking areas. Hotels will have to offer smoke-free rooms or floors, but the regulations do not specify a proportion. However, some restaurant owners have complained that it would be difficult to have a separate smoking room as required by the new regulations. \\"We plan to issue specific rules to solve this problem as soon as possible,\\" Rao Yingsheng, vice-director of the Beijing Committee for Patriotic Public Health Campaign, was quoted by the Beijing News as saying Thursday. He said small restaurants without a separate room should set aside at least 70 percent of their area for non-smokers. He also said customers and restaurant owners would be asked for their thoughts on the new rule. Local authorities dispatched about 100,000 inspectors to make sure the ban was being enforced Thursday. Everyone has the right to dissuade people from smoking in public places, Liu Zejun, who works for the Beijing committee, said. \\"Citizens are encouraged to expose those who refuse to obey the rule by calling the free telephone line 12320,\\" Liu said.

It's a friendly way that people in the USA greet each other. But \\"How are you\\" is also a very unusual question. It's a question that often doesn't need an answer. The person who asks \\"How are you?\\" hopes to hear the answer \\" Fine\\", even if the person's friend isn't fine. The reason is that \\"How are you?\\" isn't really a question and \\"Fine\\" isn't really an answer. They are simply other ways of saying \\"Hello\\" or \\"Hi\\". Sometimes, people also don't say exactly what they mean. For example, when someone asks \\"Do you agree?\\" the other person might think, \\"No, I disagree.

Question: I read this background article the other day: As for the public health or food safety concern, organic foods are intended to be healthy, free of contaminations and free from agents that could cause human diseases. Organic milk is meant to have no chemical residues to consumers, and the restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production has the purpose to accomplish this goal. Although dairy cows in both organic and conventional farming practices can be exposed to pathogens, it has been shown that, because antibiotics are not permitted as a preventative measure in organic practices, there are far fewer antibiotic resistant pathogens on organic farms. This dramatically increases the efficacy of antibiotics when/if they are necessary. I am facing a new situation today: Manny and Annie were two foodie friends. Manny was a health conscious person, he ate organic foods and drank organic milk only. Annie liked all foods, whether they were organic or not. Using the knowledge I acquired from the background article, how should I answer correctly the following question regarding my new situation: Which friend drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics? Answer:","completion":"Based on the background article and the given situation, we can break down the key points and determine the correct answer step by step: 1. Organic foods are intended to be free of contaminations and agents that could cause human diseases. 2. Organic milk should have no chemical residues to consumers due to restrictions on the use of antibiotics and chemicals in organic food production. 3. Antibiotic resistance is lower in organic farming practices compared to conventional practices as antibiotics are not used as a preventive measure. 4. Manny consumes organic food and drinks organic milk only. 5. Annie consumes all foods, whether organic or not, implying that her milk consumption is not limited to organic sources. Based on these points, we can conclude that Manny drank less milk from cows treated with antibiotics because he only consumed organic milk, which is produced with stricter restrictions against the use of antibiotics. On the other hand, Annie consumed milk from both organic and non-organic sources, making it more likely that she consumed milk from cows treated with antibiotics."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

We went to Long Animal Hospital for a couple of years and had to stop going over a series of really bad encounters and mishaps. They are a well-established clinic in a good location; however, it is a bit run-down and you'll definitely see rusting, paint chipping and questionable cleanliness if you go often enough. We haven't been there in a few years, however, Dr. Killough, Sr stands out as a vet we would never go to again after the very rough handling we experienced with our older, very sweet and gentle, greyhound. He treated her like she was a truck on an assembly line and after that visit alone, she started getting panic attacks everytime we would go thereafter (it was her first time seeing Dr. Killough, Sr after going to the practice for over 3 years). Second, they \\"forgot\\" to give her a Bordatella vaccination (for over 3 years) even though we saw them regularly, we had her original paperwork/vaccination schedule sent when we first got her and they did her vaccinations each year. We were going on a weekend trip and keeping her at a boarding facility, had their vaccinations sent over and the facility promptly called us to tell us she didn't have her Bordatella - kind of important. Third, they prescribed incorrect dosages to our 2nd greyhound who had heart issues. In fact, they diagnosed him with all his heart issues and kept putting him on different meds - each time we would go in, their diagnosis would change (his heart murmur went from a grade 2 to a grade 6, then to a 5) - he had high blood pressure, then he didn't, then he did again. He had an enlarged heart, then it was normal (ex-racers are naturally larger) and then it was again. Get the picture? We took him to NCSU vet school and they said it was around a grade 4 and that his medication strengths were all off. They sent all the results and paperwork back to Long's. I am guessing they didn't read it, because our next visit to Long's, they re-upped his medications (he was on 3 different medications). He started having kidney issues (and what dog wouldn't on all those meds?) and the prescription bottle dosage changed *again* -- I called them and they had no idea what dosage he was on, or what he should be on or why this bottle was different than the last. I asked them to review what NCSU sent over, which they did, and I had to go back, again, to get his \\"true\\" medications and dosages. What a mess. We later took him to a canine cardiologist in Charlotte (she had just started practicing here) and she was appalled at all the changes in his diagnoses, medications and dosages. His health definitely suffered as a result of inadequate care and he died, of heart failure, when he was barely 8 years old. Long's just wasn't capable of treating his condition. By the time we were forced to leave, both our dogs were having panic attacks when going there (something they didn't have at first, and didn't have at the next vet clinic we went to). We didn't have a regular vet, we saw all of them there and perhaps that is why they never seemed to know what the heck had gone on with our dogs before that visit (we ended up having to tell them our dogs' histories, which sucks, since THEY had their records). Maybe they were too busy to read charts, maybe we got them on bad days, I don't know - but I believe a vet should at least skim an animal's record before walking in and seeing them again. Why should I have to tell you what meds my dog is on? Why should I have to tell them what they diagnosed last time? Finally, we never used them for boarding, but the boarding conditions are insanely bad. They are outdoor cages attached to the main clinic building. Dogs were completely exposed to the elements AND to anyone walking to the backside of the clinic. Perhaps they've upgraded in the last couple years, but even if they have, I find it pretty bothersome that dogs would sit in a cage in winter, the dead of summer, through rainstorms and potentially have some random person do something to them because they are in outdoor cages. I could never understand how anyone could leave their dog in those conditions. We didn't try them one time, have one bad experience, and leave - we went there for over three years and it was one headache after another. I will say that the front office staff were all incredibly nice. They knew our dogs by name within a visit or two and were very welcoming when we came. We also had some good experiences with the vets there, which is why we went there for so long -- but the bad experiences, in the end, outweighed the good and we left. We aren't looking for anything fancy-schmancy (as another reviewer mentioned) - but we expect them to know what's going on with our dogs, diagnose them correctly, give them correct meds with correct doses, have a clean practice and humane boarding conditions -- oh, and maybe be gentle with the animals when necessary. Is that too much to ask? What is the sentiment of this review?","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer experienced multiple issues and dissatisfaction with the veterinary clinic, including concerns about cleanliness, inconsistent diagnosis and treatment, and inadequate boarding conditions. The only positive aspect mentioned was the friendliness of the front office staff."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. User will you give you a task.

Q: What process is at work when warm air or water rises, and cool air or water sinks? Choices: - evaporation - radiation - moisture - convection A:","completion":"The process at work when warm air or water rises, and cool air or water sinks is convection. Here's a step-by-step justification of this choice: 1. In the context of physics and meteorology, there are three primary methods of heat transfer: convection, conduction, and radiation. 2. Evaporation is the process by which water changes from a liquid state to a gas or vapor, so it doesn't have much to do with the rising or sinking of warm or cool air/ water. 3. Radiation is the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles, especially high-energy particles that cause ionization, and it's not about the movement of warm or cool air/water. 4. Moisture doesn't explain the physics behind the rise of warm air or water, or the sinking of cool air or water. 5. Convection, in contrast, involves the movement of heat within a gas or liquid. In the case of convection, heat is transferred by the mass movement of molecules from one place to another. When a fluid such as air or water is heated, its molecules move faster and they become less dense, and thus rise. Conversely, when the fluid is cooled, it becomes denser and falls. Therefore, the correct choice is convection."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation. Think like you are answering to a five year old. Write a title for this article: There is no sign so far that GE’s design is to blame for any of the plant’s problems, which mainly have been the result of power failures after the massive earthquake and tsunami that slammed the area Friday. The containment structure is holding up. Some experts said that if the situation deteriorates at the nuclear plant, GE’s design — known as the Boiling Water Reactor Mark 1 — may not withstand the massive amount of hydrogen gas that could be released. “We’re not at that point yet,” said Paul Gunter, director of the Reactor Oversight Project at Beyond Nuclear. “But these vessels are brittle. They were going to retire Fukushima Daiichi in just a few more months, and so this particular Mark 1 with its substandard design was reaching its endlife, and so it raises a lot of concerns.” GE defended its technology on Monday while it offered engineers to help Japanese officials contain the crisis. “The BWR Mark 1 reactor is the industry’s workhorse with a proven track record of safety and reliability for more than 40 years,” GE said in a statement. “Today, there are 32 BWR Mark 1 reactors operating as designed worldwide. There has never been a breach of a Mark 1 containment system.” GE’s design is unique. The company specializes in boiling water reactor systems — in contrast to the pressurized water technology produced by rivals such as Westinghouse and Ariva. Two-thirds of the nuclear plants in the United States rely on pressurized water technology, according to Edward Blandford, a researcher who focuses on nuclear reactor design at Stanford’s Center for International Security and Cooperation. In 1986, a top official at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission raised concerns about the GE containment system’s design. “I don’t have the same warm feeling about GE containment that I do about the larger dry containments,’’ said Harold Denton, director of NRC’s Office of Nuclear Reactor Regulation during an industry conference, according to a report at the time by the publication, Inside N.R.C. “There has been a lot of work done on those containments, but Mark I containments . . . you’ll find something like a 90 percent probability of that containment failing.’’ “There is a wide spectrum of ability to cope with severe accidents at GE plants,’’ Denton said. “And I urge you to think seriously about the ability to cope with such an event if it occurred at your plant.’’ GE’s Mark 1 containment system was designed to withstand discrete problems known as design basis accidents, such as a broken pipe releasing hot steam, said Ken Bergeron, a physicist and former scientist with the Sandia National Laboratories, where he worked on nuclear reactor accident simulation. “Unfortunately, some of the shortcuts that were taken to accommodate the design basis accident at a fairly low cost results in containment that does not do well for severe accidents,” Bergeron said. There are also fresh concerns about the fuel rods, which are above the reactors. Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, some nuclear experts have said that the rods should be closer to the ground to avoid exposure to terrorist attacks. Officials are concerned that structural damage to the plant may have exposed some of the rods to the air, which would spread radiation.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Answer based on context: In August, Ottoman forces established a provisional government of Western Thrace at Komotini to pressure Bulgaria to make peace. Bulgaria sent a three-man delegation—General Mihail Savov and the diplomats Andrei Toshev and Grigor Nachovich—to Constantinople to negotiate a peace on 6 September. The Ottoman delegation was led by Foreign Minister Mehmed Talat Bey, assisted by Naval Minister Çürüksulu Mahmud Pasha and Halil Bey. Although Russia tried to intervene throughout August to prevent Edirne from becoming Turkish again, Toshev told the Ottomans at Constantinople that \\"he Russians consider Constantinople their natural inheritance. Their main concern is that when Constantinople falls into their hands it shall have the largest possible hinterland. If Adrianople is in the possession of the Turks, they shall get it too.\\" Resigned to losing Edirne, the Bulgarians played for Kırk Kilise . Both sides made competing declarations: Savov that \\"Bulgaria, who defeated the Turks on all fronts, cannot end this glorious campaign with the signing of an agreement which retains none of the battlefields on which so much Bulgarian blood has been shed,\\" and Mahmud Pasha that \\"hat we have taken is ours.\\" In the end, none of the battlefields were retained in the Treaty of Constantinople of 30 September. Bulgarian forces finally returned south of the Rhodopes in October. The Radoslavov government continued to negotiate with the Ottomans in the hopes of forming an alliance. These talks finally bore fruit in the Secret Bulgarian-Ottoman Treaty of August 1914. On 14 November 1913 Greece and the Ottomans signed a treaty in Athens bringing to a formal end the hostilities between them. On 14 March 1914, Serbia signed a treaty in Constantinople, restoring relations with the Ottoman Empire and reaffirming the 1913 Treaty of London. No treaty between Montenegro and the Ottoman Empire was ever signed. What happened when Greece and the Ottomans signed a treaty?","completion":"When Greece and the Ottomans signed a treaty on November 14, 1913, it marked the formal end of hostilities between the two nations, which had been ongoing as part of the Balkan Wars. The treaty was instrumental in stabilizing the region after a series of conflicts that had involved multiple nations and resulted in significant territorial changes. The Balkan Wars, consisting of the First Balkan War (1912-1913) and the Second Balkan War (1913), were fought by nations of the Balkan League (Serbia, Montenegro, Greece, and Bulgaria) against the Ottoman Empire and later amongst themselves. In the First Balkan War, the Balkan League sought to gain territory from the weakening Ottoman Empire. The subsequent victory led to the signing of the Treaty of London on May 30, 1913, which established the new boundaries and political situation in the region. However, disputes over the division of the acquired territories led to the Second Balkan War, during which Greece, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Ottoman Empire fought against Bulgaria. Throughout these conflicts, Greece and the Ottoman Empire found themselves on opposing sides, leading to a strained relationship between the two nations. The signing of the treaty between Greece and the Ottomans signified their willingness to put their differences aside and restore diplomatic relations, acknowledging the new territorial boundaries established by the previous Treaty of London and reinforced by the Treaty of Constantinople (signed on September 30, 1913, between Bulgaria and the Ottoman Empire). The peace treaty between Greece and the Ottoman Empire marked the end of a tumultuous period in the region, which concluded the Balkan Wars and agreed on the new territorial boundaries for each nation. This treaty, along with others signed at the end of the Balkan Wars, would later set the stage for the political events leading to World War I, including alliances established between the various nations involved."},{"prompt":"You should describe the task and explain your answer.

Please write a short summary for the following article: Syria Steps Up Crackdown in Damascus Suburbs DAMASCUS, Syria — Facing a growing threat on the doorstep of its capital city, the Syrian government struck out at its opponents in the rebellious eastern suburbs on Sunday, sending soldiers, tanks and armored vehicles to vanquish pockets of rebel fighters in an escalation of the spreading war. By Monday, the outcome of the military action remained unclear while the Syrian authorities reported violence on a different front, saying a “terrorist group” had blown up a gas pipeline in the central province of Homs near the border with northern Lebanon, according to the official SANA news agency. There have been several such blasts since the revolt against the government of President Bashar al-Assad took root last March. The news agency gave no further details. Earlier, close to Damascus, columns of black smoke rose from El Ghouta, and heavy clashes were reported in nearby Harasta. A resident who fled Ein Tarma told The Associated Press that electricity and water had been cut to the area during fighting that had not let up since Saturday. Video shot in Saqba showed soldiers shadowing a tank as it rolled through streets that just days ago were controlled with some swagger by rebel fighters. Activists in Saqba said they knew of at least nine people killed in the fighting on Sunday. That toll could not be independently confirmed. The violence was not confined to the capital’s suburbs. A rebel commander in the town of Rankous, near the Lebanese border, said several houses there were burning after a day of shelling by government tanks. “They will pay a high price for this,” said the commander, Abu Khaled. The government’s latest offensive came a day after the Arab League suspended a monitoring mission in Syria because of the intensifying violence, removing outside observers from around the country and in the process lifting a measure of restraint on a government intent on routing its opponents. Arab League nations have been pushing the United Nations Security Council to endorse their plan for a political transition in Syria that calls for Mr. Assad to hand over power to his deputy, and the formation of a unity government in advance of elections. Syria has condemned the plan, calling it foreign interference. The proposal has also run into resistance from Russia, one of Syria’s last remaining allies. On Sunday, Russia’s foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, gave the strongest indication yet that his country would oppose the Arab plan, saying that the insistence by Western and Arab nations that Mr. Assad give up power was “absolutely unforgiveable,” and suggesting that Russia might be willing to use its veto power to block a proposed Security Council resolution favoring it. Mr. Lavrov, who is on a tour of Asia-Pacific nations, said at a news conference in Brunei that the demand — which makes up the core of the draft resolution — was “a rather irresponsible statement, because it attempts to undermine the chance to calm the situation,” according to remarks carried by the Russian Interfax news service. Mr. Lavrov expressed surprise and dissatisfaction with the decision to end the Arab League monitoring mission, which he called a “useful instrument.” He has also said Russian officials planned to meet with Syrian opposition leaders in the coming days to urge them to negotiate with Mr. Assad. “We are trying to convince these forces that dialogue is the only path to normalization,” Mr. Lavrov said, in an interview with Japanese television. “Unfortunately, several of our partners in the U.N. Security Council have taken the opposite position and are persuading the opposition not to enter a dialogue with the authorities. “This is incitement,” he said. The general secretary of the Arab League, Nabil al-Araby, said on Sunday that he was hopeful Russia and China would change their positions and support the resolution. For most of Sunday, there was little sign in central Damascus on Sunday of the war unfolding within miles of the city. Early in the day, activists referred to reports of a major military deployment under way, headed in the direction of the eastern suburbs. Over the last month, militias of defected soldiers had gained a foothold in the area, posting fighters at the entrances to towns like Saqba to repel government incursions and protect antigovernment protests, which have persisted and grown. Syrian officials framed the advance of the fighters as a growing threat to citizens by lawless bands of armed gangs, and promised a harsh response. On Sunday, antigovernment activists and fighters said a broad military campaign was under way, stretching from Rankous in the north to Kufr Butna and surrounding towns in the east. The violence and its aftermath was seen in videos posted by activists. The sound of gunfire coursed through a crowd in Jawbar, as protesters carried away a bloodied body. Slum dwellings in Saqba were reduced to rubble. Black smoke rose from a building in Irbeen. The state news agency, SANA, reported an attack on the military, saying an “armed terrorist group” had blown up a bus in Sahnaya, south of Damascus, killing six soldiers. Fighting was also reported in Homs, Hama and Aleppo, where several days of protests have started to shake a city that had remained calm for most of the 10-month-old uprising. The Local Coordination Committees, an opposition group, said security forces had attacked the northern town of Idlib on Sunday with antiaircraft guns and artillery. On Sunday evening, a group of Arab League observers stationed in Idlib returned to Damascus, carrying the yellow vests they had worn as uniforms. “The situation is very, very bad,” one said. Kareem Fahim reported from Damascus, Syria, and Ellen Barry from Moscow. Huwaida Saad contributed reporting from Damascus, and Alan Cowell from London.","completion":"The Syrian government is fighting against some people who don't like the way the country is being run.

From the base of the rolling dunes emerged subtle, yet striking, features of the coastal nature – the rhythmic dance of the swaying sea oats, their verdant green leaves contrasting sharply with the coarse, crystalline grains that paved the footpaths; the gentle whisper of the ocean breeze echoing through the outlines of the empty seashells, spinning tales of waves they once dared to challenge; the intoxicating salty air, bristling with a hint of oceanic symphony, adding a pure, raw exhilaration to the atmosphere. Life along the coast seemed like poetry frozen in time, each moment dripping with calmness, a nexus point where simplicity met grandeur. But in the heartbeat of the coastal tropics, I sensed a transformation, an impending theatrical, one that only a few dared to witness – the birth of a tempestuous storm. The predictable rhythm of the sea was suddenly disrupted, as the waves grew taller, skipping against the shore with fervent desire, as if they were an army of ambitious knights undaunted by the fear of the duel. As the eastern horizon darkened and gathered thunderous clouds, the beach's serene portrait started getting overshadowed. The fierce creatures of the deep sea roared, their voices heralding the imminent approach of the storm, for they were the first to feel its wrath. The wind howled, swirled around the palm trees, testing their resilience, bending their spines, but not breaking their spirit; the sky, once a canvas of pastel shades, now morphed into a daunting grey wall, echoing with booming thunderclaps that ricocheted across the landscape as a grim warning of the tumultuous events that were about to unfurl upon this glistening jewel of nature. As I stood on that beach, a mere mortal against the raging elements, I couldn't help but respect the terrifying beauty of the storm's approach. A medley of fear and awe filled my heart, providing a humbling reminder of the power and force of nature that held the ability to turn the calmest beach into a cauldron of swirling chaos, serving as a testament to nature’s paradoxical dichotomy – its sheer beauty and its unmatched fury. As the first drops of rain hit the sands, I witnessed the beautiful violence, the destruction and creation fused into one, reinforcing the cycle of life, and a reminder of the vigor of our symbiotic relationship with this mighty earth. For within every storm, there lies a poignant message: it is the fury of the tempest that washes the shore anew, allowing life to flourish once again amidst the wreckage, shaping the character of the beach, and teaching us the profound lessons of resilience, courage, and renewal."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Let sun light through the hole and into the prism. A rainbow will appear. The correct answer is option 1 because sunlight contains a full spectrum of colors which can be separated by a prism to create a rainbow. When sunlight passes through the prism, it refracts (bends) and gets dispersed into its constituent colors, resulting in the formation of a spectrum of light, or a rainbow. Option 2 is incorrect because moonlight is much weaker than sunlight, and it is actually reflected sunlight. Since the intensity of moonlight is not enough to create a strong and clear spectrum of light, it would be difficult to create a visible rainbow using moonlight and a prism."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Q: SEOUL — The head of the United Nations World Food Program (WFP) on Tuesday said the North Korean leadership is hopeful that following a possible denuclearization deal, the international community will increase humanitarian aid for millions of people in the country who are living in poverty and suffering from malnutrition. “There is a tremendous sense of optimism by the leadership, by the people I met with, in the hopes that they will be turning a new chapter in their history, a new page,” said David Beasley, the Executive Director of the WFP during a briefing in Seoul. The WFP director visited North Korea for four days last week, spending two days in Pyongyang and two visiting rural areas outside the capital. Beasley said he was given “remarkable” access during his visit to the restrictive state where contact with foreigners is tightly controlled. Government minders also accompanied him during his visit. Beasley, a former governor of the U.S. state of South Carolina, was nominated to head the WFP last year by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Nikki Haley, who is also a former South Carolina governor. With the upcoming summit between U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un now scheduled to be held in Singapore on June 12, there are increased expectations that an agreement will be reached to dismantle the North’s nuclear, missile and chemical weapons programs that threaten the U.S. and its allies. Details over the scope and timing of the denuclearization process must still be worked out, but the North Korean leader has indicated he wants to resolve the dispute to focus on improving the economic conditions of the country. Ending the severe U.S. led sanctions banning 90% of North Korean trade that were imposed for the North’s repeated nuclear and missile tests, would open the door to increased economic investment and cooperation.

Amidst the crisis, the brilliant but socially withdrawn biochemist, Professor Levin, makes a miraculous breakthrough and perfects the formula for a healing agent called \\"Derma 28.\\" Driven by the memory of his late daughter who died from a similar infection, Professor Levin now dedicates himself to prevent further suffering. With Derma 28, skin infections are treated rapidly, and patients undoubtedly recover. News of his discovery spreads like wildfire, and the world finally sees a glimmer of hope amidst the chaos. As demand for Derma 28 surges, the professor collaborates with the government and a major pharmaceutical company to manufacture and distribute the healing agent worldwide. However, greed and corruption soon take hold as those in power conspire to keep Derma 28 scarce and expensive, making it unaffordable for the masses. Professor Levin's personal life begins to unravel as he discovers the dark secrets behind Derma 28's restricted production. Determined to bring the truth to light and make Derma 28 accessible to everyone, Professor Levin teams up with a fearless investigative journalist, Sandra, and an idealistic young doctor, Dr. Jared Walker, who both share his unwavering vision of healing a world in crisis. The trio embarks on a risky journey to expose the government's lies and corruption, outsmart the pharmaceutical company, and distribute the healing agent to those most in need. Along the way, they face betrayals, roadblocks, and near-death experiences, testing their faith and commitment. As the stakes grow higher, rumours of a prophetic \\"Healer,\\" who might be a key element to the crisis resolution, begins to spread. Levin, Sandra, and Dr. Walker realize that their fight against the system is more significant than they initially thought. In the climactic final act, Professor Levin ultimately finds redemption when he unwillingly accepts his newfound role as the \\"Healer,\\" working together with the government and the pharmaceutical company to mend their ways and ensure Derma 28 is finally made accessible to every single human being in need. His selfless devotion to his cause not only saves countless lives but also restores the faith of humanity in one another, in the midst of a rapidly declining world. Derma's Redemption is a thrilling, emotional tale that explores the power of empathy, unity, and the undying human spirit in the face of greed, adversity, and global catastrophe."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Article:Media playback is not supported on this device Of course, he needs to be in the right car to execute that - as you can see from the woes of Fernando Alonso and Jenson Button at McLaren - but part of the skill of F1, beyond getting into it and staying there, is making the right decisions at the right time. Hamilton's current position is the result of what appeared at the time to be his unthinkable decision to leave McLaren at the end of 2012 and join Mercedes. That move represented a step-change in his life. He had been nurtured as a racing driver from the age of 11 by McLaren. His father had managed his career up until that point, and had been ever-present. But in joining Mercedes at that time Hamilton left both those situations behind. He made that decision having been persuaded by current non-executive chairman Niki Lauda and then-team principal Ross Brawn that it was the best place for him to be in the future. How right they have proven to be. Hamilton still has doubters out there - whenever I use a phrase such as a \\"Senna-esque performance\\" about Hamilton, I get criticised, as if it is some kind of sacrilege. But Senna-esque is exactly how Hamilton is performing at the moment. We cannot ignore the fact that Hamilton's team-mate Nico Rosberg has had a very solid career in F1, with the occasional exceptional race. Rosberg gave Hamilton a run for his money in both their first two seasons as team-mates in 2013 and 2014. Hamilton, like all great drivers, has exceptional speed. Rosberg appeared somehow to be able to neutralise that last year and the year before. But not this year. The other day, I met a guy who was haranguing me about how ridiculous he thought Hamilton's tattoos were. Now, tattoos are not my cup of tea, but if Hamilton likes them - or wants to dye his hair blond, or hang out with pop stars - who are we to judge? As long as it is not affecting his driving - and it is abundantly clear that it is not, unless it is positively - then he should get on and do whatever he wants. He is young, he is wealthy, he is at the top of his form, he has a great car. He will be feeling brilliant in himself, and that is reflecting in his performances on the race track. Hamilton's win at Monza has put him in a commanding 53-point lead in the championship over Rosberg, and the German is absolutely right to say that it will now be \\"very difficult\\" to beat Hamilton to the title. It is never over until it is over - Hamilton could have a run of bad luck with accidents and reliability. You never know. But if we are frank, at hardly any point this year has Rosberg looked a match for Hamilton. I can completely relate to that situation, and see it with a clarity that Rosberg perhaps cannot. Having raced for six years as team-mate to Mika Hakkinen, I know what it is to be alongside a driver who fundamentally is just that bit faster. You are often left short by only a tenth of a second - but you are left short. You don't give up, and say: \\"Oh, he's better than me.\\" You keep digging deep, and keep thinking of ways to win. You keep believing. That is an inherent part of being a sportsman. But Rosberg has not been the equal of Hamilton this year, and he knows that. There is no shame in that. He has been a great racing driver, and a marvellous asset for Mercedes F1 but so far Hamilton has been the stronger. There was a nervous wait for Mercedes and Hamilton after the race while the stewards decided what to do about one of his tyres being slightly below the minimum permitted pressure at a certain point before the start of the race. Inevitably, there has been some cynicism and grumbling about the decision to take no further action, but I always prefer to wait until the governing body, the FIA, makes its decision before wading in with an opinion. Media playback is not supported on this device Tyre pressures are a very difficult thing to get an accurate handle on, simply because they fluctuate so much. The issue in this case was that the teams had been given a time before the race that the pressures would be measured, at which point Hamilton's tyres were within the allowed parameters. Measured again after this point, they were slightly too low. But if you don't have a precise set of parameters for measurement - or you measure something that can change as much as tyre pressures can due to external factors at a different time from when you agreed - I don't see how you punish someone in these circumstances. This will be a work in progress. The FIA has taken a sensible approach to the numbers and there will be more clarity around this situation by the time of the next race in Singapore on 20 September. It was fitting in some ways that the weekend would end with a tyre controversy. From the debate about whether Pirelli had chosen to set the minimum pressures too high the start of the weekend, to the meeting between top drivers, Pirelli and the sport's leading bosses, tyres had been the centre of attention all the way through. We touched in the last column on Pirelli's decision to accept the request to produce deliberately fast-degrading tyres, and the difficult position in which that puts them. Media playback is not supported on this device The drivers have for a long time not been happy about the way these current Pirellis behave and would like to race on tyres that were more durable, so they can push hard for much longer than they can at the moment. So it is about time that F1's bosses sat down and discussed with the drivers whether the current philosophy they are pursuing is the right one - and I am pleased to see that is what they are going to do. For too long, the drivers' views have been dismissed by those in charge of the sport, sometimes in quite a patronising way. But why would you not listen to and value the opinions of the people who are actually racing the cars? To me, more so than the fans, or the broadcasters, or the journalists, the drivers are the most relevant people to talk about this - and they are not as enthusiastic about the latest F1 cars as they were in the past. That does not just apply to the likes of Fernando Alonso, Sebastian Vettel, Hamilton and Rosberg - who were the men dragged into the meeting with Pirelli and Ecclestone. It applies to the young drivers as well. The important thing to say is that F1 needs to appeal to the audience, and much of the audience is well aware that the drivers right now are not happy. If the parents are not taking their sons and daughters, they go and do something else, and it would not take many years for the audience to die off if the sport is too expensive, too inaccessible or not entertaining enough. F1's ability to challenge the drivers more than it does now is central to that.

Following reports that a Michael Jackson impersonator may have sung songs on the King of Pop’s posthumous 2010 Epic Records release, Michael, lawyers for parent company Sony Music Entertainment are denying—maybe, sort of—that the songs are fake, according to Variety. The bizarre rebuttal stems from a class-action lawsuit filed in 2014 against Sony Music, MJJ Productions, representatives for Jackson’s estate, and other parties associated with the release of Jackson’s posthumous albums. A fan named Vera Serova initiated a suit, alleging that several tracks—”Breaking News,” “Keep Your Head Up,” and “Monster”—are faked. During a hearing Thursday held to determine whether the album’s liner notes are protected by the First Amendment, one of the lawyers for Jackson’s estate made a statement along the lines of, “even if the songs weren’t sung by Jackson.” While the purpose of the hearing was not to resolve whether or not the vocals belong to Jackson or another singer, many took the comments were an obvious admission of guilt on Sony’s side. Consequently, social media lit up with questions about whether Sony Music would issue refunds for the albums containing tracks sung by an impersonator. Good to see Sony concede what every MJ fan already knew: several of the “new” songs on the first posthumous Michael Jackson release were obvious fakes. Worse, they didn’t concede the obvious until forced into admitting it by this lawsuit. https://t.co/R2fl726n5l — Anil Dash (@anildash) August 24, 2018 Sony did not immediately comment on the controversy, but attorneys representing Sony and Jackson’s estate now say those comments were made for the purposes of an argument only. “No one has conceded that Michael Jackson did not sing on the songs,” said Zia Modabber of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, the firm representing both parties. But depending on your definition of “on,” the lawyer’s wording raises further questions. Variety notes that singing “on” a track could refer to enhanced vocal tracks, or even tracks sung by another vocalist entirely. Modabber did not respond to Variety‘s request for further clarification. Sony and reps from Jackson’s estate tried to have the suit dismissed as a public interest matter under California’s Anti-SLAPP statute. SLAPP, a “strategic lawsuit against public participation,” is often used to chill free speech by discouraging critics of a major business or corporation, such as in the case about who invented email. ||||| UPDATED: Articles published on Thursday claimed that Sony Music had “admitted” in a court hearing earlier this week that three tracks on “Michael,” the 2010 Michael Jackson album released posthumously by Sony’s Epic Records, contained lead vocals that were not actually by Michael Jackson — an assertion that the company denied in a statement released late Friday morning. “No one has conceded that Michael Jackson did not sing on the songs,” said Zia Modabber of Katten Muchin Rosenman LLP, who is representing both Sony Music and the Jackson estate in this matter. “The hearing Tuesday was about whether the First Amendment protects Sony Music and the Estate and there has been no ruling on the issue of whose voice is on the recordings.” That interpretation was seconded to Variety by the plaintiff’s attorney on Friday afternoon. The songs in question are “Breaking News,” “Monster” and “Keep Your Head Up,” which were released on “Michael,” the first album from a splashy ten-album 2010 deal between Jackson’s estate and Epic Records to complete and issue dozens of previously unreleased recordings by the singer. While the deal — which estimates at the time claimed could bring 250 million to the estate — called for the 10 albums to be released over the next seven years, just two have emerged, “Michael” and 2014’s “Xscape.” Related Why Ringo Starr Won't Stop Touring Quincy Jones Invests in Music Startup Jammcard Although involved parties have claimed that the recordings were faked since they were first released in 2010, the court hearing stems from a 2014 class-action lawsuit brought by a fan, Vera Serova, against Sony Music; John Branca, a co-executor of the estate; MJJ Productions; Edward Cascia and James Porte, the songwriter/producers of the songs in question; and their production companies. According to the lawsuit, in November 2010 Sony stated “We have complete confidence in the results of our extensive research as well as the accounts of those who were in the studio with Michael that the vocals on the new album are his own.” Howard Weitzman, an attorney for Jackson’s estate, released a statement citing multiple engineers, musicians, vocal directors, executives and musicologists as concluding that the vocals were Jackson’s. Sony and the Jackson estate sought to throw the lawsuit based on California’s anti-SLAPP (Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation) statute, which protects speech on matters of public interest. The trial court judge denied the motion, prompting Sony and the estate to appeal. The argument was heard Tuesday by a three-judge panel of the 2nd District Court of Appeal. Whether or not the vocals are indeed Jackson’s was not the purpose of Tuesday’s hearing, but rather whether the album’s liner notes and a video promoting it qualified as “commercial speech,” which, if they were would mean they are not protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. “When you review the motion on appeal, you assume that everything in the complaint is true,” said Bryan Freedman, who represents other defendants in the case. “Any admission that was made was for purposes of that argument only.” A ruling on the anti-SLAPP motion is due within the next 90 days. Among other issues, the 2014 lawsuit raises the question of whether people who purchased the album or songs “are entitled to a refund, in whole or in part, of the purchase price of the album ‘Michael’ and/or the songs.” According to sources close to the situation, individuals who attended Tuesday’s court hearing seized upon a statement by an attorney for Jackson’s estate in which he said something to the effect of “even if the vocals weren’t Jackson’s” as proof that they were indeed faked. The sources insist that the attorney was speaking speculatively. The notes read in part, “This album contains 9 previously unreleased vocal tracks performed by Michael Jackson. These tracks were recently completed using music from the original vocal tracks and music created by the credited producers.” The wording of that statement is striking in light of Modabber’s comment, which says Jackson sang “on” the songs, which could be interpreted to mean that his vocals were enhanced or even completed by another singer. Fans have long claimed that an American singer named Jason Malachi actually sang the three songs in question, and he purportedly admitted as much in a 2011 Facebook post, according to TMZ, although his manager later denied it, claiming the post was faked. Modabber did not immediately respond to Variety‘s request for further comment. ||||| Michael Jackson’s record label Sony has been caught up in a legal battle over whether the singer really performed the lead vocals on three songs in a posthumous album released under his name. In a US court this week, in attempting to persuade a judge that it should not be a defendant in a lawsuit over the songs, Sony hypothesised that Jackson was not the main singer on Breaking News, Keep Your Head Up and Monster – but argued that such a scenario would not mean it had no legal right to sell the music under his name. Beat it: a moonwalk through Michael Jackson's fashion history Read more Sony’s argument was seized upon by its opponents as evidence that the tracks are fake. But the label emphasises that the admission is “only for the purposes of this motion” and reserves the right to take a different stance outside of the appeal. In a separate statement, Sony has insisted it has not conceded that Jackson did not sing “on” the songs and says that the case is about its protection under the first amendment. Nonetheless, the global music conglomerate’s legal argument marks a significant development in a fan-led legal case that has blighted the company for years. The songs in question appeared on Jackson’s first posthumous album, Michael, released in 2010, the year after his death. It debuted at No 3 on the Billboard 200, selling 85,000 copies in its first week. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Jackson performing during his concert in Vienna in 1997. Photograph: Leonhard Foeger/Reuters When it was released the album immediately sparked controversy over whether the voice on it really was that of the dead Thriller singer. Jackson’s Epic record label, part of the Sony Music Entertainment Group, said at the time it had “complete confidence” that the vocals on the new album were Jackson’s own. But his sister, La Toya Jackson, was quoted as saying: “It didn’t sound like him,” in an interview with the celebrity website TMZ. In 2014, fan Vera Serova brought the case against Jackson’s longtime friend Eddie Cascio and his brother’s production company, Angelikson Productions LLC, accusing them of producing fake songs and then selling them through the late artist’s estate and Sony Music Entertainment. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Jackson performing on stage in 2002. Photograph: Michael Caulfield Archive/WireImage Angelikson and Cascio have denied the claims. In an appearance on the Oprah Winfrey show, Cascio said: “I can tell you that it is Michael’s voice.” Sony is currently taking part in an intermediate appeal about whether it should stay as a defendant in a class action lawsuit case brought by Serova. For the purposes of legal argument, it said it had accepted Jackson did not sing all the vocals, but that even if this was the case it was not given this information when the album was released and could not be expected to have known. Sony said that if anyone misrepresented the origin of the vocals, it was the Angelikson defendants. Court documents published online read: “For purposes of the appeal, appellants [Sony] accept that Jackson did not sing all the lead vocals on the Cascio tracks. Black and White: how Dangerous kicked off Michael Jackson's race paradox Read more But also for the purposes of the appeal, and based on their own express pleading admissions, respondents must accept that appellants did not know that someone else was the singer.” Sony Music Entertainment is applying to a higher court for a reversal of the decision of a lower court. The court of appeal will now decide if the company should stay as a defendant in the case or should be dismissed and allowed to continue selling the album. Ray Gallo, one of the lawyers representing Serova, said his client did not care about money. “She is a lifelong Michael Jackson fan that deeply felt the importance of protecting Jackson’s legacy,” he said. “My colleagues and I are always honoured to bring consumer cases that challenge dishonesty and help bring integrity and reliability to consumer markets, including this one.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Michael Jackson in 1984. Photograph: Richard Young/REX/Shutterstock Critics have accused the music conglomerate of trying to deflect the problem. Editor of the website HipHop-N-More, Navjosh, said: “The fact that Sony was ready to admit that the songs may be fake has been known for a while. What they are now trying to do is shift the blame of the case to Cascio.” He added that he felt if Sony was allowed to do this it would set a “dangerous precedent for other legacy artists in the future”.

Washington, D.C., formally the District of Columbia and commonly referred to as Washington or D.C., is the capital of the United States. Founded after the American Revolution as the seat of government of the newly independent country, Washington was named after George Washington, the first President of the United States and a Founding Father. As the seat of the United States federal government and several international organizations, Washington is an important world political capital. The city is also one of the most visited cities in the world, with more than 20 million tourists annually.The signing of the Residence Act on July 16, 1790, approved the creation of a capital district located along the Potomac River on the country's East Coast. The U.S. Constitution provided for a federal district under the exclusive jurisdiction of the U.S. Congress, and the District is therefore not a part of any state. The states of Maryland and Virginia each donated land to form the federal district, which included the pre-existing settlements of Georgetown and Alexandria. The City of Washington was founded in 1791 to serve as the new national capital. In 1846, Congress returned the land originally ceded by Virginia; in 1871, it created a single municipal government for the remaining portion of the District. Washington had an estimated population of 702,455 as of July 2018, making it the 20th most populous city in the United States. Commuters from the surrounding Maryland and Virginia suburbs raise the city's daytime population to more than one million during the workweek. Washington's metropolitan area, the country's sixth largest, had a 2017 estimated population of 6.2 million residents.All three branches of the U.S. federal government are centered in the District: Congress (legislative), president (executive), and the U.S. Supreme Court (judicial).

However, recent research has indicated that the actual amount of alcohol consumed by the residents of England might be far higher than what has been initially estimated. In fact, the underestimation equates to around 12 million bottles of wine per week. This revelation poses serious questions on the accuracy of national health surveys, as well as concerns for public health. The Research Behind the Revelation A team of researchers from the University of Sheffield's School of Health and Related Research (ScHARR) embarked on a journey to uncover the true extent of alcohol consumption in England. Utilizing data from multiple sources, including the national Alcohol Toolkit Survey, the British Beer and Pub Association, and the figures from alcohol producers, the researchers set out to uncover the discrepancies between self-reported consumption and actual sales figures. The results were quite alarming: it was discovered that alcohol consumption was underreported by the equivalent of an astounding 12 million bottles of wine per week. The researchers further dove into the age-group analysis and found that this issue was most prominent in those aged 25 to 34 years, where the underestimation of alcohol consumption was as high as 33%. The Reasons Behind the Underestimation The underestimation of alcohol consumption in England is attributed to several factors. Foremost, the reliance on self-reported surveys creates an environment in which individuals might not be entirely truthful about their alcohol intake, often due to social desirability bias. This may result in underreporting, as people may not want to appear as heavy drinkers in the eyes of the researchers or society. Moreover, some drinkers might not accurately recall the amount they consumed during a specific time period, leading to discrepancies in the data. Another factor contributing to underreported alcohol consumption is the fact that national surveys do not always account for all alcohol consumed. For instance, previously mentioned surveys often do not include alcohol purchased duty-free or brought back from other countries. It is also important to consider informal alcohol sales channels, which might not be adequately represented in these survey findings. Implications for Public Health This startling revelation of underreported alcohol consumption carries significant implications for public health in England. The consumption of large quantities of alcohol is known to have both short-term and long-term detrimental effects on individual health, including liver diseases, cardiovascular diseases, and detrimental effects on mental health. Furthermore, the underestimation of alcohol consumption levels also leads to an underassessment of the burden on the National Health Service (NHS), which might be grappling with a higher number of alcohol-related ailments and issues than previously thought. This also means that current alcohol awareness programs, policies, and regulations may not be sufficiently addressing the magnitude of the issue. Recommendations for Improvement In light of these findings, it is crucial to revisit the methods used for collecting alcohol consumption data as well as policies aimed at mitigating alcohol-related public health issues. More accurate data would enable the government and organizations to properly assess consumption and plan interventions, ensuring that the available resources are allocated effectively. One possible solution is to triangulate alcohol consumption data using various sources, such as sales data, alcohol treatment services, and hospital admissions records. This would help to provide a more comprehensive representation of the actual alcohol consumption levels in England. In addition, increasing the use of digital technology, such as mobile apps and wearable devices, might also aid in tracking alcohol consumption levels more accurately. Conclusion The underestimation of alcohol consumption in England is a stark reminder of the risks posed by heavy drinking and the importance of accurate data collection for informing public health policies. In light of these findings, it is crucial to reassess the methodologies used in surveys and utilize innovative approaches to ensure that the nation's drinking habits are appropriately addressed. While existing policies and interventions have achieved some success, understanding the true extent of alcohol consumption is essential for bringing about a healthier future for the people of England."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Question: I can use this background: Unfortunately, the layer of good ozone is being destroyed by air pollution. The chief culprits are chlorine and bromine gases. They are released in aerosol sprays, coolants, and other products. Loss of ozone has created an ozone hole over Antarctica. Ozone depletion results in higher levels of UV radiation reaching Earth. In humans, this increases skin cancers and eye cataracts. It also disturbs the nitrogen cycle, kills plankton, and disrupts ocean food webs. The total loss of the ozone layer would be devastating to most life. Its rate of loss has slowed with restrictions on pollutants, but it is still at risk. Now, I have a new situation: Two researchers studied air quality over the North Pole, and over Antarctica. Dan was more fond of the south pole, so he studied Antarctica, while Colt liked reading about the North Pole. Answer this question please: Which researcher learned more about chlorine gases?

Nonetheless, to provide a more detailed and comprehensive answer to the question, it should be noted that Arnold Schwarzenegger was initially credited as \\"Arnold Strong\\" in his acting debut in the 1970 film \\"Hercules in New York.\\" At the time, the film's producers decided to use a different last name for the Austrian-born actor because they felt that his real last name would be too difficult for American audiences to pronounce, spell, or remember. The pseudonym \\"Arnold Strong\\" was chosen to showcase his impressive physique and background as a bodybuilder. The film itself, directed by Arthur Allan Seidelman, was a low-budget production that aimed to capitalize on the rising popularity of sword-and-sandal movies. Schwarzenegger, a former Mr. Universe winner and up-and-coming bodybuilder, was seen as the ideal candidate for the lead role of Hercules due to his muscular build and charismatic presence. Despite the change in his last name for the film, it is important to mention that Arnold Schwarzenegger eventually reclaimed his original surname as his acting career progressed. Throughout the 1970s, he continued to appear in various film and television projects, gradually solidifying his status as a Hollywood star. By the time he successfully transitioned from bodybuilding to acting, Schwarzenegger had become a household name, paving the way for iconic roles in movies such as \\"Conan the Barbarian,\\" \\"The Terminator,\\" \\"Predator,\\" and \\"Total Recall,\\" among others. In conclusion, while the original statement does not directly address the question, it can be inferred that Arnold Schwarzenegger used the last name \\"Strong\\" in his acting debut as Hercules in the 1970 film \\"Hercules in New York.\\" This was, however, a brief deviation that served the specific context of his introduction to the film industry, and Schwarzenegger ultimately reverted to using his authentic surname as his acting career flourished."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Context_3 : Touchstone is a fictional character in Shakespeare's play \\"As You Like It\\". Context_4 : As You Like It is a 2006 film written and directed by Kenneth Branagh, and based on the Shakespearean play of the same name. It stars Bryce Dallas Howard as Rosalind, David Oyelowo as Orlando De Boys, Romola Garai as Celia, Adrian Lester as Oliver De Boys, Alfred Molina as Touchstone, Kevin Kline as Jaques, Janet McTeer as Audrey, and Brian Blessed as Duke Frederick and his brother Duke Senior. Context_5 : Jacob Clement Utzon-Krefeld (born 1990, Denmark) is a Danish actor Played Hamlet in Shakespeare's Hamlet at the Castle of Elsinore for two consecutive years 2016-17. Studied at East 15 Drama School in London. Context_6 : Rama Paduka Pattabhishekam (\\"English\\": The Coronation Of Lord Rama's Slippers) (\\"Telugu:\\" రామ పాదుక పట్టాభిషేకం) is a 1932 Telugu mythological drama film directed by Sarvottam Badami. Badami was contracted by Sagar Movietone (Sagar Film Company) to direct \\"Rama Paduka Pattabhishekham\\" in Telugu. The success of the film established him as a director. He went on to direct \\"Galava Rishi\\" (Tamil), and \\"Shakuntala\\" in Telugu for Sagar Movietone. Suryanarayana Yadavalli, who was a renowned stage actor played the lead role of Lord Rama in \\"Rama Paduka Pattabhishekam\\". The film starred C. S. R.

He has appeared in many of Kenneth Branagh's films, most recently as Corin in the 2006 film \\"As You Like It\\". Yuill was also the music composer for \\"A Midwinter's Tale\\" and \\"Swan Song\\". Context_8 : D.C. Follies is a syndicated sitcom which aired from 1987–1989 and was set in a Washington, D.C. bar, where bartender Fred Willard would welcome puppet caricatures of politicians and pop culture figures. The show was satirical, and frequently commented on politicians and the political process. Although Willard was the only live actor appearing regularly, each episode brought a celebrity guest into the bar, such as Martin Mull, Robin Leach, Bob Uecker, and Betty White. In one episode, Robert Englund showed up as his Freddy Krueger character, and in a special Christmas episode an un-billed actor played Santa Claus. Another episode had Mike Tyson confront his own puppet character. Context_9 : Although traditionally Titus Andronicus has been seen as one of Shakespeare's least respected plays, its fortunes have changed somewhat in the latter half of the twentieth century, with numerous scholars arguing that the play is more accomplished than has hitherto been allowed for. In particular, scholars have argued that the play is far more thematically complex than has traditionally been thought, and features profound insights into Ancient Rome, Elizabethan society, and the human condition. Such scholars tend to argue that these previously unacknowledged insights have only become apparent during the twentieth and twenty-first centuries as only now has the ultraviolent content of the play achieved a sense of relevance. For example, in his 1987 edition of the play for the \\"Contemporary Shakespeare\\" series, A.L. Rowse writes; \\"in the civilised Victorian age the play could not be performed because it could not be believed. Such is the horror of our own age, with the appalling barbarities of prison camps and resistance movements paralleling the torture and mutilation and feeding on human flesh of the play, that it has ceased to be improbable.\\" Similarly, director Julie Taymor, who staged a production Off-Broadway in 1994 and directed a film version in 1999, says she was drawn to the play because she found it to be the most \\"relevant of Shakespeare's plays for the modern era;\\" She feels that the play has more relevance for us than it had for the Victorians; \\"it seems like a play written for today, it reeks of now.\\" Because of this new found relevance, previously unrecognised thematic strands have thus come to the forefront.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Do you think the right answer to the question \\"how do cypress produce seeds?\\" is \\"wind\\", given that cypress produce seeds in cones? Possible answers: - Yes. - No. Answer:","completion":"No. Cypress trees, belonging to the Cupressaceae family, do produce seeds in cones; however, the answer to \\"how do cypress produce seeds?\\" is not \\"wind\\". The formation of seeds occurs within the cone structure, involving the tree's reproductive system. Here's a brief explanation: Cypress trees are monoecious, meaning that they have both male and female reproductive structures on the same tree. The male cones produce pollen, and the female cones contain the ovules. During the pollination process, wind plays a significant role as it carries and disperses the pollen from the male cones to the female cones. Once pollination occurs, the ovules within the female cones are fertilized and develop into seeds. In summary, while wind is essential in the pollination process, the actual production of seeds is a result of the successful fertilization of ovules in the female cones, not the wind itself. So, the correct answer is \\"No.\\""},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Write the next sentence. William got lost in thought less often than Jason because","completion":"William possessed a more focused and disciplined mindset, allowing him to efficiently compartmentalize his thoughts and direct his attention towards the tasks at hand, whereas Jason had a tendency to frequently drift into daydreams and contemplative states, often getting caught up in abstract ideas and hypothetical scenarios, which, although providing him with a wellspring of creativity and innovative solutions, made it difficult for him to maintain concentration on immediate responsibilities and navigate the practical complexities of day-to-day life. Consequently, their divergent cognitive styles played a significant role in shaping their individual approaches to problem-solving, collaboration, and personal growth, with William excelling in structured environments where quick decision-making and unwavering focus were crucial, and Jason thriving in more open-ended and fluid contexts that called for adaptability, imaginative thinking, and a propensity to challenge established conventions. Despite their contrasting mental inclinations, both William and Jason were acutely aware of the unique strengths and limitations that characterized their thought processes, and they consistently sought to reinforce their cognitive abilities and expand their intellectual horizons by engaging with diverse experiences, perspectives, and learning opportunities that allowed them to push beyond the boundaries of their comfort zones and cultivate a deep appreciation for the vast and interconnected tapestry of human knowledge and understanding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

About 10% of sedimentary rocks are limestones. The solubility of limestone in water and weak acid solutions leads to karst landscapes, in which water erodes the limestone over thousands to millions of years. Most cave systems are through limestone bedrock. White mountains are often visited by tourists because of the many beautiful caves, stalactites, stalagmites and karst phenomena. Dome mountains are interesting to tourists because they are very massive, of volcanic origin and excellent for climbing. Which mountain attracts fewer tourists because of its caves? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Dome mountains attract fewer tourists because of their caves when compared to White mountains. While both White mountains and Dome mountains offer unique and captivating experiences for tourists, there are a few reasons for the difference in visitor numbers when it comes to their cave systems. First and foremost, it is essential to understand the formation and composition of these two types of mountains. White mountains are primarily formed by the erosion of limestone, a sedimentary rock that is vulnerable to erosion by water and weak acid solutions. Over thousands to millions of years, the dissolution of limestone results in the formation of karst landscapes, characterized by an extensive network of caves, sinkholes, underground rivers, and other subterranean features. The combination of caves, stalactites, and stalagmites creates a visually stunning environment, drawing a significant number of tourists from around the world. Dome mountains, on the other hand, have a volcanic origin and owe their formation to the uplifting of Earth's crust caused by the intrusion of magma. This process often results in a characteristic dome-like shape without any specific rock type. Thus, Dome mountains may not consist of limestone, which is the primary rock type responsible for the formation of caves in the White mountains. Consequently, Dome mountains are less likely to have extensive cave systems that would attract tourists. Secondly, the main appeal of Dome mountains to tourists lies in other aspects such as their striking appearance, massive size, and suitability for climbing activities. These factors collectively contribute to Dome mountains being a popular destination for adventure seekers and outdoor enthusiasts who are more interested in scaling peaks and exploring volcanic landscapes than spelunking in caves. Additionally, the presence of caves in White mountains is a well-known and celebrated feature, attracting plenty of attention and significantly contributing to tourism in these regions. Conversely, Dome mountains are primarily renowned for their impressive size and climbing opportunities, rather than their potential as a cave exploration destination. In essence, while both White mountains and Dome mountains offer unique experiences to visitors, the prevalence of captivating caves, stalactites, stalagmites, and karst phenomena in White mountains make them a more sought-after destination for tourists looking to explore caves. Therefore, Dome mountains attract fewer tourists because of their caves when compared to White mountains."},{"prompt":"I know that the answer to the question \\"Which of the following is not a religion: Hinduism, Jainism, or Uttarakhand?\\" is in \\"Sanskrit (/ˈsænskrɪt/; Sanskrit: saṃskṛtam [səmskr̩t̪əm] or saṃskṛta, originally saṃskṛtā vāk, \\"refined speech\\") is the primary sacred language of Hinduism, a philosophical language in Buddhism, Hinduism, Sikhism and Jainism, and a literary language that was in use as a lingua franca in Greater India.

The use of the words \\"dreary mess\\" indicates dissatisfaction with the film and most likely a sense of disappointment. Additionally, the use of \\"dreary\\" conveys an overall gloomy and dull feeling, which further supports the fact that the reviewer does not have a favorable view of the movie. In the context of a movie review, the foremost goal is to either express an affirmative or adverse impression of the movie. The language used in reviews can help to identify whether the reviewer is enjoying or disliking the film. For instance, positive language might include phrases such as \\"brilliant performance,\\" \\"engaging storyline,\\" or \\"exceptional direction.\\" On the contrary, negative language might involve descriptions like \\"poor acting,\\" \\"weak plot,\\" or \\"underwhelming visuals.\\" In this case, the use of \\"dreary mess\\" points to several potential imperfections in the movie. It could suggest that the film had a lack of exciting or engaging elements, leading it to be a dull and unappealing viewing experience. Additionally, the term \\"mess\\" could imply that the different aspects of the movie didn't come together cohesively, resulting in a poorly-executed film. Other aspects like the acting, direction, plot, and visuals might also have contributed to the reviewer's negative evaluation. For example, if the actors' performances were subpar, the plot was confusing, or the visuals were lackluster, the overall opinion of the movie would likely be unfavorable. In conclusion, the reviewer harbors a negative opinion of the movie, as evident from the language used.

Provide a detailed answer so user don’t need to search outside to understand the answer. Answer the following question: Two countries situated at different latitudes are exposed to climate change. Iceland is located closer to the North Pole, while Ecuador is located near the Equator. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: Which country will feel the effects of climate change more drastically? Hint: During the Cold War, the Arctic became a place where the United States, Canada, and the Soviet Union performed significant research that has been essential to the study of climate change in recent years. A major reason why research in the Arctic is essential for the study of climate change is because the effects of climate change will be felt more quickly and more drastically in higher latitudes of the world as above average temperatures are predicted for Northwest Canada and Alaska. From an anthropological point of view, researchers study the native Inuit peoples of Alaska as they have become extremely accustomed to adapting to ecological and climate variability.[1] Answer:","completion":"Based on the information provided, Iceland, being located closer to the North Pole, will feel the effects of climate change more drastically compared to Ecuador. This is due to the fact that higher latitudes, such as the Arctic region, experience the effects of climate change more quickly and dramatically. The research conducted in the Arctic during the Cold War has been essential for understanding climate change, as it has highlighted the significant impact of above-average temperatures in areas like Northwest Canada and Alaska.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Deforestation rate remains alarming An average of 7.3 million hectares of forest, an area about the size of Sierra Leone or Panama, was destroyed annually in the last five years, theÂ Food and Agriculture Organisation(FAO)Â said on Monday. The lossÂ between 1990 and 2000 wasÂ 8.9 million hectares a year. Deforestation was most extensive in South America, where an average of 4.3 million hectares wasÂ lost annually over the last five years, followed by Africa with 4 million hectares, the Rome-based agency said whileÂ presenting The Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FRA 2005). North America and Oceania saw smaller forest losses over the same period, while forest areas in Asia and Europe grew, the FAO said. \\"While good progress is being made in many places, unfortunately forest resources are still being lost or degraded at an alarmingly high rate,\\" said Hosny El-Lakany, the agency's assistant director-general for forestry. Forests now cover nearlyÂ four billion hectares or 30% of the world's land area. HoweverÂ 10 countries account for two-thirds of all forest area: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, India, Indonesia, Peru, the Russian Federation and the US. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissionsOceania lostÂ 356,000 hectares a year betweenÂ 2000-2005, while North and Central America together lostÂ 333,000 hectares a year during the period. Forests help offset increasingindustrial carbon emissions Asia moved from a net loss of around 800,000 hectaresÂ a year in the 1990s to a net gain of one million hectares per year between 2000 and 2005, primarily as a result of large-scale afforestation reported by China. Forest areas in Europe continued to expand, although at a slower rate than in the 1990s. Primary forestsÂ with no visible signs of past or present human activitiesÂ account for 36% of total forest area, but are being lost or modified at a rate ofÂ six million hectares a year through deforestation or selective logging. FRA 2005 also found that new forests and trees are being planted at increasing rates, but plantations still account for less than 5% of forest area, it notes. Major methodological flaws in the UN's report according to the Rainforest Foundation:- the UN figure for 'net' deforestation is grossly misleading, as it conceals the fact that most deforestation is taking place in the world's tropical rainforests, whereas most of the reforestation and natural re-growth of forests is taking place in the northern hemisphere, and much of this consists of plantations rather than forests; - the UN figure is based on a definition of forest as being an area with as little as 10% actual tree cover, which would therefore include areas that are actually savannah-like ecosystems and badly damaged forests; - areas of land that presently have no trees on them at all, but that are 'expected' to regenerate, are also counted as forests; - the UN includes in its data for existing areas of forest those that are covered by industrial tree plantations, which are actually lacking some of the key functions of true forests.However, the UK-based Rainforest Foundation said the FRA 2005 figures are misleading, inaccurate and understate the real extent of deforestation and damage to forests globally.

He said the new Forest Resources Assessment repeats the bad science of previous assessments, which have been widely criticised, and obscures the real extent of deforestation. Forests have multiple functions, including conservation of biological diversity, soil and water, supplying wood and non-wood products, providing recreation opportunities and serving as carbon sinks. While most forests are managed for multiple uses, FRA 2005 found that 11% are designated principally for the conservation of biological diversity - and such areas have increased by an estimated 96 million hectares since 1990. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. Around 348 million hectares of forests are used to conserve soil and water, control avalanches and desertification, stabilise sand dunes and protect coastal areas. One-third of the world's forests are mainly used for production of wood, fibre and non-wood products, and more than half have production of these products as one of their management objectives. Forests are particularly important as carbon sinks: the amount of carbon stored in forest biomass alone is about 283 gigatonnes (Gt) of carbon, though it decreased globally by 1.1 Gt annually between 1990 and 2005. Carbon stored in forest biomass, deadwood, litter and soil together is roughly 50% more than the amount of carbon in the atmosphere.","completion":"This news article talks about how many trees and forests are being cut down or destroyed every year. The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) said that about 7.3 million hectares of forest (an area about the size of Sierra Leone or Panama) was destroyed each year in the last five years. Most of this happened in South America and Africa. This is bad for the environment because forests help clean the air by taking in carbon emissions from factories and cars. Some forests are growing back in Asia and Europe, but the Rainforest Foundation says that the FAO's information might not be accurate and the real situation could be worse. Forests are important because they are home to many animals, help control the climate, and provide resources like wood and clean water."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Is the next sentence syntactically and semantically acceptable? Paul breathed at Mary.","completion":"The sentence \\"Paul breathed at Mary\\" is acceptable from a syntactic perspective, but its semantic acceptability can be further analyzed and discussed. From a syntactic point of view, the sentence is well-formed. It follows the basic subject-verb-object (SVO) structure found in English sentences, with \\"Paul\\" as the subject, \\"breathed\\" as the verb, and \\"Mary\\" as the object: Subject: Paul (a proper noun) Verb: breathed (a past tense verb) Object: at Mary (a prepositional phrase with \\"at\\" as the preposition and \\"Mary\\" as the object of the preposition) However, from a semantic perspective, the acceptability of the sentence can be questioned due to the rarity of this particular sense of the verb \\"breathe.\\" Commonly, the verb \\"breathe\\" is considered an intransitive verb, meaning it does not take a direct object. For example, you would say \\"Paul breathed deeply,\\" where \\"deeply\\" is an adverb that describes how Paul breathed. The sentence \\"Paul breathed at Mary\\" requires the reader to interpret a less conventional meaning of the verb \\"breathe,\\" as it suggests that Paul is directing his breath towards Mary. While it is not entirely incorrect to use \\"breathe\\" with a prepositional phrase (such as \\"at Mary\\"), it can create confusion or sound unnatural, especially without proper context. The sentence might be more easily understood if clarified or rephrased, such as: \\"Paul blew his breath towards Mary\\" or \\"Paul exhaled in Mary's direction.\\" However, understanding that language is fluid and evolves, the sentence can still have some semantic acceptability if the intended meaning is clear given the context in which it appears."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

A:","completion":"The woman means a combination of all three statements. 1. The record player is still useful: When the woman says \\"It still works,\\" she implies that the record player is functioning and can perform its intended purpose. So, there is still some utility in the device, and it can be used for its intended purpose. 2. The man shouldn't have thrown it away: By stating that the record player still works, the woman is indirectly suggesting that the man's decision to throw it away was not a wise one.

The anti-bigotry group said \\"racists and haters\\" had \\"taken a popular internet meme and twisted it\\". Pepe has recently been depicted as Adolf Hitler and a member of the white supremacist KKK. Pepe made his debut in 2005 in artist Matt Furie's \\"Boy's Club\\" cartoons. Since then, pictures of the creature have spread through the online communities 4chan, 8chan, and Reddit, where users can post an image for others to comment on. These are mostly used to express emotions or experiences, but some racist and anti-Semitic versions have spread virally on Facebook and Twitter. Trump Jr's Skittles graphic deleted from Twitter \\"These anti-Semites have no shame,\\" ADL's chief executive Jonathan A Greenblatt said. \\"They are abusing the image of a cartoon character, one that might at first seem appealing, to harass and spread hatred on social media.\\" The Alt-Right movement, a disparate group of right-wing social media users, has repeatedly shared Pepe re-workings on social media. The movement has been described as an alternative to mainstream conservatism, but its proponents have repeatedly abused Jewish Americans and portrayed white people as oppressed. The Alt-Right has claimed Mr Trump as its presidential candidate of choice. The mogul has not approved it, but did re-tweet a caricature depicting him as Pepe the Frog in October 2015, with the caption \\"You Can't Stump the Trump\\". The frog made headlines in mid-September when Hillary Clinton said most of Mr Trump's supporters belonged in a \\"basket of deplorables\\".

They are the largest known gravitationally bound structures in the universe and were believed to be the largest known structures in the universe until the 1980s, when superclusters were discovered. One of the key features of clusters is the intracluster medium (ICM). The ICM consists of heated gas between the galaxies and has a peak temperature between 215 keV that is dependent on the total mass of the cluster. Galaxy clusters should not be confused with star clusters, such as open clusters, which are structures of stars \\"within\\" galaxies, or with globular clusters, which typically orbit galaxies. Small aggregates of galaxies are referred to as groups of galaxies rather than clusters of galaxies. The groups and clusters can themselves cluster together to form superclusters. - The Universe is all of time and space and its contents. It includes planets, moons, minor planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, and all matter and energy. The size of the entire Universe is unknown. - The Virgocentric flow (VCF) is the preferred movement of Local Group galaxies towards the Virgo cluster caused by its overwhelming gravity, which separates bound objects from the Hubble flow of cosmic expansion. The VCF can refer to the Local Group's movement towards the Virgo \\"Super\\"cluster, since its center is considered synonymous with the Virgo cluster, but more tedious to ascertain due to its much larger volume. The excess velocity of Local Group galaxies towards, and with respect to, the Virgo Cluster are 100 to 400 km/s. This excess velocity is referred to as each galaxy's peculiar velocity. - The Andromeda Galaxy, also known as Messier 31, M31, or NGC 224, is a spiral galaxy approximately 780 kiloparsecs (2.5 million light-years) from Earth. It is the nearest major galaxy to the Milky Way and was often referred to as the Great Andromeda Nebula in older texts. It received its name from the area of the sky in which it appears, the constellation of Andromeda, which was named after the mythological princess Andromeda. - A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of stars, stellar remnants, interstellar gas, dust, and dark matter. The word galaxy is derived from the Greek \\"\\", literally \\"milky\\", a reference to the Milky Way. Galaxies range in size from dwarfs with just a few billion stars to giants with one hundred trillion stars, each orbiting its galaxy's center of mass. Galaxies are categorized according to their visual morphology as elliptical, spiral and irregular. Many galaxies are thought to have black holes at their active centers. The Milky Way's central black hole, known as Sagittarius A*, has a mass four million times greater than the Sun. As of March 2016, GN-z11 is the oldest and most distant observed galaxy with a comoving distance of 32 billion light-years from Earth, and observed as it existed just 400 million years after the Big Bang. - A star is a luminous sphere of plasma held together by its own gravity. The nearest star to Earth is the Sun. Many other stars are visible to the naked eye from Earth during the night, appearing as a multitude of fixed luminous points in the sky due to their immense distance from Earth. Historically, the most prominent stars were grouped into constellations and asterisms, the brightest of which gained proper names. Astronomers have assembled star catalogues that identify the known stars and provide standardized stellar designations. However, most of the stars in the Universe, including all stars outside our galaxy, the Milky Way, are invisible to the naked eye from Earth. Indeed, most are invisible from Earth even through the most powerful telescopes. - The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System. The descriptive \\"milky\\" is derived from the appearance from Earth of the galaxy a band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye. The term \\"Milky Way\\" is a translation of the Latin ', from the Greek (', \\"milky circle\\"). From Earth, the Milky Way appears as a band because its disk-shaped structure is viewed from within. Galileo Galilei first resolved the band of light into individual stars with his telescope in 1610. Until the early 1920s, most astronomers thought that the Milky Way contained all the stars in the Universe. Following the 1920 Great Debate between the astronomers Harlow Shapley and Heber Curtis, observations by Edwin Hubble showed that the Milky Way is just one of many galaxies. - Harlow Shapley (November 2, 1885 October 20, 1972) was an American astronomer. - Edwin Powell Hubble (November 20, 1889 September 28, 1953) was an American astronomer. He played a crucial role in establishing the fields of extragalactic astronomy and observational cosmology and is regarded as one of the most important astronomers of all time. - A Supercluster is a large group of smaller galaxy clusters or galaxy groups, which is among the largest-known structures of the cosmos. The Milky Way is part of the Local Group galaxy cluster (that contains more than 54 galaxies), which in turn is part of the Laniakea Supercluster. This supercluster spans over 500 million light-years, while the Local Group spans over 10 million light-years. The number of superclusters in the observable universe is estimated to be 10 million. - The Virgo Supercluster ( Virgo SC ) or the Local Supercluster ( LSC or LS ) is a mass concentration of galaxies that contains the Virgo Cluster in addition to the Local Group , which in turn contains the Milky Way and Andromeda Galaxies . At least 100 galaxy groups and clusters are located within its diameter of 33 megaparsecs ( 110 million light - years ) . It is one of millions of superclusters in the observable universe . A 2014 study indicates that the Virgo Supercluster is only a lobe of a greater supercluster , Laniakea , which is centered on the Great Attractor . - Latin (Latin: ) is a classical language belonging to the Italic branch of the Indo-European languages. The Latin alphabet is derived from the Etruscan and Greek alphabets. - A light-year is a unit of length used to express astronomical distances. It is about 9 trillion kilometres or 6 trillion miles. As defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU), a light-year is the distance that light travels in vacuum in one Julian year (365.25 days). Because it includes the word \\"year\\", the term light-year is sometimes misinterpreted as a unit of time. - The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system comprising the Sun and the objects that orbit it, either directly or indirectly. Of those objects that orbit the Sun directly, the largest eight are the planets, with the remainder being significantly smaller objects, such as dwarf planets and small Solar System bodies. Of the objects that orbit the Sun indirectly, the moons, two are larger than the smallest planet, Mercury. - A constellation is formally defined as a region of the celestial sphere, with boundaries laid down by the International Astronomical Union (IAU). The constellation areas mostly had their origins in Western-traditional patterns of stars from which the constellations take their names. - The Local Group is the galaxy group that includes the Milky Way. The Local Group comprises more than 54 galaxies, most of them dwarf galaxies. Its gravitational center is located somewhere between the Milky Way and the Andromeda Galaxy. The Local Group covers a diameter of (about 10 meters) and has a binary (dumbbell) distribution. The group itself is a part of the larger Virgo Supercluster, which in turn may be a part of the Laniakea Supercluster.

You must generate a detailed and long answer. Article: In the United States, their persistent legal challenges prompted a series of state and federal court rulings that reinforced judicial protections for civil liberties. Among the rights strengthened by Witness court victories in the United States are the protection of religious conduct from federal and state interference, the right to abstain from patriotic rituals and military service, the right of patients to refuse medical treatment, and the right to engage in public discourse. Similar cases in their favor have been heard in Canada. Now answer this question: What do patients have the right to refuse?","completion":"In the United States, patients have the right to refuse medical treatment, a right that has been strengthened through various legal cases and court rulings, including some involving the Jehovah's Witnesses. This right is grounded in the principles of autonomy, self-determination, and informed consent. The right to refuse medical treatment encompasses several aspects, including the refusal of specific medical procedures or interventions, the discontinuation of ongoing treatments, and the denial of life-sustaining measures. 1. Refusal of specific medical procedures or interventions: Patients may refuse specific procedures or interventions, such as surgeries, medications, or diagnostic tests if they feel that the potential risks outweigh the potential benefits. This right is based on the premise that patients have a fundamental right to control what happens to their bodies and should be able to make informed decisions about their medical care. 2. Discontinuation of ongoing treatments: Patients have the right to discontinue ongoing treatments, such as chemotherapy or dialysis, if they believe that the treatment is not improving their quality of life or is causing unbearable side effects. In such cases, patients may opt for comfort care or palliative care, which focuses on providing relief from symptoms and maximizing the patient's quality of life. 3. Denial of life-sustaining measures: Patients can refuse life-sustaining measures, such as ventilators, tube feeding, or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). This right is particularly relevant in cases of terminal illnesses, where patients may choose to focus on quality of life rather than prolonging life. 4. Advance directives: To ensure that their wishes regarding medical treatment are respected in the event that they become incapacitated or unable to communicate, patients can create advance directives, such as living wills or durable power of attorney for healthcare. These documents outline the patient's preferences concerning medical treatments, including life-sustaining measures, and designate a healthcare proxy to make medical decisions on their behalf if they are unable to do so. Despite the right to refuse medical treatment, there are some limitations. Healthcare providers are obligated to provide patients with adequate information about their medical condition, the proposed treatment, its risks, benefits, and alternatives, as well as the potential consequences of refusing treatment. However, healthcare providers cannot force patients to undergo treatments against their will or coerce them into making specific choices. In some cases, the refusal of medical treatment may result in legal or ethical challenges. For instance, doctors might encounter situations where they must balance the patient's autonomy with the greater good or the protection of public health. Moreover, issues may arise when discussing the rights of minors or individuals with cognitive impairments, as their ability to make informed decisions may be compromised. In these cases, the decision-making process may involve parents, guardians, or court-appointed advocates. In summary, patients in the United States have the right to refuse medical treatment based on their personal beliefs, values, and preferences. This right is grounded in the principles of autonomy, informed consent, and the patient's right to make decisions about their own body and medical care. However, this right is not absolute, and healthcare providers must carefully consider the ethical and legal implications involved when patients refuse treatment."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Donald Trump triumphantly greeted the three Americans released by North Korea in the early morning darkness at Joint Base Andrews outside Washington early Thursday, an image one can expect to see over and over again come the 2020 U.S. presidential election campaign. “It was a very important thing to all of us to be able to get these three great people out,” Trump told reporters on the tarmac. He then went on to speculate that live television coverage of the arrival “probably broke the all-time in history television rating for 3 o’clock in the morning.” It was a moment the president gladly seized given that his White House has been buffeted by a chaotic mix of policy and personal drama in recent days. The prospect of a potentially historic breakthrough on North Korea could move a number of other unwelcome distractions to the side, including the ongoing Russia investigation, the growing legal difficulties for Trump’s personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, and the soap opera that the Stormy Daniels story has become. Daniels is the adult film actress who claims she once had an affair with Trump. He denies the claim. Trump also announced Thursday on Twitter that he will meet with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un on June 12 in Singapore. A new CNN poll found that 77 percent of those surveyed support Trump meeting the North Korean leader, and 53 percent approve of his handling of the North Korea issue generally. Those numbers are in keeping with a general trend of late that has seen the president’s poll ratings improving, perhaps in part because of the strong economy.

Burn beeswax candles.","completion":"Title: Enhance Your Living Space: Plants, Salt Lamps, and Beeswax Candles Introduction Our homes serve as our personal sanctuaries, providing comfort, safety, and relaxation. Therefore, it is important to create a living space that promotes a balanced and healthy environment. One way to achieve this is by incorporating plants, salt lamps, and beeswax candles into your decor. In this article, we will discuss the benefits of these items and how they can improve the quality of your living space. Step 1: Incorporating Plants into Your Home Adding plants to your home can significantly improve indoor air quality, as they act as natural air purifiers. According to a NASA study, certain plants are known to remove harmful pollutants like benzene, formaldehyde, and trichloroethylene from the air. These pollutants can be emitted by everyday household items such as furniture, electronics and cleaning products. By reducing these pollutants, plants can help alleviate allergies and promote overall wellness. Plants also have a natural calming effect, which can lower stress levels and improve mood. This can be particularly beneficial for people who spend a large portion of their day indoors, such as those working from home. Some easy-to-care-for plants that provide air purification benefits include the spider plant, snake plant, and pothos. Step 2: Adding a Salt Lamp to Your Space A Himalayan salt lamp is another great addition to your home decor, providing both aesthetic and health benefits. These lamps are made from solid blocks of Himalayan pink salt, which are known for their rich mineral content and distinct color. The lamp provides a warm, soothing glow when lit, creating a calming ambience in any room. Salt lamps are believed to have air purifying properties as they emit negative ions when heated. These ions can neutralize positive ions produced by electronic devices, helping to reduce indoor air pollution. Additionally, salt lamps are thought to help alleviate symptoms of allergies, asthma, and other respiratory issues, as well as improve sleep and enhance overall well-being. Step 3: Burning Beeswax Candles Beeswax candles can also contribute to a healthier home environment. Unlike paraffin candles, which release toxic chemicals when burned, beeswax candles are a natural and eco-friendly alternative. They produce negative ions when lit, similar to salt lamps, purifying the air and reducing indoor allergens. Burning beeswax candles can also help with relaxation and stress relief, thanks to the calming effect of their warm, golden light. Moreover, they emit a subtle, natural honey scent, which can create a pleasant atmosphere in your home without the need for synthetic fragrances. Conclusion In conclusion, incorporating plants, salt lamps, and beeswax candles into your home decor can improve your living space's air quality, provide a calming environment, and promote overall well-being. With these simple additions, you can transform your home into a sanctuary that nurtures your physical and emotional health, while also creating a stylish and comfortable space."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The answer to the question: What is Beiderbecke's nickname? is inside the article: On November 30, 1928, whilst on tour in Cleveland, Beiderbecke suffered what Lion terms \\"a severe nervous crisis\\" and Sudhalter and Evans suggest \\"was in all probability an acute attack of delirium tremens\\", presumably triggered by Beiderbecke's attempt to curb his alcohol intake. \\"He cracked up, that's all\\", trombonist Bill Rank said. \\"Just went to pieces; broke up a roomful of furniture in the hotel.\\"In February 1929, Beiderbecke returned home to Davenport to convalesce and was hailed by the local press as \\"the world's hottest cornetist\\". He then spent the summer with Whiteman's band in Hollywood in preparation for the shooting of a new talking picture, The King of Jazz. Production delays prevented any real work from being done on the film, leaving Beiderbecke and his pals plenty of time to drink heavily. By September, he was back in Davenport, where his parents helped him to seek treatment. He spent a month, from October 14 until November 18, at the Keeley Institute in Dwight, Illinois. According to Lion, an examination by Keeley physicians confirmed the damaging effects of Bix's long-term reliance on alcohol: \\"Bix admitted to having used liquor 'in excess' for the past nine years, his daily dose over the last three years amounting to three pints of 'whiskey' and twenty cigarettes.....A Hepatic dullness was obvious, 'knee jerk could not be obtained' – which confirmed the spread of the polyneuritis, and Bix was 'swaying in Romberg position' – standing up with his eyes closed\\".While he was away, Whiteman famously kept his chair open in Beiderbecke's honor, in the hope that he would occupy it again. However, when he returned to New York at the end of January 1930, Beiderbecke did not rejoin Whiteman and performed only sparingly. On his last recording session, in New York, on September 15, 1930, Beiderbecke played on the original recording of Hoagy Carmichael's new song, \\"Georgia on My Mind\\", with Carmichael doing the vocal, Eddie Lang on guitar, Joe Venuti on violin, Jimmy Dorsey on clarinet and alto..., can you guess it ?

Article: In a 'Letter to American People' written by Osama bin Laden in 2002, he stated that one of the reasons he was fighting America is because of its support of India on the Kashmir issue. While on a trip to Delhi in 2002, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld suggested that Al-Qaeda was active in Kashmir, though he did not have any hard evidence. An investigation in 2002 unearthed evidence that Al-Qaeda and its affiliates were prospering in Pakistan-administered Kashmir with tacit approval of Pakistan's National Intelligence agency Inter-Services Intelligence. A team of Special Air Service and Delta Force was sent into Indian-administered Kashmir in 2002 to hunt for Osama bin Laden after reports that he was being sheltered by the Kashmiri militant group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen. U.S. officials believed that Al-Qaeda was helping organize a campaign of terror in Kashmir in order to provoke conflict between India and Pakistan. Fazlur Rehman Khalil, the leader of the Harkat-ul-Mujahideen, signed al-Qaeda's 1998 declaration of holy war, which called on Muslims to attack all Americans and their allies. Indian sources claimed that In 2006, Al-Qaeda claimed they had established a wing in Kashmir; this worried the Indian government. India also claimed that Al-Qaeda has strong ties with the Kashmir militant groups Lashkar-e-Taiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed in Pakistan. While on a visit to Pakistan in January 2010, U.S. Defense secretary Robert Gates stated that Al-Qaeda was seeking to destabilize the region and planning to provoke a nuclear war between India and Pakistan.

Perturbation hypothesis: suppose sediment becomes a smaller rock happens, how will it affect MORE igneous rock forming. Does the supposed perturbation have an effect (direct or indirect) on the process? Answer:","completion":"The perturbation hypothesis suggests that if sediment becomes a smaller rock, it could affect the formation of more igneous rocks. In this scenario, the smaller sedimentary rocks may break down more easily and quickly, increasing the rate at which sediment accumulates. This could lead to a greater amount of sedimentary rocks being formed. If more sedimentary rocks are formed, it increases the likelihood of these rocks being subjected to heat and pressure from plate-tectonic activity, leading to the formation of more metamorphic rocks. The greater amount of metamorphic rocks would then increase the chances of these rocks melting and becoming magma once again, eventually leading to the formation of more igneous rocks. So, the supposed perturbation does have an indirect effect on the process, with the potential to increase the rate at which igneous rocks are formed. However, this effect would depend on several factors such as the rate of sediment accumulation, the rate of sedimentary rock formation, and the intensity of plate-tectonic activity in the region."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Given the following passage \\"Notre Dame's conference affiliations for all of its sports except football and fencing changed in July 2013 as a result of major conference realignment, and its fencing affiliation will change in July 2014. The Irish left the Big East for the ACC during a prolonged period of instability in the Big East; while they maintain their football independence, they have committed to play five games per season against ACC opponents. In ice hockey, the Irish were forced to find a new conference home after the Big Ten Conference's decision to add the sport in 2013–14 led to a cascade of conference moves that culminated in the dissolution of the school's former hockey home, the Central Collegiate Hockey Association, after the 2012–13 season. Notre Dame moved its hockey team to Hockey East. After Notre Dame joined the ACC, the conference announced it would add fencing as a sponsored sport beginning in the 2014–15 school year. There are many theories behind the adoption of the athletics moniker but it is known that the Fighting Irish name was used in the early 1920s with respect to the football team and was popularized by alumnus Francis Wallace in his New York Daily News columns.

Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Abo Rabeea says he is still suffering from the suspected chemical weapons strike in Khan Sheikhoun The US says Syria's government appears to be preparing for a chemical weapons attack and has warned that it will \\"pay a very heavy price\\" if one takes place. The White House said similar activities had been seen before the nerve agent Sarin was allegedly dropped on rebel-held Khan Sheikhoun in April. Dozens of people were killed, prompting President Donald Trump to order a missile strike on a Syrian airbase. Syria's government denies it is preparing a chemical attack. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has previously said the Khan Sheikhoun incident was fabricated. What does the US claim? On Tuesday, Pentagon spokesman Capt Jeff Davis said activity had been spotted at the Syrian army's Shayrat airfield, from where the US says jets departed before the Khan Sheikhoun incident. \\"This involved specific aircraft in a specific hangar, both of which we know to be associated with chemical weapons use,\\" Capt Davis said. In a statement on Monday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the US had \\"identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children\\". He added that if \\"Mr Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price\\". The White House provided no supporting evidence or further explanation. US media had reported that the state department and Pentagon were caught off-guard by the statement, suggesting they were not consulted in advance, but the White House later said all \\"were involved in the process from the beginning\\". The US permanent representative to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, also warned Russia and Iran - Mr Assad's allies. \\"Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Assad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people,\\" she tweeted. The Associated Press news agency cited a non-governmental source with close ties to the White House as saying that the US had received intelligence that Syrian government forces were mixing precursor chemicals for a possible Sarin attack in either the east or south of the country. What is the context? Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: \\"Assad choked out the lives of helpless men, women and children\\" More than 80 people were killed in Khan Sheikhoun on 4 April, according to the local opposition-run health directorate. Video posted following the alleged air strike showed people struggling to breathe and foaming at the mouth - symptoms consistent with nerve agent poisoning. President Assad's close ally, Russia, said an air strike had hit a rebel depot full of chemical munitions and released toxic agents into the air - a claim that rebel factions and the Western powers which back them have dismissed. The Organisation for the Prevention of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) has said tests on samples collected from victims indicated that they were exposed to Sarin or a Sarin-like substance. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Former US deputy national security adviser James Jeffrey says \\"it's high time President Assad learns a lesson\\" President Trump cited the pictures of children in distress as one of the reasons he had decided to reverse previous US policy on Syria and launch a direct attack on Shayrat airbase days later. At the time, Capt Davis, the Pentagon spokesman, said Shayrat was used to store chemical weapons, and that US intelligence assessed that aircraft from there had dropped bombs filled with a nerve agent on Khan Sheikhoun. 'Crystal clear' warning - Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent The very public warning to the Syrian government against using chemical weapons is highly unusual. Such a step , which must surely be based upon detailed intelligence, might usually be delivered behind the scenes through diplomatic channels. The use of chemical weapons requires tell-tale preparations such as the movement of particular units, the distribution of weapons to a base from which they can be delivered and so on, all capable of being picked up by US satellites or drones. The warning is clearly intended to forestall such an attack and to make it clear that if the Syrian regime again crosses this line - just as it did last April - the US will respond with force. This time though the context is very different. There is growing friction between the US and pro-Assad forces. A US strike now would risk Washington being drawn further into the conflict. But the warning from the White House is crystal clear. What has been the reaction? Speaking to AP on Tuesday, Ali Haidar, the Syrian minister for national reconciliation, dismissed the US allegation. Russia, meanwhile, said it considered \\"such threats against the Syrian leadership to be unacceptable\\". Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov criticised the White House's use of the term \\"another\\" chemical weapons attack, pointing out that there had been no independent investigation of the Khan Sheikhoun deaths. President Assad has denied ever using chemical weapons and maintains that the country's entire arsenal was destroyed as part of a deal brokered by the US and Russia after a deadly Sarin attack on rebel-held suburbs of Damascus in 2013. The latest development comes amid increasing tension between the US and Russia, which recently warned the US-led coalition fighting so-called Islamic State that it would view its aircraft as targets after a Syrian military jet was shot down. ||||| White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during a the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, June 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Associated Press) White House press secretary Sean Spicer speaks during a the daily briefing at the White House in Washington, Monday, June 26, 2017. (AP Photo/Alex Brandon) (Associated Press) WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House issued a stern warning to Syrian President Bashar Assad on Monday night as it claimed \\"potential\\" evidence that Syria was preparing for another chemical weapons attack. In an ominous statement issued with no supporting evidence or further explanation, Press Secretary Sean Spicer said the U.S. had \\"identified potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack by the Assad regime that would likely result in the mass murder of civilians, including innocent children.\\" He said the activities were similar to preparations taken before an April 2017 attack that killed dozens of men, women and children, and warned that if \\"Mr. Assad conducts another mass murder attack using chemical weapons, he and his military will pay a heavy price.\\" The White House offered no details on what prompted the warning and spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said she had no additional information Monday night. Several State Department officials typically involved in coordinating such announcements said they were caught completely off guard by the warning, which didn't appear to be discussed in advance with other national security agencies. Typically, the State Department, the Pentagon and U.S. intelligence agencies would all be consulted before the White House issued a declaration sure to ricochet across foreign capitals. The officials weren't authorized to discuss national security planning publicly and requested anonymity. A non-governmental source with close ties to the White House said the administration had received intelligence that the Syrians were mixing precursor chemicals for a possible sarin gas attack in either the east of south of the country, where government troops and their proxies have faced recent setbacks. Assad had denied responsibility for the April 4 attack on the town of Khan Sheikhoun in the rebel-held Idlib province that killed dozens of people, including children. Victims show signs of suffocation, convulsions, foaming at the mouth and pupil constriction. Days later, President Donald Trump launched a retaliatory cruise missile strike on a Syrian government-controlled air base where U.S. officials said the Syrian military had launched the chemical attack. It was the first direct American assault on the Syrian government and Trump's most dramatic military order since becoming president months before. Trump said at the time that the Khan Sheikhoun attack crossed \\"many, many lines,\\" and called on \\"all civilized nations\\" to join the U.S. in seeking an end to the carnage in Syria. Syria maintained it hadn't used chemical weapons and blamed opposition fighters for stockpiling the chemicals. Russia's Defense Ministry said the toxic agents were released when a Syrian airstrike hit a rebel chemical weapons arsenal and munitions factory. Russia is a close ally of Assad. The U.S. attack on a Syrian air base came after years of heated debate and deliberation in Washington over intervention in the bloody civil war. Chemical weapons have killed hundreds of people since the start of the conflict. Earlier Monday, Trump had dinner with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster and other top officials as he hosted Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the White House. Tillerson and Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov talked earlier Monday about the need to secure a cease-fire in Syria, fight extremist groups and prevent the use of chemical weapons, the Russian Foreign Ministry said. Nikki Haley, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, followed up Spicer's statement with a Twitter warning: \\"Any further attacks done to the people of Syria will be blamed on Asaad, but also on Russia & Iran who support him killing his own people.\\" Less than an hour after Spicer issued the statement, Trump was back to tweeting about the 2016 campaign, denouncing investigations into potential collusion between Moscow and his campaign aides as a \\"Witch Hunt!\\" __ Associated Press writers Josh Lederman, Vivian Salama and Matthew Lee contributed to this report. ||||| Story highlights After a chemical attack on a rebel-held town in April, the US retaliated with a missile strike Trump said in April it was in the \\"vital national security\\" of the US to prevent use of chemical weapons (CNN) The White House has warned there are \\"potential preparations for another chemical weapons attack\\" by the Syrian regime and told the country's president, Bashar al-Assad, he would face a \\"heavy price\\" if one is carried out. The announcement comes amid rising tensions in Syria between the US-led coalition and Russia, which is backing the Assad regime. The US launched a fierce riposte in the aftermath of the chemical attack launched by Assad's forces in April -- which was condemned across the world -- and says it will not hesitate to take action should another similar strike take place.

Consider splitting it into new pages, adding subheadings, or condensing it. (March 2015) The film opens with a car crash on Brooklyn Bridge, and introduces Henry Letham (Ryan Gosling), a survivor of the crash, sitting, unharmed, next to a burning car on the bridge. Psychiatrist Sam Foster (Ewan McGregor) and his girlfriend (and former patient), art teacher Lila (Naomi Watts) are then introduced in a new scene. Sam discusses his patient, Henry, a college student and aspiring artist whom he describes as depressed and paranoid, with feelings of guilt and remorse over having 'set fire to' his car at the beginning of the film. Henry mentions that he sometimes hears voices, and seems able to predict future events. Henry is also suspicious of Sam because he had suddenly been called to stand in for his ordinary psychiatrist, Beth Levy (Janeane Garofalo). Henry has told Sam of his plans to kill himself that Saturday at midnight, which Sam finds very troubling. Lila, who has survived a past suicide attempt, offers to help to dissuade Henry from killing himself. Sam investigates Henry's circumstances in an effort to help. After repeatedly attempting to reach Dr. Levy, he comes to her apartment to find her disoriented and lethargic, mumbling incoherent phrases like \\"I didn't touch him; I know you're not supposed to move them,\\" occasionally belittling Sam with a maudlin reference to an implied unresolved tension between the two, and the fact that she's aware that he's dating an ex-patient. Henry, who had earlier claimed to have killed both of his parents, has his account contradicted by Sam when he finds Henry's mother (Kate Burton) and her dog living in a bare house, confused about Sam's identity (she insists that he is Henry) and refusing to respond to his questions. Henry's...

Q:Background: Farsightedness, or hyperopia, is the condition in which distant objects are seen clearly, but nearby objects appear blurry. It occurs when the eyeball is shorter than normal (see Figure below ). This causes images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina (if light could pass through the retina). Hyperopia can be corrected with convex lenses. The lenses focus images farther forward in the eye, so they fall on the retina instead of behind it. Paragraph: John is a an ophthalmologist in a local hospital. Today, he has seen two patients, patient A and patient B. Patient A had hyperopia, but patient B didn't have any issues with eyes. John would now treat the patient that have eye problem. Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question: In patient A would images fall behind the retina or on the retina? A:","completion":"In patient A, who has hyperopia, images would fall behind the retina. This conclusion is based on the provided background information that in hyperopia, the eyeball is shorter than normal causing images to be focused in a spot that would fall behind the retina. This is also indicated by the fact that patient A has an eye problem which John is treating, suggesting an abnormality in the way the eye is focusing images, which corresponds to the definition of hyperopia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Is the hypothesis entailed by the premise?","completion":"To determine if the hypothesis \\"Carving the nation's own path\\" is entailed by the premise \\"Towards Nationhood,\\" we first need to understand the implications and meanings of both statements. The premise, \\"Towards Nationhood,\\" suggests a process or journey that a particular territory, its people, and institutions undertake to achieve recognition as an independent, sovereign nation-state. This involves various stages, such as forming a distinct national identity, creating political and economic systems, and establishing international relationships. Key elements of the nationhood process may include: 1. Self-determination: A population's right to choose their political, social, and economic systems without external interference. 2. Cultural and social homogeneity: The development of a unique shared culture, language, religion, or other defining characteristics that distinguish the population from others. 3. Territorial integrity: A contiguous land area with defined borders, within which the country exercises full sovereignty. 4. Political institutions: The establishment of governance structures, including a constitution, rule of law, and systems for the peaceful transfer of power. 5. Economic foundations: Developing the infrastructure, industries, and networks needed to support a functioning economy. 6. Diplomatic recognition: Gaining formal acknowledgment and acceptance as a sovereign state by other countries and international organizations. The hypothesis, \\"Carving the nation's own path,\\" suggests the idea that, in achieving nationhood, the territory, its people, and institutions are pursuing an independent, self-determined direction that reflects their unique characteristics, aspirations, and priorities. This means that the nation seeks to develop its political, social, economic, and cultural systems according to its specific circumstances and wishes, rather than following templates or external pressures imposed by other nations, international organizations, or dominant global norms. Given these, it is possible to argue that the hypothesis is indeed entailed by the premise. Achieving nationhood inherently requires carving one's own path, as the process involves the gradual development of unique, self-determined systems and structures. A nation moving \\"towards nationhood\\" must necessarily explore its path, taking into consideration its history, geography, demography, and potential, while simultaneously forging a destiny apart from external influences. However, it should also be acknowledged that the journey towards nationhood is not always linear or entirely self-determined. Nations often face significant challenges and may need to compromise or adapt their aspirations due to external factors, such as international treaties, regional geopolitics, or global economic trends. Moreover, nations are not isolated entities – they exist within a complex, interconnected web of relationships that fundamentally shape their development trajectories. In conclusion, the hypothesis \\"Carving the nation's own path\\" is broadly entailed by the premise \\"Towards Nationhood.\\" However, it is crucial to recognize that the process of nation-building may encounter various external influences and pressures that necessitate negotiation, adaptation, and engagement with the broader international community."},{"prompt":"In this task, you are given an input list A.

Summarize this article: Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Trump: I would certainly apologise if you would like me to do that US President Donald Trump has said he is prepared to apologise for retweeting posts from a British far-right group. In an interview with ITV's Piers Morgan, Mr Trump said he knew \\"nothing\\" about Britain First before sharing three of its videos in November. \\"If you are telling me they're horrible people, horrible, racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that,\\" he told Morgan. The interview, held in Davos, will be broadcast on 28 January at 22:00 GMT. The president's sharing of the controversial videos to his 40 million followers sparked a Twitter row with the UK prime minister, who criticised the move. \\"I'm very clear that retweeting from Britain First was the wrong thing to do,\\" Mrs May said, prompting Mr Trump to instruct the PM to focus on \\"terrorism\\" in the UK instead. 'Good relationship' Asked if he regretted the tweets, Mr Trump said, \\"it was done because I am a big believer in fighting radical Islamic terror\\". But he insisted he knew \\"nothing about\\" Britain First before sharing posts by the group's deputy leader Jayda Fransen - who is facing a trial in April, accused of using threatening, abusive or insulting words at a protest in Belfast last year. \\"I know nothing about them, I don't want to be involved with people [like that],\\" Mr Trump told Morgan. One of the videos retweeted by Mr Trump shows unverified footage of a \\"Muslim migrant\\" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches, with another showing a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. The third video, originating from riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, shows a man being pushed from the top of a building. Mr Trump told Morgan: \\"Here's what's fair - if you're telling me they're horrible people, horrible racist people, I would certainly apologise if you'd like me to do that.\\" He also said the controversy was not a big story in the US. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption May: We're not afraid to say when US has got it wrong Britain First, which was set up in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP), uses social media to gain attention for what it calls the \\"Islamification of the UK\\". Responding to Mr Trump's interview, Ms Fransen said she believed he had been \\"railroaded\\" into offering to apologise. She said: \\"The fact is Donald Trump retweeted those because they are a matter of national and worldwide security. \\"Islamic terrorism is affecting us all and he's been railroaded into saying he would offer an apology.\\" Ms Fransen said if she was really a \\"horrible, nasty racist\\" the US president \\"would condemn me\\". But she added: \\"It's not true.\\" 'Significant climbdown' Speaking to ITV after the interview, Morgan said it was \\"right and proper\\" that Mr Trump should apologise, adding: \\"I think this is a significant climbdown by the president\\". The pair have been amiable since Morgan, who has described the president as a \\"good friend\\", won the US reality show Celebrity Apprentice in 2008 - which was judged by Mr Trump. Brendan Cox, whose wife Jo Cox was murdered by an extremist who shouted \\"Britain First\\" as he fired his gun, praised Morgan for pushing for an apology. \\"Not many have succeeded in getting one,\\" said Mr Cox, who was among those who rebuked Mr Trump for promoting the far-right group. During the interview, on the sidelines of the World Economic Forum, Mr Trump also told Morgan that he did not want to \\"cause any difficulty for your country\\". He spoke of his \\"love\\" for the UK and for Scotland in particular, which he described as a \\"very special place\\", despite cancelling a planned visit to the UK in February. Asked about whether some people were opposed to a UK visit, Mr Trump said: \\"I hadn't heard about banning, I think a lot of the people in your country like what I stand for, [including] tough borders.\\" Mr Trump added that he had a \\"very good relationship\\" with the UK prime minister, who he met in Davos shortly before the interview on Thursday. \\"A lot of people think we don't,\\" he said. In an earlier exchange with the PM in Davos, Switzerland, President Trump told Mrs May: \\"We love your country.\\" He also said the US and UK were \\"joined at the hip\\" on military matters, while Mrs May said they stood \\"shoulder to shoulder\\" in facing shared threats. ||||| U.S. President Donald Trump arrives during the annual meeting of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Friday, Jan. 26, 2018.

Trump tells British journalist Piers Morgan that \\"I know nothing about\\" the Britain First group and \\"would certainly apologize, if you'd like me to do that.\\" Trump was widely criticized - including by Morgan - for retweeting the videos last year. Morgan pressed Trump on the issue during an interview taped Thursday in Switzerland, where Trump is attending the World Economic Forum. Morgan released an interview clip on Friday. The full interview is scheduled to air Sunday on ITV.

Trump recently drew widespread condemnation for allegedly referring to African nations as \\"shithole countries\\" in discussing immigration, according to those at the meeting. The president has denied using that language, but others present say he did. Kagame says he and Trump had \\"good discussions\\" on economic and trade issues.

The president spoke to reporters briefly as he arrived at the annual gathering of financial and political leaders. Trump addresses the summit later Friday. He predicted his message will be \\"very well received\\" and that he will note that the U.S. is \\"doing fantastically well — better than we've done in decades.\\" The president is also expected to tout recent tax cuts and efforts to slash regulations. ___ 10:30 a.m. President Donald Trump says a New York Times report that he ordered the firing of special counsel Robert Mueller is \\"fake news.\\" The president was asked about the report on Friday as he arrived at the annual World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. Trump replied: \\"Fake news, folks. Fake news. Typical New York Times fake stories.\\" The Times reported that Trump ordered the firing of Mueller last June but backed off after White House lawyer Don McGahn threatened to quit. The newspaper says Trump demanded Mueller's firing just weeks after Mueller was first appointed by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. ___ 10 a.m. The White House says President Donald Trump is looking forward to declaring at the World Economic Forum that America open for business. Trump addresses the summit on Friday and administration officials who previewed the speech for journalists said the president is expected to tout recent tax cuts and efforts to reduce regulations. Trump will argue that it's a good time for businesses to invest in the United States. Trump is a critic of multinational trade deals. But he'll stress his commitment to free markets under what he sees as fair terms. He'll also call for international cooperation to take on issues like the threat posed by the Islamic State group and North Korea's nuclear arsenal.

By Alex Greig and Ryan Gorman PUBLISHED: 17:36 EST, 4 August 2013 | UPDATED: 07:51 EST, 5 August 2013 A MasterChef star arrested after a bizarre confrontation with University of Chicago police told officers he'd been possessed by Gordon Ramsay - who turned him into God - wasn't the first time he's run afoul of the law. Arrested July 31 after a knock down, drag out fight with campus police who noticed him acting strangely and with cuts all over his face, Josh Marks, 26, is no stranger to local law enforcement. Marks was also arrested in June on a trespassing charge. His transgressions have also cost him multiple sponsorships. Hell's kitchen: It's not clear what the relationship between Ramsay and Marks has been after","completion":"their encounter in the reality show MasterChef. However, it is evident that their trajectory has been fraught with surreal interactions, leaving observers puzzled by the depth of Marks' apparent obsession. Marks, a runner-up on the third season of Fox's \\"MasterChef\\" series, was renowned for his culinary talents and poised demeanor on television, but has increasingly exhibited erratic behavior sparking great concern amongst those who know him. Gordon Ramsay, a internationally acclaimed British chef, has long built a reputation for his explosive nature and cutting remarks aimed at contestants on shows like \\"Hell's Kitchen\\" and \\"MasterChef.\\" But Ramsay has yet to comment on Marks' allegations and claims of possession. It's not clear whether Ramsay is aware of how deeply his persona has allegedly affected Marks, or whether any of his actions may have contributed to the star's current state of wellbeing. The incident in July, notably disturbing due to its violent nature, led to charges against Marks for aggravated battery of a police officer. Marks apparently displayed clear signs of mental distress during the event, causing his attorney to push for a psychological evaluation. Reports from the scene described Marks as visibly shaken and markedly inconsistent in his statements to police, one moment insisting that he himself was God, the next moment claiming that Gordon Ramsay had transformed him into a deity. In addition, his arrest in June for trespassing suggests that Marks might be struggling with issues beyond the usual pressures of post-reality TV fame. Such instances raise major concerns about his state of mind, with unconfirmed claims that Marks is battling mental health issues. Moreover, these repeated incidents have had a devastating impact on his professional life - numerous sponsors have reportedly severed ties with the star due to his controversial actions and behaviour. Moving forward, Marks may face legal proceedings related to the battery charges as well as possible ramifications for violating terms potentially outlined in probation from his earlier trespassing charge. Undeniably, this is a tense period for all parties involved. To conclude the story, both local law enforcement and Marks' representatives will likely be closely monitored in the near future to see whether any further incidents will occur or whether a happier ending will emerge from this troubling chain of events - Marks receiving much-needed help for his issues. As for Ramsay, it remains interesting to see if the chef will address these claims publicly in what has become a strange and unexpected twist in the tale of a former MasterChef star's life."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

When I tried to get the film to be JUST subtitled or just dubbed, it made no difference! Odd, but still watchable. The story purports to be based on a Poe story, though I can't recall which one.

The country bounced between socialism and adherence to the neoliberal model.

To accommodate socialist and communist principles: As the country was transitioning between political and economic models, the constitution needed to be adjusted to reflect these changes.

To address the rights of workers: The revised constitution aimed to protect and promote the rights and welfare of workers in the country. This was an essential aspect of the socialist and communist ideologies that sought to ensure fair treatment and social justice for all in the face of deep-rooted inequalities. 3. To support the desirability of a socialist economy: The constitutional revisions explicitly mentioned the desirability of a socialist economy as a means to address the country's economic challenges and promote social and economic equality. This was in response to the country's previous experiences with the neoliberal model and a desire to move towards a more balanced and equitable economic system. 4.

Robert decides to continue being mostly inactive and only exercises with weights every couple of months. and a hint : In exercises such as weight lifting, skeletal muscle contracts against a resisting force (see Figure below ). Using skeletal muscle in this way increases its size and strength. In exercises such as running, the cardiac muscle contracts faster and the heart pumps more blood. Using cardiac muscle in this way increases its strength and efficiency. Continued exercise is necessary to maintain bigger, stronger muscles. If you don’t use a muscle, it will get smaller and weaker—so use it or lose it. Please answer this question : Who will increase the size of their muscles less?

Kevin got an error on his computer but could fix it unlike Kenneth because","completion":"Kenneth, unlike Kevin, was not very tech-savvy. Kenneth had always struggled with technology and found it much more challenging than his brother, Kevin, did. Kevin, on the other hand, had always been fascinated by computers and had even taught himself programming when he was just a teenager. As the two brothers sat in their shared living room, staring at the error message that had suddenly taken over Kenneth's computer screen, they knew they needed to figure out a solution. Kevin, taking on the role of the helpful older brother, was the first to suggest trying to troubleshoot the problem. \\"What's the error message say?\\" Kevin inquired, squinting at the screen. \\"Maybe we can figure out the problem by looking it up.” Kenneth pointed at the jumble of letters and numbers on the screen. \\"It says 'CRITICAL_PROCESS_DIED - Stop Code: 0x000000EF',\\" he replied nervously, hoping against hope that it wasn't a severe issue. Kevin recognized it as a common and mostly harmless operating system error, and he reassured his brother. \\"Okay, don't worry. This is a relatively easy problem to solve. You've probably got a software or driver that's causing the issue. I can help you fix it.\\" Grateful for Kevin's assistance, Kenneth stepped aside and allowed his brother to take the driver's seat at the computer desk. Kevin carefully navigated through the process, jotting down each step so that Kenneth might learn from the experience. First, Kevin instructed Kenneth to reboot the computer in safe mode, an essential troubleshooting step. By booting into safe mode, they could bypass most potential conflicts and load only the most crucial drivers and services. This step would help them discover if the error was related to any third-party software or driver. Once they had accessed safe mode without encountering the error, Kevin guided Kenneth through the following steps: 1. Open the Device Manager, a tool that allowed them to view and manage hardware devices and their drivers. 2. Identify any unknown, outdated, or malfunctioning devices, which may appear with a yellow triangle or an exclamation point. 3. Update or reinstall the drivers for these devices. By doing this, Kevin hoped to eliminate any driver conflicts that could be causing the error. As they went through this process, Kevin discovered an outdated graphics driver that potentially caused the problem. He showed Kenneth how to download and install the latest driver version from the manufacturer's website while explaining that keeping drivers up to date was crucial for a computer's stability and performance. Once the driver was successfully updated, they rebooted the computer in normal mode. To their relief, the error message had disappeared, and the system was running smoothly. Kevin took this opportunity to guide Kenneth through some preventive actions. He showed his brother how to create a system restore point, which could be very useful in the future if similar issues were to occur. Additionally, he taught Kenneth the importance of having an antivirus software installed and updated, as some errors like the one they just experienced could be caused by malware or other security threats. Overwhelmed but grateful, Kenneth thanked his brother and promised to pay more attention to technology and learn from Kevin's expertise. Kevin, in return, agreed to keep a watchful eye on his brother's computer habits while gently nudging him to become more tech-savvy. As a result, the brothers managed to combine their efforts and ensure that the computer error was not only fixed but that Kenneth acquired some essential tech skills. Above all, they realized that technology could bring them together and foster a deeper bond between them - one marked by mutual support, growth, and a shared curiosity for the world's rapidly evolving digital landscape."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Please briefly summarize this news article: How to Handle a Bad Boss Q: I have worked at the same company for 12 years. I really like my job and all the people who I work with except for one: my new boss. He was brought in from the outside, and no one else in my department can stand him either. We're hoping he won't stick around long, but I don't want to count on that in this economy. I now dread going to work since his office is right next to mine, and he watches everything I do. Is it time for me to start looking for a new job? A: While looking for another job may turn out to be your best option, don't start your search just yet. A job you really like and coworkers with whom you get along are benefits you don't want to lose in the current economy. What a disappointment if you leave your current job, only to find yourself in a new job with a whole new set of problems. So, try to resolve your issues first. If you aren't happy with your boss, you'll want to determine why you feel that way and then investigate and understand the root causes, says Gaylan Nielson, CEO of The Work Itself Group and co-author of Fake Work: Why People are Working Harder but Accomplishing Less. Then, take the initiative with your boss and try to resolve the issues you have with him. Start by making a list of the essentials you need in order to be effective and happy at your job. Next, set up a meeting with him. The meeting can serve as an opportunity to bridge the gap between your needs and those of your boss. Mr. Nielson suggests discussing the company, the group, and the team strategies and priorities along with your boss's priorities and how you can best support them. \\"Finally, after you have asked several questions about how your boss perceives your work and others' work, ask him for permission to discuss your issues about how he is treating you and others,\\" suggests Mr. Nielson, using \\"I feel\\" statements over judgments. Many times, new bosses are completely unaware of the discomfort their styles are causing, says Lydia Anti, a personal development coach and author of Develop the Keys to Successful Living. \\"He might not even know he is making you feel so down and agitated because, for all you know, he believes that he is doing his job,\\" she says. \\"If no one tells him, how will he know and change certain aspects of his people skills if that is the issue?\\" The biggest mistake you can make is to sit around and wait for your boss to leave. \\"Waiting around and hoping that things might change is a career-wasting activity,\\" says John Cioffi, management consultant and author of 6 Habits of Highly Successful Managers. \\"A collective and diplomatic discussion that gets everyone, including the boss, focused on goals is in the best interests of the staff, the boss, and the company.\\" Finally, remember there is a big difference between a boss who is abusive or crooked and one who is just learning the ropes and still an outsider, says Donald Hurzeler, author of The Way Up: How to Keep Your Career Moving in the Right Direction. If it turns out that your boss is in the first category, then yes, it may be time to start looking for a new position elsewhere or at least speaking about the situation with a higher up. But if it turns out that your boss simply hasn't settled in yet and is still feeling his way around, you have an excellent opportunity here to advance your career. \\"Bosses come in all shapes, sizes and with all kinds of backgrounds,\\" says Mr. Hurzeler. \\"The way to succeed is to find a way to become important to that new boss. In doing so, the boss wins, you win and the company wins.\\" Write to Elizabeth Garone at cjeditor@dowjones.com Summary:","completion":"In this news article, the author advises an employee dealing with a difficult new boss.

Zoos and research centers look after about 160 pandas. Scientists are studying how they live and more baby pandas are born in the zoos. Pandas live in the forests and mountains of Southwest China. They mainly live on bamboo, and each panda needs to eat a lot of bamboo every day. The area of bamboo is becoming smaller for many different reasons, so pandas have less and less land to live on. Pandas don't have many babies, and baby pandas often die. The situation is becoming very serious. Our government is working hard to save pandas. There are more than 30 nature reserves to protect pandas but these are not enough. The government has made a new plan to help pandas. The nature reserves will be bigger and the bamboo will grow better. Then the pandas will have enough food to eat and enough places to live in. Pandas born in the zoos may go back to live in the nature reserves. Most people love pandas. The panda is one of the best-known animals in the world. It is the symbol for the World Wide Fund for Nature. The WWF works to protect all animals in danger, so the panda has become the symbol of all animals in danger.

The user expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction which indicates the absence of an employment situation. Despite the attractiveness of the day, the speaker confronts and is reminded about their employment status, which isn't positive. The juxtaposition of these opposite sentiments in the same sentence can create a bit of confusion when trying to classify the whole message into either positive or negative. However, the negative aspect of the tweet which focuses on the impact of unemployment on the individual's daily life overshadow the positive sentiment about the day. Being jobless isn't a desirable condition for most individuals as it is associated with financial instability and uncertainty. So, considering the holistic view of both parts of this message, if we need to choose one of the options, the most reasonable choice would be: a). negative. The negative sentiment in the latter part of the statement has a higher weight because unemployment is a persistent condition and has a more significant impact on a person's emotions, compared to the transitory state of the weather or the state of a single day as described in the first part of the tweet."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Question: President Donald Trump is counting on congressional Republicans to enact a package of tax cuts in the coming weeks, in the process delivering his first major legislative achievement since taking office in January. But even as Trump and his Republican allies close in on the goal of passing tax reform, the Russia investigation continues to be a major distraction. The recent plea deal between Trump’s former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, and the office of special counsel Robert Mueller sent shockwaves around Washington and at the very least seemed to indicate the Russia probe is a long way from being completed. Trump is banking on a tax cut victory to shore up his political base and show supporters and detractors alike that he is a man of his word when it comes to delivering on his campaign promises. House and Senate negotiators are now working to resolve differences in the two versions with hopes of final votes in the coming weeks. But even if the tax plan is enacted into law, its impact is not likely to be felt for at least a year. And polls show the plan has less than majority support. Trump insists the tax cuts will lead to economic growth and more jobs. “I will tell you this is in a nonbraggadocio way,” Trump told supporters in Missouri recently. “There has never been a 10-month president that has accomplished what we have accomplished. That I can tell you.” Democrats oppose the tax plan but lack the votes to stop it. “It rewards the rich in terms of individuals and corporations at the expense of tens of millions of working middle class families in our country,” warned House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. Despite his poor standing in national polls, just less than 40 percent approval in most surveys, Trump’s base is largely sticking with him. The latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute found that 84 percent of Republicans continue to back the president.

The people that voted for him like it President Donald Trump is eager to achieve a major legislative victory and deliver on his campaign promises, especially when it comes to tax reform. This package of tax cuts has been a key focus for the Trump administration in recent weeks. Despite the ongoing distractions from the Russia investigation, Trump remains determined to secure a tax cut victory in order to shore up his political base and show both supporters and detractors that he can deliver on his promises. In the process of working towards tax reform, the House and Senate are now negotiating to resolve the differences between their two respective versions of the tax plan, aiming for final votes in the coming weeks. Even if the tax plan is successfully enacted into law, the impact of the tax cuts is unlikely to be felt for at least a year. Meanwhile, recent polling data has shown that less than a majority of Americans support this tax proposal. Nevertheless, Trump insists that the tax cuts will result in economic growth and increased job opportunities. In a speech in Missouri, Trump highlighted his administration's achievements during his first 10 months in office and expressed confidence that the proposed tax cuts would have positive effects on the economy. Democrats, on the other hand, have voiced opposition to the tax plan, arguing that it favors the wealthy and corporations over middle-class families. Despite his low approval ratings in national polls, Trump's base of support remains relatively strong. According to the latest American Values Survey by the Public Religion Research Institute, 84% of Republicans continue to back the president. This suggests that even though the tax plan may have less than majority support overall, it remains popular among those who voted for Trump. Thus, the correct answer is C. The people that voted for him like it. Trump likely believes that it's important to move forward with the tax plan despite some polls showing negative perceptions because his core supporters, who have been largely loyal and unwavering, endorse the proposal. By pushing for tax reform and demonstrating his commitment to fulfilling campaign promises, Trump hopes to maintain and potentially bolster this base of support."},{"prompt":"I am a movie director and I just received the following movie plot.

Police arrested a man Wednesday who is suspected of brandishing a handgun during a confrontation with young Somalis inside a McDonald’s in Eden Prairie. The 55-year-old man from Eden Prairie was jailed on suspicion of second-degree assault, a felony, in connection with the encounter Monday night at the fast-food restaurant on Prairie Center Drive in the heart of the suburb’s sprawling retail district. A police statement said the case will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney’s Office for a charging decision. The Star Tribune generally does not identify suspects before they are charged. A Somali teenager told the Star Tribune that she confronted a white man over what she took as an ethnic slight and that he responded by waving a handgun at her and other young people before leaving. Jihan Abdullahi, 17, said she and a friend both tried in vain to pay for an order with a retail app on their smartphone as the man stood behind them. “As [we] are walking away, the man says under his breath, ‘You were paying with EBT; that’s why it didn’t work,’ ” Abdullahi said. A screengrab from the video on Twitter of the incident at the McDonald's in Eden Prairie. A 55-year-old man has been arrested. EBT refers to government-funded food assistance. Abdullahi said she responded, “ ‘Just because I’m black you think my friends and I live under EBT?’ And he said, ‘Yes.’ ” A 45-second video that has been viewed on Twitter more than 1.7 million times starts at some point after several young people got into a confrontation with the man. The video shows a teenage boy and the man pushing each other before the man stumbled backward and out the door. At that point, the teenagers quickly backed away, and several people shouted that the man was holding a gun. A gun cannot be seen in the video. A police report said the man allegedly pulled the firearm from his waistband. Police have yet to say whether the man had a state-issued permit allowing him to carry a firearm in public. “Over the course of the investigation, several witnesses have been interviewed and video recordings of the incident have been reviewed,” the police statement said. “Cooperation from McDonald’s and many tips from the public have also assisted the Eden Prairie Police Department with this case.” ||||| “Someone could easily have died,” Jihan said in an interview on Wednesday. “Anybody could easily have died.” Jihan said she and some friends were doing homework at a library on Monday when, just before 8 p.m., they decided to head to a nearby McDonald’s. “This is the McDonald’s we go to every day,” Jihan said. “It’s our hangout spot.” Jihan said she and a friend tried to pay for an order of Cinnamon Melts with Apple Pay, the mobile payment app, but the system didn’t work. That’s when the man started to complain that he wanted them to hurry up, she said. Then, as they were passing him after leaving the line, he asked them if they were using electronic benefits transfer cards, which are like debit cards for welfare benefits, to pay for their food. Jihan said that she asked him if he had said that because she and her friends were black, and that the man said yes. ||||| MINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) – There are concerns surrounding how a situation was handled this week after a group of Somali teens alleged that a man pulled a gun on them inside an Eden Prairie McDonald’s restaurant. Eden Prairie police are investigating the incident, which happened Monday night at the restaurant on Prairie Center Drive, near the city’s shopping mall. Police arrested 55-year-old Lloyd Edward Johnson Wednesday afternoon on probable cause second-degree assault. Johnson, from Eden Prairie, is being held at Hennepin County Jail in downtown Minneapolis. Omar Jamal, a Somali community activist, told The Star Tribune that he’s concerned how the store management responded to the situation, which was captured in a now viral video, showing a manager demanding that the teens leave immediately. “If I were the manager, and you were in there and mentioned the word ‘gun,’ then I have to go out and make sure there is no gun before I kick you out,” he told the newspaper. One of the teens involved in the incident, Farida Osman, told the website Muslim Girl that it happened after her and her friends left the nearby library to get food. When workers at the restaurant had trouble processing her friends’ Apple Pay orders, Johnson, who was standing in line, allegedly commented that they were using EBT, electronic welfare benefits. Insulted by the remark, the teens confronted Johnson, who began to curse at them, Osman told the blog. The situation escalated, becoming physical. When Johnson walked out of the restaurant, he allegedly flashed a gun at the teens. The incident was captured on video and posted to Twitter, showing the man push a teen and back out of the restaurant, facing the group. It’s unclear if he had a gun. As of Wednesday morning, the video posted to Twitter has been viewed more than one million times. The 45-second clip also showed the McDonald’s manager immediately demand that the teens leave the restaurant. Another customer then comes to the teens’ aid, telling the manager to call the police. The McDonald’s owner and operator, Paul Ostergaard, released a statement Tuesday, saying that the restaurant is taking the incident seriously and is working with police. “Nothing is more important than the safety and security of our customers and employees,” the statement said. Jaylani Hussein, executive director of CAIR-Minnesota, applauded the arrest in a statement Wednesday. “We welcome the arrest of a suspect in this disturbing incident and look forward to appropriate charges being brought by state and federal law enforcement agencies,” Hussein said. “We thank Eden Prairie police for their swift and professional investigating leading to this arrest.” Eden Prairie police are still interviewing witnesses and reviewing videos of the incident.

Cholesterol has been implicated in heart disease for decades. Atherosclerosis is a disorder of the arteries in which cholesterol and other materials are deposited on the interior of the arterial wall. These deposits lead to the formation of plaques that can restrict or even block the flow of blood through these blood vessels (see Figure below ). A decrease in the flow of blood can lead to high blood pressure and a lowered oxygen supply to the heart muscle.

Costa Rica's Legislative Assembly on Monday passed a measure – by accident – that could legalize same-sex civil unions as part of a larger bill, lawmakers noted on Tuesday. Conservative lawmakers voted for the bill’s passage without recognizing the included language that could be interpreted to change the definition of marriage, according to the daily La Nación. Lawmakers immediately called for President Laura Chinchilla to veto the bill. José María Villalta, a lawmaker from San José, inserted the language into the bill. Villalta is a member of the leftist Broad Front Party. The language confers social rights and benefits of a civil union, free from discrimination, according to La Nación. Villalta attached the measure to a reform of the Law of Young People, which covers various social services for young people and laws governing marriage. “During the discussion in the first debate, we explained that the Law of Young People should be interpreted with this sense of opening to gays and no one objected,” Villalta said, according to La Republica. Conservative politicians such as Justo Orozco, a member of the evangelical National Renovation Party, slammed the measure. “That preference is not a right,” Orozco said, according to La Nación. “It’s a stunted development of sexual identity. It can change like alcoholism, tobacco addiction.” Carlos Avendaño, a lawmaker from another evangelical party, the National Restoration Party, threw cold water on the measure. According to La Prensa Libre, Avendaño said the measure is a mirage because the law already established that marriage unions are between a man and a woman. “The reference that is here is for heterosexual partners,” Avendaño said. Marco Castillo, president of the Diversity Movement, said he was optimistic about the bill’s passage. However, for civil unions to survive, it would have to survive a constitutional challenge in the court. “It is a big step forward for gay rights in Costa Rica,” Castillo said in a phone interview. The legislation comes one day after thousands marched for gay marriage in San José. In 2011, Chinchilla said she would not oppose gay marriage if the courts allowed, but she has not campaigned on the issue. A poll at that time said 73 percent of Costa Ricans opposed same-sex marriage. Currently, five Latin American countries recognize same-sex unions. Argentina and Uruguay recognize gay marriage, while Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador recognize same-sex unions, according to the Washington Post. ||||| The president told reporters on Wednesday morning that it is not the executive branch's role to interpret laws passed by Congress. President Chinchilla greeting people at an event she attended in Naranjo, where she told the press about her intention to sign the controversial bill into law. Courtesy Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. Just days after lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender organizers kicked off a national campaign for marriage equality in Costa Rica, sexual diversity advocates here are celebrating a bizarre series of events in their favor. After legislators “accidentally” passed a law that includes language that could open a path to same-sex civil unions in the Central American country, President Laura Chinchilla said on Wednesday that she would not veto it, as some lawmakers have urged. “No, we’re going to go forward and will sign this law. We understand that the debate is over how some interpret the law and this alone is not sufficient for the executive to veto the law,” Chinchilla told reporters, according to a video posted by AmeliaRueda.com. Tico Times Editorial A miracle on the Cuesta de Moras The president added that the only members of government equipped to interpret the law are judges and lawmakers. Communications Minister Carlos Roverssi confirmed the president’s statement, according to the daily La Nación. On Monday, the Costa Rican Legislative Assembly passed the Law of Young People, which included a new version of the Family Code that recognizes the right to a common-law marriage “without discrimination against to human dignity.” Article 242 of Costa Rica's Family Code defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman. The modification of the Young People Law – if ruled constitutional by the country's Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court – would strike language defining unions specifically as that between a man and woman. Supporters and many opponents believe the new language opens the legal possibility of same-sex unions. In the past, Chinchilla has been lukewarm on her support for same-sex unions. In 2011, she said that she would not oppose the legalization of gay marriage in Costa Rica, but stopped short of a full endorsement, saying that it was not part of her “national agenda.” In a meandering response to a reporter’s question about if and when she would support gay rights during U.S. President Barack Obama’s visit in early May, Chinchilla said, “I hope and trust that the debate truly can become much more balanced and more mature, without stigmatization and without disqualifications, and that, finally, will generate a decision in the Congress of the Republic.” On Sunday, organizers with the Front for Equal Rights launched a national campaign for marriage equality, demanding full marital and family rights for LGBT couples in Costa Rica. According to the group’s Facebook page, they collected more than 2,000 signatures in support of the bill. Past bills to legalize civil unions and common-law marriage between same-sex couples have languished in the legislature. Marco Castillo, president of the Diversity Movement, told The Tico Times last week that “religious fundamentalist” deputies and a lack of political will were the biggest hurdles to passing LGBT rights and protections in Costa Rica. Costa Rica would be the first country in Central America to approve same-sex civil unions if the provision’s legal interpretation holds up in court. ||||| What is a summary?","completion":"A summary is a short and simple explanation of something that is usually longer and more complex.

When Jurgen D suggested French food as August's cuisine for our monthly yelp get-together dinner I was over-joyed. French cuisine is my absolute favourite, and I'm not just saying this. I have visited France more than I have England, at least twice a year as a kid, and grew up adoring foie gras, steak tartar, red meat as blue as can be, haricot vert, goutier, creamy patisserie pastries, cheese and wine. Le Mouton Noir is as close to a meal in Lyon as you'll find in Edinburgh. Whilst the word 'authentic' gets banded around a bit too much, I can't really think of any other way to describe it. French waiters, a French chef, and with real French passion for good food. The menu changes daily so you can't find it on the website. I did laugh at the fact that it deatils every option such as \\"lamb shank in spices with sweet potato\\", \\"duck gizzard salad with walnuts and lardons\\" through every meat dish and then at the very bottom there was only one veggie option, described simply as \\"Veggie Option\\". If you know French cuisine you will know they are unsympathetic to those who go sans viande. Luckily I am not of that ilk. So it was duck gizzards to start and feather steak for a main - rare. I'd never had duck gizzards before and only when going home later and googling it did I discover that they are in fact one of the few stomachs that a duck has. I was surprised. The gizzards were really delicious, and I think I had around 8 of them (that's 8 whole little duck stomachs, oops.) The steak. Oh my god. The steak. Give me a moment. When you order 'rare' in the UK it can sometimes arrive slightly pink, if you're lucky the potatoes may get stained a little red, but once or twice a 'rare' steak has been presented 'well done'. Le Mouton Noir's steak was still blue. And just... je nais ce qoui. Out of this world. It was a huge portion, and for only u00a312 I couldn't get over the value for both the quality and quantity. As Jurgen D has said, the chips were probably the best we've had too. It really was my best meal in a long time. I have previously given another restaurant in Edinburgh the accolade of 'Best Steak in the City'. So that I don't appear to be giving that prized title right, left and centre I hear by reclaim it and hand it over to Le Mouton Noir. I would seriously eat out here every week for a steak and glass of red. Just perfect. The ambience is wonderful too. Dark wood, fairly small inside with limited seating, candles, and of course... it's French. Perfect for a date night, but also for the table of 8 yelpers that we were. Oh and my dessert of rum prunes was killer!! I'd never eaten prunes before - turns out I like them. And also turns out that there was probably at least three shots of rum in total. I left a little merrier and tipsy after those. I have definitely found my new favourite neighbourhood eaterie. It's actually affordable for a weekly meal, but the quality is some of the best I've had. Is this review positive or negative?","completion":"This review is undoubtedly positive. The reviewer expresses their love for French cuisine and describes Le Mouton Noir as authentic and having passionate staff. They praise the changing daily menu and their choice of duck gizzards and feather steak, mentioning that the latter was the best steak they've had in the city. The reviewer also appreciates the ambiance of the restaurant, which they find perfect for both date nights and group dinners. They mention enjoying their dessert and feeling tipsy from the rum prunes. The review emphasizes that the restaurant is affordable for a weekly meal, while maintaining top-notch quality.

Think like you are answering to a five year old. Solve -18*z = 27*z + 75*z + 2160 for z. Solve this problem.","completion":"Alright, let's solve the equation step by step, like we're helping a five year old to understand! We are given this equation: -18 * z = 27 * z + 75 * z + 2160 This equation has \\"z\\" in it which means we need to find out what number \\"z\\" is. To find it, we simply need to put all the \\"z\\" terms on one side of the equation and the number (in this case, 2160) on the other side. Let's start by moving the \\"z\\" terms with the positive numbers (27 * z and 75 * z) to the other side where there's -18 * z: -18 * z - 27 * z - 75 * z = 2160 Now, let's add up all the \\"z\\" terms on the left side: (-18 - 27 - 75) * z = 2160 (-120) * z = 2160 Now, we want to find \\"z\\" by itself, so we have to get rid of the -120 that is multiplied by \\"z\\". To do this, we divide both sides of the equation by -120: z = 2160 / (-120) When we divide 2160 by -120, we get: z = -18 So the answer to the equation is z = -18."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Q: SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA — Some people in Seoul on Tuesday said they are happy just to see U.S. President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un talking to each other rather than trading threats of war. “I am very happy because it is an epoch breakthrough after 70 years of division,” said Lee Jun-keun, a salesman working for a retail business. Last year the two leaders traded insults, with Trump calling Kim “rocket man,” and the North Korean leader calling the U.S. president a “dotard,” and they both threatened military action as tension rose over the North’s accelerated weapons testing to develop an operational nuclear armed intercontinental ballistic missile capability. But after North Korea successfully test-fired missiles it claimed could carry nuclear warheads capable of reaching the United States, Pyongyang pivoted to diplomacy by suspending further provocations and indicating a willingness to engage in denuclearization talks. Trump surprised allies and adversaries alike by immediately agreeing to meet with Kim, long before the specifics of a nuclear deal could be negotiated. Tuesday’s first meeting between a sitting U.S. president and a North Korean leader produced a broad declaration to rid the Korean Peninsula of nuclear weapons and develop a peace treaty to end the long standing hostiles between the U.S. and North Korea. Trump called the agreement “very comprehensive,” but it will be left to negotiators to later resolve differences between Washington’s call for complete and verifiable nuclear dismantlement before any sanctions relief is provided, and Pyongyang’s demand that concessions be linked to incremental progress. Some in South Korea remain skeptical that the broad commitment reached at the U.S.-North Korean summit in Singapore will lead to North Korea giving up its nuclear weapons program. “North Korea did not keep its promise in the past, even after signing the agreement. This is what I am disappointed and doubtful about,” said Shim Jae-yeon, a housewife who lives in Seoul. Others... According to the above context, answer the following question. Following the summit, what does Trump likely believe about North Korea's intent to honor the new agreement? The answer is:","completion":"Trump likely believes that North Korea has sincere intentions to honor the new agreement, as he called the agreement \\"very comprehensive.\\" However, the actual outcome will depend on the negotiators' ability to resolve differences between the U.S. and North Korea over the specifics of nuclear dismantlement and sanctions relief."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Lee laid next to Aubrey and looked up at the stars in the night sky.

Asberry, 64, and her grandchildren, ages 6 to 9, died early Saturday after being swept away by floodwaters in Palestine, police said. It was part of a system of severe storms that left one other person missing, damaged dozens of homes and threatened more flash-flooding in storm-weary Texas and other parts of the South. \\"They were talking to her telling her to come this way, come this way keep walking,\\" Asberry's son, Doniell Hudnall, told CNN affiliate KLTV . \\"They say she was trying and once she took so many steps or whatever. I guess she got weak.\\" Asberry's nephew Derrick Asberry told the station she was trying to help the small children to safety. Several inches of rain fell in less than an hour after midnight in Palestine, about a 110-mile drive southeast of Dallas, particularly endangering a group of homes in a low-lying area near a creek -- including the home where Asberry and her four grandchildren were staying, police spokesman James Muniz said.

Capt. James Muniz of the Palestine Police Department told The Associated Press that six to 10 homes in a Palestine cul-de-sac were severely damaged following heavy rainfall over the course of just a few minutes after midnight. All other residents of the cul-de-sac were accounted for, he said. City crews found the five bodies — including the four children, all younger than 9 — near one of the homes before dawn after the floodwaters had receded. \\"The water came down the hill,\\" Muniz said. \\"The street was full of mud, so the water just came up. With the enormous amount of rain we had, we had people tell us that within minutes, the water was waist deep.\\" City officials used a dump truck to rescue one man from the roof of a home, Muniz said. One neighbor told authorities that he saw the family but lost sight of them as he waded through waist-deep water. ___ This story has been corrected to indicate the woman killed in the flooding was 64, not 66. ||||| PALESTINE, TX -- More than 12 hours after flood waters swept away a grandmother and her four children in East Texas, a photo of the family home on Timber Drive shows dirt and debris covering the roadway.

The 64-year-old woman and her great-grandchildren, who were all under the age of nine, died when a creek flooded their home in the 100 block of Timber Drive. The victims were identified as 64-year-old Lenda Asberry; Venetia Asberry, 9; Devonte Asberry, 8; Von Anthony Johnson Jr., 7; and Jamonicka Johnson, 6. A sixth fatality was confirmed early Saturday evening. The body of 30-year-old Giovani Olivas, who had been missing, was found around 5:30 p.m. Just after midnight, heavy downpours began to fall triggering flooding in a low-lying area in the town, according to the Palestine Police Department. Flood waters quickly filled a creek around homes and businesses with water rising to the roof line of nearby homes on Timber Dr. The police department reported receiving a call about a missing family around 3:45 a.m. and began a house-to-house search. A resident later told police he found bodies of two children in a front yard and police then located the grandmother and two more children in an area behind the homes. Police said it appeared Asberry and the children attempted to escape the home, but water swept them away. Their bodies have been taken to Tyler, Texas where they will undergo autopsies. Palestine mayor Bob Herrington signed a disaster declaration around 1:30 p.m. Saturday. A dump truck was used to rescue man from the roof of his home.

Q: Fact 1: Eyes are used for seeing by animals by sensing light. Fact 2: Wolves use their teeth, feet, eyes, nose, and ears to hunt. Given the two facts above, how do wolves hunt? A:","completion":"Given the two facts mentioned, we can deduce that wolves rely on a combination of sensory adaptations to effectively hunt their prey. Each of the senses - sight, hearing, smell, touch, and taste - play a role in various aspects of the hunting process to ensure the wolf's success and survival. 1. Vision: Wolves' eyes are specifically adapted for seeing in low-light conditions, enabling them to hunt effectively at dusk and dawn when their prey is most active. Their eyes possess a higher concentration of rod cells, which are responsible for detecting movement and differentiating between shades of gray. Wolves have a retinal structure called the tapetum lucidum, which reflects light back into the eye and enhances night vision. Additionally, their eyes' position on the front of the head allows for a greater field of view and depth perception. 2. Hearing: Wolves possess an acute sense of hearing, which enables them to detect prey even when it is not visible. Their large, erect ears are built to capture sound waves from various directions and amplify them for better clarity. Wolves can perceive a wide range of frequencies, from low, rumbling sounds produced by large animals, to high-pitched noises indicating the presence of smaller prey. 3. Smell: A Wolf's sense of smell is considered to be one of the most powerful in the animal kingdom. Their olfactory membrane contains around 280 million olfactory receptor cells, compared to 5 to 6 million in humans. This allows them to detect scents up to 1.75 miles away. Wolves use their noses to not only locate prey, but also to gather essential information about their surroundings, such as tracking other pack members, finding food, and identifying potential threats. 4. Touch: A wolf's sense of touch is facilitated through their highly specialized paws. The thick pads on the bottom of their feet protect their digits, and the hair between their toes provides insulation from cold temperatures and rough terrain. Moreover, these adaptations enable wolves to grip various surfaces, making it easier for them to maneuver silently and efficiently during the hunt. 5. Taste: Although the sense of taste may not play a significant role in the actual hunting process, it remains an essential component of a wolf's eating habits. Their flexible diet ensures that they can consume a wide variety of prey, from large ungulates such as elk and moose, to smaller mammals like rabbits and rodents. In summary, wolves exhibit a range of sensory adaptations specifically tailored to the demands of their hunting habits. By effectively utilizing their vision, hearing, sense of smell, touch, and taste, wolves can successfully locate, track, and capture a diverse array of prey in various environmental conditions. Each sense plays a crucial role in the wolves' hunting strategy, increasing their efficiency and overall chances of survival."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

She tells him that she has a quest for him, which he initially refuses. The queen uses her power to learn his greatest desire, to resurrect his beloved Valeria, and promises to bring her back to him, to which Conan agrees to the quest.

Pick the right mushrooms: Some mushrooms grow better outdoors than others. You can get mushroom spawn (baby mushrooms) from a store or online. Good outdoor mushrooms are like oyster mushrooms and shiitake mushrooms. 3. Prepare the area: Loosen the soil in the chosen area and mix in some yummy stuff like compost or aged wood chips. This will give the mushrooms a nice home to grow in. 4. Plant the spawn: Spread the mushroom spawn on the prepared area, and then cover it with a thin layer of soil or compost. 5. Keep it moist: Mushrooms need water to grow. So, make sure the area is always a little bit damp, but not too wet. You can use a watering can or a spray bottle to water. 6. Wait and watch: It takes some time for mushrooms to grow, maybe a few weeks or even months. So, be patient and keep checking on them. Remember, mushrooms can be sneaky, and sometimes they pop up where you least expect them. Soon, you'll have a yard full of happy little mushrooms!"},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What are the full names of the people Koch suspects is responsible for Blayden turning up dead? ? Johnny O'Clock is a junior partner in a posh casino with Guido Marchettis. Complicating their longtime working relationship is Guido's wife Nelle, who is still in love with former boyfriend Johnny. She gives Johnny an expensive custom pocket watch, the twin of a birthday present she gave her husband, except Johnny's has a romantic engraving on the back. Johnny gives the watch, along with a rejection note, to Harriet Hobson, a hat-check girl at the casino, to return to Nelle. Harriet, however, apparently commits suicide using gas. Her sister Nancy shows up to find out what happened. She becomes attracted to Johnny. They eventually learn from Police Inspector Koch that Harriet was killed by poison. Harriet was dating Chuck Blayden, a crooked cop who is trying to persuade Guido to let him take Johnny's place. When Blayden also turns up dead, Koch suspects that either Johnny or Marchettis is responsible. Though Johnny tries to resist, little by little, he falls for Nancy. When Koch shows both Johnny and Marchettis Johnny's watch and note, Johnny tells Nancy their relationship is through and takes her to the airport. As he is driving away, however, he narrowly survives a drive-by shooting, and Nancy realizes he was only trying to protect her. She refuses to leave him. Johnny decides to flee to South America with Nancy, but not before brazenly cashing in his share of the casino. Marchettis pulls out a gun when Johnny's back is turned. They shoot it out; Marchettis is killed and Johnny wounded. Afterward, Nelle offers to testify it was self-defense, but only if he will come back to her. He refuses, so she tells Koch it was cold-blooded murder. Johnny's first instinct is to run away, but Nancy convinces him to give himself up.

This measure represents the loudness or intensity of the sound generated by the horn and is used to ensure the horn is effective in warning both pedestrians and motorists of the approaching train. However, it is essential to understand that various factors can influence the exact decibel level of a train horn in different situations. 1. Train horn type: There are various types of train horns available with distinct decibel levels. For instance, a diesel-electric locomotive is equipped with an air horn designed to produce high decibel levels, usually between 130 to 150 dB. Steam train whistles are generally quieter due to their mechanism, which is based on steam pressure, and their decibel levels are typically between 100 to 130 dB. 2. Distance from the horn: Decibel levels decrease with distance due to the dispersion of sound waves as they travel through the air. Consequently, the intensity of a sound source, including a train horn, reduces the farther away you are from it. For instance, the noise level of a train horn may be around 150 dB at the source, but it might reduce to 110 dB at 100 meters or even 90 dB at 250 meters. 3. Environmental factors: The decibel level of a train horn may also be affected by the environment surrounding the train. For example, open spaces allow sound waves to spread out more easily, resulting in a decrease in the noise level. In contrast, urban areas with tall buildings and other structures can reflect or channel sound waves, causing them to remain louder over longer distances. 4. Maintenance and wear: Over time, train horns may experience wear and tear or require maintenance, which can impact their decibel levels. For example, a horn that is not properly maintained, may not create the appropriate sound intensity, and could produce a lower decibel level than intended. Federal regulations in countries such as the United States typically require a minimum decibel level for train horns to ensure that they maintain their function as a safety device. The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) mandates that train horns must produce a sound level of at least 96 dB, with a maximum limit of 110 dB, when measured at 100 feet (approximately 30 meters) away from the locomotive. It is necessary to be mindful of the potential risks associated with prolonged exposure to loud noises, as sounds that exceed 85 dB can lead to permanent hearing damage over time. Therefore, it is crucial for train operators and people living in proximity to railways to take necessary precautions to protect their hearing, such as wearing hearing protection or creating barriers to reduce noise levels in their surroundings."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

I can use this background: The general trend in electronegativity is that the value increases from left to right across a row in the periodic table and decreases down a column. The most electronegative element is fluorine, which has a value of 4.0. As discussed in the lesson \\"Trends in the Periodic Table,\\" electronegativity increases across a row as the number of protons in the nucleus increases and therefore has a stronger pull. Electronegativity decreases down a column due to an increased effect of electron shielding in larger atoms. Now, I have a new situation: A high school student, Timmy, is reading about elements of a periodic table. He is studying the periodic table when he decides to compare two random elements within the same column. He chooses Mardine and Sampline to compare and contrast and gets to work. The first thing he notices is that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine. It's not much information to go on, but it's a good starting point for Timmy. Answer this question please: Is electron shielding higher or lower in Sampline? The answer to this question is:","completion":"Electron shielding is higher in Sampline. To understand why, let's first discuss the concept of electron shielding. Electron shielding is the phenomenon where inner electrons, which are closer to the nucleus, shield or block the outer electrons from the full attractive force exerted by the positively charged protons in the nucleus. This results in a decrease of effective nuclear charge experienced by the outer electrons, leading them to be less tightly held by the nucleus. Now, let's look at the information given about Timmy's comparison between Mardine and Sampline. As both elements are in the same column, they belong to the same group in the periodic table. Elements in the same group share similar electron configurations and properties, as they have the same number of valence electrons. The statement that Sampline is further down the periodic table than Mardine indicates that Sampline has a higher atomic number and more electron shells than Mardine. As we move down a group in the periodic table, the atomic radius increases due to the addition of extra electron shells. This results in an increased distance between the nucleus and the outermost electrons, which is one of the factors contributing to higher electron shielding in larger atoms. With more electron shells, Sampline will have more inner electrons shielding the outermost electrons from the nucleus's attractive force. Thus, electron shielding will be higher in Sampline compared to Mardine. This increased electron shielding in Sampline is consistent with the trend of decreasing electronegativity as we move down a column in the periodic table, as previously discussed in the background information provided."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write a multi-choice question for the following article: Article: Doctors fighting malaria---one of the deadliest diseases on the planet--- may soon have a new affordable weapon in their smart phones. Researchers have found a way to use the phone's camera to detect the microorganism in the patient's blood that causes the disease. According to the World Health Organization, almost 600,000 people died of malaria in 2013, making this mosquito-borne disease one of the deadliest in the world. The saddest aspect of this calamity is that it affects mostly young children. Early detection of the infection is important for successful treatment. But since the first symptoms resemble ordinary flu, a microbiologist must look at a drop of a patient's blood under a microscope for a proper diagnosis. Scientists in Britain have now developed a smart phone attachment called Xrapid, that turns the phone into a 200-power microscope, while the attached app---based on facial recognition software - quickly detects the parasitic protozoa in the blood smear . Jean Viry-Babel is the CEO of IanXen, the company that developed the app. He says it is cheap and works on the spot. \\"So we take a high-definition picture of a sample of blood. We separate the red blood cells from the rest---the white blood cells, the platelets ---and we start looking at each of the red blood cells individually,\\" said Viry-Babel.

The only additional equipment required is an ordinary glass lab slide - called a \\"slate.\\" \\"There's only one button, which is called \\"Diagnose\\". So you put it on the slate and you put it on the dried blood, and you press diagnose and it tells you yes or no,\\" he said. Researchers say the field-testing of the device will begin in January and February in Tanzania, Benin and Indonesia --- while commercial use is scheduled to start by the end of March. They also plan to expand the versatility of the new device---teaching it to recognize other diseases, such as tuberculosis and Lyme Disease.","completion":"Which of the following best describes the new method for detecting malaria-causing microorganisms in a patient's blood using a smartphone?

King Tutankhamen Artifacts A traveling exhibition of artifacts from the tomb of King Tutankhamen, popularly known as \\"King Tut\\", toured the United States from November 1976 to April 1979. The 55 objects were shown in six cities and were seen by around eight million museum-goers. The second touring exhibit was started in 2007, this time with 130 artifacts and stops in London and three different American cities. However some objects, like the king's golden face mask, are too valuable or too delicate to be transported long distances, so \\"replicas\\" (exact copies of something) are on show. Japanese Color Woodblock Prints The Art Museum at University of Virginia, in Charlottesville, Virginia, has an extraordinary collection of Japanese color woodblock prints . These prints document the period from about 1850 to 1900, a time when Japan was opening itself to Western influences. Before this point, Japan was a closed society that had little communication with the world outside of its borders. These works of art beautifully show the feeling of change and the trend toward modernization. The museum has put together a traveling exhibition of 60 of these prints, which can be borrowed and exhibited worldwide for periods of eight weeks or more.

Now let's break down the steps to solve this instance of the math word problem: 1. From the given information, we know that the ratio of two numbers is 5:7. We can represent the two numbers as 5x and 7x, where x is a positive constant. 2. We are also given that if 25 is subtracted from each number, the new ratio becomes 35:59. This can be written as: (5x - 25) / (7x - 25) = 35 / 59 3. Next, we need to solve this equation to find the value of x. Cross multiplying gives us: 59 * (5x - 25) = 35 * (7x - 25) 4. Expanding the equation, we get: 295x - 1475 = 245x - 875 5. Rearranging the terms, we obtain: 50x = 600 6. Dividing both sides by 50, we find the value of x: x = 12 7.

News article: Given what a cancer the clerical sexual abuse scandals have been for the Catholic Church, one would imagine the Vatican would want new bishops to get a state-of-the-art presentation on best practices in terms of preventing such meltdowns in the future. The Vatican has been running just such a training course since 2001 for newly appointed bishops around the world, and almost 30 percent of the Catholic prelates in the world today have taken it. It’s more than a bit surprising, therefore, to discover that at least last year, the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, the body created by Pope Francis to identify “best practices” in the fight against child abuse, was not involved in the training. What’s the point of creating a commission to promote best practices, and putting one of the Church’s most credible leaders on the abuse issue, Boston Cardinal Sean P. O’Malley, in charge of it, and yet not having it address the new leaders who will have to implement those practices? On Monday, the top official at the Congregation for Bishops, Canadian Cardinal Marc Ouellet, outlined the papers presented during the most recent course, saying he wanted to invite “suggestions for improving the experience.” Traditionally, bishops have three key tasks: sanctifying, teaching, and governing. New bishops need to hear something about each, but on governance, a preeminent place clearly should go to the fight against child sexual abuse. Ouellet acknowledged it, listing “prevention of abuses” among key challenges. In that light, it’s worth reviewing what new bishops were, and weren’t, told. The presentation was entrusted to French Monsignor Tony Anatrella, a consulter to the Pontifical Council for the Family and the Pontifical Council for Health Care Workers, who’s based at the Collège des Bernardins in Paris. He’s a psychotherapist controversial for his views on homosexuality and “gender theory.” Although his presentation was long on therapeutic analysis, Anatrella did a credible job of slogging through components of the Code of Canon Law governing clergy accused of sexual crime with a minor. In other ways, however, his presentation seemed seriously wanting. For instance, Anatrella argued that bishops have no duty to report allegations to the police, which he says is up to victims and their families. It’s a legalistic take on a critical issue, one which has brought only trouble for the Church and its leaders. Why, one wonders, was it part of a training session? Most basically, canonical procedures kick in only after abuse has been alleged. Presumably the goal ought to be to stop those crimes from happening, and in that regard it’s striking that Anatrella devoted just a few paragraphs to abuse prevention, using abstract language without concrete examples. It’s especially puzzling given the resources the Church has invested in prevention programs. In the United States, the bishops estimated in 2013 that they had spent 260 million since 2002. A new book called “The Whole Truth” by Chicago-based attorney Joe Klest, an agnostic who’s made millions suing the Church on behalf of abuse victims, praises those efforts. “We need to focus on the protection of our children, the prevention of abuse, and swift intervention when abuse occurs,” Klest writes, referring to all of society. “The fact is that the institution that’s done more to create a reforming model for doing that is the Catholic Church.” For perspective, I contacted Monsignor Stephen Rossetti, who’s on the board of the Rome-based Gregorian University’s Centre for Child Protection, to ask, “What should new bishops be told about sexual abuse?” Here’s what he said bishops need to know: 1. “How to deal with victims, because it’s not intuitively obvious.” 2. “They have to know the canonical material.” 3. “What the red flags [for abuse] are … It’s important to be concrete, giving scenarios and talking out what an effective response looks like.” 4. “How to deal with accused priests … including the risk of recidivism, as well as how to show charity without enabling abusive behavior.” 5. Abuse prevention resources: “We don’t have to start from scratch. There are effective programs available right now.” Judging by the published papers, only the second point figured prominently in the “baby bishops” program last year. The omissions raise an obvious question: Why is the Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, the body led by O’Malley, not entrusted with making such a presentation to new bishops? That commission took a hit on Saturday when one of two members who are also abuse survivors, Peter Saunders, was given a leave of absence amid his bitter complaints about the pope’s response to several recent controversies. Yet its raison d’être remains identifying best practices in prevention, detection, and response; its officials have made presentations to bishops’ conferences around the world to share that experience. The next course for new bishops will be held in early September. In parallel fashion, the Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples, responsible for bishops in mission territories, holds its own program. It’s hard to see why the commission wouldn’t be invited to both. If the Church is to recover from the abuse scandals, bishops need every tool available, and these courses provide a chance to equip them. It would be a shame, to say the very least, not to take full advantage. ||||| ROME, Feb. 11 (UPI) -- A newly released Catholic church document tells bishops they don't have to report clerical child abuse accusations to the police. In laying out how newly appointed senior members of the clergy should deal with abuse allegations, the Vatican said bishops must be aware of local laws but their only duty was to deal with cases internally. \\"According to the state of civil laws of each country where reporting is obligatory, it is not necessarily the duty of the bishop to report suspects to authorities, the police or state prosecutors in the moment when they are made aware of crimes or sinful deeds,\\" the training guide states. The Church's policy was first reported Feb. 7 by Vatican journalist John Allen, associate editor of the Cruxnow.com Catholic news site. The Vatican released the bishop training guidelines at an early February press conference, asking for feedback. Victims groups reacted angrily to the edict, written by a French monsignor, despite Pope Francis declaring \\"everything possible must be done to rid the church of the scourge of the sexual abuse.\\" The Pontifical Commission for the Protection of Minors, the special commission created by the Pope, apparently wasn't involved in putting together the guidelines, despite its designed role to develop protocols for dealing with and preventing the clerical abuse of children. Wayne Chamley of the victims advocate group Broken Rites said the document was \\"unfathomable and yet it does not surprise me.\\" Nicky Davis, of Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, or SNAP, said clergy should be legally obliged to report suspected abuse. \\"Their systems function to protect the interests of the institution,\\" she said. \\"They don't put the protection of children first.\\" The guidelines were written by French monsignor and psychotherapist Tony Anatrella, who has run into controversy previously for promoting the belief that children are being harmed by the growing acceptance of homosexuality in Western society. ||||| What is a shorter version of the above article?","completion":"The Vatican recently updated its guidelines for newly appointed bishops on dealing with sexual abuse allegations, stating that bishops should be aware of local laws but their only duty was to deal with cases internally, rather than report the accusations to police.

As they speed across a bridge, the women's car plunges over the side into the river. The police spend three hours dragging the murky, fast-running water without success. Mary miraculously surfaces, but she cannot remember how she survived. Mary then drives to Utah, where she has been hired as a church organist. At one point, she can get nothing on her car radio but strange organ music. She passes a large, abandoned pavilion sitting all by itself on the shores of the Great Salt Lake; it seems to beckon to her in the twilight. Shortly thereafter, while she is speeding along a deserted stretch of road, a ghoulish, pasty-faced figure (never identified, but called \\"The Man\\" in dialogue and played by director Herk Harvey, uncredited) replaces her reflection in the passenger window and stares at her. When The Man suddenly appears in front of her, she swerves off the road. At a gas station, the attendant tells her the pavilion was first a bathhouse, then a dance hall, and finally a carnival before shutting down. In town, Mary rents a room from Mrs. Thomas; John Linden, the only other lodger, wants to become better acquainted with the blonde newcomer, but she is not interested. That night, she becomes upset when she sees The Man downstairs in the large house and retreats to her room. Mrs. Thomas, who brings her some food, says she did not pass anyone. Soon, Mary begins experiencing terrifying interludes when she becomes invisible and inaudible to the rest of the world, as if she simply is not there. When The Man appears briefly in front of her in a park, she flees, right into the arms of a Dr. Samuels. He tries to help her, even as he acknowledges he is not a psychiatrist.

Forward march!\\" Captain Jack Rover, assisted by Lieutenant Fred Rover and his other officers, was drilling Company C in a corner of the gymnasium of Colby Hall. It was two days after the adventure on the Rick Rack River, and it was still raining, so that drilling in the open was almost out of the question. The four cadets who had taken part in the rescue of John Franklin and his son Phil had explained the situation to Captain Dale on their return to the school and had been warmly praised by that old West Point military man for their bravery. It may be mentioned here that Captain Dale had been in charge of the school since Colonel Colby had volunteered for the war and gone to France to fight. Many of the cadets hated the rain and hoped it would soon clear. They loved drilling in the open far more than when held indoors, and they also wished to get at baseball and other Spring sports. \\"It's a shame it doesn't let up,\\" remarked Gif Garrison, after the drilling had come to an end and the rifles had been put away in their cases along the wall. Gif was a big youth, and the recognized head of many of the athletic sports. \\"Well, we have to take such matters as they come,\\" returned Spouter Powell, running his hand through his heavy brush of hair. \\"Were it not for the gentle rains, and the dews later on, the fields and slopes of the hills would not be clothed in the verdant green which all true lovers of nature so much admire.

We feel we are right there with them as they cross the big sky country and then into Mexico and back to America again. Near the end of the movie, the reflection of the rain on Robert Blake looks like small rivers of sweat and tears rolling down his face. In the end, we follow them up the stairway to their final moment. The two criminals, performed by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson, as Perry Smith and Dick Hickock could be seen on any street in any town. Hickock is a smiling boy next door and Smith, the guy with stars in his eyes from the wrong side of town. This point is made in the movie and it always surprises us that criminals are no different in appearance than anyone else. Evil, even the most vile, is part of the human condition. These two delusional men kill an entire family, looking for a safe that isn't there. Once on the run, they start writing bad cheques, carving out a trail for the authorities. There are many fine supporting actors. I like John Forsyth as the detective on the case, Alvin Dewey. Also, Will Geer shines in a brief but excellent scene as the prosecuting attorney.

(CNN)America's immigration debate has become red hot because President Obama's critics not only believe that he lacks the authority to act without the consent of Congress, but also that he must not change internal enforcement priorities before first \\"securing the border.\\" The truth is, the single most important thing Congress can do to meaningfully improve our border security is pass comprehensive immigration reform. Too often, border security is viewed as preventing the illegal entry of people and goods across state lines. However, border security also is about ensuring the safe, efficient flow of commerce and increasing international trade. Comprehensive reform will do both, while our current approach serves neither objective. I say this as someone who has made countless trips to the U.S.-Mexico border. I've seen firsthand how our current approach to policing the border is based on muddled objectives and unmeasurable benchmarks that mask failure. Our failure to secure the border is not for a lack of trying. Congress has passed at least four laws since 1986 authorizing increases in Border Patrol personnel. In 1980, there were 2,268 Border Patrol agents at the southwest border; under President Obama, that number grew to an all-time high of 21,730. There was 14 miles of fencing on the border in 1990; under this administration, we've erected nearly 651 miles of new fencing and dramatically increased our mobile surveillance capabilities. Yet there is scant evidence that we can spend our way out of this problem. Recent studies by Princeton University and the University of California at San Diego reach desultory conclusions about our ability to stop illegal border crossings. We have been able to stop only about 30% of those attempting to cross our border between 1996 and 2009, according to the studies. Simply spending more money and adding more agents will not secure the border, but it will complicate trade. Nations cannot seek maximum security without shuttering trade, but nations cannot have fully open borders if they want real security. We can build more fences, identify more tracks, and inspect more vehicles, but only if we are prepared to greatly diminish the free flow of commerce. Our nation has wisely opted for a balanced approach. The central reason we will not be more effective at achieving our national security border goals is because U.S. policy, since the 1980s, effectively treats all border incursions as equal threats to the homeland. This diminishes our ability to prevent true threats -- such as drug cartels, human traffickers and potential terrorists -- from \\"flooding the zone\\" and gaining passage into the homeland. These criminals know that a small percentage of their goods and vehicles will be inspected and seized. For them, this is the cost of doing business. Unless we begin to prioritize threats and facilitate the legitimate entry of validated economic migrants, the cost-benefit analysis will remain in their favor. Border security professionals tell me the vast majority of illegal entrants are Mexicans seeking temporary work in the United States. All illegal crossings undermine border integrity, but temporary, work-seeking migrants do not pose a significant national security threat to the homeland. The best way to strengthen border security without stifling trade is for Congress to establish a system whereby migrant workers can apply for validated, biometric entry keys to cross our border safely and legally. This will free up our border security cadre to focus on preventing cartels, traffickers and terrorists from exploiting holes in our current system. Furthermore, channeling economic migrants to efficient legal crossings will reduce threats to their own safety, improve human dignity, and give interdiction operators the bandwidth to respond to a higher percentage of tripwire incursions across our nearly 2,000-mile border with Mexico. We need a new risk-based approach, informed by intelligence and emphasizing information sharing and international cooperation. Fortunately, there is a precedent that offers great hope. The Transportation Security Administration's Trusted Traveler/PreCheck Program is a model of risk-based screening that is increasing our security and facilitating commerce. The TSA approach allows approved, prescreened travelers to establish they are not security threats and move more nimbly to transact international business. This allows TSA officers to focus their attention on more consequential threats to aviation security. This risk-based approach is better for the traveling public and provides more security at less cost. We can adopt a similar approach to our land border with Mexico, if the Congress acts. As a nation, we do not accept a system where more than half of terror plots will be successful; we prioritize threats and go after terror cells with zeal. We need to embrace the same strategic approach to border security and abandon a system that does not adequately distinguish between worker crossings and true dangers to U.S. security. By normalizing the process for work-seeking migrants to legally enter the country, we will legalize a critical segment of our labor force and empower security professionals to focus on the true risks to our homeland. This will be good for our economy and our security. Now is the time for Congress to act. Summarize the highlights of this article.","completion":"The article argues that the most effective way to improve border security between the U.S. and Mexico is to pass comprehensive immigration reform.

Le Nouveau partenariat pour le développement de l'Afrique (NEPAD) a proposé des mécanismes d'examen par les pairs dans le but de favoriser la gouvernance et le développement sur le continent africain. Ces mécanismes représentent une avancée importante, car ils sont conçus pour encourager l'échange d'expériences, de compétences et de meilleures pratiques entre les pays africains. L'examen par les pairs est un processus dans lequel les pays évaluent et partagent les succès et les défis de leurs politiques, programmes et projets de développement. Cela permet d'identifier les domaines dans lesquels des améliorations sont nécessaires et de mettre en œuvre des réformes qui contribuent à la croissance économique, à la réduction de la pauvreté et au développement durable. Les mécanismes d'examen par les pairs proposés par le NEPAD s'appuient sur des principes clés tels que la responsabilité, la transparence et l'égalité. Les pays participants s'engagent à examiner régulièrement leurs politiques de développement et à partager les résultats de ces évaluations avec les autres membres. Ceci permet non seulement de renforcer la collaboration et le partage des connaissances entre les pays africains, mais aussi de renforcer la capacité des gouvernements à mettre en œuvre des réformes significatives. En mettant en place des mécanismes d'examen par les pairs, le NEPAD espère également renforcer la confiance des partenaires internationaux et des investisseurs dans la capacité des pays africains à gérer efficacement leurs ressources et à améliorer leurs conditions de vie. Cela pourrait à son tour augmenter les investissements étrangers et les partenariats de développement, qui sont essentiels pour catalyser la croissance économique et la création d'emplois sur le continent. En outre, ces mécanismes d'examen par les pairs permettent également de promouvoir la démocratie et les droits de l'homme, qui sont des éléments clés de la bonne gouvernance et du développement durable. En encourageant davantage de pays africains à adopter des principes démocratiques et à respecter les droits de l'homme, le NEPAD contribue à créer un environnement propice à la paix, à la stabilité et au développement économique. En somme, les mécanismes d'examen par les pairs proposés par le NEPAD constituent une étape importante vers la réalisation des objectifs de développement du continent africain.

Please briefly summarize this news article: Clinton Gets an Instant Chance to Wield a New Weapon But by then the story had been picked up and expanded upon on by, among others, the Drudge Report, which included a link to a report about a tip that Mrs. Clinton neglected to give in 2000. The Web sites of NBC News and ABC News also carried the story. Mrs. Clinton’s rebuttal site, The Fact Hub, posted an item with the headline “Fact Check: Bill Paid, Tip Left At Iowa Maid-Rite.” It included details of the NPR editor’s note and Mr. Crawford’s statement. Steve Schmidt, a former political strategist for President Bush who helped oversee his 2004 campaign war room, said the new Clinton site was “the next evolution in rapid response.” The campaign of Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor running for the Republican presidential nomination, ventured into similar territory this year with a Web site that was started to affirm statements by Mr. Romney and rebut those of his rivals. Phil Singer, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton, said her campaign felt the need to have such a Web site because much of the news about her tends to “spread like wildfire” online. “There’s just been a proliferation of news reporting on the Internet,” Mr. Singer said. “As such, you’ve got a much faster echo effect when something hits the political zeitgeist, and it’s becoming increasingly urgent to have a mechanism in place that allows you to respond.” Reached at her home in Iowa, the waitress, Anita Esterday, said that neither she nor a colleague who helped serve Mrs. Clinton recalled seeing any tip. She said a local staff member of Mrs. Clinton’s campaign was in the restaurant on Thursday to tell them that the campaign had left a tip. She said that when she and her colleague said they had not seen a tip, the staff member gave each of them 20. Ms. Esterday said she did not understand what all the commotion was about. “You people are really nuts,” she told a reporter during a phone interview. “There’s kids dying in the war, the price of oil right now — there’s better things in this world to be thinking about than who served Hillary Clinton at Maid-Rite and who got a tip and who didn’t get a tip.” A version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline: Clinton Gets an Instant Chance to Wield a New Weapon.

Looks just like any other traveling carnival except this is one of those that charges you a 10 dollar admission just so you can walk around just to decide how much more money to spend on food and/or rides. The concept is basically like Disneyland except on a much more smaller, more ghettoish type of scale. I know, ghettoish really isn't a word but you catch my drift. Yes, I know there is a Groupon and Living Social deal for 5 bucks but that's besides the point. The fact that you have to pay just to get in only to be disappointed is what I consider time lost which equals money lost. The rides they have are basic, nothing really stands out. Each ride takes a certain amount of tickets and of course you have to get just enough tickets just to ride 2 or 3. Really not worth it. Even with the all day ride pass. As for the number 1 reason why most people go here is the food. First stop was the Dole Pineapple Whip booth. I got kind of excited because the only place that I knew had this was Disneyland where the Enchanted Tiki Room was. This place even had the words Tiki Treats in the upper left hand corner of their stand. What I found out was that it was a definite knockoff. Their largest size Float Whip was 5 bucks and my two kids easily devoured it in under 30 seconds meaning it wast that large at all. I tasted it and it was no where near what Disneyland serves. Next stop. Soul Food Cafu00e9 Express. My boys were feenin for Deep Fried Catfish with Fries and Dirty Rice as the sides. I ordered just one combo so they can share since we were gonna be eating other things. Cost 8 bucks. When we got our food, the two breaded filets were really good. As for the fries, they were soggy and was still dripping in grease. It seemed to only have been cooked halfway like they forgot about it after the fish was done so they through it in the fryer real quick only to pull it out prematurely. The Dirty Rice could have literally been dirty like it was dropped several times on the floor making its way to the skinny cardboard food holders they give you. It looked more like oatmeal sprinkled with seasonings. So basically we paid 8 bucks for two filets of breaded catfish. Next stop. Wing King. Now these guys I am definitely familiar with. I got a Review Of The Day (ROTD) for their 6475 W Charleston location. I got Fried Pickle Chips for 5 bucks and 10 Honey Barbeque Wings for 12 bucks. Both items I got my money's worth and just like their home location, it was very good. Last Stop. Mama Ita's Roasted Corn. We came here to get Funnel Cakes. Damn, 7 bucks. At least you get strawberries, powdered sugar, and whipped cream on it. Probably the most expensive Funnel Cake I ever ate. The worst thing I have to mention are the Port O Potties. Not only are they nasty, but according to my wife, none of them even had any toilet paper. Good luck if there is any soap or water left.

In Spanish, we can respect this structure since it's a common way to instruct users in manual instructions. Thus, the verb \\"Conecta\\" (Connect) is an informal you-command. The use of the preposition \\"a\\" before the \\"soporte de escritorio\\" is because it is a movement action to a place and \\"para\\" before \\"una configuración básica de estación base\\" is expressing the reason or the end of our previous action.

Tho towns located on opposite banks of a river, had a humid season, but Bend town had a cooler air at night. Bank town on the other hand, had warmer nights because it was situated on a south facing hill. Which town experienced a higher air temperature? Hint: Specific humidity (or moisture content) is the ratio of the mass of water vapor to the total mass of the moist air parcel.[13] Specific humidity is approximately equal to the mixing ratio, which is defined as the ratio of the mass of water vapor in an air parcel to the mass of dry air for the same parcel. As temperature decreases, the amount of water vapor needed to reach saturation also decreases. As the temperature of a parcel of air becomes lower it will eventually reach the point of saturation without adding or losing water mass.","completion":"Bank town experienced a higher air temperature during the night. Here's why: 1. Bank town is situated on a south-facing hill, meaning it is exposed to more direct sunlight throughout the day. This causes the ground and air to absorb more heat during the daylight hours, resulting in warmer temperatures at night as the heat is released back into the atmosphere. 2. Bend town, while also in a humid climate, experiences cooler air at night, likely due to its location on the opposite bank where the river may contribute to a cooling effect (other factors, such as elevation, vegetation, etc., could also be contributing to the cooler air). 3. As the temperature decreases, the ability of air to hold water vapor (i.e., moisture content) also decreases, effectively causing condensation (leading to dew or fog). This process releases latent heat into the surrounding air, slightly increasing the temperature. Since Bend town has cooler air at night, it would more likely reach the point of saturation, causing this condensation effect to occur more prominently compared to Bank town, which has warmer nights. So, considering the factors mentioned above, Bank town experiences higher air temperature during the night compared to Bend town."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

I have a test where I am given the following article, what is an answer for the question: What is the name of the piece that calls for an intermission after the fourth movement? ? A composer may also respond to a text by expanding a choral symphony beyond the normal bounds of the symphonic genre. This is evident in the unusual orchestration and stage directions Berlioz prepared for his Roméo et Juliette. This piece is actually in seven movements, and calls for an intermission after the fourth movement – the \\"Queen Mab Scherzo\\" – to remove the harps from the stage and bring on the chorus of Capulets for the funeral march that follows. Berlioz biographer D. Kern Holoman observed that, \\"as Berlioz saw it, the work is simply Beethovenian in design, with the narrative elements overlain. Its core approaches a five-movement symphony with the choral finale and, as in the [Symphonie] Fantastique, both a scherzo and a march.... The 'extra' movements are thus the introduction with its potpourri of subsections and the descriptive tomb scene [at the end of the work].\\"Mahler expanded the Beethovenian model for programmatic as well as symphonic reasons in his Second Symphony, the \\"Resurrection\\", the vocal fourth movement, \\"Urlicht\\", bridging the childlike faith of the third movement with the ideological tension Mahler seeks to resolve in the finale. He then abandoned this pattern for his Third Symphony, as two movements for voices and orchestra follow three purely instrumental ones before the finale returns to instruments alone. Like Mahler, Havergal Brian expanded the Beethovenian model, but on a much larger scale and with far larger orchestral and choral forces, in his Symphony No. 1 \\"The Gothic\\". Written between 1919 and 1927, the symphony was inspired by Goethe's Faust and Gothic cathedral architecture. The Brian First is in two parts. The first consists of three instrumental movements; the second, also in three movements and over an hour in length, is a Latin setting of the Te Deum. The answer to this question is:","completion":"The name of the piece that calls for an intermission after the fourth movement is \\"Roméo et Juliette\\" by Berlioz.

News article: You can tell the Supreme Court is getting closer to its historic ObamaCare ruling because the left is making one last attempt to intimidate the Justices. The latest effort includes taunting Chief Justice John Roberts that if the Court overturns any of the law, he'll forever be defined as a partisan \\"activist.\\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy recently took the extraordinary step of publicly lobbying the Chief Justice after oral argument but before its ruling. \\"I trust that he will be a Chief Justice for all of us and that he has a strong institutional sense of the proper role of the judicial branch,\\" the Democrat declared on the Senate floor. \\"The conservative activism of recent years has not been good for the Court.\\" Related Video Editorial page editor Paul Gigot on why the left is trying to intimidate the Supreme Court on ObamaCare. Photo: Associated Press He added that, \\"Given the ideological challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the extensive, supportive precedent, it would be extraordinary for the Supreme Court not to defer to Congress in this matter that so clearly affects interstate commerce.\\" The elite liberal press has followed with pointed warnings that Mr. Roberts has a choice—either uphold ObamaCare, or be portrayed a radical who wants to repeal the New Deal and a century of precedent. This attack is itself clearly partisan, but it's worth rehearsing the arguments to show how truly flawed they are. The first fallacy is defining judicial activism as overturning a Congressional law. Since Marbury v. Madison established judicial review in 1803, the High Court has overturned hundreds of laws in part or whole. The real measure of activism is whether the Court's reasoning is rooted in Constitutional principle. If it is, the Court is not activist but is adhering to the highest legal principles. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, we'd argue that upholding the individual mandate to buy health insurance requires far more judicial activism.

Once health insurance can be mandated, Congress will inevitably find that other products or services are equally essential to national well-being.

Printed in The Wall Street Journal, page 11 ||||| You can tell the Supreme Court is getting closer to its historic ObamaCare ruling because the left is making one last attempt to intimidate the Justices. The latest effort includes taunting Chief Justice John Roberts that if the Court overturns any of the law, he'll forever be defined as a partisan \\"activist.\\" Senate Judiciary Chairman Pat Leahy recently took the extraordinary step of publicly lobbying the Chief Justice after oral argument but before its ruling. \\"I trust that he will be a Chief Justice for all of us and that he has a strong institutional sense of the proper role of the judicial branch,\\" the Democrat declared on the Senate floor. \\"The conservative activism of recent years has not been good for the Court.\\" Related Video Editorial page editor Paul Gigot on why the left is trying to intimidate the Supreme Court on ObamaCare. Photo: Associated Press He added that, \\"Given the ideological challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the extensive, supportive precedent, it would be extraordinary for the Supreme Court not to defer to Congress in this matter that so clearly affects interstate commerce.\\" The elite liberal press has followed with pointed warnings that Mr. Roberts has a choice—either uphold ObamaCare, or be portrayed a radical who wants to repeal the New Deal and a century of precedent. This attack is itself clearly partisan, but it's worth rehearsing the arguments to show how truly flawed they are. The first fallacy is defining judicial activism as overturning a Congressional law. Since Marbury v. Madison established judicial review in 1803, the High Court has overturned hundreds of laws in part or whole. The real measure of activism is whether the Court's reasoning is rooted in Constitutional principle. If it is, the Court is not activist but is adhering to the highest legal principles. Regarding the Affordable Care Act, we'd argue that upholding the individual mandate to buy health insurance requires far more judicial activism. That's because if the Court finds this federal mandate to be Constitutional, it will have no principle on which to limit future purchase mandates. Once health insurance can be mandated, Congress will inevitably find that other products or services are equally essential to national well-being. Future Courts will either have to find all such purchase mandates to be legal, in which case there is no limiting principle, or they will have to pick and choose, which means an endless exercise in policy-making.

While \\"Subject Two\\" as he is initially successful, he begins to experience violent seizures and excruciating pain, begging Vick to kill him or committing suicide several times. Adam eventually gains complete immortality and near instantaneous regeneration, but as a consequence he loses the very sense of being alive; he can no longer feel things (including pain) and no longer can have emotions. His eyes turn snow white, and, to compensate for the gradual loss of his sense of self, he becomes violent and depressed, going so far as to kill a hunter that accidentally shoots him rather than risk him exposing the project. Eventually the student leaves Vick, only to become a walking ghost doomed to walk the earth for eternity. After returning home, \\"Vick\\" finds the real Dr. Franklin Vick, and it is revealed that the doctor for the course of the entire movie was his assistant, Subject One. Thinking that he had accidentally killed Dr. Vick, Subject One assumed his identity to continue the work, but finds that the serum was initially perfect, and it was only his tampering that gradually changed Adam.

What will happen to the city's level of water scarcity decrease or increase? A:","completion":"The population in Milo's city has been increasing recently. Given the information presented in the passage, it is reasonable to conclude that the level of water scarcity in Milo's city will increase as a result of the growing population. This is because water scarcity is often exacerbated by rising population levels and changing climatic conditions. As more people move to Milo's city, the demand for water resources will also increase. This will put additional pressure on the city's water infrastructure and supplies. The local wells, reservoirs, and rivers may not be able to keep up with the growing demand for water, leading to an increase in water scarcity. Moreover, as the city expands, additional infrastructure development and urbanization may lead to the loss of natural water sources and the degradation of watersheds. This could also contribute to the increased water scarcity in the region. Climate change adds another layer of complexity to the issue of water scarcity. In many parts of the world, climate change has already resulted in reduced precipitation, more frequent and prolonged droughts, and changes in the patterns of snowmelt and runoff. These developments can significantly impact the availability of water resources in affected regions and may lead to even greater water scarcity as populations continue to rise. In conclusion, given that the population in Milo's city is on the rise, it is likely that the level of water scarcity will also increase. The combined effects of population growth and climate change may place greater pressure on the city's water resources and lead to an increasingly urgent need for water conservation and management strategies."},{"prompt":"Please answer the following question: Build a movie plot around this: WHAT DO WILL SMITH AND OLLIE TALK ABOUT ? about work and children Answer:","completion":"Title: \\"From Hollywood to Humble: Chronicles of Will & Ollie\\" Plot: Will Smith, a world-famous movie star and Ollie Thorne, an average suburban father of two, find themselves unexpectedly thrown together as co-stars on the set of an upcoming blockbuster film.

Speaking to Rolling Stone last year, Haim said many of their new songs were about \\"trying to go back to your normal life, but realising there is a difference\\". After a few false starts, and several Jurassic Park rip-offs, the band were given a \\"homework assignment\\" - writing a song for a feature film. That allowed them to escape the pressure of following up their debut, and the band set about making a giddy pastiche of 1950s burger joint pop, called Little Bit Of Your Love. \\"We wanted to write a simple song with a I-IV-V chord progression,\\" says Danielle, the middle Haim sister and main singer. \\"I remember hearing these songs that came out in the early '80s that kind of had a Motown vibe but with '80s production. And I thought, 'Oh, I wonder what these songs would sound like now?'\\" \\"It was an experiment,\\" adds Alana. \\"An experiment... that I love.\\" They loved it so much, in fact, that they decided to keep it for themselves. Eleven more songs swiftly followed, each marrying Haim's melodic West Coast rock to the choppy textures of R&B. \\"We're very much inspired by drums,\\" says Alana. \\"Drums are the first instrument we all learned how to play. So that's how every song on this record was born.\\" Most of the songs were recorded live, the band facing each other as they played in a dusty old recording studio called Valentine. \\"It had been shut down since the '60s and it was literally like a time capsule,\\" right down to the vintage porn magazines on the floor, recalls Danielle. \\"It just reopened last year and it turns out it was right down the street from the house we grew up in. We had no idea it existed [but] we went in and were like, 'Oh my gosh, it sounds amazing, let's record here.'\\" It was a return to the band's beginnings, albeit on a more professional level. \\"We spent the first five years of our band playing every single venue in LA, trying to get people to listen,\\" says Danielle. \\"But we had, like, zero dollars so every year we would go into a recording studio for one day and try to bang out five songs. \\"We'd watched documentaries about Tom Petty and Fleetwood Mac and they would all be in a room together, jamming. We didn't understand they'd spent so much time doing it over and over again, making sure it sounded right. So our recordings always sounded bad. \\"But after being on the road for four years, we were like, 'You know what? We've played together for four years. We're a proper band. Let's get back to the three of us, in a room, playing together, getting that take, and just really working hard to get the right sound.'\\" You can see the band at work in the video for Right Now - the camera weaving around the sisters as they record one of the album's most sparse, atmospheric tracks. Filmed in one continuous shot, without overdubs, it allows you to hear the click as Alana steps on her guitar's distortion pedal and Este's footsteps as she crosses the floor to the drum kit for the song's climax. It was shot by Oscar nominee Paul Thomas Anderson (There Will Be Blood, Magnolia, The Master), who asked to meet the band through a mutual friend a couple of years ago. Having been passed his email address, Haim spent the best part of a day composing a message to the director. \\"There was a lot of reading it back,\\" says Danielle. \\"Take a nap, have a cup of coffee, read it again,\\" adds Alana. \\"Should I tell him where I live? Maybe not, I don't know. \\"It was a process that took 17 hours.\\" It was Anderson's idea to film the band \\"in situ\\", having noted a difference between their records and their raucous live shows. \\"He said that he would see our little videos online, where we would be banging on a table and singing and snapping our fingers,\\" says Danielle. \\"He was like, 'I love that you guys do that. I want to film you doing that in the studio and really get a sense of who you are.'\\" By a stroke of luck, the film-maker turned up on the day Haim recorded the \\"perfect take\\" of Right Now. The version in the video forms the basis of the album track, with overdubs and harmonies added later. But that was in November. Something To Tell You isn't coming out until July, and work continued right up to the wire. Haim speak to the BBC on 24 May, the same day the album is mastered (the final stage of recording, where the sound balance is tweaked for consistency and clarity across the record as a whole). Prior to that, they send over rough mixes, with file names marked \\"vocals up\\" or \\"board mix\\". The final version of Right Now is dated 5 May, two weeks after the video premiered on YouTube. \\"When you write a song, you know in your mind what it should sound like - but getting there is trial and error,\\" explains Danielle. \\"We spent a lot of time getting the right sounds. We recorded drums in a lot of different rooms to get the right sounds. \\"I wouldn't say it's obsessive. I think we just really care\\" But Alana admits that the band's... erm, \\"attention to detail\\" drove producer Ariel Rechtshaid to distraction. \\"Once we turned in the record there was just a sigh of relief because he didn't have to deal with us being 'change this, change that' every five minutes. \\"Ariel is now on his way to the Bahamas,\\" says Este. \\"He needs so many vacations after this.\\" \\"I need 14 years of vacation!\\" jokes Alana, adopting the voice of her patience-worn producer. \\"I'm going to die 10 years early because of you guys!\\" Haim's new album, Something To Tell You, is released on 7 July by Polydor Records.

(1). no; (2). yes; The answer is:","completion":"1. No; The two questions given are not the same. They are distinct in their content and purpose. Let's analyze both questions individually to understand the differences between them. The first question asks, \\"What are the best 'thank you for accepting my friend request' messages?\\" This question is seeking recommendations for expressing gratitude to someone who has accepted a friend request (most likely on social media). It aims to elicit suggestions for crafting an appropriate and kind message of thanks. The focus of this inquiry is on selecting the right words or phrases to convey one's appreciation. On the other hand, the second question asks, \\"Is it socially acceptable to ask a guy friend this?\\" This question is inquiring about the societal norms and expectations when speaking to a male friend. Rather than seeking specific suggestions for wording, as with the first question, this question is concerned with determining whether it is appropriate to ask a male friend a particular question (presumably about friendship or social interactions). The main point of consideration here is whether asking a specific question might undermine the friendship or breach social boundaries. In summary, the two questions differ in their intent and objectives: the first aims to gather ideas for well-crafted 'thank you' messages, while the second explores social acceptability in the context of asking questions within a friendship. These differences make the two questions distinct from each other, leading to the conclusion that the answer is (1) no, they are not the same."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Press question mark to learn the rest of the keyboard shortcuts r/CucumbersScaringCats ||||| So, this is a thing. Some time around July, this cat video went viral. The video features an unsuspecting cat happily eating a meal. The cat looks towards the camera then— bam—jumps in fright after it realizes that a monstrous object was behind it all along. What object could possibly be more horrifying than the vacuum cleaner? A cucumber. An innocent, inanimate cucumber. This video may have sparked a movement. For whatever reason, the Internet thought it was a good idea to test out on their own cats and share videos of the “experiments” to YouTube. (I guess on one hand, citizen science is a good thing? But on the other hand, stressing your cat out for Internet fame also makes you an asshole.). And guess what? They discovered that this wasn’t an isolated incident—tons of cats reacted in a similar manner. That same month, a community was created on Reddit called Cucumbers Scaring Cats. It’s full of what you’d expect—people sharing videos and gifs of cucumbers scaring cats. And this community takes cucumbers very, very seriously. Videos of cats being scared by similarly phallic objects—like bananas and dildos—are not allowed. (We’re not sure if pickles count). Of course, various media outlets soon picked up on this community, bringing in cat whisperers and other “experts” to give their opinion on the cat cucumber crisis. Suddenly, this question was on everyone’s mind: Of course, we like to answer the tough questions here on Upvoted so we had to investigate. The truth is, since there hasn’t been any scientific studies on cucumbers and cats, nobody really knows the answer, placing this investigation in a real pickle. That doesn’t mean we can’t speculate, however. One user had an educated guess: The question even stumped the director of the Feline Health Center at Cornell University, Dr. Colin Parrish, when we asked him—though he actually didn’t think the snake theory was too far off. Cats are not scared of the color green, but the shape of a cucumber could remind cats—big or small—of a snake. Evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne agreed with the snake theory. He wrote on his blog: “Here’s my hypothesis, which is mine: the cats have genetic predisposition to be scared of snakes—a disposition instilled in their distant ancestors by natural selection. Clearly, those wild cats lacking a tendency to avoid long, thin, and unrecognized objects wouldn’t leave as many genes behind as cats having genes for a startle reflex.” This theory most likely stems from a 2001 study on primates that suggests the mammalian brain is prewired to be fearful of snakes, originating from a time when our early mammal ancestors had to survive in a reptilian world. Former Cornell University professor and veterinary behaviorist Dr. Katherine Houpt, disagrees. Houpt researched cat behavior and now heads the Animal Behavior Consultants of North Michigan. “Cats are not naturally afraid of snakes,” she shares. “Unless the snake is very big, but it would have to be much longer than a cucumber. In fact, felines hunt snakes. And since their main enemies are dogs and coyotes, there hasn’t been much evolutionary pressure to be fearful of reptiles.” While cats are not known to be afraid of small snakes, cats are fearful of dogs, loud noises, and strange places. And they also become easily upset when you change anything about their routines (e.g. a surprise cucumber placed right behind them while eating). But Houpt wasn’t sure of the exact reason why cats were frightened by cucumbers in the videos: “Nobody has done a scientific experiment on that. I’ll go put a cucumber behind my cat and see what she does,” she says. “That’s right, cat. You are going to have to perform!” Houpt continued to narrate the experiment, live, while she was on the phone with us: “The cat is very happy she is being fed earlier.” “Now she is turning around [to face the cucumber]. She is VERY suspicious. This is a cat who never turns down a meal.” “Now she is eating.” “She turned around [again] and paid absolutely no attention to it. I’m not sure she even saw it.” “Okay, now she is sniffing it. What do you think, is that a scary object? Of course, this is a 15 lb. cat. She may be less afraid of anything.” “Now she is lying on top of it [laughs].” In conclusion?: “My cat had absolutely no reaction, except to sniff it. I don’t think it is very strong cat behavior. Cats, like people, have different personalities.” Houpt adds that some cats are genetically predisposed to be fearful, while others are bold and curious (like her cat). And it’s a behavior that is apparently not learned (but can be modified) She goes onto explain that cats have been known to exhibit a similar reaction to plastic bags placed on the floor—some are afraid, some cats urinate on it, and others simply don’t care. “I think if you take a nervous cat and put something strange in front of it, then it reacts as if it were frightened,” Houpt says. “Don’t stress the cat out! What is the point!?” ||||| What happens when you put a cucumber behind a cat? Some felines couldn't care less about the vegetable intrusion, but others leap high into the air when they see it. Videos of such encounters are going viral this week, as people try to see how their own pets respond. But that’s not good for the animals, experts warn. “If you cause stress to an animal that's probably not a good thing,” says Jill Goldman, a certified animal behaviorist in southern California. “If you do it for laughs it makes me question your humanity.” (Learn more about cat behaviors.) Note: The previous video we had posted here, showing several cats reacting to cucumbers, was removed from YouTube Friday. We have replaced it with a video showing the response of one cat. Experts say teasing cats in this way may cause stress to the animals. John Bradshaw, a cat-behavior expert at the University of Bristol and the author of the book Cat Sense, agrees, saying the “despicable” videos are “an incitement for people to scare their cats and then invite people to laugh at them.” Goldman explains that the cucumbers are triggering the cats’ natural startle responses, since they “would not normally see cucumbers on the floor.” It’s also possible they may associate the green invader with snakes, which can be deadly predators, Goldman adds. “With a startle response, a cat will often try to get out of there as quickly as possible and then reassess from a distance,” says Goldman. Hence the leaping cats in the videos. Watch: Cats' hunting secrets revealed. The fact that the cucumbers are often placed near feeding stations in the videos confuses the cats because they often associate those areas with safety and security, adds Pam Johnson-Bennett, author of Think Like a Cat. \\"That's a cruel thing to do,\\" she says. Safe Play Time Bringing new objects into the home can be a good source of mental stimulation for pets, but it shouldn’t be done with the goal of freaking them out, says Goldman. Trying to startle your cat on purpose could cause them to injure themselves. break something, or lead to prolonged stress. Instead, it’s best to introduce any novel items gradually. “You wouldn’t want to meet someone new by having them shoved right in your face,” she says. “You’d want to meet them from a safe distance, such as a few arm lengths.” (Watch a video of cat hunting.) The same is true with cats. It’s also true that each animal will respond to situations uniquely, as do human beings. Some cats, like some people, are more easily startled than others. ||||| Rating is available when the video has been rented. This feature is not available right now.

A family's tears flowed at an emotional reunion with a mother who had disappeared more than three decades ago and who they believed was long dead. Betty Lukich, 69, left Bangor, Maine, in 1981 after an acrimonious divorce, leaving her four children and four of her sisters with no idea where she'd gone. They falsely believed she was dead after a brother rang them up drunk one day and told them he had buried her in a marijuana field behind his home in Indiana. 'We thought she was dead': Betty Lukich, 69, far right, with her sisters, from left, Virginia Allen, 72, Mary Inman, 75, and Laura Riegelmen, 78, for their first reunion after she left town more than three decades ago. Long-lost mother: Debra Carmona says of these pictures of Betty Lukich (left): 'My mom, as we knew her... This was the last photo we had of her before we lost touch' and (right) 'This is how I remember my Mom' Instead Ms Lukich, who was in her mid-30s when she moved away, spent the next 14 years driving an articulated lorry around the U.S., visiting all the lower 48 states save North Dakota. Another life: Betty Lukich aged 50 in 1995, when she'd been missing for 14 years.

The context specifically states that the clothing company is Danish, which means it is from Denmark. The company sells T-shirts online to support the Colombian guerrilla group FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) and the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP).

The answer is:","completion":"Yes, the statement \\"Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% Again, this is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb cited here.\\" is reasonable to describe the water content of the human body, but it does not provide a complete answer. To give a more detailed and comprehensive answer, we should consider both the extracellular and intracellular fluid compartments. The human body consists of approximately 60% water, with variations depending on factors such as age, gender, and body composition. This water is distributed between two main compartments within the body: intracellular fluid (ICF) and extracellular fluid (ECF). Intracellular fluid (ICF) is the water found inside the cells, making up about two-thirds (40 litres) of the total body water (TBW). On average, ICF accounts for roughly 25 to 30 litres of water in an adult human body. Extracellular fluid (ECF) is the water that resides outside of the cells, which consists of interstitial fluid (the fluid between cells), blood plasma, and other minor fluid compartments like cerebrospinal fluid, synovial fluid, and ocular fluid. The ECF makes up about one-third of the total body water. Per Guyton's illustration, for a 40 litre body, about 15 litres is extracellular, which amounts to 37.5% of the TBW. This is close to the 1/3 rule of thumb that is often cited in scientific literature. In summary, the human body is composed of approximately 60% water, with 40% of it being intracellular fluid and about 37.5% being extracellular fluid. The statement given earlier is reasonable in explaining the extracellular compartment; however, providing information on the intracellular compartment would give a more complete understanding of the water content within the human body."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

How do you do this: bottle","completion":"To \\"do\\" a bottle, I will assume you want to know the process of creating a bottle. Since bottles can be made from various materials like glass or plastic, I will focus on making a plastic bottle using the process of blow molding. Here are the step-by-step instructions and justifications for each step: 1. Design the bottle: Justification: Designing the bottle is the first step because it allows us to determine the shape, size, and specifications needed for manufacturing. 2. Create a mold: Justification: A mold is necessary to shape the heated plastic material into the desired bottle shape. The mold should match the design of the bottle. 3. Prepare the plastic resin: Justification: Choosing appropriate plastic material is essential for durability and functionality. For bottles, usually, polyethylene terephthalate (PET) is used due to its recyclability and transparency. 4. Heat the plastic resin: Justification: Heating the plastic is necessary to make it pliable and easier to work with during the molding process. 5. Preform formation: Justification: Preforms are small, tube-shaped pieces of PET that are formed using an injection molding machine. These will later be transformed into bottles. 6. Position the preform in the blow molding machine: Justification: The preforms need to be accurately positioned in the machine to ensure proper distribution of the material and to create high-quality bottles. 7. Heat the preform: Justification: Heating the preforms makes them pliable enough to be blown into the desired bottle shape. 8. Blow the preform into the desired shape: Justification: Applying pressurized air to the heated preform expands it into the shape of the mold, forming the final bottle shape. 9. Cool the newly formed bottle: Justification: Cooling is necessary to solidify the plastic and ensure the bottle maintains its shape after being removed from the mold. 10. Trim excess plastic and perform quality control: Justification: Trimming and performing quality control ensures that the final product is free from defects and excess material. 11. Packaging: Justification: Packaging is the final step to protect the bottles during transportation and storage until they reach the end user. By following these steps, a plastic bottle can be created through the process of blow molding."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task. You must generate a detailed and long answer. Please answer the following question: What would be the ★-rating of this review (★ being the lowest and ★★★★★ being the highest)? \\"Fair Right\\" Answer:","completion":"It is difficult to determine an accurate star rating for the review with the term \\"Fair Right\\" without any contextual information or specific details about the experience or product being reviewed. However, I can provide a possible interpretation based on the given information as well as some suggestions on how to assess star ratings more accurately. Assuming that \\"Fair Right\\" implies an average or just above the average performance, it could be interpreted as a 3-star (★★★) review. This would mean that the reviewer found the product or service satisfactory but not necessarily exceptional or outstanding. It is worth noting that the interpretation may vary depending on the context and the aspects considered while reviewing. To assess star ratings more accurately, it would be helpful to take the following factors into consideration: 1. Context: Understand the context in which the review was written, and the expectations a reviewer might have. For example, a product or service review may focus on quality, pricing, or customer service, among other factors. 2. Details: Look for specific details provided in the review that justify the reviewer's opinion. This could include comments on what they liked or disliked, their personal experience with the product or service, and any recommendations they might have. 3. Comparison: See if the reviewer compares the product or service against others, which can be useful in determining the competitive position of the item being reviewed and whether the reviewer's expectations were met. 4. Reviewer's history: Check the credibility and the previous reviews of the reviewer to understand their biases, preferences, and overall rating behavior. 5. Aggregate ratings: Consider multiple reviews on the same product or service to form a more accurate and holistic picture, as individual reviews may not always depict a fair representation. In summary, assigning a star rating to the review \\"Fair Right\\" is subjective and open to interpretation. Assuming that it implies a modest level of satisfaction, a 3-star (★★★) rating may be appropriate.

Choices: - multiplication - putting together - times - subtraction - multiply The rationale to choose \\"putting together\\" as the answer is that: A:","completion":"A: The phrase \\"Sarah didn't think that they deserved division\\" suggests that she wanted to keep the elements unified or together. Among the choices given, \\"putting together\\" is the most appropriate answer because it is the direct opposite of division and best aligns with the intent to maintain unity. Here is a rationale for each choice: - Multiplication: Although multiplication is the opposite of division in a mathematical context, it means increasing the value, quantity, or frequency, which is not directly related to bringing elements together. - Putting together: This is the best answer because it means to combine things or make them unified, which is the direct opposite of division. - Times: This term is commonly used as another way to say multiplication, which, as previously explained, doesn't directly relate to uniting elements. - Subtraction: Subtraction is a mathematical operation where a number is taken away from another. It doesn't convey the concept of keeping elements together. - Multiply: This is another term for multiplication, and as previously mentioned, it doesn't align with the intent to maintain unity. In conclusion, \\"putting together\\" best fits the context of Sarah's desire to keep the elements unified, as it's the direct opposite of division and refers to the action of combining, gathering, or uniting components."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

He is given a kiddush cup and told that he has been granted an audience with Rabbi Marshak.Danny goes into Marshak's office, and sits in front of him. Marshak speaks slowly, almost haltingly, and in a way that suggests he's a little addled. He begins to quote lines from Jefferson Airplane's 'Somebody to Love' (not quite accurately) and recites the names of the group's members (again, not quite accurately). He then gives Danny back his confiscated radio and simply says, \\"Be a good boy.\\"The scene begins to switch back and forth at this point between Larry at his office in the college, and Danny at Hebrew school. Arlen visits Larry at his office, congratulating him on Danny's bar mitzvah and speaking about the need to savor such moments of family blessings, with which Larry agrees and promises to do. Carefully emphasizing that he is speaking off the record and didn't actually 'say anything,' Arlen insinuates that Larry has earned tenure at the college.We then see Danny listening to the radio through his earphones, discreetly goofing off during Hebrew class again. He sees that the 20 he secreted in the radio's leather belt pouch to pay for the pot sold him by Mike Fagle, is still there.

First rub the strip with a cotton cloth and then use an eraser to gently rub away dirt on the strip. The best way to clean a dirty bank card strip, also known as the magnetic stripe, so it works more effectively is by following these steps: Step 1: Gather the necessary materials. Before you start cleaning your bank card strip, make sure you have the following items on hand: - A soft, lint-free cotton cloth or microfiber cloth - An eraser (preferably a white plastic or vinyl eraser, as they are less abrasive) Step 2: Clean the card's surface. Before cleaning the magnetic stripe itself, it's essential to clean the card's surface. Gently wipe the entire card with the cotton cloth or microfiber cloth to remove dirt, dust, and oils from the surface. Be sure to avoid using wet or damp cloths, as water can damage the card and interfere with its functionality. Step 3: Use the eraser to clean the magnetic stripe. Hold the card steady and lightly rub the eraser along the magnetic stripe, moving in a back and forth motion. This will help remove any accumulated dirt or residue that could interfere with the card reader when swiping. Make sure not to apply too much pressure while doing this, as putting excess force on the stripe can damage it. Step 4: Wipe the stripe again with the cloth. After you have cleaned the magnetic stripe with the eraser, use the cotton cloth or microfiber cloth again to wipe away any small eraser bits left behind. This will ensure that the card is completely clean and ready for use. Step 5: Test the card. Now that your bank card is clean, test it out by swiping it at a card reader to ensure that it works effectively. If the card still doesn't work, it may be damaged and require replacement. In conclusion, the best way to clean a dirty bank card strip and ensure its effectiveness is to first wipe it with a cotton cloth and then gently rub away dirt on the strip using an eraser. This method is gentle on the bank card while effectively removing dirt and residue from the magnetic stripe. It is important to be careful during the process and avoid using any abrasive materials or excessive force on the card, as this may result in damage."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Answer: Some have claimed that in the 1st century of the Christian era, for example, the population more than doubled, from four to 8–10 million within the confines of the Roman Empire, in good part as a result of a wave of conversion. A single-select problem: Is the question answered in a satisfactory fashion? Pick your answer from: A). yes; B). no;","completion":"B). no; To accurately answer the question regarding the increase of the Jewish population to an estimated 2 million, it is necessary to provide a specific time frame and context. The 1st century CE saw a considerable growth in the Jewish population, mainly ascribed to conversion within the Roman Empire. However, the figures provided suggest a population increase to 8-10 million, which is beyond the scope of the question. The Jewish population reached an estimated 2 million in the period between 1880 and 1900, primarily due to the rapid growth of the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Eastern Europe. Factors that contributed to this growth included improvements in living conditions, better healthcare, and economic prosperity. During this time, large numbers of Jewish populations migrated from Eastern Europe to various other destinations, such as Western Europe, North and South America, and Palestine. For instance, large-scale Jewish migration from Eastern Europe to the United States began around the 1880s, driven by numerous factors, including political repression, economic hardship, and the search for better opportunities. The Jewish population further surged during the first half of the 20th century, albeit experiencing tragic losses and hardships during the Holocaust (Shoah) in the early 1940s. Despite these challenges, post-World War II Jewish emigration and birth rates enabled the global Jewish population to steadily increase to around 14 million by 1948, the year Israel was established. In summary, the Jewish population reached an estimated 2 million between 1880 and 1900 mainly due to the growth of the Ashkenazi Jewish community in Eastern Europe. This period signified the beginning of significant migration and dispersion of Jews to different regions of the world, contributing to the growth and diversification of Jewish populations in the 20th century."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

But for these people, captured in images posted on a Russian dating site, those lengths might be just a bit too far. The images provide a bizarre snapshot into the worlds of the people looking for love - and in some cases a weird and wonderful view inside their minds. This girl attempts to pose seductively by a microwave, complete with knife block and cat food box on top. This lady thinks that munching on an entire watermelon is a surefire way to attract the partner of her dreams. This lady thinks that a pair of rubber gloves make a seductive accessory. (left) and (right) a swordsman displays his softer side, and an array. of weaponry, in an attempt to woo an impressed other half. In one of the hilarious pictures a woman, who has fashioned a mermaid costume from what looks like an ironed tablecloth, gazes seductively at the camera. And in another, which is designed to find the subject a date, a woman takes a bathtime selfie complete with glass of wine... and yellow rubber gloves. Sometimes homemade isn't always best: This woman created her own mermaid costume for her picture. Musclebound: This man hopes that showing off his body on the dating site will bag him a potential love interest. Seductive? This lady thinks that pouring a can of Jaguar on her clothes on a riverbank creates a sexy look. Does this man think that posing with a gun in front of ornamental dogs will detract from his unusual hairstyle?

The men don't spare any blushes when looking for love too. One of the pictures shows a topless man, complete with a lego-esque haircut and high-waisted trousers. In the image he is flexing his muscles in a room that looks like it is straight out ITV sitcom Rising Damp. Many people on the site seem to believe that a heavily patterned carpet is the perfect backdrop for a picture. Floral tribute: These guys seem to think that the way to a lover's heart is through snappy dressing and flowers.

Key events that contributed to these changes include the abdication of Nicholas II of Russia, the establishment of the Russian Provisional Government, and the October Revolution. The main groups involved in the revolution's progression were the Red Guard, deserting soldiers, and the Bolshevik Party. The Red Guard and the deserting soldiers, who were directed by the Bolshevik Party, initiated an armed takeover by seizing control of Saint Petersburg (formerly known as Petrograd) and subsequently took over cities and villages across the former Russian Empire. The revolution ultimately resulted in the formation of the Soviet Union, illustrating a profound transformation in Russia's political landscape after 1917."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

The iPhone 5 looks similar to previous models but has a larger screen and is lighter and thinner than the iPhone 4S. The company says the larger screen will make it easier to check and send e-mails and to view Web pages with the phone in your hand. The phone also comes with a new, faster processor called the Apple A6, which connects to mobile carriers with a 4G LTE connection, making for speedier Internet browsing. \\"It just screams,\\" said Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller, in introducing the device. The iPhone 5 starts at 200 with a two-year mobile contract and will be available on September 21 in the United States. Pre-orders for the device begin on Friday. The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the current version, the iPhone 4S. It has a 4-inch screen, measured diagonally, compared to a 3.5-inch screen on previous versions of the phone. It is the same width as the iPhone 4S, but taller, and the iPhone 5 is made entirely of glass and aluminum. Those features are likely to be popular with consumers. Another, however, may cause some backlash. The new iPhone comes with a different-sized charging cord, meaning speakers and radios designed to work with the old iPhone cord won't function seamlessly with the new iPhone. The company did create an adapter, however, so that the old devices aren't useless. Apple calls this new cord \\"lightning,\\" and says it is 80% smaller than the previous iPhone cord. During a press conference in San Francisco, Apple also announced an update to its mobile operating system, iOS 6, which accommodates the larger iPhone 5 screen. The new operating system adds another row of icons to the phone's home screen, includes a new, 3-D version of digital maps and has a feature called Passbook, which lets people pull up airline tickets or payment apps from the locked home screen. Apple also unveiled a new line of iPods, including an iPod nano with a 2.5-inch touchscreen. That device, which starts at 150, is able to pause live radio. And Apple updated its headphones, now called Earpods, with better audio quality and a new look. Read our live blog from the event here. For many tech fans, the fall Apple press event is the highlight of a season filled with gadget announcements and releases. Last week, Amazon unveiled its latest Kindle Fire tablets, and Nokia and Motorola announced new smartphones. HTC has an announcement scheduled for later in the month. The companies are rushing to get their products out in time for the holiday season, where they will battle it out for consumer dollars in an increasingly crowded mobile-device market. This is Apple's sixth iPhone model. Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone six years ago on a stage just one block away in the Moscone Center. Since then, the iPhone has taken off, selling about 244 million units around the world. According to research firm IDC, the iPhone and its iOS operating system make up 16.9% of the worldwide smartphone market, coming in behind all phones running the Android operating system, which account for 68.1% of the world's smartphones. The winning streak has carried over to Apple's stock price, which hit an all-time high of 683.29 a share last Friday. Some people weren't impressed with the new device, however. \\"Apple doesn't innovate anymore,\\" one commenter wrote on CNN's live blog from the event. \\"They got where they are today by taking bold risks, but they are afraid to change anything that would affect their No. 1 product.

Question: who carries the championship trophy? Movie plot title: Slap Shot Movie plot: The Charlestown Chiefs, a minor league hockey team, need to drum up attendance for their upcoming game with a team from Hyannisport. Television host Jim Carr (Andrew Duncan) interviews Denis Lemieux (Yvon Barrette) on his show \\"Sports Talk\\" about the \\"finer points of hockey.\\" English is the French Canadian player's second (and not best) language, but Denis gamely describes penalty moves like hooking and slashing, using his stick on Jim to demonstrate.Reggie \\"Reg\\" Dunlop (Paul Newman) is the team's aging player/coach, and the team is dead last in the second-rate Federal League. He meets opposing player Nick Brophy (Jon Gofton) at center ice to start the Hyannisport game, and Nick reveals he is drunk and resents that his coach put him in the game. In the broadcast booth, Chiefs player Dave Carlson (Jerry Houser), who supposedly was injured in a previous game, reveals that he isn't playing because he actually has a cold. The lone quality player for the Chiefs is Ned Braden (Michael Ontkean), who is not only the highest-scorer in the Federal League (he makes his record shot during the Hyannisport game), but he is also a Princeton grad who plays for the love of the game.Joe McGrath (Strother Martin), the team's manager, seems to be receiving encouragement by the mysterious team owner to come up with publicity stunts for the players. Some of the men are put into a fashion show, and Johnny Upton (Allan Nicholls) has had it: he warns McGrath that he plans to flash the audience so they won't have to do such degrading things again. Joe blows him off to make a phone call to locate Reg and Ned, who should be at the show as well, but has to stop the call short when cries of shock and disgust greet Johnny when he takes the runway.Ned and Reg pass the mill, which Ned tells him is going to close and lay off 10,000 workers.

A:","completion":"In the movie \\"Slap Shot,\\" the person who carries the championship trophy is not explicitly mentioned or shown. The film focuses primarily on the antics of the team, the interpersonal relationships, and the challenges they face both on and off the ice. The climax of the movie does not necessarily revolve around winning a championship trophy, but rather on the transformations the characters go through and how they manage to save their team from being disbanded due to mismanagement, financial struggles, and the closing of the local mill. One of the turning points in the movie is when the Chiefs start to adopt a more aggressive and violent playing style, gaining popularity with fans and notoriety in the league. This change in their approach eventually leads the Chiefs to the championship game against the Syracuse Bulldogs. During the game, the Chiefs' high scorer, Ned Braden, performs a striptease as a form of protest against the violent nature of the game, but this action ends up distracting the Bulldogs, leading to the Chiefs winning the game. Since the movie plot focuses more on the journey and challenges faced by the Charlestown Chiefs rather than their victory in the championship, the actual act of carrying the championship trophy is not a crucial or highlighted element in the film."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella , bench coach John McLaren and Huff all were ejected in the middle of the ninth . Do they have the same meaning?","completion":"While both sentences convey that Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella, bench coach John McLaren, and right fielder Aubrey Huff were ejected during the ninth inning, they have subtle differences in meaning and emphasis. The first sentence: \\"Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella, bench coach John McLaren, and right fielder Aubrey Huff were ejected for arguing after Huff was called out on strikes to end the ninth.\\" In this sentence, the emphasis is on the reason for the ejections. The cause for the ejections is clearly stated as \\"arguing after Huff was called out on strikes to end the ninth.\\" This sentence also includes more specific information about the event, such as Huff's position as right-fielder and the fact that the ejections occurred after he was called out on strikes, indicating the potential trigger for the argument. Furthermore, it specifies that the ejections took place following the conclusion of the ninth inning. The second sentence: \\"Tampa Bay manager Lou Piniella, bench coach John McLaren and Huff all were ejected in the middle of the ninth.\\" This sentence focuses more on the timing of the ejections, stating that they occurred \\"in the middle of the ninth\\" inning. Unlike the first sentence, no specific reason is given for the ejections. Additionally, it does not provide any information about Huff's position on the field or any specific events (like being called out on strikes) that may have led to the ejections. In summary, while both sentences communicate the fact that Piniella, McLaren, and Huff were ejected during the ninth inning, they differ in their emphasis on the exact timing of and the reason for the ejections, as well as the level of detail provided about the events leading up to the ejections."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Write highlights for this article: It's the question Edin Dzeko is constantly asked. \\"You ask me again about war...\\" sighs the 28-year-old, rolling his eyes and smiling as he enjoys a rare moment of peace outside Bosnia-Herzegovina's team hotel in the picturesque suburb of Ilidza. Perhaps the line of questioning is understandable given that just a short drive away is Dzeko's home city of Sarajevo, where the national hero lived throughout the Bosnian War which raged between 1992 and 1995. The war in Bosnia left tens of thousands dead, and hundreds of thousands displaced. But just as the bullet holes which still riddle this land represent a gruesome past, Dzeko and his teammates have become symbols of a different more optimistic future. For the first time in its short history, Bosnia is off to the World Cup. \\"I never thought I would be where I am now,\\" Dzeko, who played a key role in Manchester City's 2013-14 English Premier League title triumph, told CNN. Dzeko's early years were played out against the devastating backdrop of the consequences of a brutal internecine conflict. \\"I started to play football when I was about 10, my father brought me to one school because there were more pitches where we could play. Everything was destroyed after the war.\\" In previous interviews Dzeko has spoken of how his family home was destroyed and he was forced to live in his grandparents' house with 15 of his relatives. His mother once inadvertently saved his life, calling him inside seconds before the land he was playing on was hit by bombs. The siege of Sarajevo followed the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, with conflict erupting between the ethnic groups which make up Bosnia -- chiefly Bosnian Muslims, Croats and Serbs. Modern-day Bosnia is an independent state, although still under international administration. \\"I was here all the time during the war and I know what it is, but I think we came out stronger,\\" explains Dzeko. \\"We want to show the world that even if you go through some bad periods, you always have to think positive just to go forward. \\"Some people had a very hard life, we are still making positives and I think that's amazing.\\" Amid the bombs and bullets, Dzeko forged an unlikely path to the top. After signing his first professional contract in Bosnia, the young striker earned a move to Teplice in the Czech Republic before getting his big break with VFL Wolfsburg in the German Bundesliga. He became one of the hottest properties in European football during a prolific spell which saw him score 67 Bundesliga goals in three-and-a-half seasons, with City winning the race for his signature after paying Wolfsburg a reported 45 million in January 2011. While Dzeko carries echoes of the fighting wherever he goes, other members of the Bosnia squad had a different experience. Asmir Begovic and his family left Trebinje, 80 miles south of Sarajevo, and headed to Germany before immigrating to Canada. Aged four when his family relocated, Begovic has no memories of the conflict which engulfed his homeland. \\"And it's probably better so,\\" the 26-year-old goalkeeper, who plays in England for Stoke City. \\"I mean it's obviously very bad memories, very bad experiences for some of my other family members who have been around and stayed for the war. \\"I left when I was a boy, so I really don't remember much from the past. \\"As I've gotten older I've educated myself a little on the situation and what happened, drawn on experiences from my family members and friends, who lived through it and it was just a very unpleasant experience as people can imagine. \\"For our quality of life as a family, just being able to be safe in a different country meant a lot to us.\\" Although Begovic's life abroad has left its mark on his voice -- he speaks perfect English with a slight North American accent -- he insists his upbringing was distinctly Bosnian. \\"I've always been very close to the country,\\" he says. \\"When the opportunity came it was a fantastic thing for myself and my family to do, I couldn't wait to put on a Bosnia shirt and I haven't really looked back since.\\" Neither has Bosnia's national football team. Since an inauspicious first official international match in November 1995 -- a 2-0 reverse away to Albania -- \\"The Dragons\\" have gone from strength to strength. Bids to qualify for the 2010 World Cup and the 2012 European Championships fell agonizingly short, with Portugal ending the team's hopes at the playoff stage of both qualification competitions. But, on October 15, 2013 in the Lithuanian capital city of Vilnius, a goal from striker Vedad Ibisevic sealed a 1-0 win for Safet Susic's Bosnia and passage to Brazil 2014. Cue wild celebrations on the streets of Sarajevo, with the team flying home to be greeted by 50,000 ecstatic Bosnian football fans. \\"I am proud of this team that we achieved some great things, that we did some things that nobody could do it before us,\\" said Dzeko. \\"When you see 50,000 there waiting for you, then you know you did something good.\\" \\"We've learned from our past, we've learned from our failures and I think we've definitely grown as a team and we've been able to overcome that final hurdle now,\\" added Begovic. \\"To receive such an ovation and such a reception from our people, being able to celebrate with them is what qualifying and being able to qualify for major tournaments is all about. \\"It's something we have all accomplished together.\\" Now Rio de Janeiro's iconic Maracana Stadium awaits. At the arena first built for the 1950 World Cup and lavishly redeveloped for Brazil's second hosting of the tournament, Bosnia will take its bow against a Lionel Messi-led Argentina. African Cup of Nations winners Nigeria and Iran are the other two teams which make up a tough Group F. \\"I'm very much looking forward to it,\\" says Begovic, who will be trying to keep out four-time FIFA Ballon d'Or winner Messi. \\"That's what football is all about, being able to work your whole life to get to a World Cup and then playing against one of the biggest football countries in the world in the opening game. \\"Obviously we're massive underdogs, so we've got nothing to lose in that game, we can go there with an open mind and see how we can beat them. \\"It's going to be a huge challenge, but I believe in the quality of our team and we can cause Argentina problems.\\" With players like Begovic and Dzeko, not to mention Roma playmaker Miralem Pjanic, Bosnia have players capable of upsetting the odds. And in Dzeko, they also have a leader who is determined to show how far his country has come in the last 20 years. \\"I love this country, I love my country,\\" he said. \\"I am very happy that I am born here and I am very happy that I know that I will always, always come back here. \\"I think we all just can't wait for this World Cup to start.\\" Interactive: Take the pulse of the 2014 World Cup.

How is \\"Cop found his body beside a shopping cart full of the guy's stuff.\\" said in Czech?","completion":"In Czech, the phrase \\"Cop found his body beside a shopping cart full of the guy's stuff\\" would be translated as: \\"Policista našel jeho tělo vedle nákupního vozíku plného toho chlápkovy věci.\\" Here is a breakdown of the translation: 1. Cop: \\"Policista\\" - This is the Czech word for a police officer or a cop. 2. found: \\"našel\\" - This is the past tense of the verb \\"najít,\\" which means \\"to find.\\" 3. his body: \\"jeho tělo\\" - \\"Jeho\\" indicates possession (his), while \\"tělo\\" means \\"body\\" in Czech. 4. beside: \\"vedle\\" - This preposition is used to indicate the position of something next to or very close to another object. 5. a shopping cart: \\"nákupního vozíku\\" - \\"Nákupní\\" means \\"shopping\\" and \\"vozík\\" means \\"cart.\\" In Czech, the adjective \\"nákupní\\" agrees with the noun \\"vozík\\" in gender and case, hence \\"nákupního vozíku\\" is in the genitive case. 6. full of: \\"plného\\" - This adjective indicates that something is filled with or contains a lot of something else. In Czech, it agrees with the noun it modifies. 7. the guy's stuff: \\"toho chlápkovy věci\\" - \\"Toho\\" is the demonstrative pronoun (referring to \\"the guy\\"), \\"chlápkovy\\" means \\"guy's\\" in the possessive form, and \\"věci\\" is the plural form of \\"věc,\\" which means \\"thing\\" or \\"stuff.\\" The whole phrase describes the contents of the shopping cart.

These unique and fascinating creatures are found primarily in the coastal waters around Australia and the eastern Indian Ocean, extending as far north as the southern coast of Japan. Wobbegongs are highly effective predators and play a significant role in the marine ecosystem. There are currently 12 recognized species of wobbegong sharks, with varying physical characteristics, sizes, and habitats. Some of the most well-known species include the Ornate Wobbegong (Orectolobus ornatus), Tasselled Wobbegong (Eucrossorhinus dasypogon), and Spotted Wobbegong (Orectolobus maculatus). They generally range in size from 3 to 10 feet (around 1 to 3 meters) in length, with some smaller species only reaching about 2 feet (approximately 60 cm). Wobbegong sharks exhibit fascinating physical features that enable them to effectively camouflage themselves and hunt for prey. Their flat, carpet-like body shape allows them to blend in with their surroundings, typically rocky or coral reefs and sandy seabeds. They are easily identifiable by a distinctive pattern of bold markings, which may include spots, bars, or reticulations across their skin. Additionally, they have dermal lobes (fleshy skin extensions) and whisker-like projections called barbels around their mouths, which give them a fringed appearance. These features make wobbegongs masters of camouflage and ambush predators in their natural habitats. In terms of behavior and diet, wobbegong sharks are primarily nocturnal animals, lying in wait for prey during the day and becoming more active to hunt at night. Their primary diet consists of smaller fish, crustaceans, and cephalopods. When hunting, they use their exceptional camouflage to remain hidden and undetected until prey ventures too close. At this moment, they strike with lightning-fast speed and precision, using their powerful jaws and sharp teeth to capture their meal. Wobbegong sharks are considered to be relatively docile and are known to exhibit little aggression towards humans. However, they have been known to bite if accidentally stepped on or provoked. Consequently, it is essential to be cautious and respectful when encountering any wild animal, including wobbegong sharks, in their natural environment. In conclusion, a wobbegong is a type of shark found primarily in the coastal waters of Australia and the eastern Indian Ocean. Characterized by a unique and intricate appearance that serves as camouflage, these carpet sharks expertly blend into their surroundings and are highly efficient predators. While not inherently aggressive, it is crucial to remember to treat them with caution and respect when encountered in the wild."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant. You will be given a task.

Like any alga species, black algae (which are really blue-green algae that look black) will grow quickly in warm water on a sunny day. Black algae are chlorine-resistant, because they have a protective outer layer that makes regular sanitization ineffective. Available options: [A]. Try a plastic or glass aquarium pump to see if you can get rid of the mildew. Plastic pumps don't scratch or dry algae scales, making them great for water-decontamination, while glass pumps may not. [B]. While algae aren't harmful, their presence can be a sign that other bacteria are present. Other alga species that are common in pools are green algae, mustard or yellow algae, and pink algae, which is actually a bacterium. [C]. No matter the weather, a change in water temperature is advisable. Because of this, you should still be cautious when swimming in a pool with black algae. [D]. Black algae can also grow up in clumps on your pool floor and around corners, which can aggravate the entire problem. Remove black algae by using a commercial water purification spray. Answer:","completion":"[D]. Black algae can also grow up in clumps on your pool floor and around corners, which can aggravate the entire problem. Remove black algae by using a commercial water purification spray. Explanation: Option [A] is incorrect because we are talking about a swimming pool, not an aquarium, and mildew is a separate issue than black algae. Option [B] is incorrect because it talks about the presence of other algae and bacteria, but it doesn't directly address how to get rid of black algae in the swimming pool.

Please answer the following question: The answer to the question: What is the name of the person whose fanbase was alienated by her image as a militant and extremist? is inside the article: Makeba married Carmichael in March 1968; this caused her popularity in the US to decline markedly. Conservatives came to regard her as a militant and an extremist, an image which alienated much of her fanbase. Her performances were cancelled and her coverage in the press declined despite her efforts to portray her marriage as apolitical. White American audiences stopped supporting her, and the US government took an interest in her activities. The Central Intelligence Agency began following her, and placed hidden microphones in her apartment; the Federal Bureau of Investigation also placed her under surveillance. While she and her husband were travelling in the Bahamas, she was banned from returning to the US, and was refused a visa. As a result, the couple moved to Guinea, where Carmichael changed his name to Kwame Touré. Makeba did not return to the US until 1987.Guinea remained Makeba's home for the next 15 years, and she and her husband became close to President Ahmed Sékou Touré and his wife, Andrée. Touré wanted to create a new style of African music, and all musicians received a minimum wage if they practised for several hours every day. Makeba later stated that \\"I've never seen a country that did what Sékou Touré did for artists.\\" After her rejection from the US she began to write music more directly critical of the US government's racial policies, recording and singing songs such as \\"Lumumba\\" in 1970, (referring to Patrice Lumumba, the assassinated Prime Minister of the Congo), and \\"Malcolm X\\" in 1974., can you guess it ?

Write down how you feel, and do it regularly. This will help to mentally separate you from your depression, and allow you to analyze and track your emotions, as well as provide valuable information to any doctor you see for treatment. . Even if you suspect you're feeling this way for some other reason, talk to your doctor about your symptoms. Your doctor should be able to direct you to valuable resources to help return yourself to a healthy state of mind. Bring in your description of how you're feeling. Describe the severity and the consistency of the feelings. Be totally honest with your doctor. Depression is dangerous. It can make you feel isolated, worthless, and empty. No matter how severe you feel that your depression is, tell someone you trust. If you're feeling suicidal, call a hotline at any time and talk to someone or call emergency services, such as by dialing 911 in the US: 1-800-SUICIDE (1-800-784-2433) or 1-800-273-TALK (1-800-273-8255) You can text 1-800-799-4TTY (1-800-799-4889) LGBT Youth Suicide Hotline: 1-866-4-U-TREVOR Depression can make it feel like you have no sense of purpose. It can make it difficult to get out of bed each day, much less do anything productive when you're out. The world can be overwhelming. To help yourself stay motivated and focused, it's important to establish clear and simple goals. Write out a list of things, even simple things, that you can do today to make yourself productive. Don't be afraid to list out extremely small things, like \\"Brush your teeth\\" or \\"Pick up the kids\\" or \\"Eat something\\" or \\"Don't smoke.\\" Focus on the little stuff you need to do. Write out your accomplishments each day at the end of the day, if that works better for you. Listing out everything that you did will help you focus on your successes. Your moods are impacted by lots of different factors, but if your body isn't getting what it needs, then your brain isn't either. Exercise is shown to have a direct effect on your mood and overall happiness, releasing endorphins that help to counteract the effect of stress on the body and make you feel happy. You don't have to be sporty, or a jock. Find something that you enjoy doing. Start jogging, or hiking. Play squash. Do something that you might enjoy. Make sure to get 8 hours of sleep every day, and at the same time every day. Rest is essential in keeping your energy levels even throughout the day, which affects mood. What you eat affects your mood directly. Eating more complex carbohydrates and decreasing the amount of refined sugars and processed foods can help you feel better. Focus on getting as many leafy greens, whole grains, fresh vegetables, and fruits into your diet, and cutting out anything pre-prepared. Increase intake of omega 3 fatty acids (flaxseed, fish, walnuts, tofu): Omega 3 helps brain function and regulates mood Drink eight cups of water every day to stay hydrated. Lots of problems like headaches and tiredness can be attributed to minor dehydration, which can affect your mood as well. Studies show some connection between the levels of Vitamin D and overall happiness. This is important for everyone, but especially in those with depression. Seasonal depression often occurs in the wintertime, when the days are shorter and we don't get a lot of sun. But a good dose of natural light will do wonders for your mood.

It is bounded by Asia on the north, on the west by Africa, on the east by Australia, and on the south by the Southern Ocean or, depending on definition, by Antarctica. It is named after the country of India. The Indian Ocean is known as \\"Ratnkara\\", \\"\\"the mine of gems\\"\\" in ancient Sanskrit literature, and as \\"Hind Mahsgar\\", \\"\\"the great Indian sea\\"\\", in Hindi. - Yazata is the Avestan language word for a Zoroastrian concept with a wide range of meanings but generally signifying (or used as an epithet of) a divinity. The term literally means \\"worthy of worship or veneration\\", and is thus, in this more general sense, also applied to certain healing plants, primordial creatures, the \\"fravashis\\" of the dead, and to certain prayers that are themselves considered holy.

It is the only country with both a Caspian Sea and an Indian Ocean coastline. The country's central location in Eurasia and Western Asia, and its proximity to the Strait of Hormuz, make it of great geostrategic importance. Tehran is the country's capital and largest city, as well as its leading economic center. - The Abbasid Caliphate (or \\"\\") was the third of the Islamic caliphates to succeed the Islamic prophet Muhammad.

Python is a widely used high-level programming language for general-purpose programming, created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. An interpreted language, Python has a design philosophy that emphasizes code readability (notably using whitespace indentation to delimit code blocks rather than curly brackets or keywords), and a syntax that allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than might be used in languages such as C++ or Java. The language provides constructs intended to enable writing clear programs on both a small and large scale. Python features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative, functional programming, and procedural styles. It has a large and comprehensive standard library. Python interpreters are available for many operating systems, allowing Python code to run on a wide variety of systems. CPython, the reference implementation of Python, is open source software and has a community-based development model, as do nearly all of its variant implementations. CPython is managed by the non-profit Python Software Foundation. Python was conceived in the late 1980s, and its implementation began in December 1989 by Guido van Rossum at Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica (CWI) in the Netherlands as a successor to the ABC language (itself inspired by SETL) capable of exception handling and interfacing with the operating system Amoeba. Van Rossum is Python's principal author, and his continuing central role in deciding the direction of Python is reflected in the title given to him by the Python community, \\"Benevolent Dictator For Life\\" (BDFL). 1.

During the past century, the Earth's average temperature has risen by almost 1°C (about 1.3°F). You may not think that is significant, but to organisms that live in the wild and are constantly adapting to their environments, any climate change can be hazardous. Recall that burning fossil fuels releases gasses into the atmosphere that warm the Earth. Our increased use of fossil fuels, such as coal and oil, is changing the Earth’s climate. Any long-term change in the climate can destroy the habitat of a species. Even a brief change in climate may be too stressful for an organism to survive. For example, if the seas increase in temperature, even briefly, it may be too warm for certain types of fish to reproduce.","completion":"Grey island used more oil."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Write an article with the title: \\"House panel accuses IRS' Werfel of stonewalling probe\\"","completion":"Title: House Panel Accuses IRS' Werfel of Stonewalling Probe Introduction The credibility and integrity of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) have been called into question in recent years. The latest controversy to afflict the federal agency has prompted reproach from Congress, making it even more challenging for the IRS to regain public trust. In a recent investigation led by a House panel, the acting IRS commissioner, Daniel Werfel, has been accused of stonewalling—a term which refers to the act of intentionally delaying or obstructing progress in an investigation or inquiry. The criticism stems from Werfel's alleged reluctance to fully cooperate with the probe, with the House panel growing increasingly frustrated at the lack of transparency in the matter. Background The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee is currently investigating the undue scrutiny and targeting of conservative organizations by the IRS. Revelations that political groups, particularly conservative ones, were subject to additional, often invasive queries and heightened scrutiny when applying for tax-exempt status have raised concerns about the impartiality of the IRS and its possible misuse of power. While Daniel Werfel was not directly involved in the events that prompted the investigation, as Acting IRS Commissioner, he is the highest-ranking authority within the agency. House Republicans view his overall lack of cooperation as an attempt to impede the inquiry, thus levying allegations of stonewalling against him. Werfel's Resistance The House panel has accused Werfel of failing to provide the required documents and information during the course of the investigation. Despite several subpoenas issued by the committee, Werfel has not fully complied with the panel's requests, citing taxpayer privacy and the need for a measured approach in the release of sensitive information as his reasons. Critics argue that Werfel's refusal to cooperate effectively hampers the investigation and undermines its credibility. His ongoing resistance has only served to fuel suspicions of misconduct and political bias on the part of the IRS, while also prompting accusations of a cover-up. Congressional Response Members of Congress, particularly those from the Republican party, have expressed their frustration with Werfel's behavior during the investigation. They contend that by refusing to provide the requested documentation and information, Werfel is obstructing the progress of the probe. As a result, lawmakers have been considering options in response to Werfel's actions, ranging from holding him in contempt of Congress to taking more drastic measures such as impeachment. These possibilities demonstrate the severity of Werfel's alleged stonewalling and the high stakes for both the IRS and its relationship with Congress. Impact and Significance The implications of Werfel's stonewalling accusations cannot be understated. Should the allegations prove to be genuine, it would not only hamper the panel's investigations, but it could also further diminish the public's faith in the IRS. Such an outcome could erode the very foundations of the agency responsible for collecting more than 3.5 trillion in taxes each year. Moreover, Werfel's actions risk deepening the partisan divide that already exists in American politics. As Republicans lead the charge against the alleged misconduct of the IRS, Werfel's stonewalling could worsen the relationship between the agency and Congress, undermining any opportunities for future collaboration and reforms. Conclusion Despite the ongoing accusations and investigations into the IRS, one thing remains clear – there is a pressing need for increased transparency and accountability within the agency. Acting Commissioner Daniel Werfel's alleged stonewalling only serves to exacerbate the growing distrust between the IRS, Congress, and the American public. Without full cooperation and open dialogue, the IRS will continue to struggle to regain the confidence of taxpayers, and the ongoing probe will falter in its pursuit of justice and reform."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Here is one sentence: A ten day's leave to visit his mother. Here is another sentence: Might I beg leave to accompany you? Q: Does the term leave mean the same thing in both these sentences? Options are: [A]. different meanings [B]. the same meaning","completion":"In order to determine whether the term \\"leave\\" has the same meaning in both sentences, let's analyze each sentence individually. 1. A ten day's leave to visit his mother. 2. Might I beg leave to accompany you? First, let's understand the context of the term \\"leave\\" in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"A ten day's leave to visit his mother,\\" the term \\"leave\\" refers to a period of time granted to someone to be away from work or other duties, generally for a specific purpose. In this case, the purpose is to visit the person's mother. In the second sentence, \\"Might I beg leave to accompany you?\\" the term \\"leave\\" is used as a way of expressing permission. The speaker is essentially asking for permission or approval to accompany the listener. After analyzing each sentence, it is clear that although both instances of the term \\"leave\\" involve permission or approval, they serve different purposes in each sentence. In the first sentence, \\"leave\\" refers to a period of absence from work or duties, while in the second sentence, \\"leave\\" means to ask permission to join someone.

Answer the following question: U.S. President Donald Trump’s plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum has met criticism from his Republican allies in Congress, many of whom worry the measures could trigger a trade war that damages U.S. businesses. But the president does have supporters among some Senate Democrats from states where voters are concerned about the long-term loss of American manufacturing jobs. “This welcome action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants across Ohio and steelworkers who live in fear that their jobs will be the next victims of Chinese cheating,” Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, said in a statement released after the plan was announced. “If we fail to stand up for steel jobs today, China will come after other jobs up and down the supply chain tomorrow.” American labor unions have also broadly favored Trump’s proposed tariffs, saying they have been complaining for years that foreign countries frequently subsidize their own steel industries, putting American competitors at a disadvantage. Economists have been mostly critical of the plan, saying that overall it will hurt American manufacturers, some of whom may be targeted by trading partners for retaliatory sanction. They argue that the benefits to steel and aluminum workers are outweighed by job losses among Americans in other industries. A test of how much the issue is resonating with American voters comes next week, when voters in Pennsylvania’s 18th congressional district, vote in a special election to fill a vacated seat. Many voters are looking to the president to fulfill his campaign promise of protecting manufacturing jobs in America’s heartland. The race for the seat left vacant by Rep.

According to the above context, answer the following question. What the supporters of the plan saying? Answer:","completion":"The supporters of President Trump's plan to impose tariffs of 25 percent on steel and 10 percent on aluminum argue that the measures are necessary to protect the American manufacturing industry, specifically steel and aluminum jobs. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat from Ohio, stated that the action is long overdue for shuttered steel plants in his state and for steelworkers who fear job loss due to unfair practices from countries like China. Brown emphasizes that if the U.S. fails to stand up for steel jobs now, China could continue to undermine other jobs up and down the supply chain. Additionally, American labor unions broadly favor Trump's proposed tariffs, as they have been voicing concerns for years about foreign countries subsidizing their own steel industries, which puts American competitors at a disadvantage. The supporters believe that the imposition of tariffs would help level the playing field for U.S. manufacturers. Another key aspect of support behind the plan is the fulfillment of President Trump's campaign promise to protect manufacturing jobs in America's heartland. Voters in areas with significant manufacturing industries, such as Pennsylvania's 18th congressional district, are looking for the president to defend domestic industries and prevent further job losses. In summary, supporters of the plan argue that the tariffs are needed to protect American steel and aluminum jobs, counter unfair trade practices from countries like China, and fulfill President Trump's campaign promises of defending the American manufacturing industry."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

Article: Mathematicians are a step closer to answering what, for some, is one of life’s most pressing questions – how to make the perfect cup of coffee. Advanced mathematical analysis of a “hideously complicated” set of variables reveals that the size of the coffee grain is critical, followed by a long list of other factors. This information is expected to be of particular interest to industrial manufacturers of coffee machines. The research was carried out by a group from Mathematics Applications Consortium for Science and Industry (MACSI) at University of Limerick (UL), Ireland’s largest industrial mathematics research group. It was published in SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics on Tuesday. The research was led by Kevin Moroney of UL and co-authored by Dr William Lee, who now leads the industrial mathematics group at the University of Portsmouth, as well as Professor Stephen O'Brien director of MACSI at UL, Johan Marra and Dr Freek Suijver of Philips Research, Eindhoven. “There are about 2,000 chemicals in coffee, making it as complex as wine,” said Dr Lee. Coffee brewing is, the researchers say, poorly understood, and a better understanding of the physics and chemistry of coffee brewing is likely to lead to better designed coffee machines. They used a combination of experimental and mathematical methods to reveal grain size is one of the most important elements in brewing coffee, but a host of other factors also play an important role. According to Dr Lee, “what makes the best coffee is hideously complicated – from the shape of the filter, to the scale of a single grain, to the flow rate of water and which machine or tool is used, there are an enormous number of variables”. “But maths is a way of revealing hidden simplicity. By using mathematical analysis, we can begin to tell the story of which elements and in what order lead to the best coffee – we are now one step closer to the perfect cup of coffee,” he explained. The team hope to develop a complete theory of coffee brewing that could be used to inform the design of filter coffee machines in the same way that industry uses the theories of fluid and solid mechanics to design aeroplanes and racing cars. “One of the many challenges that have to be overcome to develop such a theory is to understand the effect the grind size has on the extraction of coffee,” Dr Lee said. “Our model shows that this can be understood in terms of the grind size controlling the balance between rapid extraction of coffee from the surface of grains and slow extraction from the interior of coffee grains. “This not only explains qualitatively why grind size plays such an important role in determining the taste of coffee but also quantifies that relationship through formulas. These formulas could allow fine tuning the design of a coffee machine for a particular grind size,” Dr Lee concluded. This work was funded through the Science Foundation Ireland Investigator Programme. ||||| Image copyright Thinkstock Mathematicians are a step closer to understanding what makes a perfect cup of coffee. Through some complex calculations, they have shone a light on the processes governing how coffee is extracted from grains in a filter machine. This could help drinkers optimise their cuppa by applying a more precise - and scientific - approach. The work is published in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics. Composed of over 1,800 chemical components, coffee is one of the most widely consumed drinks in the world. Estimates put the number of cups drunk around the world at more than a couple of billion each day. Brewing the perfect cup of coffee is always going to be a subjective endeavour. But the work by Kevin Moroney at the University of Limerick, William Lee at the University of Portsmouth and others offers a better understanding of the parameters that influence the final product. While past studies have looked at the maths of coffee extraction, there hasn't been that much work on drip filter machines. Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Bryony Hopkins asked Londoners for their idea of the perfect cup of coffee. These make up more than half of the 18 million coffee machines sold yearly in Europe, and involve pouring hot water over a bed of coffee grounds housed in a filter. Gravity pulls the water through the filter, extracting soluble compounds from the coffee grains during the flow. \\"Our overall idea is to have a complete mathematical model of coffee brewing that you could use to design coffee machines, rather like we use a theory of fluid and solid mechanics to design racing cars.\\" Dr Lee told BBC News. He said this study was a step towards that goal, adding: \\"We looked at the effect of coffee grain size on the way that coffee comes out of a filter coffee machine. \\"The really surprising thing to us is that there are really two processes by which coffee is extracted from grains. There's a very quick process by which coffee's extracted from the surface of the grains. And then there's a slower tail-off where coffee comes out of the interior of the grains.\\" It had previously been known that grinding beans too finely could result in coffee that is over-extracted and very bitter. On the other hand not grinding them enough can make the end result too watery. \\"What our work has done is take that [observation] and made it quantitative,\\" said Dr Lee. \\"So now, rather than just saying: 'I need to make [the grains] a bit bigger', I can say: 'I want this much coffee coming out of the beans, this is exactly the size [of grain] I should aim for.\\" This could help coffee drinkers - like Dr Lee - who grind their own beans, to optimise their coffee-making routines. Image copyright Thinkstock Image caption The analysis looked at drip filter coffee machines Dr Lee says he sets his grinder to the largest setting. By doing so, he says: \\"The grains are a bit larger than you get in the standard grind, which makes the coffee less bitter. Partly because it's adjusting that trade-off between the stuff coming out of the surface and stuff coming out of the interior. When things are larger, you're decreasing the overall surface area of the system. \\"Also, the water flows more quickly through a coffee bed of large grains, because the water's spending less time in contact with the coffee, helping reduce the amount of extraction too. \\"If it's bitter, it's because you're increasing the amount of surface area in the grains. Also, when the grains are very small, it's hard for the water to slide between them, so the water is spending a lot more time moving through the grains - giving it more time for the coffee to go out of solution.\\" But what to one person might seem bitter and tarry, to another might seem like the perfect cup of coffee. \\"For industrial applications, we'd hope you could optimise the coffee machine for a certain size of grains. You could adjust the flow rate so you get the perfect extraction there,\\" said Dr Lee. \\"Or if the coffee machine has an integrated grinder you've got two variables to play around with. You can play around with the grind size and the flow rate.\\" The researchers are now looking at the shape of the coffee bed in drip filter machines. \\"The shape of the coffee bed is deformed as you brew the coffee. When it goes in first, it's sitting flat at the bottom of the filter, but at the end of [brewing] it's coating the walls of the filter. This also seems to play a role in how the coffee tastes,\\" said Dr Lee. \\"That would allow us to address another degree of freedom: how exactly you put the water in. Do you put it in as a single jet down the centre, like water pouring out of a tap? Or do you use something more like a shower head, where it's dripping down from lots of places. Those would have different effects in disturbing the coffee bed.\\" Follow Paul on Twitter. ||||| Coffee is one of the world's most popular beverages. In Canada, two thirds of adults drink at least one cup of joe a day. But beyond the caffeine kick, cups of coffee can differ wildly. Whether you have a Tim Hortons habit, swear by Starbucks or prefer to brew your own beans at home, you never quite know what you're going to get. That's why researchers at Ireland's University of Limerick are working on brewing the perfect cup of coffee. What makes a 'perfect' cup of coffee? Researchers devised a mathematical model specifically for drip coffee machines, hoping to unlock the secret to the smoothest, most predictable, and most efficient brew. Although it might seem simple, passing hot water over roasted and ground coffee beans is an incredibly complex process. A model showing the transfers of water and coffee that go into brewing a cup of drip coffee. (Kevin M. Moroney) There are over 1,800 chemicals in a typical cup of coffee and many of those contribute to the taste. There are mechanical variables, too: the size of the coffee grounds, the temperature of the hot water, the rate at which the water passes over the grounds, and the density of packing of the grounds all affect the flavour and texture of a humble cup of joe. How much coffee did the researchers have to drink? All the authors involved in the study admit that coffee is a part of their daily routine — but their research wasn't as simple as touring the coffee shops of Limerick. Instead, the team considered all the possible variables that go into making coffee and developed a mathematical and computer model that can predict the amount of coffee extraction that will take place under the conditions of a drip coffee machine. Their initial equations included so many variables that it was far too cumbersome to ever actually use in practice. So the researchers decided to ignore things like brew time and water quality and focused their model on what could truly be measured. However, if the orders at Starbucks are any indication, what constitutes a good cup of coffee is really based on personal preference. So it wasn't so much about researching the quality of the coffee but more the efficiency of the brew. What's the biggest variable that changes coffee quality? According to researcher Kevin Moroney, the size of the grounds is \\"vitally important\\" to the extraction of coffee. The larger the grind in drip coffee the less bitter the taste, partially because there are more gaps between the grinds and the hot water can circulate more easily. While there are a number of factors that affect coffee quality, grind size is the most important variable. (Irene Coco / Unsplash) The bitterness occurs when the surface area of the grain is high (a fine grind), preventing water from easily flowing between the grounds and increasing the amount of coffee extracted from the beans. What this means is that bitterness is determined primarily by the size of the coffee grounds. The largest setting of grind size will give you the least bitter taste. But it's a trade off, since smaller grinds pack more of a caffeine punch. Will this research help us make the perfect cup of coffee? Yes. In fact, this work has helped them quantify just how many molecules you want to extract from a coffee bean. \\"You want to extract about 20 per cent,\\" said Moroney, \\"because if you extract too little of the mass of the coffee grain, you only get the flavours that come from chemicals of a small molecular mass which extract fast so you don't get that complex flavour you want in the coffee.\\" There's no way to calculate the perfect 20 per cent extraction at home, but you can bet that coffee machine makers are taking note. The next step researchers want to take is to determine how specific brewing configurations affect the quality of coffee — and how you can maximize flavour extraction without verging on bitterness. ||||| A lot of math goes into the coffee extraction process. Public domain photo. Composed of over 1,800 chemical components, coffee is one of the most widely-consumed drinks in the world. The seeds (coffee beans) from the plant of the same name are roasted and ground, allowing a flow of hot water to extract their soluble content. Undissolved solids are filtered from the dissolved particles, and the resulting liquid becomes the concoction that much of the population drinks every day. Brewers have developed numerous techniques to prepare the popular beverage. All techniques are based on leaching via a solid-liquid extraction, and each method aims to produce the best quality coffee possible – a subjective feat that, despite evaluations from professional coffee tasters, is often a matter of personal preference. Because so many chemical compounds comprise a single batch of coffee, determining precise correlations between the solubles’ physical parameters and the beverage’s quality is difficult. However, understanding the mathematics of extraction can help identify the influence of various parameters on the final product. In a paper publishing today in the SIAM Journal on Applied Mathematics, Kevin M. Moroney, William T. Lee, Stephen B.G. O’Brien, Freek Suijver, and Johan Marra present and analyze a new multiscale model of coffee extraction from a coffee bed. While past studies have investigated the mathematics of coffee extraction, researchers have previously paid little attention to the drip filter brewing system. Drip filter machines make up about 10 million of the 18+ million coffee machines sold yearly in Europe, and involve pouring hot water over a bed of coffee grounds housed in a filter. Gravity pulls the water through the filter, extracting coffee solubles from the grains during the flow. (a) Espresso coffee is made by forcing hot water under high pressure through a compacted bed of finely ground coffee. (b) Drip filter brewing involves pouring hot water over a loose bed of coarser coffee in a filter. In either method water flows through the bed, leaching soluble coffee components from the grains. Any undissolved solids in the fluid are filtered from the extract as the liquid leaves the filter. Image credit: Kevin M. Moroney Moroney et al.’s current paper focuses on drip filter machines and expands upon the authors’ previous work, which was published in Chemical Engineering Science in 2015. “Most of the models of coffee extraction we found in the literature either focused on batch extraction in a well-mixed system, or derived general transport equations without proposing specific extraction mechanisms or validating with experiments,” Moroney said. “In comparison, our model describes flow and extraction in a coffee bed, specifies extraction mechanisms in terms of the coffee grain properties, and compares the model’s performance with experiment. Our initial focus on the flow-through cylindrical brewing chamber allowed us to consider the model in one spatial coordinate and ensure that the model assumption of a static bed was valid.” The authors’ earlier paper presents the derivation of this general model, which considers bed dimensions, flow rates, grind size distribution, and pressure drop. They assume isothermal conditions (constant temperature), because optimal brewing circumstances require a narrow temperature range of 91-94 degrees Celsius. They also assume that coffee bed properties remain homogeneous in any cross section and that water saturates all pores in the coffee bed, eliminating the need to model unsaturated flow. A set of conservation equations on the bed scale monitor the transport of coffee and liquid throughout the coffee bed. Now the authors take that model one step further. “The model of coffee brewing published in Chemical Engineering Science was mathematically complete, but I would describe it as a model only a computer could love: a complicated system of coupled partial differential equations that can only be solved numerically,” Lee said. “This new paper analyses that model to produce a reduced system of equations for which approximate analytic solutions can be found.” Transfers included in the coffee extraction model (reproduced from K. M. Moroney et al, 2015): The diagram shows the transfers of water and coffee which are described by the coffee extraction model presented in the above reference. Image credit: Kevin M. Moroney Because coffee brewing involves so many components, simplifying the model becomes necessary. “In modelling a complicated physical process such as coffee brewing, one attempts to write down a system of equations which captures the essence of the process,” O’Brien said. “In doing so, we initially make some simplifications, which neglect some aspects of the real problem. For example, real coffee contains a large number of dissolved substances; we simplify our model by considering the case of a single such substance. The mathematical model then comprises conservation laws (mass momentum), which in their complete form cannot be solved exactly.” The authors then utilize non-dimensionalism, which measures variables with respect to fundamental constants intrinsic to the problem, to further simplify the extraction model. This technique reduces the number of parameters—which include brew ratio, brewing time, water quality and temperature, grind size and distribution, and extraction uniformity—therefore letting the authors recognize the equations’ dominant terms before they begin actively seeking solutions. “Neglecting smaller terms thus allows us to find approximate solutions,” O’Brien said. Recognizing these approximate solutions helps the authors easily identify typical trends. “Approximate solutions are formed based on the dominant processes in the coffee bed during different stages of the extraction process,” Moroney said. “Initially, the concentration of coffee in the bed is determined by the balance between a rapid extraction from the surfaces of coffee grains and the rate at which coffee is removed from the coffee bed by the extracting water. Later in the process, the extraction is dominated by slow diffusion of coffee from the kernels of larger grains, which was initially negligible.” Although the timescales of the aforementioned extraction methods are much shorter in fine coffee grinds rather than coarse grinds, the authors can still construct approximate solutions because of the timescale ratios’ small size. “The value of the solutions lies in the ability to explicitly relate the performance of a brewing system with the properties of the coffee, water and equipment used,” Moroney said. These solutions help predict the coffee quality for specific brewing configurations. Location of coffee in the bed: The coffee bed consists of (intergranular) pores and grains. The grains consist of (intragranular) pores and solids. The schematic shows the breakdown of this coffee in the grains (intragranular pores are not represented for clarity). Image credit: Kevin M. Moroney In the end, the authors intend for their model analysis to expose the mathematics involved in coffee brewing. “The research work is ultimately aimed at improving our understanding of the brewing process and understanding the relation between brewing process parameters and perceived coffee taste,” Marra said. A possible next step involves incorporating the changing coffee bed shape that occurs while water flows through the conical filter holder of a drip filter machine. “This causes both the extraction and the flow rate through the coffee bed to become a function of position,” Marra said. The authors’ research also has the potential to inspire further models on different extraction processes, including unsaturated flow and the trapping of air pockets in a coffee bed, in the never-ending quest for a perfect cup of coffee.

The only reason why I put one star is because the cheesecake is phenomenal. Me and my bf dined there one night he got the mac n cheese burger and I got like a western one , our server I think her name was Amanda talk blonde girl , never checked up on us and I watched every one else that was sat after us get there food and we sat for about 2 more hours with no food other parties that were there after us left already , then one guy comes up to us apologizing about the food delay , and that he would take care of it , well then the food came and finally.our server comes back apologizing for it taking forever , well the burgers were gross over Cooked, Mac n cheese was dry with rubbery noodles , we didn't even finish it , then we get the bill and we got no discount no nothing , they didn't take care of us at all , we paid the bill and left and will never be dining in there again ever just going in to get cheesecake to go for now on. The only thing good there is the cheesecake , poor poor poor service","completion":"The sentiment of this review is predominantly negative. The reviewer expresses copious dissatisfaction with several aspects of their dining experience. Firstly, the reviewer laments a perceived lack of attentiveness from the waiting staff. They detail having to wait for two hours for their food to be served, a delay which was not rectified adequately by the staff, according to them. They also note that despite other diners arriving after them, these new customers were served their meals first establishing a sense of inequality and neglect in service. Secondly, the reviewer criticizes the quality of the food, other than the cheesecake. They describe the mac and cheese burger as dry and rubbery, and the western burger as grossly overcooked, indicating poor cooking standards or perhaps inadequate quality control in the kitchen. They are further upset that, despite having to wait for a long duration and receiving what they felt was subpar food, they did not receive any discount or compensation on their bill. This adds to the feeling of perceived unfair treatment and poor customer service, which further fuels their negative sentiment. Finally, they assert their decision to abstain from returning to the dining establishment in the future - a clear indication of intense dissatisfaction. They state that they will only return in future to purchase the cheesecake, illustrating that even though they had a negative experience, they still found the cheesecake enjoyable. Overall, despite one positive comment about the cheesecake, the overall sentiment of this review is highly negative regarding the restaurant's service, food quality, and customer care."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

As of January 2008, only \`\`combination type'' AFCIs meet the NEC requirement. The 2008 NEC requires the installation of combination-type AFCIs in all 15 and 20 ampere residential circuits with the exception of laundries, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and unfinished basements, though many of these require GFCI protection. The 2014 NEC adds kitchens and laundry rooms to the list of rooms requiring AFCI circuitry, as well as any devices (such as lighting) requiring protection. does a garage need to be arc fault protected?","completion":"Per the 2008 and 2014 National Electrical Code (NEC) standards, not all residential locations require the installation of an Arc-Fault Circuit-Interrupter (AFCI). The use of AFCIs is typically required in 15 and 20 ampere circuits to assist in reducing the risk of electrical fires caused by arcing faults. These arcing faults can occur in damaged wires or cords when a connection becomes loose, potentially contributing to sparking which could ignite flammable materials. For the 2008 NEC standards, combination-type AFCIs were not required in several areas including laundries, kitchens, bathrooms, garages, and unfinished basements. However, Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter (GFCI) protection was often required in these areas for safety, especially in places where water may be present, creating a risk for electrical shock. The 2014 NEC standards expanded the areas requiring AFCI circuitry to include kitchens and laundry rooms. They also added a general reference to any devices that need protection, which implicitly includes lighting fixtures as well. As for your specific question regarding garages, as of the 2014 NEC update, garages were still not explicitly included in the list of areas requiring AFCI protection, rather they typically require GFCI protection. However, it is important to mention that national code can be superseded by local building codes and they may require AFCI protection in garages. As such, it would be advisable to check your specific local or state building codes to determine the exact requirements for your situation. Additionally, if your garage has a habitable room above it or certain types of electrical equipment that could be sensitive to arc faults, you might consider installing AFCIs for an extra level of protection. Despite them not being a universal requirement in garages, AFCIs provide additional safety against the risk of electrical fires and might be a worthwhile investment. Overall, electrical installation regulations can vary and evolve over time with new technical knowledge and safety information. Therefore, it is crucial to stay informed about the most recent local and national codes.

The Ramanathaswamy Temple, located in Rameswaram, houses this Jyotirlinga and is one of the most important pilgrimage sites for Shaivites. The MG Ganga Kavery Express was a train service that used to connect the northern part of India with the southern region, enabling devotees and tourists to visit several holy sites, including Rameswaram. This train brought a lot of pilgrims from various parts of the country to Rameswaram, which is also one of the four sacred destinations forming the Char Dham pilgrimage circuit. However, with the broad gauge conversion and subsequent introduction of new train services, the MG Ganga Kavery Express ceased its operations in 2007. Nowadays, several trains and other modes of transport are available for pilgrims and tourists to visit Rameswaram and experience its spiritual and historical significance."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Summarize this article: The medication is used to treat high blood pressure, a known risk factor for dementia. In the study, which will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in March, men on beta-blockers were less likely to have brain changes suggestive of dementia. Experts say it is too early to recommend beta-blockers for dementia. The findings are preliminary and larger studies in men and women from different ethnicities are needed to see what benefit beta-blockers might offer. People with high blood pressure are advised to see their doctor and get their condition under control to prevent associated complications like heart disease, stroke and vascular dementia. Having high blood pressure may damage the small vessels that supply the brain with blood. Blood carries essential oxygen and nourishment to the brain and without it, brain cells can die. Vascular dementia is the second most common cause of dementia after Alzheimer's disease and can occur if blood flow to the brain is reduced. Other research in a much larger sample of men - 800,000 in all - suggests another type of blood pressure drug known as an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) may cut dementia risk, including Alzheimer's disease, by as much as 50%. The latest work in 774 Japanese-American men found that all types of blood pressure medication were better than no treatment in terms of signs of dementia in the brain - brain shrinkage and tiny areas of brain tissue damage caused by poor blood supply - noted at autopsy after death. However, men who had received beta-blockers as their only blood pressure medication had fewer abnormalities in their brains than those who had not been treated for their hypertension, or who had received other blood pressure medications, the University of Hawaii team found. Men on beta-blockers and other medications also had fewer brain abnormalities, but not as big a reduction as that seen in the men on beta-blockers alone. In the study, 610 of the men had high blood pressure or were being treated for high blood pressure. Study author Dr Lon White said: \\"With the number of people with Alzheimer's disease expected to grow significantly as our population ages, it is increasingly important to identify factors that could delay or prevent the disease. \\"These results are exciting, especially since beta-blockers are a common treatment for high blood pressure.\\" Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer's Research UK, said: \\"Hypertension is a known risk factor for Alzheimer's and other causes of dementia, and keeping high blood pressure in check could be important for preventing these diseases. \\"This study suggests a link between the use of beta-blockers and fewer signs of dementia, but as the results of this study have yet to be published in full, it's not clear what caused this link. It's important to note that this study only looked at Japanese-American men, and these results may not be applicable to the wider population. He said a better understanding of the links between high blood pressure and dementia could be crucial for developing new treatments or approaches to prevention. \\"With 820,000 people affected by dementia in the UK, and that number increasing, we urgently need to find ways to prevent the diseases that cause it - that requires a massive investment in research,\\" Dr Ridley added. Summary:","completion":"A study conducted by the University of Hawaii suggests that beta-blockers, a medication used to treat high blood pressure, might help reduce the risk of dementia in men. The preliminary findings showed that men on beta-blockers had fewer brain abnormalities associated with dementia compared to men on other blood pressure medications or no treatment. However, experts believe it is too early to recommend beta-blockers for dementia, and larger studies including women and different ethnicities are needed to better understand their potential benefits. High blood pressure is a known risk factor for dementia, and maintaining healthy blood pressure is essential to preventing complications like heart disease, stroke, and dementia."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

One study involved sixty-eight healthy young women and men who ran at least twenty-four kilometers a week. The runners were observed on a treadmill machine . Sometimes they wore running shoes. Other times they ran barefoot . Researchers from the JKM Technologies company in Virginia, the University of Virginia and the University of Colorado did the study. They found that running shoes create more stress that could damage knees, hips and ankle joints than running barefoot. They observed that the effect was even greater than the effect reported earlier for walking in high heels. The study appeared in the official scientific journal of The American Academy of Physical Medicine. The other study appeared in the journal Nature. It compared runners in the United States and Kenya. The researchers were from Harvard University in Massachusetts, Moi University in Kenya and the University of Glasgow in Scotland. They divided the runners into three groups. One group had always run shoeless. Another group had always run with shoes. And the third group had changed to shoeless running. Runners who wear shoes usually come down heel first. That puts great force on the back of the foot. But the study found that barefoot runners generally land on the front or middle of their foot. That way they ease into their landing and avoid striking their heel. Harvard's Daniel Lieberman led the study. He says the way most running shoes are designed may explain why those who wear them land on their heels. The heel of the shoe is bigger and heavier than other parts of the shoe, so it would seem more likely to come down first. Also, the heel generally has thick material under it to soften landings. But the researchers do not suggest that runners immediately start running barefoot. They say it takes some training. And there can be risks, like running when your feet are too cold to feel if you get injured. The study was partly supported by Vibram,...

Please answer the following question: Process: - Fuel mixes with air - Mix gets inducted into cylinder - Piston compresses the mix - Spark plug emits a spark that ignites it causing combustion - Combustion gases expand - Pushes piston during power stroke - Exhaust valve opens to vent exhaust out tail pipe. Question: suppose the weather has been rainy recently happens, how will it affect the piston does not compress. How does the supposed perturbation influence the second effect mentioned. Answer by more, less or no effect A:","completion":"The weather, especially rainy conditions, can have a significant impact on the operation of an internal combustion engine, specifically the piston's ability to compress the fuel-air mixture. When there is a lot of moisture in the air, several issues may arise that can disrupt the normal engine operations as described in the process given. Here's an in-depth analysis of how a rainy weather might influence the piston-not-compressing situation and how it subsequently affects the second effect mentioned. Rainy weather can increase the amount of humidity in the air, and the engine will naturally draw in this moisture-laden air during the induction phase. This could lead to several potential problems for the engine, including an overly-rich fuel mixture, reduced efficiency, and in extreme cases, the formation of water droplets in the cylinders. Starting with an overly-rich fuel mixture, combining the fuel with moist air may cause the balance of air-to-fuel ratio to be unfavorably skewed. With too much moisture in the mix, this could lead to a less efficient combustion process, as the fuel may not ignite as readily or completely as it should. In this case, it can be said that rainy weather has a \\"more\\" effect on the piston's inability to compress the fuel-air mixture, as it might push the mixture further out of an ideal range. In instances where moisture accumulates excessively inside the cylinders, there might be a formation of water droplets. These droplets, depending on their size, can dramatically affect the compression process by hindering the formation of a proper seal between the piston and the cylinder wall. This could, in turn, compromise the piston's ability to compress the fuel-air mixture entirely. In this case, rainy weather may have a \\"more\\" effect on the piston's inability to compress as well. Now, considering the second effect mentioned – \\"Spark plug emits a spark that ignites the fuel-air mixture causing combustion.\\" The consequences of the previously discussed issues (overly-rich fuel mixture and water droplet formation) mainly would lead to a disruption in the ignition of the fuel-air mixture. The overly-rich fuel mixture might not ignite fully or could ignite less efficiently, causing a reduction in the power generated during the combustion process. This could be described as having a \\"less\\" effect on the second step of the process. On the other hand, if water droplets are present inside the cylinder, depending on their quantity, they might prevent the spark plug from effectively emitting its spark, or they could disrupt the process of combustion altogether, as water is not a combustible material. In a worst-case scenario, where the ignition is entirely disrupted due to the water droplets, it can be said that the rainy weather led to a \\"no effect\\" influence on the second step due to the combustion's complete failure. In conclusion, rainy weather can have varying degrees of impact on the compression process of an internal combustion engine, potentially exacerbating the piston's inability to compress the fuel-air mixture. This can subsequently lead to less efficient combustion or a complete inability to ignite the mixture, reducing the overall performance of the engine. The influence that the rainy weather has on the second effect mentioned ranges from \\"less effect\\" in cases of less efficient combustion to \\"no effect\\" when ignition isn't possible altogether."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant.

Tree city and Leaf city were the two biggest cities in Boulderland. Tree city burned lots of gas and other fossil fuels, while Leaf city was very protective towards its environment. Which city caused less air pollution? Answer:","completion":"Leaf City caused less air pollution as compared to Tree City. Between the two cities, Tree City consumed a higher amount of gas and other fossil fuels, which resulted in a significant release of greenhouse gases, air pollutants, and other harmful substances into the atmosphere. The combustion of fossil fuels particularly contributes to air pollution in various ways, including the production of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, particulate matter, and carbon monoxide. On the other hand, Leaf City prioritized environmental conservation, which suggests that the city embraced sustainable and eco-friendly practices. By prioritizing the protection of its environment, Leaf City would have implemented policies and practices that minimized air pollution. These policies might have included investment in renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, ensuring that both residential and commercial energy demands come from cleaner sources. In addition, the transportation system in Leaf City likely promoted the use of electric, hybrid, or other low-emission vehicles. Public transportation options like buses, trams, or trains, as well as cycling and walking infrastructure, would be promoted to reduce dependence on personal vehicles, avoiding emissions from combustion engine vehicles. Green urban planning initiatives like the increased presence of green spaces, parks, or forests could also contribute to improving air quality in Leaf City. These elements not only make the city more attractive but also support the establishment of an urban space where pollutants can be absorbed and filtered by plants, improving the air quality for the inhabitants. Furthermore, Leaf City likely established strict regulations on industries and businesses to mitigate their environmental impact. These regulations could enforce the implementation of pollution control technologies, better waste and emission management, and the transition to greener production processes. Efforts to promote the circular economy, reduce waste, and implement recycling and composting programs would contribute to a lower overall environmental footprint. Considering the above factors, it is evident that Leaf City's environmentally-conscious approach and commitment to sustainability were instrumental in reducing the city's air pollution levels. Tree City, with its heavy reliance on fossil fuels and likely fewer restrictions on pollution, would have a significantly higher air pollution impact. This proof demonstrates that Leaf City was the one harming the environment less between the two cities."},{"prompt":"You are an AI assistant that follows instruction extremely well.

I gave this place 2 chances and they failed both times and here's why: 1. Long lines. Yes, you will get 2 different views on this because they do let girls get in for free and go straight to the front of the line. Guys will have to wait in line for a substantial amount of time. Got in line at 9pm and got to the front at almost 11pm. Now of course this can be remedied by \\"greasing\\" the bouncer, but with so many clubs/lounges to choose from I think the only clubs worth greasing would be the top clubs where you could see a celebrity or the venue is much nicer. 2. Lying employees. This one sucked, but didn't ruin the night. All of them talk and talk about going in the club for free with the pass. Even go so far as to promote it as a reason to not go to other clubs. Then when you get to the front all of a sudden your \\"free\\" pass is only a \\"discount\\" card. I didn't mind paying, but when you promote something it'd be nice if you stuck by it. 3. Layout. Layout resembles any normal club. 2 rooms or so, a few bars. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary. Felt like I was back in San Jose or San Francisco, which sucks because you want to feel like you're in Vegas. 4. Crowded. Some people like crowded. Not me. I like a room to be full, but not to the point where people bump into you while you dance. That being said, the music was good and the alcohol was good just like it would have been anywhere else in Vegas except overpriced. I can have a fun time anywhere because I like to drink and dance with friends, but if you're in Vegas, skip this club and go to a newer and nicer place. If you're going to pay cover, might as well be a place that's more \\"Vegas\\" or if you don't want to pay cover check out the many free lounges with dance floors.

A man having sex with a goat, a lady groping her own breast and a naked woman sitting astride a Roman god. While it may sound like obscure pornography, it is actually art. A new exhibition in Italy featuring naked artists posing as cavorting nymphs and satyrs leaves little to the imagination. Austrian artist Veronika Bayer standing next to a picture of her colleague Daniel Feyer superimposed on an erotic fresco at the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) near Naples The exhibition entitled ErotiCAM_Secret Room II, which is on display in the Contemporary Art Museum (CAM) in the town of Casoria near Naples, is based on images adapted from some of the erotic frescoes (mural paintings) from Roman times.","completion":"These frescoes were discovered in the ruins of Pompeii and Herculaneum, two ancient cities that were buried under volcanic ash in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. The art that adorned the walls of the ancient dwellings revealed that sexual desire and eroticism were deeply ingrained in Roman culture. Sensuality and carnal pleasures were not only an integral part of their society, but also a means of self-expression and artistic freedom. The ancient Roman frescoes have been effectively reinterpreted by contemporary artists to create a compelling and provocative exhibit that sparks conversation and prompts viewers to explore their own attitudes towards sexuality, desire, and the human body. Some of the original frescoes depicted scenes that would likely have been deemed obscene or perverse in the more conservative and puritanical times that followed the Roman Empire, such as orgies, bestiality, and kinky fetishes. The ErotiCAM_Secret Room II exhibition takes inspiration from these ancient works and pushes the boundaries of modern art, incorporating nudity, sensuality, and even humor, to challenge the viewer's perspective and provoke thought on what is considered acceptable and appropriate when it comes to erotic content in art. The use of contemporary models in the style of Roman frescoes bridges the gap between the ancient and modern worlds, creating a unique visual experience. Some critics argue that the erotic nature of the exhibition is gratuitous and overly sensationalized. However, proponents of the exhibition view it as an opportunity to explore and celebrate human sexuality and its ever-evolving expression through art. They believe that by delving into the explicit content of the original frescoes, as well as their reinterpretations, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own cultural norms and taboos, and perhaps even challenge them. Furthermore, the exhibit also showcases the impressive skill and talent of the artists, who have effectively captured the spirit of the original frescoes while adding their own unique touches and modern sensibilities. The blend of classical and contemporary art styles results in a captivating display that invites viewers to engage with the artwork on multiple levels – both aesthetically and intellectually. In conclusion, the ErotiCAM_Secret Room II exhibition at the Casoria Contemporary Art Museum bears testament to the enduring power of erotic art as a means of self-expression, cultural exploration, and creative innovation. By reimagining the ancient Roman frescoes in a contemporary context, the artists involved inspire important dialogues surrounding sexuality, artistic freedom, and societal norms. And, by arousing both desire and curiosity in its viewers, the exhibit ultimately proves that eroticism continues to have a vital and potent presence in the realm of art."},{"prompt":"You are a helpful assistant, who always provide explanation.

Summarize this article: After you've delivered your request calmly and kindly, your parents might still say, “No, you absolutely cannot see this movie.” Although at times it might not make any sense why they wouldn’t let you see a movie, trying to understand their reasons might give you a new perspective. Ask them why they don’t want you to see it, and listen to them carefully. Try to really understand what their points and concerns are. You might be surprised to see how some of them might make sense. Ask them if they would let you see it when you are older, or not at all, and have them explain why or why not. Oftentimes parents are concerned about sex and nudity, profanity, drugs and violence included in the content of the movie. Ask them if they can see it first, and screen it for you, or if there is a family-friendly version they can have you see. One of the reasons why your parents won’t let you see the movie might be that they think you are not mature enough. Acting more responsibly will show them otherwise, and even if they don’t let you see a movie now, they might change their mind later. Help with household chores such as washing the car or doing laundry, clean your room, and make your bed regularly. Be nice and respectful to your siblings and parents, and don’t start fights. Be understanding and stay calm even if you don't get your way with certain things. This will show that you are mature enough to handle failure or rejection, and that you are determined. Once you’ve intentionally started behaving better and proved to your parents that you are more mature than they might think, try asking them again after a while. You can also suggest doing something in return, for instance, helping with the dishes daily or vacuuming the living room for a month, if they let you see this movie. No matter what your parents reply with, you should always learn to respect their decision and act your best. If they do not say “Yes” immediately, it’s very important that you stay calm instead of getting angry or throwing a tantrum. Otherwise, you might ruin your chances of a “Yes” forever.","completion":"This article is about trying to convince your parents to let you see a movie they said no to.
